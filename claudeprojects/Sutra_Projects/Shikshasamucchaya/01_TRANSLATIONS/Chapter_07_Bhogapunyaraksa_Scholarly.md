# Chapter 7: Protection of Enjoyments and Merit (Bhogapuṇyarakṣā)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

*The seventh chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on how to protect enjoyments and merit through proper use of material goods, avoiding gain and honor, cultivating humility, and dedicating merit to awakening.*

---

## Introduction

Thus, protection of one's person is to be understood [as stated in the previous chapter].¹ But protection of enjoyments (*bhogarakṣā*) is to be stated. There:

> **By one who undertakes good deeds, and by one knowing measure in everything,**
> **from this training-precept, protection of enjoyments is not difficult.** (Kārikā 14)

---

## Part I: Knowing Measure in Enjoyments

For in the Ugraparipṛcchā, the training-precept is stated:²

> "Acting with well-considered action; acting with well-done action."

By this, examination of the improper disposition of enjoyments [is enjoined]. The prohibition of contempt becomes established. And by the presentation on calm, knowing measure (*mātrajñatā*) and knowing propriety (*yuktijñatā*) have been stated.

By this, the following is established: "Even when the task can be accomplished with little and low enjoyments, one should not—oneself or through others—neglect the destruction of many superior enjoyments."

---

## Part II: Proper Use of Servants and Possessions

Hence in the Ugraparipṛcchā it is stated:³

> "By the proper use of sons, wives, female servants, male servants, workers, and employees..."

Likewise, neither relinquishing nor non-relinquishing should be done when it causes obstruction to one's own and others' awakening-factors, learning, etc.

For a bodhisattva of greater or equal power in beings' welfare, neither relinquishing nor non-relinquishing should be done when it causes obstruction to greater or equal wholesome [deeds]—this is established.

---

## Part III: The Renunciant's Dharma-Gift

Regarding this, in the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa it is stated:⁴

> "What indeed, Śāriputra, should a bodhisattva who has gone forth from household life, devoted to the limbs of awakening—how should he give gifts? What gifts should he give? How much should he give?...
>
> He should be a Dharma-giver, a Dharma-patron.
>
> And, Śāriputra, if a householder bodhisattva, having filled buddha-fields equal to the sands of the Ganges with the seven treasures, should give this gift to the Tathāgatas, Arhats, Samyaksaṃbuddhas—and if a renunciant bodhisattva should illuminate a single four-line verse, this latter generates far more merit.
>
> **Śāriputra, material gift (*āmiṣadāna*) has not been approved by the Tathāgata for the renunciant.**...
>
> If, however, there should be gain that has come into the bowl, that is in the bowl, righteous, rightfully obtained—he should be one who eats in common with his fellow-practitioners.
>
> If someone should come asking for a bowl or robe, he should give what is superfluous beyond the Buddha-approved three robes, as long as it is not relinquished.
>
> But if his robe would be insufficient—that on which the holy life depends—that should not be relinquished. Why is that? The Tathāgata has said the three robes are not to be given away.
>
> But if, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva, having relinquished the three robes, should become one who is heavy toward beggars—by him few desires would not have been cultivated.
>
> By a bodhisattva who has gone forth from household life, the Dharma should be cultivated. He should be devoted to that."

---

## Part IV: The Danger of Obstructing Greater Good

For otherwise, for the sake of gathering one [person], great harm would be done to a great mass of beings—and to that being's own future preparation as a bodhisattva—harm to a great purpose.⁵

Hence, avoiding the excellent wholesome side is called "non-washing" (*apakṣāla*).

Thus, the prohibition of relinquishing [is stated]. The prohibition of non-relinquishing is also [stated], as in the Āryasāgaramatisūtra, where having many gains is seen among the obstacles to the Mahāyāna.

---

## Part V: The Vimalakīrti Exchange

In the Āryavimalakīrtinirdeśa too it is stated:⁶

> "What should one afraid of the fear of saṃsāra resort to?"
>
> He said: "One afraid of the fear of saṃsāra, O Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattva should resort to the greatness of the Buddha."
>
> "Where should one wishing to stand in the greatness of the Buddha stand?"
>
> He said: "One wishing to stand in the greatness of the Buddha should stand in equality with all beings."
>
> "Where should one wishing to stand in equality with all beings stand?"
>
> He said: "One wishing to stand in equality with all beings should stand for the liberation of all beings."

---

## Part VI: Dharmasaṃgīti on Beings' Liberation

In the Dharmasaṃgīti too, the bodhisattva Sārthavāha said:⁷

> "Whatever bodhisattva, O Blessed One, wishes for enlightenment first for all beings, not for himself... this, O Blessed One, is the Dharma-assembly."

And from the very relinquishment [of all to beings], the absence of self-interest is established. However, due to fear of harm to beings' welfare, one does not place one's own burden on an unsuitable being.

But where one does not see harm to beings' welfare, what difference is there whether one accomplishes the world's welfare oneself or through another? Because one does not relinquish one's own wholesome [deed] for the sake of accomplishing another bodhisattva's wholesome [deed].

If one fears one's own suffering in bad destinies—that very suffering belongs to the second [bodhisattva] as well. If one is indifferent [thinking] "That suffering does me no harm"—by the sūtras stated [above], one incurs offense.

---

## Part VII: The Four Bodhisattva-Pretenders

As in the Ratnakūṭasūtra:⁸

> "There are, O Kāśyapa, four who are pretenders (*pratirūpaka*) of bodhisattvas..."

It is stated: "He is one who seeks his own happiness, not one who seeks to remove the suffering of all beings."

Therefore, by the rule of the Ugraparipṛcchā, as before, oneself should be blamed.

---

## Part VIII: Protection of Merit

Protection of enjoyments has been stated in summary. Protection of merit (*puṇyarakṣā*) is to be stated.⁹

> **By freedom from craving for the ripening of self-interest, merit is well-protected.** (Kārikā 15ab)

As stated in the Nārāyaṇaparipṛcchā:

> "He does not protect morality for his own sake, not for the sake of heaven, not for the sake of Śakra-hood, not for the sake of enjoyments, not for the sake of power, not for the sake of form, not for the sake of beauty, not for the sake of fame... not afraid of hell does he protect morality... not afraid of animal birth does he protect morality.
>
> Rather, he protects morality for the sake of establishing the Buddha-guidance. He protects morality seeking the welfare, benefit, happiness, and security of all beings."

He, the bodhisattva endowed with such a morality-aggregate, does not diminish in ten dharmas. Which ten?
- He does not diminish from universal-monarch sovereignty
- He is unheedful, aspiring to awakening, aspiring to see Buddhas
- He does not diminish from Brahma-hood, from seeing Buddhas
- He does not diminish from Dharma-hearing
- He does not diminish from bodhisattva-vow undertaking for accomplishing practice as heard
- He does not diminish from all wholesome dharmas, dhyānas, due to unobstructed eloquence...

Thus, the bodhisattva mahāsattva established in the morality-aggregate is always honored by gods, always praised by nāgas, always honored by yakṣas, always worshipped by gandharvas, always respected by nāga-lords and asura-lords, always well-regarded by brahmins, kṣatriyas, merchants, and householders, always to be approached by the wise, always attended by Buddhas, approved by the Teacher for the world with its gods, and compassionate toward all beings...

He does not go to four destinies. Which four?
- He does not go to the unfavorable-moment destiny, except for the sake of ripening beings
- He does not go to a buddha-field empty of Buddhas
- He does not go to birth in a wrong-view family
- He does not go to any bad destiny.

---

## Part IX: No Regret After Giving

Thus, even merit that was previously relinquished, when taken up again under the power of afflictions—its protection should be made. Even from merit-giving, whatever merit [arises], from that too no ripening should be sought, except for others' welfare.¹⁰

Moreover, one wishing to protect merit:

> **Should not create regret afterward.** (Kārikā 15c)

As stated in the Ugraparipṛcchā:

> "And having given, one should not generate a regretful mind."

From weakness of the back comes weakness [of the whole]. From regret, even merit would be exhausted like evil—this is the intention.

---

## Part X: Do Not Proclaim Good Deeds

> **And having done, should not make it public.** (Kārikā 15d)

For in many ways by the Blessed One, having concealed good and revealed evil (*pracchannakalyāṇatā vivṛtapāpatā*) is praised.¹¹ Therein, the exhaustion of what is revealed is understood—of evil through sorrow, of merit through elation.

There is no offense for one who publicizes [good deeds] for beings' sake, with a mind without bait.

As in the Ratnamegha, by the physician analogy, self-exaltation is stated to be without fault.

---

## Part XI: Avoiding Gain, Honor, and Pride

Moreover, one wishing to protect merit:

> **Should be afraid of gain and honor, should always avoid exaltation;**
> **the bodhisattva should be serene, should abandon doubt in the Dharma.** (Kārikā 16)

In the Ratnakūṭa it is stated:¹²

> "By four dharmas, O Kāśyapa, a bodhisattva's arisen wholesome dharmas are diminished—by which [four] they do not increase in wholesome dharmas. Which four?
>
> 1. By the conceited one's search for *lokāyata* mantras (worldly philosophy)
> 2. By one intent on gain and honor, through looking at families
> 3. By hatred-accusation of bodhisattvas
> 4. By rejection of unheard and un-expounded sūtras"

---

## Part XII: Merit Exhausted by Ill-Will

In the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya it is recited:¹³

> "See, O monks, this monk generating faith by prostrating with his whole body at the stūpa of hair and nails? Yes, Venerable One. By this monk, O monks, as much earth as was touched—down eighty thousand yojanas to the golden wheel—as many sands as there are, so many thousands of universal-monarch sovereignties are to be enjoyed by this monk.
>
> Then the venerable Upāli, approaching the Blessed One, joining palms, said to the Blessed One: 'The Blessed One has said that this monk has such great roots of virtue. Where, O Blessed One, do these roots of virtue become thin, exhausted, depleted?'
>
> 'Upāli, I do not see such diminution and impairment as when a fellow-practitioner generates an ill mind toward a fellow-practitioner. There, Upāli, these great roots of virtue become thin, exhausted, depleted.'
>
> 'Therefore, Upāli, thus should you train: "We will not corrupt our minds even toward a burnt post—how much less toward a body possessing consciousness."'"

---

## Part XIII: Ill-Will Destroys a Kalpa's Merit

In the Āryamañjuśrīvikrīḍitasūtra it is also said:¹⁴

> "'Opposition, opposition'—it destroys roots of virtue accumulated over a hundred kalpas; therefore it is called 'opposition' (*pratigha*)."

In the Āryagaṇḍavyūhasūtra too, the night-goddess Samantasattvaparitrāṇyojaḥśrī, telling a previous story, stated:

> "They, by that root of unwholesomeness arisen from mutual disdain, were diminished even from their lifespan, from their beauty, from their strength, from their happiness..."

And here, "always" is stated to show that exaltation should never be made.

---

## Part XIV: When Gain May Be Accepted

Gain and honor, however, are sometimes accepted. As stated in the Āryaratnamegha:¹⁵

> "Here, O son of good family, a bodhisattva, receiving even a Sumeru-sized heap of jewels, accepts it; receiving even a lesser thing, [he accepts it].
>
> Why is that? Thus he thinks: 'These beings are stingy, greedy, overcome by greed. Due to that cause, that condition, that basis, they, like those held by a great mass of water, bob up and down in the ocean of saṃsāra. This will be for their long-term welfare, benefit, and happiness.'
>
> Having accepted everything, he does not make it his own. He does not generate a greedy mind. Rather, he makes an offering to Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha in common with all beings. He makes it a means of livelihood for all suffering beings. And he encourages and delights that patron."

And here it is also stated:

> "And by that gift he is not exalted."

And again:

> "If, due to that cause, that condition, that basis, fame-word-renown arises for him—there he is not exalted-born, not proud-born, not intoxicated-born. Thus he thinks: 'Before long, he for whom this fame-word-renown has arisen, and this fame-word-renown itself—all three will entirely cease to be. What person of wise nature, among dharmas that are impermanent, unstable, not lasting, would generate a mind of attachment, be exalted, or be proud and arrogant?'
>
> Thus the bodhisattva dwells with mindfulness well-established regarding gain, honor, fame-word-renown."

---

## Part XV: Dwelling Like an Outcaste Youth

And again:¹⁶

> "They dwell in the world like outcaste youths, with a low, low mind; they become ones who have arrived at pride, intoxication, and arrogance, due to the constant presence of the perception of slander."

And again:

> "Here, O son of good family, a renunciant bodhisattva who has gone forth from household life, [thinking] 'I am like a corpse to friends, relatives, and kin,' is one whose pride has been struck down.
>
> 'Disfigurement has arisen in me, discolored garments are worn by me, another appearance has befallen me'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'With shaved head, bowl in hand, I go from family to family for alms, because of alms, due to alms'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'With a low, low mind, like an outcaste youth, I go for alms'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'I have become a bowl-liver; my livelihood depends on others'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'I accept what is rejected, what is disdained'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'My teachers, masters, and venerable ones are to be pleased'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'My fellow-practitioners are to be satisfied—by such and such conduct, pasture, and behavior'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'I shall attain Buddha-dharmas not yet attained'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'Among beings who are angry, with corrupted minds, I shall dwell abounding in patience'—his pride is struck down."

---

## Part XVI: The Ten Māra-Works

In the Āryalokottaraparivarta it is stated:¹⁷

> "These, O son of the Victor, are ten Māra-works of bodhisattvas. Which ten?
>
> 1. **Disrespect** toward teachers, venerable ones, ācāryas, fathers, mothers, śramaṇas, brāhmaṇas, and those rightly going, rightly practicing—this is Māra-work.
>
> 2. **Not bowing** to Dharma-preachers, to those who have attained distinguished dharmas, to expounders of excellent dharmas, to those mounted on the Mahāyāna, to those who know the procedure of the nirvāṇa-path, to those who have obtained dhāraṇī-sūtra-supremacy; being haughty and stiff; not generating respect for the Dharma-preacher, not causing service, not causing appreciation—Māra-work. Seated in a Dharma-hearing conversation, when the great Dharma-wave arises, not giving applause to the Dharma-preacher, [thinking] 'May no one praise this one'—Māra-work.
>
> 3. **Generating conceit** and grasping oneself, not grasping others; not entering into self-knowledge; not generating mental satisfaction—Māra-work.
>
> 4. **Generating pride**, not knowing, not understanding, concealing the praises of praise-worthy persons, speaking ill of them, and not being delighted by another's quality-praise—Māra-work.
>
> 5. **Knowing** 'This is Dharma, this is Vinaya, this is true Buddha-word,' yet making Dharma-hatred due to person-hatred, rejecting the true Dharma, and causing others to quarrel—Māra-work.
>
> 6. **Seeking high position**, not seeking what counteracts diminution, approaching and delighting in others' service, not rising for or going out to meet old, long-practiced holy-lifers—Māra-work.
>
> 7. **Being frown-faced**, not smile-faced; not of affectionate, sweet speech; always hard-minded, seeking faults, looking for entry-points—Māra-work.
>
> 8. **Having fallen into conceit**, not approaching the wise, not serving, not attending, not waiting upon, not asking, not inquiring: 'What is wholesome, what is unwholesome? What, done, is for long-term welfare, benefit, and happiness? What, not done, is for long-term non-welfare, non-benefit, and non-happiness?' He becomes stupid, even more stupid, wrapped in delusion, grasping pride, not seeing escape—Māra-work.
>
> 9. **Overcome by pride**, he becomes disgusted with Buddha-arising, exhausts former roots of virtue, does not raise new ones, expounds what is not to be expounded, undertakes quarrels, and is full of disputes. Living thus, there is occasion for him to fall into a wrong great precipice. And yet, by the power of the bodhicitta-commitment, he attains wonder. He does not encounter Buddha-arising for a hundred thousand kalpas—let alone Dharma-hearing. This is the tenth Māra-work.
>
> These, O son of the Victor, are the ten Māra-works which, having avoided, bodhisattvas obtain ten knowledge-works. And here, among the knowledge-works, it is stated: 'Humility toward all beings.'"

---

## Part XVII: The Rāṣṭrapāla Verse

In the Āryarāṣṭrapālasūtra too it is stated:¹⁸

> *Bad-destiny-ground, unfavorable-moment destinies,*
> *poverty, birth in a low family,*
> *blind-birth, weakness, and little strength—*
> *those fools, overcome by pride, grasp these.*

---

## Part XVIII: Beings as Buddha-Field

In the Dharmasaṃgītisūtra too it is stated:¹⁹

> "The being-field is the bodhisattva's buddha-field, since from the buddha-field comes the acquisition of Buddha-dharmas. I am not fit to err regarding it.
>
> And thus he thinks: 'All good conduct and bad conduct proceed depending on beings. From the basis of bad conduct, bad destinies proceed; from the basis of good conduct, gods and humans [proceed].'"

---

## Part XIX: The Ten Mind-States Toward Beings

Hence, in the Ratnolkādhāraṇī too it is stated:²⁰

> "Here, O sons of the Victor, a bodhisattva of first thought-arising, from the very beginning, generates toward all beings a ten-fold mind. Which ten?
>
> 1. Welfare-mind
> 2. Happiness-mind
> 3. Nurse-mind
> 4. Affectionate-mind
> 5. Dear-mind
> 6. Assistance-mind
> 7. Protection-mind
> 8. Equal-mind
> 9. Ācārya-mind
> 10. Teacher-mind
>
> This ten-fold mind he generates."

---

## Part XX: Servant to All Beings

In the Śraddhābalādhānāvatāramudrāsūtra too it is stated:²¹

> "'I am established in the undertaking of being a student of all beings. And I shall establish others in the undertaking of being students of all beings'—thus he obtains confidence...
>
> 'I am established in bowing and prostrating to all beings'—as before."

Therein, bowing and prostrating to all beings is humility toward all beings.

Likewise, in the Āryavimalakīrtinirdeśa, teacher-love toward all beings is stated for the sake of arising in a pure buddha-field.

For the sake of protecting the world's faith, even by one doing foot-showing work [i.e., menial service] on a seat, mentally, toward women or those who have attained unfavorable moments or the fallen—the bodhisattva should practice love and respect.

---

## Part XXI: The Blessed One's Service

For it is stated in the Gaṇḍavyūha, when that company sat on that great lion-throne, all that crowd stood facing, palms joined, honoring that very king...

And as stated in the Bhikṣuprakīrṇaka:²²

> "The Blessed One said: 'Do not fear, monk, do not fear, monk! I, O monk, will attend you. Bring, O monk, the robes, that I may wash them.'
>
> Thus addressed, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: 'May the Blessed One not wash the impurity-stained robes of this sick one. I, O Blessed One, will wash them.'
>
> The Blessed One said: 'Then, Ānanda, you wash this monk's robes. The Tathāgata will pour the water.'
>
> Then the venerable Ānanda washed the robes of that sick monk. The Blessed One poured the water...
>
> Then the venerable Ānanda, having properly and well taken up that sick monk, having brought him outside, bathed him. The Blessed One poured the water."

---

## Part XXII: Verses on Serving Beings

And it is said:²³

> *Those whom, having pleased, one attains greatness; having opposed, one attains terrible ruin—*
> *is it not right to satisfy them even by abandoning life?*
>
> *These are those beings by pleasing whom many have attained success.*
> *There is no field of success other than beings in the world.*
>
> *These are wish-fulfilling jewels, good vessels, and wish-granting cows.*
> *Like a teacher, like a deity—therefore they are to be pleased.*
>
> *Moreover, for those who are genuine relatives, who bring immeasurable benefit,*
> *having abandoned pleasing beings, what other atonement could there be?*
>
> *One should carry on one's head, as formerly the Protector did as wished,*
> *the beings who dwelt in his matted hair, having become [such], with firm effort.*
>
> *Those for whose sake one breaks the body and enters Avīci—*
> *when that is done for them, [the task] is done.*
>
> *Therefore, toward even great harm-doers, one should practice only good.*
>
> *My very masters, after all—for whose sake I am indifferent even to myself—*
> *how can I make pride toward those various masters, not servant-nature?*
>
> *Those in whose happiness the sage-lords go to joy,*
> *those in whose suffering they enter anger—*
> *from satisfying them, satisfaction of all sage-lords;*
> *in harm to them, harm done to the sages.*
>
> *Just as for one whose body is entirely on fire,*
> *there is no well-being from all pleasures—*
> *so too when beings are suffering,*
> *there is no means of joy for the greatly compassionate.*
>
> *Therefore, whatever suffering I have created for beings,*
> *which has saddened all the greatly compassionate—*
> *that evil I now confess;*
> *may the sages, whom I have grieved, forgive me.*
>
> *And for the sake of pleasing the Tathāgatas,*
> *I undertake servitude to the world with my entire being.*
> *Let crowds of people place their feet on my head,*
> *or let them strike—may the World-Protector be pleased.*
>
> *This entire world has been taken as their own by those of compassionate nature—*
> *of this there is no doubt.*
> *Are these not seen in the form of beings—*
> *those very Protectors? Why disrespect here?*
>
> *This very thing is pleasing of the Tathāgatas;*
> *this very thing is accomplishing one's own aim;*
> *this very thing removes the suffering of the world—*
> *therefore, may this be my vow.*
>
> *Just as a single king's man assaults a great crowd,*
> *acts cruelly—and the far-seeing crowd cannot [resist],*
> *since he is not alone—the king's power is his power—*
> *so one should not disdain any weak offender.*
>
> *For the guardians of hell and the compassionate—that is their power.*
> *Therefore, one should please beings as a servant [pleases] a fierce king.*
>
> *What would an angry king do that would equal the suffering of hell*
> *which is experienced from creating sorrow for beings?*
>
> *What would a pleased king give that would equal Buddha-hood*
> *which is experienced from creating joy for beings?*
>
> *Let alone future Buddha-hood arising from pleasing beings—*
> *do you not see in this very life good fortune, fame, and well-being?*
>
> *Beauty, health, joy, and long life—*
> *the patient one, wandering [in saṃsāra], obtains abundant universal-monarch happiness.*
>
> *That loving-intention is to be honored—that is the very greatness of beings.*
> *That merit from Buddha-faith—that is the very greatness of the Buddha.*

---

## Part XXIII: Loving-Kindness Surpasses All Worship

Hence, in the Candrapradīpasūtra, the fruit of loving-kindness meditation is displayed:²⁴

> *Whatever immeasurable, various worships*
> *in a hundred fields, in niyutas and crores—*
> *having made that worship of incomparable Leaders,*
> *it does not equal a fraction of the mind of loving-kindness.*

Therefore, toward such great venerable ones, one should always avoid exaltation.

---

## Part XXIV: Avoiding Improper Mental Attention

And this exaltation arises from improper mental attention (*ayoniśomanaskāra*).²⁵

Effort should be made toward its non-arising. As stated in the Ratnamegha:

> "And how, O son of good family, is a bodhisattva free from improper mental attention? Here, a bodhisattva, alone, gone to a secluded place, established in solitude, does not generate such a thought: 'I am one who dwells unmixed. I am established in solitude. I am one who practices in the Tathāgata's Dharma-Vinaya. But other śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas—they all dwell mixed, are full of association, are disturbed from the Tathāgata's Dharma-Vinaya.'
>
> Thus a bodhisattva is free from improper mental attention."

---

## Part XXV: Not Exalted by Vigor

And here again:²⁶

> "Here, a bodhisattva, undertaking vigor, does not relish that great vigor. He does not exalt himself by that vigor. He does not disparage others. Thus he thinks: 'What person of wise nature, devoted to one's own work, would reproach others?'
>
> Thus a bodhisattva is one of non-exalted vigor."

---

## Part XXVI: The Summary of Merit-Protection

This, then, is the summary of merit-protection: **dedication to awakening (*bodhipariṇāmanā*)**.²⁷

For thus it is stated in the Āryākṣayamatisūtra:

> "For there is no intermediate exhaustion of a root of virtue dedicated to awakening, until sitting on the seat of enlightenment. Just as, O venerable Śāradvatīputra, for a drop of water that has fallen into the great ocean, there is no intermediate exhaustion until the end of the kalpa."

---

*Thus ends the Seventh Chapter, Protection of Enjoyments and Merit, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*
