# Chapter 3: Watching Your Back (Dharmabhāṇakādirakṣā)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig

---

*The third chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on protecting those who preach the Dharma, avoiding the snares of Māra, and keeping your heart right when the world goes wrong.*

---


## The General Rule

We already talked about protecting yourself, your goods, and your merit in general.¹ Now we gotta get specific.

### The Teaching (Kārikā 7)

> **What does protecting yourself mean?**
> **Avoiding what's gonna hurt you.**²

Simple as that. But "avoiding harm" means two things:
1. Not getting yourself destroyed
2. Not destroying others³

---

## The Vow of the Holding-Fast Ones

This teaching on avoiding harm was spoken by bodhisattvas devoted to upholding the Dharma. They said:⁴

> "After the Teacher dies, we gonna hold that Dharma—
> Even if we gotta give up body and life.
>
> We'll let go of money! Let go of fame! Let go of praise!
> But we won't let go of this Dharma that shows Buddha-wisdom.
>
> They gonna curse us? We'll take it.
> They gonna threaten us? Bring it.
> They gonna spread lies about us? Let 'em.
>
> When those hard times come, when monks can't eat,
> When beings are falling apart—
> We'll be standing there, holding the Dharma.
>
> Those who accept these deep teachings?
> They won't break. They'll brush aside the nonsense.
>
> We'll show loving-kindness to the ones not grounded in Dharma.
> And we'll show compassion, holding this teaching all the way.
>
> When we see folks with bad conduct, stuck in greed—
> We'll weep for them. Where they gonna end up?
>
> When we see someone blocking the Dharma,
> We'll love 'em from a distance—so they don't get mad at us.
>
> We'll protect ourselves, watching our words and actions.
> We won't suddenly call out folks deep in their own mess.
>
> With gifts, with respect, we'll ripen 'em slowly.
> And we'll nudge 'em toward truth, away from evil's domain.
>
> We'll leave the household life behind,
> Wander the wild edges like deer—
> Few concerns, few tasks...
>
> Tamed, peaceful, free—and when we come into town,
> We'll teach the Dharma to those who thirst for it.
>
> We'll travel far if we hear of someone seeking.
> Delighting in Dharma, we'll do the work for beings.
>
> Seeing all the stumbling of beings face to face,
> We'll watch ourselves—keeping a kind heart.
>
> Whether they honor us or shame us—solid like Mount Meru,
> Untouched by the world, we'll become guides for the world.
>
> Hearing monks criticize divided communities,
> We'll mind our own business—let their karma be theirs.
>
> They gonna hire assassins for folks who practice this?
> They'll say 'We ain't got none of this among us!'
>
> 'Our monks ain't got no monk-qualities!'
> When they hear true criticism, they reject this very text.
>
> Cut off ears and noses—how's a mirror gonna please them?
> When they hear true words, they throw out the Dharma.
>
> Those monks who embrace the true Dharma?
> They'll work so hard that somebody—anybody—hears it.
>
> Kings will come for them. Mobs will break them.
> But through Buddha's power, beings will hear the Dharma anyway.
>
> In that hard time, we—giving up body and life—
> Will hold the Dharma. For beings' sake."

That's the vow. That's the commitment.

## The Lotus Sūtra Warning

The Lotus Sūtra lays it out straight:⁵

> Protect your conduct. Stay unassociated. Be clean.
> Avoid getting cozy with princes and kings.
>
> Avoid the king's men too.
> Outcasts, boxers, drunks, and all kinds of sectarians.
>
> Don't serve conceited monks—even if they know their scriptures—
> If they act like arhats but got bad behavior? Avoid 'em.
>
> Stay away from nuns who laugh too much, gossip too much.
> Stay away from laywomen who are exposed and unsettled.
>
> Women, hermaphrodites—avoid close ties.
> In households, avoid the young brides and virgin daughters.
>
> Don't befriend them or ask 'How's it going, spiritually?'
> Avoid pig-sellers, sheep-sellers.
>
> Those who support women [as a profession]—avoid.
> Actors, jugglers, wrestlers—all that.
>
> Don't serve courtesans or entertainers.
> Greeting such folks? Entirely avoid.
>
> And when you're teaching Dharma to women alone?
> Don't go in there solo. Don't start laughing."

## The Devil's Playbook

Here's another danger—what the scriptures call **Māra's work**.⁶

The Perfection of Wisdom says:

> "Māra the Evil One will work extra hard against the bodhisattva who's just getting started."

And also:⁷

> "Ānanda, whenever a bodhisattva really gets into Prajñāpāramitā practice, right then Māra brings harassment, generates fear.
>
> He'll make meteors fall. He'll show fires burning in every direction. 'Maybe this bodhisattva will get scared! Maybe his hair will stand on end!'—anything to shake even one moment of their awakening-mind.
>
> Some will write it down, take it up, then say: 'We ain't getting nothing from this!' and walk away. Yawning, laughing, drifting off—that's Māra's work.
>
> Then thoughts arise: thoughts of the countryside, the village, back home. Thoughts of your teachers, your parents, your friends, your family. Thoughts of thieves. Thoughts of 'I need new robes.'
>
> Then: The Dharma-teacher wants to teach, but the student gets sick. Or vice versa. The teacher wants to travel, but the students say no. The teacher wants more, the student wants less—or the opposite.
>
> In short: **Whatever discord there is between teacher and student? That's Māra's work.**"

---

## Everything Unwholesome Is Māra

The Gaganagañja Sūtra says:⁸

> "Whatever keeping on with unwholesome dharmas, whatever abandoning of wholesome dharmas—all of that is Māra's work."

---

## The Ten Hooks of Māra

The Sāgaramati Sūtra gives us the list—the **ten snares**:⁹

**Hook #7: Forest-Dwelling Gone Wrong**

> "There's a bodhisattva who lives in the forest, loves his solitude, has few desires, is content, stays away from householders and monks alike. Because he's got few concerns, he lives easy.
>
> But he's not diligent about learning. He don't cross over to ripen beings. He don't participate in Dharma-talks. He don't ask questions. He don't ask 'What's skillful?'
>
> His afflictions stay dormant because he's isolated. He feels satisfied just suppressing them—but he don't uproot 'em.
>
> So he ain't practicing for himself or for others. That's **Māra's seventh hook**."

**Hook #10: False Friends**

> "The bodhisattva serves, follows, and attends evil friends who look like spiritual friends.
>
> These 'friends' pull him away from the means of attraction, from accumulating merit, from embracing the Dharma. They put him in isolation. 'Focus on few desires!' they say. They teach him the Lesser Vehicle stuff.
>
> When he should be in solitude, they give him busy-work. When he should be serving, they isolate him.
>
> And they say: 'Enlightenment is for those who work hard! You're lazy. If you don't wake up in eight or nine kalpas, you never will.'
>
> Here's the danger: With too much pressure, the bodhisattva might just grab personal nirvāṇa [as an arhat] and stop short of full buddhahood.
>
> That's **Māra's tenth hook**."

**Hook #11: Bad Company**

> "Those who are supposed to be Mahāyāna folks but don't know the Māra-hooks, who practice dharmas that have gone astray—with them the bodhisattva finds pleasure.
>
> Because they become his followers. And the one who hangs with the lower goes to a lower place—a desert destiny, a destiny of dullness and muteness.
>
> That's **Māra's eleventh hook**."

---


## Don't Burn Yourself Out

Because of all this danger, continuous aroused effort done wrong produces burnout.¹⁰

The Cloud of Jewels says:

> "The bodhisattva arouses effort in every posture. But he does it so he don't get tired—body or mind.
>
> What kind of effort leads to exhaustion? Taking on heavy work when you're weak. Doing difficult stuff when your aspiration ain't ripe yet—like giving your own flesh before you're ready.
>
> Yes, you've given your body [in aspiration]. But don't let it be consumed at the wrong time. Otherwise, through your exhaustion, the bodhicitta-seed in those very beings gets destroyed—and a huge mass of fruit is lost."

And the Gaganagañja adds:¹¹

> "Expecting results before the right time? That's Māra's work."

---


## Who Not to Feed Your Flesh To

You shouldn't abandon the practice of giving your body just because the time ain't right. If you never practice, you'll never be ready to give.¹²

So keep mindfulness. Protect your body from:
- Those who block the ripening of bodhicitta
- Those who, through delusion, destroy your own benefit
- Flesh-eaters¹³
- Harmful actors

### The Teaching (Kārikā 8 verse)

> *Just like the seed of a medicine tree—*
> *whose root and branches will be used—*
> *even when given, you protect it from wrong timing:*
> *That's how you guard the Buddha's medicine tree.*¹⁴

In short: that's the harm called Māra's work.

---


The Cloud of Jewels tells us how:¹⁵

> "How does the bodhisattva get skillful at avoiding Māra's work?
>
> He entirely avoids unwholesome friends.
> He avoids dwelling in the wrong place.
> He avoids worldly sciences and mantras [as obsession].
> He avoids [excessive pursuit of] gain, honor, reverence, esteem.
>
> Whatever secondary afflictions block the path—he avoids them all.
> And he cultivates the antidotes."

---

## What's an Unwholesome Friend Look Like?

The text spells it out:¹⁶

> "You can tell an evil friend by what they lack:
>
> - Morality failed? Avoid.
> - View failed? Avoid.
> - Conduct failed? Avoid.
> - Livelihood failed? Avoid.
> - Loves communal drama? Avoid.
> - Lazy? Avoid.
> - Takes pleasure in saṃsāra? Avoid.
> - Turned away from awakening? Avoid.
> - Too attached to householders? Avoid.
>
> But here's the thing: Even while avoiding them, don't generate hostility. Don't get angry. Don't be contemptuous.
>
> Remember what the Buddha said: 'Beings flow together according to their element—desire, and so forth. Through association they're destroyed. That's why I avoid association.'"

---


## The Confusion of Bodhicitta

**Losing the awakening-mind is also harm.**¹⁷

The Heap of Jewels tells us what causes it:

> "By four things, Kāśyapa, the bodhisattva's bodhicitta becomes confused:
>
> 1. **Deceiving your teachers and guides**
> 2. **Making folks feel bad when they got no reason to**
> 3. **Spreading lies about Mahāyāna practitioners**
> 4. **Approaching folks with deceit instead of genuine intention**"

---

## How to Keep It Clear

The same text tells us how to prevent confusion:¹⁸

> "By four things, Kāśyapa, the bodhisattva's bodhicitta stays clear from birth to birth, all the way to the seat of awakening:
>
> 1. **Never lie—not even for laughs, not even to save your life**
> 2. **Stand before all beings with real intention, abandoning deceit**
> 3. **See all bodhisattvas as your teachers**
> 4. **Praise them in every direction**
>
> And whoever you ripen—lead them all to full awakening, not partial paths."

---


The Lion's Questions says:¹⁹

> "One who never creates an obstacle to the Dharma-gift?
> That one quickly meets the World-Protectors.
>
> From the Dharma-gift, you remember your past lives.
> By it, you don't abandon bodhicitta in any birth—
> Not even in dreams, how much more when awake!
>
> In whatever place you take up the Dharma for awakening—
> By that, your heart never lets go."

---


The Mañjuśrī Buddha-Field Sūtra says:²⁰

> "Four things keep the bodhisattva from falling from the vow:
>
> 1. Pride has been struck down
> 2. Jealousy and stinginess are avoided
> 3. Seeing others succeed, you don't get puffed up"

---


What keeps bodhicitta most clear?²¹

The Heap of Jewels says:

> "Cultivating bodhicitta in every posture. Making bodhicitta first."

And the Moon-Lamp Sūtra:²²

> "I tell you straight:
> However much you think on something,
> That's how your mind inclines.
> You're supported by what you keep thinking."

---


**Discouragement is harm too.**²³

The Cloud of Jewels says:

> "The bodhisattva don't think: 'Enlightenment is too hard for a human. My effort is too small. I'm lazy. Awakening takes forever—kalpas upon kalpas! I can't carry that load.'
>
> Instead, the bodhisattva thinks: 'Every buddha that ever was, is, or will be—they all did it this same way, with this same practice, this same effort.
>
> They weren't already buddhas when they woke up. I'm gonna strive the same way, exert myself the same way—with effort common to all beings, effort that has all beings as its object—so I can awaken to full enlightenment.'"

---


Another danger from the Heap of Jewels:²⁴

> "**Trusting unripe beings**—that's a stumbling for the bodhisattva.
>
> **Teaching high Dharma to those who can't hold it**—that's a stumbling.
>
> **Teaching the Lesser Vehicle to those ready for greatness**—that's a stumbling.
>
> **Looking down on the virtuous while gathering the wicked**—that's a stumbling."

---


**Lack of aspiration is harm.**²⁵

The Rāṣṭrapāla Sūtra says:

> "No faith in Buddha, Dharma, Saṅgha?
> No faith in the training?
> Evil-minded, open to the lower realms—
>
> Such a one, falling from here, reborn human but still confused,
> Will find suffering in hell, in animal births, in the hungry ghost realm."

---

## How to Remedy It

The Heap of Jewels again:²⁶

> "For teachings too deep for your understanding? Don't reject them.
>
> Just say: 'The Tathāgata knows. I don't know. Buddha's awakening is infinite. Through diversity of aspirations, the teaching flows to beings.'"

---


**If you're doing service, be skillful in avoiding harm.**²⁷

The Bodhisattava Prātimokṣa enjoins service for Dharma-hearing and Buddha-worship.

The Heap of Jewels gives the rules:²⁸

> "The serving monk should satisfy the whole Saṅgha.
>
> Don't give work-assignments to forest-dwelling monks. If Saṅgha work falls to a forest-dweller, do it yourself or ask someone else—don't burden the forest monk.
>
> For the alms-round monk, share the good food.
>
> For the yoga-practitioner monk, bring suitable equipment—medicine, supplies for sickness. Don't make loud noise where he meditates. Protect him. Prop up his seat. Offer good food suited to practice...
>
> For monks devoted to learning, encourage them. Protect them.
>
> For Dharma-preachers, receive them properly. Encourage Dharma-listeners. Prepare the hall. Clean the discourse-space. Applaud plenty...
>
> Don't develop a sense of lordship. Even small tasks—do them by the Saṅgha's will, not your own...
>
> Don't mix Saṅgha property with property of the Four Quarters' Saṅgha. Don't mix stūpa property...
>
> If a serving monk, angry, commands virtuous ones from a sense of lordship—by that karma, he goes to hell...
>
> If he threatens a monk out of fear—he's reborn in a hell called 'Many Terrors'... tongue extended a hundred yojanas... iron stakes driven into it, blazing...
>
> If he hoards incoming Saṅgha gains, doesn't give on time, harasses before giving, withholds from some—the hungry ghost realm called 'Shank' is his destination. Other ghosts take food and hide it from him. Looking at it, hungry and thirsty, he suffers—for a thousand years he never gets the food..."

---


The Saṃgharakṣita Story tells what happens when you mess with Saṅgha property:²⁹

> "Those beings you saw shaped like **walls**—they were monks. They ruined a Saṅgha wall with phlegm. Now they're wall-shaped.
>
> Those shaped like **pillars**—they ruined a Saṅgha pillar with mucus. Now they're pillar-shaped.
>
> Those shaped like **trees, leaves, flowers, fruits**—they consumed Saṅgha trees and fruits for personal use. Now they're tree-shaped.
>
> Those shaped like **ropes and brooms**—they used Saṅgha ropes and brooms personally. Now they're rope-shaped and broom-shaped.
>
> The one shaped like a **ladle**—he was a novice making porridge. When guest monks arrived and asked 'Is this for the Saṅgha?', he said (out of stinginess): 'Can't you see the scum? The porridge is gone!' The guests left discouraged. Now he's ladle-shaped.
>
> The one shaped like a **mortar**—he was a monk who got angry at an arhat-novice grinding beans. He said: 'If I could, I'd throw YOU in the mortar and pound you!' The novice stayed silent.
>
> Later the novice said: 'Do you know who I am? I'm an arhat. The work is done—afflictions abandoned. You spoke harshly. Acknowledge the transgression, maybe the karma can be diminished.'
>
> But the monk didn't acknowledge it. Now he's mortar-shaped."

And so on—pots, things split down the middle being carried by thread...³⁰

The lesson is harsh but clear: **Even small violations against communal property bring heavy karmic fruit.**

---

*Thus ends the Third Chapter: Watching Your Back.*

---

## Endnotes

¹ **Chapters 1-2 recap**: Giving (Chapter 1) and protecting through spiritual friends (Chapter 2).

² **Kārikā 7**: "Protection = avoiding harm"—deceptively simple, but the rest of the chapter shows how complex it gets.

³ **Two-way protection**: Not getting destroyed AND not destroying others.

⁴ **Gaganagañja Sūtra**: The "Space-Treasury" Sūtra. These verses are a collective vow for the age after Buddha's death.

⁵ **Lotus Sūtra**: These guidelines for "safe conduct" for Dharma-preachers have been controversial—they reflect an ascetic wariness of women, entertainers, and worldly power.

⁶ **Māra's work (mārakarma)**: Everything that obstructs the path—external opposition or internal discord. Māra is the devil, the tempter, the obstructor.

⁷ **The discord principle**: Any disagreement between teacher and student is Māra's work. That's sobering.

⁸ **Everything unwholesome is Māra**: Not just demonic attacks—laziness, clinging, abandoning good.

⁹ **Ten Māra-hooks (mārāṅkuśa)**: These are specific traps. The seventh is lazy forest-dwelling; the tenth is false spiritual friends; the eleventh is bad company.

¹⁰ **Burnout is danger**: Too much effort at the wrong time destroys the seed of awakening in others who depend on you.

¹¹ **Impatience is Māra**: Expecting results before the right time—that's the devil's work.

¹² **The paradox of practice**: You must practice giving the body gradually, or you'll never be ready when the time comes.

¹³ **Flesh-eaters (piśitāśana)**: Demons or beings who would consume your offered body destructively, wasting the gift.

¹⁴ **The medicine tree**: Your body is like a medicinal tree whose seed should be protected for proper harvest—not consumed too early by wrong agents.

¹⁵ **Cloud of Jewels (Ratnamegha)**: How to avoid Māra's traps—avoid wrong friends, wrong places, wrong pursuits.

¹⁶ **Evil friend characteristics**: Failed morality, view, conduct, livelihood; drama-lovers; lazy; saṃsāra-lovers; awakening-avoiders; householder-cling.

¹⁷ **Bodhicitta confusion (bodhicittasaṃpramoṣa)**: When the awakening-mind gets stolen or fogged—one of the worst harms.

¹⁸ **Four clarities**: Never lie; stand genuine; see bodhisattvas as teachers; praise them everywhere.

¹⁹ **Lion's Questions (Siṃhaparipṛcchā)**: Never block Dharma-giving—it generates lifetime memory and keeps bodhicitta alive.

²⁰ **Four non-falling dharmas**: Pride struck, jealousy avoided, not conceited at others' success.

²¹ **Make bodhicitta first**: Cultivate it in every posture. That's the clearest prevention of confusion.

²² **Moon-Lamp Sūtra**: "You become what you keep thinking."

²³ **Discouragement (avasāda)**: Thinking "I can't do this" is harm—it abandons the path.

²⁴ **Four stumblings (skhalita)**: Wrong trust, wrong teaching, looking down on the virtuous.

²⁵ **Lack of aspiration (anadhimukti)**: No faith = lower rebirths.

²⁶ **Tathāgata as witness**: For teachings too deep, don't reject—say "The Buddha knows; I don't."

²⁷ **Service skill (vaiyāvṛtyakuśala)**: If you serve the Saṅgha, know the rules or you'll hurt yourself.

²⁸ **Heap of Jewels (Ratnarāśi)**: Extensive service guidelines—protect forest-dwellers, yoga-practitioners, Dharma-preachers.

²⁹ **Saṃgharakṣita narrative**: Monks who misused Saṅgha property reborn as objects. Vivid karmic warning.

³⁰ **The mortar-monk**: Didn't acknowledge his transgression against an arhat. Harsh speech, no confession = mortar-shaped rebirth.

## Theological Notes

### Māra Is Everywhere
In Blues tradition, we call this "the Devil's work." But notice: Māra isn't just some red demon with a pitchfork. Discord between teacher and student? That's Māra. Laziness? Māra. Impatience? Māra. Bad company? Māra. The enemy is inside the house.

### The Ten Hooks
These are specific traps for the spiritually sincere:
- **Hook 7**: Forest-dwelling gone wrong—isolation without growth
- **Hook 10**: False friends who look spiritual but divert you
- **Hook 11**: Running with folks who've fallen

### The Burning Heart Doesn't Burn Out
The bodhisattva's vigor is continuous but sustainable. You can't sprint a marathon. If you burn yourself out, you destroy the bodhicitta-seed in the beings who depend on you.

### Discouragement Is Sin
"I can't do this" is abandoning the path. The Blues response: "Every buddha did it this way. So will I."

### Small Violations, Big Fruit
The Saṃgharakṣita visions are terrifying: monks reborn as walls, pillars, ladles, mortars—for small misuses of communal property. The lesson: acknowledge your transgression before it hardens into karmic form.

### Blood and Water
We saw in Chapter 2 that Sadāprarudita used his own blood when Māra hid the water. Here we see the flip side: protect the body from wrong consumption. The gift isn't wasted on flesh-eaters.
