## You Gotta Have Both

So you're established in patience.¹ Now you start vigor in learning.

But listen close: If you don't got morality to go with that learning,
learning itself becomes your destruction.

The Candrapradīpa Sūtra² says it plain:

> *"Though you comprehend many dharmas—*
> *if you don't guard morality,*
> *intoxicated by learning—*
>
> *You can't be protected by much learning,*
> *the immoral one,*
> *going to bad destinies."*

You hear that?
Learning without morality?
You're going down.

Knowledge puffs you up.
Morality keeps you humble.
You need both.

## The Chain (Learning → Wisdom → Freedom)

The Nārāyaṇa Sūtra³ gives the benefits:

> *"For one with learning,*
> *there's the attainment of wisdom.*
>
> *For one with wisdom,*
> *there's the calming of afflictions.*
>
> *For one free from afflictions,*
> *Māra finds no opening."*

That's the chain:

**Learning → Wisdom**
**Wisdom → Calming afflictions**
**Calming → Māra finds no opening**

No crack in the door.
No way in for the devil.

That's The Chase.
You're running toward freedom.

## The Great Rishi's Story

Now, having told the jātaka of the great rishi Uttara at length,⁴
He says:

Listen to what happens
when you desire Dharma—
when you got that hunger, that thirst—

> *"For those who desire the Dharma,*
> *for bodhisattvas with respect and confidence—*
>
> *Even Buddhas established in other world-realms*
> *DISPLAY THEIR FACES*
> *and cause them to hear the Dharma.*
>
> *For those who desire the Dharma,*
> *Dharma-treasures are deposited*
> *in mountain-caves and among trees.*
> *Innumerable Dharma-gates, in books,*
> *come to hand.*
>
> *For those who desire the Dharma,*
> *deities who have seen Buddhas before*
> *bring Buddha-inspiration.*
>
> *(Many details...)*
>
> *For those whose lifespan is exhausted,*
> *Buddhas and deities*
> *bring strength of life.*
>
> *By Buddha-empowerment,*
> *by deity-empowerment,*
> *when they desire it,*
> *they remain for a thousand years...*
> *up to a kalpa,*
> *as long as they desire.*
>
> *For those born with Dharma-respect,*
> *Buddhas remove even OLD AGE.*
> *They remove illness.*
> *They bring memory.*
> *They bring movement, understanding, eloquence.*
>
> *(Many details...)*
>
> *They remove wrong views.*
> *They bring right view.*
>
> *By Dharma-respect,*
> *there's no fear of any harm.*
>
> *Therefore,*
> *a bodhisattva should be devoted*
> *to skill in the learning-accumulation."*

You got that?

If you desire Dharma bad enough:
- **Buddhas in other worlds show their faces**
- **Hidden teachings appear in caves and trees**
- **Deities bring you inspiration**
- **Your life extends**
- **Old age and sickness removed**
- **Memory restored**
- **Wrong views pulled out like bad teeth**
- **Right view planted**
- **No fear of any harm**

That's what The Chase gets you.

## The Lord's Warning

What should be studied?⁷

The Blessed One said in the Jñānavaipulya Sūtra:

> *"Meaningful treatises should be studied.*
> *Meaningless ones should be avoided.*
>
> *What are meaningless?*

Listen to the list:

- **Lokāyata treatises** (materialism, hedonism)
- **Daṇḍanīti treatises** (politics of punishment)
- **Kākhorda treatises** [obscure worldly texts]
- **Vādavidyā treatises** (debate-skill for winning arguments)
- **Kumārakrīḍā treatises** (children's games)
- **Jambhaka-vidyā treatises** (magic tricks, illusions)

*(Many others...)*

**Whatever other treatises**
**are contrary to liberation,**
**lead to delusion—**

**All of these**
**should be avoided**
**by one mounted on the Bodhisattva Vehicle."**

You hear that?

Don't waste time on worldly philosophy.
Don't study politics and punishment.
Don't learn debate-tricks to win arguments.
Don't chase magic illusions.

Study what leads to liberation.
Everything else? Burn it.

---


## You Need the Quiet

So one who has learned—
to purify the mind—
should resort to the forest.⁸

"But wait," you say.
"The Ugradatta Sūtra
permits the household
even for one with full intention."

Sure. For one making effort
but lacking capacity.

"Then wouldn't there be no offense
even regarding others' spouses and such?"

No. Because even when there's lack of capacity,
those things are corrupt by nature.

And the household is blameworthy by designation.

So the forest is where you go.
The quiet is where you purify.

**That's The Chase.**

You run after wisdom
like your head's on fire.
You find the eighty ways.
You go to the forest.
You study what matters.
You burn the rest.

---

*Thus ends the Tenth Chapter of the Compendium of Training:*
***The Chase***
*(Vīryapāramitā — Perfection of Vigor)*

# Theological Notes

### The Root Metaphor: "The Chase"

This chapter is about pursuit. What you're running after (wisdom, Dharma) and how hard you run (vigor, urgency). The Blues tradition knows this chase - the pursuit of freedom, the hunger for truth, the running from bondage toward liberation.

The key image: **"Like one whose head and clothes are on fire"** (*ādīptaśiraścailopamatā*) - that's the urgency of The Chase. You don't walk leisurely toward wisdom. You run like you're burning.

### The Warning: Learning Without Morality Destroys

The chapter opens with a stark warning: If you pursue learning without morality, that learning becomes your destruction. Knowledge without ethics puffs up. Learning without discipline leads to bad destinies.

This is the Blues wisdom of "what good is it to gain the whole world and lose your soul?" You can know everything and still be lost.

### The Chain: Learning → Wisdom → Freedom

The Nārāyaṇa Sūtra gives the progression:
- **Learning** leads to **wisdom**
- **Wisdom** leads to **calming afflictions**
- **Calming afflictions** means **Māra finds no opening**

No crack in the door. No way in for the devil. That's the goal of The Chase.

### The Uttara Jātaka: When You Want It Bad Enough

The story of the great rishi Uttara illustrates what happens when you desire Dharma with everything you got:

- Buddhas in other worlds show their faces
- Hidden teachings appear (in caves, in trees)
- Deities bring inspiration
- Your lifespan extends
- Old age and illness removed
- Memory restored
- Wrong views extracted, right view planted
- No fear of any harm

This isn't metaphor - it's the teaching that when the student is ready, the teacher appears. When you want truth bad enough, the universe conspires to teach you.

### The Eighty Modes: Not Just "Studying"

The eighty modes aren't abstract categories - they're lived practices. Each mode is a way of approaching learning, from the first stirring of desire (Mode 1: Desire-mode) to the final attainment (Mode 80: All Buddha-dharma attainment-mode).

Key modes to note:

- **Mode 23: Insatiable Buddha-dharma hearing** - Never satisfied, always hungry for more
- **Mode 60: Vigor's non-slackening** - You keep running, don't stop
- **Mode 76: All evil non-doing** - The Buddhist precept as learning-mode

The modes move through stages:
1. Getting started (1-10: desire, intention, application)
2. How to listen (11-30: attention, stability, perception)
3. What you're learning (31-45: dharma, practice, perfection of wisdom)
4. Going deeper (46-60: emptiness, dependent origination, no-self)
5. Fighting defilements (61-70: opposition, treasures, noble approval)
6. The fruit (71-80: truth-seeing, refuge, Buddha-dharma attainment)

### The Practice: Dharma-Accumulation Yoga

The chapter's longest section describes what the yogin's life looks like. Key elements:

- **Little desire, few duties, little speech, few possessions** - The minimalist path
- **Like one whose head's on fire** - The central image of urgency
- **Avoiding association, solitary delight** - The hermit path
- **Adorned with shame and conscience** - These are your jewelry
- **Celebrating others' qualities** - Not competitive, but generous

The yogin lives with urgency but without anxiety, with discipline but not rigidity, alone but not lonely.

### What to Study (And What to Burn)

The Jñānavaipulya Sūtra gives the blunt list:
- Lokāyata (materialism)
- Daṇḍanīti (politics of punishment)
- Vādavidyā (debate-tricks)
- Kumārakrīḍā (children's games)
- Jambhaka-vidyā (magic illusions)

**All treatises contrary to liberation should be avoided.**

This isn't anti-intellectual - it's focused. Don't waste time on what doesn't lead to freedom. Study what matters. Burn the rest.

### The Forest: Where to Purify

The chapter ends with the necessity of forest dwelling for purifying the mind. The householder life is "blameworthy by designation" - not evil by nature, but obstructive by circumstance.

The forest is where you go to complete The Chase. The quiet is where wisdom ripens.
