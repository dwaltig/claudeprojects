# Chapter 18: Recollection of the Three Jewels (Ratnatrayānusmṛti)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

**Summary**: Having detailed the benefits of worship in Chapter 17, Śāntideva now turns to the mental cultivation that sustains it: the **Recollection (*Anusmṛti*) of the Three Jewels** (*Ratnatraya*). This chapter is a treasure trove of Mahāyāna devotional literature, citing the *Rāṣṭrapāla Paripṛcchā* for the Buddha, the *Dharmasaṃgīti* for the Dharma, and the *Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa* for the Sangha. It concludes with a spectacular section from the *Ratnolkādhāraṇī* describing the infinite "Light Rays" (*raśmi*) of the Tathāgata that enact buddha-work across the cosmos.

### 1. The Necessity of Constant Practice

The increase of merit through the Practice of Good Conduct (*Bhadracaryā*) has been stated. Here is another cause for it: **the constant practice (*sadābhyāsa*) of faith (*śraddhā*) and the other faculties.**

As stated in the *Ārya-Tathāgataguhya Sūtra*:¹

> "Four things, Great King, lead to distinction (*viśeṣagāmitā*) and non-degeneration (*aparihāṇi*) for those set out in the Mahāyāna. What four?
> 1.  **Faith (*śraddhā*)**: By which one approaches the Noble Ones (*āryas*) and does not do what should not be done.
> 2.  **Respect (*gaurava*)**: By which one listens to the Well-Spoken (*subhāṣita*) and hears the Dharma with an attentive ear.
> 3.  **Humility (*nirmānatā*)**: By which one bows to and reveres the Noble Ones.
> 4.  **Vigor (*vīrya*)**: By which one gains physical and mental lightness (*laghutā*) and accomplishes all tasks."

### 2. The Five Faculties (Indriya)

One must constantly practice faith and the rest. Or, following the *Ārya-Akṣayamati Sūtra*, the **Five Faculties**:

1.  **Faculty of Faith (*Śraddhendriya*)**: Belief in the world-transcending Right View, karma and result, and the Bodhisattva conduct. One believes in the emptiness of the person and phenomena but does not fall into nihilism (*uccheda*).
2.  **Faculty of Vigor (*Vīryendriya*)**: Gathering those dharmas one believes in.
3.  **Faculty of Mindfulness (*Smṛtīndriya*)**: Not losing the dharmas one has gathered.
4.  **Faculty of Concentration (*Samādhīndriya*)**: Making the mind one-pointed (*ekāgra*) on the retained dharmas.
5.  **Faculty of Wisdom (*Prajñendriya*)**: Investigating and penetrating those concentrated dharmas.

### 3. Recollection of the Buddha (Buddhānusmṛti)

How should one recollect the Buddha?
As praised in the *Rāṣṭrapāla Sūtra*:²

> "I worship You, of golden hue and excellent marks,
> Face like a stainless moon, knowledge unequaled;
> None in the three worlds is like You, dustless One.
>
> Your hair is soft, beautiful, glossy, and pure;
> Your uṣṇīṣa is like the King of Mountains.
> None can look down upon Your crown;
> The ūrṇā (hair-tuft) shines between Your brows, O Sage.
>
> Eyes like blue lotuses, pure and white as conch or moon;
> With compassion You gaze upon this world—
> I worship You, O Jina, of stainless vision.
>
> Your tongue is broad, thin, copper-colored;
> With it, You cover Your own face.
> Speaking Dharma, You discipline the world—
> I worship You of sweet, glossy speech.
>
> This world is known by You as like an illusion (*māyopama*),
> Like a stage-play, a dream, a mirage.
> No self (*ātman*), no being, no life-course exists;
> Dharmas are like a mirage, like a flash of lightning.
>
> Seeing the world always confused by passion and a hundred ills,
> Like a peerless Physician, You wander,
> Liberating hundreds of beings, O Sugata."

### 4. Recollection of the Dharma (Dharmānusmṛti)

As stated in the *Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra*:

> "Here, the Bodhisattva reflects:
> 'The Dharma is **Same** (*sama*); it functions equally toward beings.
> The Dharma is **Impartial** (*apakṣapatita*); it does not function with a view to pleasure.
> The Dharma is **Timeless** (*akālika*); not waiting for time.
> The Dharma is **Without High or Low**; it functions neither for the lofty nor the lowly.
> The Dharma is **Beyond Purity or Impurity** (*utkarṣāpakarṣāpagata*).
> The Dharma is **Solidly Established** (*sadādhiṣṭhita*); it functions night and day.
> The Dharma is **Unlimited** (*aprameya*); like space, it does not decrease or increase.
> The Dharma is **Not Protected**; it protects beings.
> The Dharma is **Not a Refuge Seeker**; it is the refuge of the whole world.'"³

### 5. Recollection of the Sangha (Saṅghānusmṛti)

The Sangha consists of those who speak Dharma, think Dharma, and are a Field of Dharma.
As stated in the *Arya-Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa*, the qualities of the Bodhisattvas should be cultivated:⁴

> "In a single moment (*ekakṣaṇa*), these confident Bodhisattvas
> Display the forms, sounds, and voices of all beings.
>
> They appear old, sick, or dead;
> For the ripening of beings, they play with illusion-dharmas.
>
> They show the burning of the kalpa, earth consumed by fire;
> To those with the notion of permanence, they show impermanence.
>
> Invited by hundreds of thousands of beings in one kingdom,
> They eat in everyone's house,
> And bend them all toward Awakening (*bodhi*).
>
> Whatever arts, sciences, or crafts exist,
> They have reached perfection in all, bringing happiness to beings.
>
> They become suns, moons, Indras, Brahmas,
> Lords of Creatures, Water, Fire, Earth, and Wind.
>
> During kalpas of disease, they become supreme medicines;
> During kalpas of famine, they become food and drink;
> During kalpas of weapons, they become meditators on Maitrī (Love)."

### 6. The Light Rays of the Tathāgata (Ratnolkādhāraṇī)

Just as the *Ratnolkādhāraṇī* describes the Bodhisattva qualities, so should they be cultivated:⁵

> "Releasing the ray called **Garland-Array** (*Mālyavyūhā*):
> It rains down garlands, ornaments, and canopies.
> With these scattered everywhere, Great Beings worship the Jina.
>
> Releasing the ray called **Peace-Maker** (*Śāntikarī*):
> Beings urged by its light become free of passion, hate, and delusion.
> Turning away from bad friends and crowds,
> They praise the peace of the forest (*araṇya*).
>
> Releasing the ray called **Produce-Promoter** (*Sasyasaṃpādanī*):
> It rains down rain, producing crops and herbs,
> Satisfying those tormented by hunger and thirst.
>
> Releasing the ray called **Insight-Lamp** (*Prajñāpradīpa*):
> It reveals dharmas as empty, selfless, unborn, like illusions.
> Beings understand that phenomena are like dreams or mirages.
>
> Releasing the ray called **Fear-Remover** (*Abhayaṃdadā*):
> Beings touched by it are freed from bonds, beatings, and threats.
> They refrain from taking life and become protectors of the fearful.
>
> Releasing the ray called **Wealth-Shower** (*Arthanidarśanī*):
> Lists of treasures appear to the poor.
> Obtaining inexhaustible wealth, they practice giving.
>
> Releasing the ray called **Sense-Purifier** (*Indriyaviśodhanī*):
> The blind see forms; the deaf hear sounds;
> The noseless smell fragrances; the mute speak sweetly;
> The crippled gain perfect bodies; the mad regain their minds."

### 7. Conclusion

Just as the wind, unlearned in the perfections, brings happiness to the world,
Just as the magician displays illusions without attachment,
Just as the sun shines on the blind without discrimination—
So do the Tathāgatas and their children (Bodhisattvas) perform their work.

**This is the Recollection of the Three Jewels.**
