# Chapter 10: Perfection of Vigor (Vīryapāramitā)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

*The tenth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on the Perfection of Vigor. Contains the benefits of learning, the Uttara jātaka, the famous 80 modes of entering learning from the Akṣayamatisūtra, and what treatises to study or avoid.*

---

## Part I: Vigor in Learning

Thus, established in patience, one should undertake vigor regarding learning.¹ Otherwise, learning itself becomes destruction for him.

As stated in the Candrapradīpasūtra:²

> *Though one comprehends many dharmas,*
> *if one does not guard morality, intoxicated by learning—*
> *he cannot be protected by much learning,*
> *the immorally-disciplined going to bad destinies.*

---

## Part II: Benefits of Learning

But the benefits of learning are stated in the Nārāyaṇaparipṛcchā:³

> "For thus, O sons of good family, for one with learning there is the attainment of wisdom. For one with wisdom there is the calming of afflictions. For one free from afflictions, Māra finds no opening."

---

## Part III: The Uttara Jātaka

And here, having done the jātaka of the great sage Uttara at length, He states:⁴

> "For those who desire the Dharma, O Vimalatejas, for bodhisattvas mahāsattvas with respect and confidence—even Buddhas, Blessed Ones established in other world-realms display their faces and cause them to hear the Dharma.
>
> For those who desire the Dharma, O Vimalatejas, for bodhisattvas mahāsattvas, **Dharma-treasures are deposited in mountain-caves and among trees**. Innumerable Dharma-gates are in books, come to hand.
>
> For those who desire the Dharma, O Vimalatejas, for bodhisattvas who have seen former Buddhas, **deities bring Buddha-inspiration**.
>
> For those whose lifespan is exhausted, **Buddhas, Blessed Ones and deities bring strength of life**. By Buddha-empowerment and deity-empowerment, when they desire it, they remain for a thousand years... up to a kalpa or remainder of a kalpa, as long as they desire.
>
> For those born with Dharma-respect, for bodhisattvas, **Buddhas, Blessed Ones remove even old age**. They remove illness. They bring memory. They bring movement, understanding, and eloquence. They remove views. They bring right view.
>
> By Dharma-respect, O Vimalatejas, for bodhisattvas mahāsattvas, **there is no fear of any harm**.
>
> Therefore, O Vimalatejas, a bodhisattva should be devoted to skill in the learning-accumulation."

## Part VI: What Should Be Studied

What should be heard?⁷ The Blessed One stated in the Jñānavaipulyasūtra:

> "Purposeful treatises should be studied. Purposeless ones should be avoided. Namely:
>
> - **Lokāyata treatises** (materialist philosophy)
> - **Daṇḍanīti treatises** (political treatises)
> - **Crow-[omen] treatises**
> - **Debate treatises** (sophistry)
> - **Child-play treatises**
> - **Jambhaka-lore treatises** (sorcery)
>
> And whatever other treatises are contrary to liberation—they all conduce to confusion—all those should be avoided by one set out in the bodhisattva-vehicle."

## Part VII: Resort to the Forest

Thus, one with learning should resort to the forest to purify the mind.⁸

But how is household life permitted in the Ugradattaparipṛcchā even for one endowed with intention? Due to inability even for one making effort.

But then, would there be no offense even regarding others' wives? No. For even in their inability, they are naturally corrupt; and household life is proclaimed to be with-fault (*prajñaptisāvadya*).

*Thus ends the Tenth Chapter, the Perfection of Vigor, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*
