# Chapter 4: Avoidance of Harm (Anarthavarjana)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

*The fourth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on the great harms enumerated in the sūtras—root offenses, karmic consequences, the dangers of sensual desire, and the rejection of true Dharma.*

---

## Introduction: The Great Harms

Other great harms also are stated in the sūtrāntas.¹

---

## Part I: The Root Offenses of Kings

As stated in the Ākāśagarbhasūtra:²

> "There are, O son of good family, these five root offenses (*mūlāpatti*) for a consecrated king (*kṣatriya mūrdhābhiṣikta*), by which root offenses the consecrated king destroys all previously planted roots of virtue, becomes fallen in [his] ground (*vastupatita*), defeated (*parājika*), bound for bad destinies in the sight of all gods and humans.
>
> **First Root Offense:** Whoever, O son of good family, steals stūpa-property, or that belonging to the Saṅgha, or that belonging to the Saṅgha of the Four Quarters, or that which has been donated—whether taking it himself or having it taken.
>
> **Second Root Offense:** Whoever, moreover, rejects the Dharma—whether spoken for the Śrāvaka vehicle, the Pratyekabuddha vehicle, or the Mahāyāna vehicle—rejects and repudiates it.
>
> **Third Root Offense:** Whoever, moreover, [attacks] one who has gone forth in my name, shaven-headed, wearing the dyed robe—whether observing the training or not, whether of bad conduct or virtuous—takes away his dyed robes, or causes them to be taken; or makes him a householder; or strikes his body with weapons; or casts him into prison; or deprives him of life.
>
> **Fourth Root Offense:** Whoever, moreover, a king, deliberately deprives his mother of life, or his father, or an arhat, or a Blessed One's disciple; or splits a harmonious Saṅgha; or, with malicious mind, deliberately sheds the blood of a Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyaksaṃbuddha. By any of these five immediate [heinous deeds], he produces one or another action.
>
> **Fifth Root Offense:** Whoever, moreover, a king, becomes a proponent of no-cause (*ahetuvādin*), disregards the other world, takes up the ten unwholesome paths of action and establishes himself in them, and establishes many other beings in the ten unwholesome paths of action, leads them, settles them, fixes them.
>
> **Sixth Root Offense:** (abbreviated) Whoever causes the breaking of villages, regions, cities, or kingdoms..."

---

## Part II: The Eight Root Offenses for Beginners

> "For beginner bodhisattvas (*ādikarmiṇa*) who have set out in the Mahāyāna, there are eight root offenses, by which root offenses, stumbling, the beginner bodhisattvas destroy all previously planted roots of virtue. Fallen in ground, defeated, fallen from the happiness of gods, humans, and the Mahāyāna, bound for bad destinies, they sink long in saṃsāra, bereft of spiritual friends.
>
> **First Root Offense for Beginners:** Those beings who, due to formerly performed bad actions, are reborn in this defiled world of five corruptions—they, having little roots of virtue, relying on a spiritual friend, hear this supremely profound Mahāyāna. Although of limited intelligence, they generate the thought [aimed at] supreme perfect enlightenment.
>
> To these beginners, certain bodhisattvas who hear this supremely profound sūtrānta connected with emptiness (*śūnyatāpratisaṃyukta*) proclaim it extensively, just as they heard it, just as they obtained it, with proper wording and meaning, to others of former understanding.
>
> But those who have not exerted themselves, those childish ordinary people, hearing it, become terrified, frightened, extremely frightened. Being frightened, they turn away, and having turned away from the thought [aimed at] supreme perfect enlightenment, they fix their minds on the Śrāvaka vehicle.
>
> This is the first root offense of the beginner bodhisattva, by which root offense that son of good family destroys all previously planted roots of virtue, fallen in ground, defeated, [fallen] from the happiness of heaven and liberation. His bodhicitta is deceived. He becomes bound for bad destinies.
>
> Therefore, by the bodhisattva mahāsattva, first having known the inclinations and latent tendencies of other persons, the Dharma should be taught gradually to beings according to their inclinations, just as one enters the great ocean gradually...
>
> **Second Root Offense:** Furthermore, a beginner bodhisattva says to someone: 'You are not capable of practicing in the six perfections. You are not capable of awakening to supreme perfect enlightenment. Quickly generate the thought [aimed at] the Śrāvaka vehicle or the Pratyekabuddha vehicle. By that you will escape from saṃsāra.'...
>
> **Third Root Offense:** Furthermore, a beginner bodhisattva says to someone: 'What is the use of the Prātimokṣa, of morality well-protected? Quickly generate the thought [aimed at] supreme perfect enlightenment. Study the Mahāyāna. Whatever unwholesome karma has been accumulated by your body, speech, and mind through the condition of afflictions—by that study there is purification without karmic ripening.'...
>
> **Fourth Root Offense:** Furthermore, a beginner bodhisattva says to some: 'Abandon the talk of the Śrāvaka vehicle. Do not hear it, do not study it, do not teach it to others. Conceal the Śrāvaka talk. You will not obtain great fruit from it. You are not capable of making an end of afflictions from it. Have faith in the Mahāyāna talk. Hear, study the Mahāyāna, and teach it to others. By that you will pacify all paths to bad destinies, and quickly awaken to supreme perfect enlightenment.' If they become doers of his words, they would grasp such a view. For both there is a root offense...
>
> **Fifth Root Offense:** Furthermore, beginner bodhisattvas become double-tongued. They display things otherwise. And they study, recite, retain, and teach this Mahāyāna for the sake of fame, reputation, honor, gain, and esteem. They teach to others only what they have merely heard. And they say: 'We are Mahāyānikasno others.' They envy others for the sake of gain and esteem... For the sake of jealousy, they proclaim themselves with higher human dharmas. Then by that ground, fallen, defeated, from the happiness of the Mahāyāna, they incur this great grave offense, by which they become bound for bad destinies...
>
> **Sixth Root Offense:** Furthermore, in the future, householders and renouncers, beginner bodhisattvas, [will come who take] those profound sūtrāntas connected with emptiness, adorned with dhāraṇī, patience, samādhi, and stages—the domain of bodhisattvas who are great learned men, who have exerted themselves—they will retain, study, recite [these sūtrāntas], and, having taught them extensively to others, will proclaim: 'I have awakened to these dharmas by my own understanding. And furthermore, out of compassion I teach them to you. You must practice in such a way that you will become a witness to these profound dharmas. Your knowledge and vision will be just like mine.' But he does not give thus. By mere study I teach such profound dharmas—not through direct realization. For the sake of gain and esteem he sells himself..."

## Part III: Remedy for Root Offenses

The escape from these [offenses] is stated in this same sūtra:³

> "If those bodhisattvas, having heard the name of the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha, should wish to see him, wishing to confess their root offenses from fear of falling into bad destinies—if they should bow to the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha and recite his name, that son of good family, according to his fortune, will stand before him in his own form, or in the form of a brahmin... or in the form of a girl he will stand before him.
>
> To that beginner bodhisattva he confesses those offenses as they have arisen. He displays the profound skillful means and the practice in the Mahāyāna. He establishes him on the irreversible stage...
>
> If he does not give him a face-to-face vision, then that beginner bodhisattva who is transgressed, rising in the last watch from his seat, standing facing east, should burn incense and invoke the god Aruṇa.
>
> And he should speak thus: 'Aruṇa, Aruṇa, O greatly compassionate, O greatly fortunate one, you who have risen high in Jambudvīpa—cover me with compassion! Quickly awaken the greatly compassionate Ākāśagarbha by my word! In my dream, display to me that means by which I may confess the offense, by which I may obtain skillful wisdom in the noble Mahāyāna.'
>
> At that time, he should go to sleep on his bed. At the very moment Aruṇa rises, here in Jambudvīpa the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha arrives, in his own form. Standing before that beginner bodhisattva in his dream, he confesses that root offense by the Mahāyāna means. And he displays to him such skillful knowledge that by that skillful means that beginner bodhisattva right there obtains the samādhi called 'non-confusion of bodhicitta,' and becomes firmly established in the Mahāyāna..."

## Part IV: Summary Verses on Root Offenses

For the sake of easy grasping and retention of these root offenses, and for the collection of those going together [in theme], summary verses are stated:⁴

> *From stealing from the Three Jewels, the offense of defeat is considered.*
> *From rejecting the true Dharma, the second is declared by the Sage.*
>
> *From stealing the robes of a monk, even of bad conduct, from striking,*
> *From casting into prison, from expelling [from the order]—*
>
> *From committing the five immediates, from grasping wrong view,*
> *Or from breaking villages and so forth—root offense is declared by the Victor.*
>
> *From teaching emptiness to beings of unprepared understanding,*
> *From turning those set out for Buddhahood away from enlightenment—*
>
> *From making them abandon the Prātimokṣa to engage in Mahāyāna,*
> *Or from grasping that the Disciple vehicle does not abandon desire and so forth—*
>
> *From others' grasping, or again from displaying one's own qualities,*
> *From disparaging others for the sake of gain, esteem, and reputation—*
>
> *From falsely saying 'I am one tolerant of the profound,' again,*
> *From having ascetics punished, or from giving from the Three Refuges—*
>
> *Or from taking what is being given, again from abandoning tranquility,*
> *From announcing to reciters the enjoyment of one in retreat—*
>
> *These root offenses are indeed causes of great hells.*
> *Before the noble Ākāśagarbha, standing in dream, they should be confessed.*
>
> *From abandoning bodhicitta, from not giving to a suppliant,*
> *From intense stinginess and greed, from striking beings out of anger—*
>
> *Though being entreated earnestly, one does not forbear toward beings,*
> *Or from following others out of affliction, from praising the semblance of true Dharma.*

---

## Part V: The Teaching on Harming Monastics

In the Āryakṣitigarbhasūtra it is also stated:⁵

> "That monk who has gone forth in my name, O great brahmin, who is of bad conduct and evil practice—whether a chaff-monk, impure, a non-ascetic with the profession of an ascetic, a non-celibate with the profession of a celibate—fallen, defeated, conquered by various afflictions—
>
> Yet even now that monk of bad conduct and evil practice is a displayer of spiritual friends, a treasure of merit, for all gods up to all humans. Even though he has become unworthy, yet by virtue of his shaven head and the donning of the dyed robe, by the mere seeing of his deportment, he becomes a propper of various roots of virtue for many beings, a shower of the path to good destinies.
>
> Therefore, for one who has gone forth in my name, whether virtuous or of bad conduct, I do not permit even wheel-turning kings—let alone by unjust means—to give a blow of punishment to the body of one gone forth in my name with a stick; or to cast him into prison; or to make a cutting or breaking of limbs; or to deprive him of life.
>
> Even though he is called 'dead' in this Dharma-Vinaya, yet that person is like yellow orpiment or musk..."

---

## Part VI: Karmic Consequences of the Ten Unwholesome Paths

The ten unwholesome paths of action are to be seen as harms with bitter ripening, from the Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna.⁶ A small portion of the sūtra is indicated:

### Killing

> "Just as there are birds called Fire-Crest-Walkers who dwell in the midst of flame-crests and are not burned, and, being excited, having broken the skulls of hell-beings, drink their blood. So also the birds called Skull-Interior-Walkers, having broken the head, drink the ignited brain-matter. So the birds called Tongue-Flesh-Eaters, having split the tongue, eat it on all sides. And that tongue, eaten, is born again, more tender than a lotus petal.
>
> Similarly [there are birds] called Tooth-Pullers, Throat-Pipe-Extractors, Lung-Eaters, Stomach-Contents-Eaters, Spleen-Turners, Intestine-Cavity-Gnawers, Spine-Walkers, and the birds called Marma-Seekers, who, having broken all the marma-cavities, having cut the marmas, entering the cavities, drink the marrow-essence of those crying out...
>
> Thus the place of Avīci [extends] 300,000 yojanas. This portion [of Avīci] is called 'Devoured by Birds.' There, with other hell-beings, for many hundreds of thousands of years, he is eaten and is [reborn] again.
>
> Somehow released from all that, wrapped in the net of suffering, he goes to the second place called 'Dog-Pit-Fall,' seeking protection, seeking refuge, seeking safety... Surrounded on all sides by eleven flame-masses, without companion, bound by the bonds of the karma-noose, surrounded on all sides by enemies, having entered a wilderness, having entered a calamity more than all the heaps of hell, he runs to that place called 'Dog-Pit-Fall.'
>
> When he falls, his foot melts utterly. Thrown up, he is reborn, more tender, more smooth. Overcome by harsh, intense feelings... For many hundreds of thousands of years, falling and being thrown up, [he is thus]... Eaten by vultures, crows, hawks, and owls...
>
> Somehow released from that... he runs to the place called 'Wheel-Mark-Cavity.' There, wheels with a thousand spokes appear, with diamond hubs, with sharp flames, spinning swiftly. Just as he arrives, those wheels, reaching his body, spin... burning, crushing each limb separately. And on the sole of his foot, stakes pierce him..."

### Stealing

> "That evil-action-doer, like a firebrand-circle, like a gandharva city, like a mirage, sees a great mass of wealth—jewels, clothes, grain, heaps. For him, overcome by greed, deluded by karma, the thought arises: 'This is mine.' Thus deluded, that evil-doer, having leapt across burning coal-pits, runs after that treasure. He is seized by karma-created Yama-men. Entering the midst of a weapon-net, he is split limb by limb, quartered, burned, reduced to bones. And even in that state, his greed, operating since beginningless time, does not diminish..."

### Sexual Misconduct

> "That evil-doer, somehow released from the weapon-crisis, somehow having leapt across the coal-pits, deluded by karma, reaches another place called 'False Vision.' There he sees a karma-created woman, whom he saw before when his memory was lost. Having seen her, the fire of desire, practiced since beginningless time, arises. He runs toward those women. And those women are made of iron, karma-created. By them he is seized. Having seized him, from lips onward he is so consumed that not even a mustard-seed measure remains of his body. He is reborn again, consumed again...
>
> Yet from that craving-fire he does not turn back. He rushes again toward those women... Then those women, with blazing iron-vajra bodies, taking that man, with bodies full of flame-garlands, grind that hell-being like a fistful of sand. He is reborn again..."

> *Women are the root of bad destinies, of the destruction of wealth in every way.*
> *Those men who are subject to women—how can there be happiness for them?*
>
> *Woman is destruction among destructions, in this world and the next.*
> *Therefore, women should be avoided if one wishes happiness for oneself.*

### Lying

> "He is seized by those Yama-men. Having seized him, they split open that mouth, extract the tongue. And that tongue, by the force of karma, becomes 500 yojanas in measure. At the time of its coming forth, those Yama-men throw him onto a burning iron ground. And 1,000 burning ploughs with blazing tips appear, karma-created. Powerful bullocks carry those ploughs on his tongue, entering into it. There rivers of pus, blood, and worms flow..."

### Slander

> "Just as for lying, with this difference: the tongue is 300 yojanas. Those Yama-men, taking sharp blazing swords, cut the tongue. In another place he is eaten by jackals. He experiences extremely bitter feeling. He cries out, screams, [makes] inarticulate sounds, being without a tongue..."

### Harsh Speech

> "They seize that tongue. Having split open the mouth, they take it. Having cut it with sharp-edged weapons, they throw it into his own mouth for food. And he, tormented by hunger, with face emaciated by hunger, eats that very tongue of his, smeared with his own blood and saliva. And that tongue, cut, is reborn again by the force of karma...
>
> The Yama-men speak an instructive verse:
>
> *'From the bow of the tongue, a sharp arrow of words by you*
> *Was seen as "harsh speech"—this is the fruit that has come.'"

### Idle Chatter

> "That burning copper-liquid, licking the tongue, burns it. Having burned the tongue, it burns the throat. Having burned the throat, it burns the heart. Having burned the heart, it burns the intestines. Having burned them, it burns the stomach. Having also burned the stomach, it exits from below.
>
> The Yama-men speak a verse:
>
> *'Unconnected words before and after, meaningless, incoherent,*
> *Unbound—what was spoken by you—this is the fruit that has come.*
>
> *That which is never truly speaking, which is not devoted to study—*
> *That is not seen as a tongue by the wise, but merely a lump of flesh.'"

## Part VII: The Dangers of Sensual Desire

All harms have sensual desire as their root; therefore, one should feel disgust toward them.⁷ As stated here:

> "There is, they say, a hell called Fire-Pit. By what karma do beings take rebirth there? By one who is a non-ascetic with the profession of an ascetic, who, having heard the sounds of women's dancing and singing, or of ornaments, with improper attention, with distracted mind, hearing it, has ejaculated impurity laughing, playing, sporting...
>
> There those hell-beings are crushed limb by limb by iron rain, and by coal rain they are cooked, burned...
>
> Thus, from the memory of savoring past sensual pleasures, the hell called Paduma is taught; from the memory of one's own past [pleasures]. There those hell-beings are cooked in cauldrons. They are beaten in troughs with iron pestles..."

---

## Part VIII: The Seven Kinds of Sexual Union

In the Saptamaithunsaṃyuktasūtra it is also stated:⁸

> "Here, O brahmin, a certain one professes himself to be a celibate. He does not engage in intercourse with a woman here. But gazing upon a woman's form with his eye, he sees it, savors it, becomes attached to it, and so remains. This, O brahmin, is called a celibate joined with the dharma of sexual union, not separated.
>
> Similarly, regarding playing, sporting, laughing with a woman—savoring [this], he practices impure celibacy.
>
> Similarly, regarding savoring the private parts of a woman...
>
> Similarly, for one behind a wall or behind a cloth, savoring the sounds of a woman's dancing, singing, and so forth—[this is] joining with sexual union.
>
> Similarly, savoring another's [woman] endowed with the five strands of sensuality...
>
> Similarly, from dedicating celibacy to [rebirth in] a god-realm and so forth—joined with the dharma of sexual union, not separated..."

---

## Part IX: The Kāma-Rejection Teaching

Because these sensual pleasures, even when gone to the domain of memory and aspiration, cause such harm, it is stated in the Kāmāpavādakasūtra:⁹

> "Restrain your mind from sensual pleasures, O monk! This path is fearful, dangerous, thorny, dense, a wrong path, a bad path, a path of feeling, frequented by bad men. This path is not frequented by good men.
>
> Do you not think thus: 'Why are sensual pleasures said by the Blessed One to be of little savor, of much suffering, much affliction, much trouble?' The danger here is greater.
>
> Sensual pleasures, O monks, are a disease, a boil, a dart, a misfortune, the root of misfortune, bait on a fishhook, death. Sensual pleasures are impermanent, empty, of the nature of deceiving falsehood, dream-like. Such are sensual pleasures—merely the prattle of fools...
>
> Just as a trap for deer, just as a net for birds, just as a copper pot for fish, just as glue for monkeys, just as a mass of fire for moths—so are sensual pleasures...
>
> For one going about in the pursuit of sensual pleasures, being turned about in the mouth of lions for a long night—there is no end known. Being turned about in the mouth of slaughterers, cow-eaters—there is no end known. Being turned about in the mouth of frogs and snakes—there is no end known.
>
> Of those long pursuing sensual pleasures, seized as thieves, beheaded—there is no end known. Adulterers, fence-breakers, village-destroyers, region-destroyers... knot-looseners, seized, beheaded—there is no end known.
>
> Suffering—intense, harsh, bitter—has been experienced. Blood has flowed, gushed forth, which is more than the water in the four great oceans...
>
> For this body is of much danger, a collection of bones, bound by sinews, smeared with flesh, wrapped in skin, covered by hide, full of holes, inhabited by hosts of worms, useless for beings, a basis for afflictions and karma...
>
> What is your peace regarding sensual pleasures, O monk? What seduces you? How are you led, infatuated, attached, having attained attachment? When I am fully nirvāṇa-ed, and the true Dharma has disappeared, and you, having pursued sensual pleasures, have gone to ruin—when will you liberate yourself from old age and death?
>
> Enough, O monk! Restrain your mind from sensual pleasures! This is not the time for the pursuit of sensual pleasures. This is the time for the pursuit of Dharma."

---

## Part X: The Harm of Obstructing Bodhisattvas

Another harm is stated in the Praśāntaviniścayaprātihāryasūtra:¹⁰

> "Whoever, O Mañjuśrī, whether son of good family or daughter of good family, should deprive all beings of Jambudvīpa of life and take all their property—or whoever else, O Mañjuśrī, should create an obstacle for even one wholesome thought of a bodhisattva, even for [a being in] animal birth, even for one root of virtue accompanied by a single mouthful of food—this one produces incomparably more evil.
>
> Why is that? He becomes an obstructor of roots of virtue that generate the arising of Buddhas.
>
> Whoever, O Mañjuśrī, should create jealousy and stinginess toward a bodhisattva in other families—for him, at that time, from that very cause, three fears are to be expected: fear of rebirth in hell, fear of birth blind, fear of rebirth in border regions..."

> *"With a great self-body, in the hells, that evil-minded one,*
> *Ruined in self, is reborn; he experiences painful feeling.*
>
> *500 yojanas is his height when born.*
> *Surrounded by krores, he is eaten constantly by dogs.*
>
> *5,000 heads are born to this slanderer.*
> *And 500 tongues are born on each head.*
>
> *On each tongue, 500 flame-mouthed [devices]*
> *Carry ploughs for him, having spoken evil speech.*
>
> *In Pratāpana [hell] they are cooked, in intense suffering and fire,*
> *Those who create oppression for bodhisattvas, the unassociated.*
>
> *Animal birth with hell—for them it is not hard to obtain!*
> *For 100,000 koṭis of kalpas, hundreds and niyutas—*
>
> *Fallen from there, they become snakes of fierce poison, terrifying.*
> *Overcome by hunger and thirst, they do dreadful deeds.*
>
> *Having obtained even food and drink, they never attain satisfaction.*
>
> *Fallen from there, if reborn among humans,*
> *Born blind, of poor understanding, of evil mind, unrestrained.*
>
> *Having spoken words displeasing and harsh to the noble ones,*
> *Fallen from humans also, again he goes to bad destinies.*
>
> *For 100,000 koṭis of kalpas, born, he does not see the Buddha."*

---

## Part XI: Merit of Protecting Bodhisattvas

The ripening of honoring [bodhisattvas] is stated in the Praśāntaviniścayaprātihāryasūtra:¹¹

> *"Whoever creates righteous protection for these speakers of Dharma,*
> *Abandoning all bad destinies, he becomes Śakra, king of gods.*
>
> *Brahmā too, [lord of] Yāma, Tuṣita, and Vaśavartī, again and again.*
>
> *Reborn among humans, he is born a wheel-turning [monarch].*
> *A merchant, a householder too, he becomes wealthy, of great wealth.*
>
> *Endowed with wisdom and memory, happy, free from affliction."*

---

## Part XII: The Śūraṅgamasamādhi Teaching

As stated in the Śūraṅgamasamādhisūtra:¹²

> "What, O Dṛḍhamati, is the prediction of one whose bodhicitta has not been generated?
>
> Here, O Dṛḍhamati, that person is reborn in the five-fold saṃsāra—whether in hells, in animal birth, in the world of Yama, among gods, or among humans. And that person is of sharp faculties, of exalted aspiration.
>
> The Tathāgata knows him: 'This man-person, after so-many 100,000 niyutas of kalpa-koṭis, will generate the thought [aimed at] supreme perfect enlightenment. And after so-many 100,000 asaṃkhyeya kalpas, he will awaken to enlightenment.' This, O Dṛḍhamati, is called the prediction of the bodhisattva whose bodhicitta has not been generated.
>
> Then the venerable Mahākāśyapa said to the Blessed One: 'From today onward, O Blessed One, we should generate the perception of Teacher toward all beings. Why is that? For this knowledge does not operate for us: which bodhisattva has faculties that ripen enlightenment? Which does not? Therefore, O Blessed One, not knowing, we might generate the perception of [them being] inferior toward such persons. By that we would be destroyed.'
>
> The Blessed One said: 'Well said, well said, Kāśyapa! This word of yours is well-spoken. And seeing this very point, Kāśyapa, this Dharma has been taught by me to you: O monks, a person should not discriminate through another person. For a person discriminating through a person is quickly destroyed. Either I would discriminate a person, or one who would be like me.
>
> By this teaching, Kāśyapa, by a bodhisattva or a śrāvaka, the perception of Teacher should be generated toward all beings... For there might be some person of the bodhisattva vehicle. Therefore, the self should be protected in that matter.' And [toward one] who certainly has the mark of attaining enlightenment, all the more should disdain be guarded against."

---

## Part XIII: The Dharma-Rejection Teaching

Another harm is stated in the Āryasarvadharmavaipulyasaṃgrahasūtra:¹³

> "Subtle, O Mañjuśrī, is the karma-obstruction of rejecting the true Dharma.
>
> Whoever, O Mañjuśrī, in a dharma spoken by the Tathāgata, makes the perception 'this is beautiful' for some, and 'this is not beautiful' for some—he rejects the true Dharma. By him rejecting the true Dharma, the Tathāgata is falsely accused, the Dharma is rejected, the Saṅgha is slandered.
>
> One who says 'this is proper, this is improper'—he rejects the true Dharma...
>
> I have not taught any separate dharma—whether connected with the Śrāvaka vehicle, the Pratyekabuddha vehicle, or the Mahāyāna. Those confused men will make this dharma of mine diverse: 'This was taught for Śrāvakas, this for Pratyekabuddhas, this for bodhisattvas.'
>
> By the perception of diversity, he rejects the true Dharma—'this is the training of the bodhisattva, this is not the training of the bodhisattva'—thus he rejects the true Dharma.
>
> 'The Dharma-preacher has eloquence; he has no eloquence'—thus he rejects the true Dharma.
>
> He speaks the Dharma in terms of [mere] dharma—thus he rejects the true Dharma.
>
> 'When the arising of a Buddha has passed, there is no obtaining of dhāraṇī'—thus he rejects the Dharma.
>
> 'There is no obtaining of dhāraṇī for the Dharma-preacher'—thus he rejects the Dharma.
>
> He finds fault with the practice of the Dharma-preacher—'the Dharma-preacher is not accomplished in practice'—thus he rejects the Dharma.
>
> He accuses him through heedlessness, through deportment, through conduct with letters, through moral failure—thus he rejects the Dharma...
>
> Whoever, O Mañjuśrī, whether monk, nun, layman, or laywoman, thinks 'this is the form of the Dharma-preacher,' speaks it—all of these reject the true Dharma..."

*Thus ends the Fourth Chapter, Avoidance of Harm, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*

## Soul-Check Hints for Blues Version

- **Root offenses are specific and enumerated**—kings and beginners have different lists
- **The hell descriptions are graphic and detailed**—Fire-Crest birds, Skull-Interior birds, tongue-extraction
- **Sensual desire is the root of all harms**—the extended kāma-rejection passages are central
- **Even disdaining a future bodhisattva is catastrophic**—treat all as potential teachers
- **Dharma-rejection is subtle**—saying "this teaching is good, that is bad" is rejection
