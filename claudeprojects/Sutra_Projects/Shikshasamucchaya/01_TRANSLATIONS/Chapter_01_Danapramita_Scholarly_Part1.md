> **yadi matsamadhātureva paśyed**
> **aparo'pyenamato'pi sārthako'yam ||7||**

> **yadi nātra vicintyate hitaṃ**
> **punarapyeṣa samāgamaḥ kutaḥ ||8||**

*This endowment of favorable circumstances¹⁵ is extremely difficult to obtain, [yet] it has been obtained—it accomplishes the goal of human life. If one does not reflect upon what is beneficial here [and now], from where will such an opportunity come again?*

## The Rarity of Human Birth: Quotation from Gaṇḍavyūhasūtra

As stated in the Āryagaṇḍavyūhasūtra,¹⁶ in the Liberation [chapter on] Āryajayoṣmāyatana:¹⁷

> *"Rare is the cessation of the eight unfavorable conditions.¹⁸ Rare is obtaining a human body. Rare is the purity of favorable circumstances. Rare is the arising of a Buddha. Rare is the possession of complete sense faculties. Rare is hearing the Buddha-dharma. Rare is association with good persons.*
> 
> *Rare are genuine spiritual friends. Rare is proper instruction in the true method. Rare is right livelihood. Rare is compatible effort in the true Dharma in the human world."*

## Footnotes

¹ **[Sanskrit]** *yasya*: Relative pronoun genitive, "that [teaching] of which..." The relative-correlative structure (*yasya...tat*) is characteristic of Sanskrit philosophical verse.

² **[Sanskrit]** *āśraveṇa*: Instrumental of *āśrava* (hearing). "Through the hearing of which"—the teaching is efficacious *through being heard*.

³ **[Sanskrit]** *mahāpratāpa-dāha*: "Great fierceness-burning"—the intense heat of hell realms.

⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *abhūt*: "Becomes non-existent" (√bhū with negation via sandhi). The suffering *ceases* through hearing the teaching.

⁵ **[Meter]** This and the following verses are in *śārdūlavikrīḍita* meter (19 syllables per quarter), more elaborate than the *anuṣṭubh* typical of Buddhist śāstras. **[Grammar]** *bhajadhvam* is 2nd person plural imperative—a direct command to the assembly.

³ **[Sanskrit]** *anuddhatātmā*: "one whose self is not arrogant/agitated." Compound of *an-uddhata* + *ātman*.

⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *saṃbodhisattvasukham*: The happiness of perfect awakening. *Saṃbodhi* = complete enlightenment.

⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *labdhakṣaṇāḥ*: "having obtained the [opportune] moment." *Kṣaṇa* here refers to the precious human rebirth with all its conditions.

⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *nāga*: Serpent-beings of the underworld/water realm, often protectors of Dharma.

⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *tribhuvana*: The three worlds—desire realm, form realm, formless realm; or alternatively earth, heaven, and the underworld.

⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *sugata*: "Well-Gone One," an epithet of Buddha. From *su-* (well) + *gata* (gone).

⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *sasutān*: "together with [their] sons." The *suta*/*putra* (children/sons) are the bodhisattvas.

¹⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *dharmakāya*: The "Dharma-body," the ultimate truth-body of Buddha, identical with reality itself.

¹¹ **[Sanskrit]** *sugatātmajasaṃvara*: The discipline (*saṃvara*) of the offspring (*ātmaja*) of the Sugata—i.e., bodhisattva vows.

¹² **[Cross-ref]** This verse parallels Bodhicaryāvatāra 1.2 almost exactly, showing the texts' close relationship.

¹³ **[Philosophical]** Śāntideva's characteristic humility—he claims no originality but presents the teaching for his own practice.

¹⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *prasādavega*: "impetus/momentum of faith." *Prasāda* = clarity, serenity, faith.

¹⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *kṣaṇasaṃpad*: "endowment of the [opportune] moment"—the 18 conditions for a precious human rebirth.

¹⁶ **[Source]** *Āryagaṇḍavyūhasūtra*: The "Flower Ornament Sūtra" (Avataṃsaka), one of the most extensive Mahāyāna sūtras.

¹⁷ **[Source]** The *Jayoṣmāyatanavimokṣa* is a liberation chapter within the Gaṇḍavyūha describing the spiritual attainments of a teacher named Jayoṣmāyatana.

¹⁸ **[Philosophical]** *aṣṭākṣaṇa*: The eight unfavorable conditions that prevent Dharma practice: (1) hell, (2) hungry ghost realm, (3) animal realm, (4) long-lived gods, (5) barbarian lands, (6) wrong views, (7) Buddha-less eon, (8) defective sense faculties.

## Soul-Check Hints for Blues Version

- The opening is an *invitation*—call-and-response energy
- Verse 6's humility: "I ain't saying nothing new, just trying to fix my own heart"
- Verse 8's urgency: "This chance don't come twice"
- The Gaṇḍavyūha quotation is a *litany of rarities*—could be treated as congregational testimony
