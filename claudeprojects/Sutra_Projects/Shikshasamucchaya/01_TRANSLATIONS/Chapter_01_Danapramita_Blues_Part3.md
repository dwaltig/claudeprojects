## Mañjuśrī's Testimony

Now listen to how the great Mañjuśrī—back when he was just starting out—made his vows in front of the Lord.¹ This is the testimony we follow:

---

### The Endless Road

> *"For as long as saṃsāra keeps rolling*
> *without end—ten million eons and more—*
> *that's how long I'll walk this road*
> *for the good of every being."*

That's the first word: *I'm in this for the long haul.*

---

### The Invitation

> *"I raise up the waking-up mind*
> *right here, in front of the Protector.*
> *I'm inviting the whole world:*
> *I'm gonna set you free from poverty."*²

That's the promise: *Everybody's invited to this liberation.*

---

### The Vow of Purity

> *"Ill-will, a hardened heart,*
> *jealousy, stinginess—*
> *from today on, I won't make them,*
> *not till I reach awakening.*
> *I'll walk the holy life.*
> *I'll let go of evil desires."*

That's the discipline: *I'm cleaning up my act.*

---

### The Patient Road

> *"I'll train after the Buddhas*
> *in the restraint of good conduct.*
> *I ain't in a hurry to get enlightened—*
> *I'm willing to wait."*³

That's humility: *This ain't about me getting mine quick.*

---

### For Even One

> *"I'll stand here till the end of time*
> *for the sake of even one being.*
> *I'll purify my buddha-field—*
> *immeasurable, inconceivable."*

That's commitment: *Even one soul is worth everything.*

---

### The Famous Name

> *"I'll make my name known*
> *in all ten directions.*
> *I'll purify my body-action completely.*
> *I'll purify my speech-action.*
> *I'll purify my mind-action.*
> *I won't do evil deeds."*

That's integrity: *Inside and out, I'm getting right.*

---

## The Heart of It All: Kārikās 3 and 4

Now here's the thing, church—Śāntideva says the full training is so vast it can't be told in infinite eons. But if you want the *essence*, the *vital points* that keep you clean, here it is:⁴

### The Summary (Kārikā 4)

> **Give yourself away.**
> **Give your enjoyments away.**
> **Give your merit away—past, present, and future.**
> **Give it all to every being.**
> **Then protect that gift. Purify it. Make it grow.**

That's it. That's the whole bodhisattva vow in four lines.⁵

## What's Given vs. What's Kept

The old Ugradatta teaching lays it out like this:⁶

| What's Given | What's Kept |
|:------------|:------------|
| Don't need to protect it | Got to guard it |
| Exhausts craving | Feeds craving |
| No grasping | Full of grasping |
| No fear | Full of fear |
| Supports the path | Supports Māra |
| Never perishes | Rots away |
| Brings happiness | Brings suffering |
| Drops afflictions | Grows afflictions |
| Deed of the good | Deed of the foolish |
| Praised by all Buddhas | Praised by fools |

You see the pattern? Everything you hold onto holds you back. Everything you give breaks you free.

---

## The Medicine Tree

Now here's the most powerful teaching in the whole chapter.⁷

The Nārāyaṇa scripture says the bodhisattva should think like this:

> *"This body of mine? It's already given away.*
> *It belongs to all beings—how much more my stuff!"*

And then—this is the hard part—

> *"To those who need a hand, I give my hand.*
> *To those who need a foot, I give my foot.*
> *To those who need an eye, I give my eye.*
> *Flesh to those who need flesh.*
> *Blood to those who need blood.*
> *Marrow. Limbs. Even my head."*

---

### The Tree That Heals

The teaching goes on:

> *"Think of a medicine tree.⁸*
> *When people come and take from it—*
> *root, trunk, branch, bark, leaf, flower, fruit, sap—*
> *the tree don't complain. It don't discriminate.*
> *It just heals whoever comes.*
> *Low, middling, or high—all get healed.*
>
> *That's what the bodhisattva body is:*
> *medicine for the world.*
> *Whoever needs whatever—take it.*
> *Hand, foot, eye, flesh, blood, bone—*
> *it's all here for you."*

That's radical generosity. Not "what can I spare?" but "take what you need from me."

## The Five Immediacies

Mañjuśrī also taught the **five things that lead straight to awakening**:⁹

1. **Hold the waking-up mind** and don't slip back to just saving yourself.
2. **Give everything away** and don't let stinginess creep back in.
3. **Commit to protecting all beings** and don't get tired and sit down.
4. **See all things as unarisen and unceasing** and don't fall into wrong views.
5. **Aim for one-moment wisdom** and don't stop or quit until you reach omniscience.

Those who keep these five? They wake up *quick*.

---

## The Great Exchange

Now here's the thing about giving:

The scriptures say that even one thought of bodhicitta—aimed at rescuing all beings, liberating all beings, consoling all beings, bringing all beings to nirvāṇa—produces *immeasurable, incalculable* merit.

How much more when you actually *live* it?

And here's the paradox:¹⁰ By giving away everything—even your own body—you become like a hook with bait, drawing beings to liberation. You don't even get to enjoy what you give. You just... *give*.

And in that giving, you *are* liberated.

---

## The Final Word

The Ratnamegha puts it plain:¹¹

> **"For the bodhisattva, giving IS awakening."**

Not "giving leads to awakening." Not "giving prepares you for awakening."

*Giving IS awakening.*

The act of opening your hand, your heart, your whole self—that's it. That's the path and the goal in one.

---

*Thus ends the First Chapter: The Road of Generosity.*

## Endnotes

¹ **Mañjuśrī's vows**: These are quoted from the *Mañjuśrībudddhakṣetraguṇavyūhālaṃkārasūtra*, Mañjuśrī's original bodhisattva commitment.

² **"set you free from poverty"**: Sanskrit *dāridrya*—not just material poverty, but the poverty of saṃsāra, the lack of awakening.

³ **"I ain't in a hurry"**: Mañjuśrī vows to train forever, not rushing to personal liberation while beings suffer.

⁴ **"the vital points"**: Sanskrit *marmasthāna*—the essential summary. Kārikā 3 asks for this; kārikā 4 provides it.

⁵ **Kārikā 4**: This is the heart of the Śikṣāsamuccaya—the three-fold giving (self, enjoyments, merit) plus the three-fold cultivation (protect, purify, increase).

⁶ **Ugradatta teaching**: The *Ugradattaparipṛcchā* provides this classic contrast between giving and keeping.

⁷ **"the most powerful teaching"**: The body-offering passages from the *Nārāyaṇaparipṛcchā* represent the radical extreme of dānapāramitā.

⁸ **"medicine tree"**: Sanskrit *bhaiṣajyavṛkṣa*—the image of the bodhisattva as a tree that heals all without discrimination is one of Buddhist literature's most striking metaphors.

⁹ **Five immediacies**: Sanskrit *ānantarya*—usually this term refers to the five evil acts leading to immediate hell. Here Mañjuśrī inverts it: five commitments that lead *immediately* to awakening.

¹⁰ **"the paradox"**: The bodhisattva gives everything away—even the merit of giving—and thereby becomes free. Not by getting, but by releasing.

¹¹ **"giving IS awakening"**: *dānaṃ hi bodhisattvasya bodhiḥ*—this is the summary of Chapter 1.

## Theological Notes

- **Radical Self-Offering**: The body-offering passages are not metaphor—they describe the bodhisattva ideal literally. This is the extreme edge of generosity, giving what we most cling to.

- **The Medicine Tree as Blues Ancestor**: In African-American spirituality, the church itself is a "medicine tree"—the congregation gives of itself to heal whoever comes. The bodhisattva operates the same way.

- **Giving as Identity**: The final statement—"giving IS awakening"—collapses the means/end distinction. For the bodhisattva, the practice is the goal. Walking the road IS arriving.

- **Blues Economics**: "What's given vs. what's kept" is pure Blues wisdom. The blues tradition knows: what you hold onto owns you. Let it go and you're free.
