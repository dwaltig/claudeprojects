# Chapter 11: The Woodshed (Araṇyasaṃśraya)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig

---

*The eleventh chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on the necessity of leaving the City of Noise, facing the Hellhounds, and finding the place where the body ain't got no landlord.*

---


## Leave the Burning House

You heard the teaching.¹ You seen the faults of that householder life—that **City of Noise**. You know it's a trap.

So now you gotta go. You gotta take your heavy heart to **The Woodshed**—the quiet place—to scrub it clean.

The Moon-Lamp Sūtra² sings it like this:

> *"As long as you chasing comfort,*
> *craving for wife and child,*
> *dwelling in that house so despicable—*
> *you ain't never gonna touch the High Note.*
>
> *But them that leave desire like a pit of fire,*
> *walking out on family and home,*
> *terrified of the burning—*
> *for them, the Supreme Awakening ain't hard to find.*
>
> *Ain't never been a Buddha in the past,*
> *ain't never gonna be one in the future,*
> *who stayed sitting on the porch*
> *and got enlightened.*
>
> *Leave the kingdom like you spitting out phlegm.*
> *Go to the Woodshed.*
> *Crush your pride. Break the chains.*
> *Wake up spotless."*

## The Jina Don't Need No Room Service

Listen now:

> *"The best of men—the Conquerors—*
> *they don't get served fine food and perfume*
> *like they did back home.*
> *They get served by the Truth.*
>
> *So if you tired of this fake world,*
> *if you weary of the constructions,*
> *take **seven steps** toward the forest.*
> *Even that walk makes you a king."*

---

## Don't Argue with Fools

Now, maybe you thinking: "I'll stay a little longer. For my friends. For the crowd. For the money."

Don't do it. The Book says:

> *"A wise man don't argue with a fool.*
> *He honors him—then he walks away.*
>
> *You can serve a fool forever,*
> *but turn your back and he's your enemy.*
> *The wise man knows the fool's nature:*
> *broken.*
>
> *Where can you find a friend in the crowd?*
> *You speak truth, they get angry.*
> *You speak righteousness, they get hateful.*
> *A pure heart knows: don't trust the fool.*
>
> *Fools mix with fools—like dirt with dirt.*
> *Wise mix with wise—like cream with cream."*

## Walk That Lonesome Road

So who's happy? I'll tell you who's happy.

> *"Happy is the one with no beloved anywhere.*
> *Happy is the one with no enemy anywhere.*
>
> *Those who don't love the cave*
> *miss the great joy of the wandering life.*
>
> *No 'mine' anywhere.*
> *No dragging weight at all.*
>
> *They wander the world **like a rhinoceros**—³*
> *just like the wind wanders in the sky.*
>
> *Happy is the man whose mind don't stick.*
> *Like the wind—passing through, never holding on.*
> *Beloved? Unloved? Don't mean a thing."*

---

## The Benefits of the Quiet

> *"Yoked to few duties.*
> *Yoked to the yoke.*
> *No disputes. No noise.*
> *Restrained in speech, restrained in mind.*
>
> *Weary of everything made and built.*
> *No desire anywhere in the world.*
> *No flowing-in of trouble.*
>
> *Liberation comes easy in the Woodshed.*
> *The peace settles deep.*
> *All these qualities belong to the lonesome traveler."*

---

## Like a Rhinoceros (The Refrain)

He says it again. Listen to the beat:

> *"Go to the thickets. Stay hidden.*
> *Forget the village. Forget the town.*
> *Be without a second.*
> *Always.*
> **Like a rhinoceros.**
> *Before long, you'll hit the Supreme Note."*

And the Rāṣṭrapāla Sūtra picks up the chorus:⁴

> *"Walking out on the infinite faults of home,*
> *regardless of worry,*
> *finding joy in the wild,*
> *peaceful senses, gentle heart.*
>
> *No woman, no man found there.*
> *Walking alone—**ekākī**—like a rhinoceros.*
> *Pure intention. Stainless.*
>
> *Gain don't thrill him.*
> *Loss don't scare him.*
> *Few desires. Satisfactions.*
> *No deceit. No mask."*

## Don't Die of Thirst in the Water

Now listen close. Just knowing the words ain't enough.

If a learned man, holding this precious moment, still clings to money and fame... if he don't clean his mind... oh, the tragedy!

The Ratnakūṭa Sūtra lays down the saddest blues of all:⁵

> *"It's like a man being carried away by a Great Flood.*
> *Water everywhere.*
> *But he dies of thirst.*
>
> *Just so, Kāśyapa—*
> *some folks learn all the Dharmas.*
> *They talk the talk.*
> *But they don't drop the thirst for passion.*
> *They don't drop the thirst for hate.*
> *They don't drop the thirst for delusion.*
>
> *Carried away by the Great Flood of Dharma—*
> *they die of the thirst for defilements.*
> *And down they go."*

Water everywhere, and not a drop to drink. Don't be that man.

## How to Live in the Woodshed

So you go to the forest. Find a place with clear water, fruit trees, caves.

And there, you recite. Three times a night, three times a day.
Not too loud. Not too soft.
Not excited. Not scattered.
Living on faith. Holding the text. Driving away sleep.

If a king comes? Or a minister?
Welcome him. Sit if he sits.
"You're lucky, King. Virtuous folks live in your land."

If he's steady? Teach him the Dharma.
If he's bored? Shock him with *agitation* (saṃvega).
If even that don't work? Tell him about the Buddha's glory.

But don't rely on him. Don't become his servant. You ain't there to wait tables.

The Ugradatta asks: "Why did I come to this forest?"

It ain't just to watch the deer. Thieves live in the forest too. Monkeys live there. That don't make 'em holy.

No. I came because I was **terrified**.⁶

I got the hellhounds on my trail.
"Fear of what?" you ask.

I was scared of **Society** (*saṃgaṇikā*).
I was scared of that **Connection**.
I was scared of Lust, Hate, and Delusion.
I was scared of Pride, the Big Head.
I was scared of Greed, the Tight Fist.
I was scared of Form, Sound, Taste, and Touch.

I was scared of "I-making" and "Mine-making."
I was scared of the **Māra of the Aggregates**.
I was scared of the **Māra of Death**.

I was scared of seeing Permanent in the Impermanent.
Self in the No-Self.
Happiness in Suffering.

I was scared of my own Mind.
I was scared of Gain and Honor.
I was scared of Bad Friends.
I was scared of untimely words.

I was scared of the "Seen" in the unseen.
I was scared of Hell.
I was scared of the Animal life.

Terrified by these fears—shaking like a leaf—I ran to the Woodshed.

---

## The Antidote: No Self

But here's the turn. Here's where the music changes key.

> *"Whatever fears arise, they all come from grasping at a Self (*ātmagrāha*)."*

If I sit in the woods holding onto "Me" and "Mine"—my forest dwelling means nothing.
There ain't no forest dwelling for a man who perceives a Self.

**Forest dwelling is the dwelling of No-Arising.**

---

## Be Like the Grass

Look at the grass. Look at the trees.
They don't fear. They don't tremble.
Why? Because they got no "Mine."

You gotta make your body like that grass. Like a wall. Like an illusion.

> *"Who fears here? Who trembles?*
> *This body? It ain't got no soul. It ain't got no person.*
> *This fear? It's just a false imagination.*
> *I won't imagine it."*

Just as the trees accept the rain and the sun without owning them...
**Forest dwelling is the Cutting of Conflict (*raṇaccheda*).**

---


## Radical Generosity

But what if the beasts come? What if the tigers come?⁷

The Ratnarāśi Sūtra says: Don't panic.
Think like this:

> *"Man, I already gave this body up a long time ago.*
> *I came here to lose myself.*
> *So I ain't gonna be afraid.*
>
> *I'll send 'em loving-kindness.*
> *But if they eat me anyway?*
> *Use me up.*
>
> *My gains are easily obtained.*
> *They take the essence-less part (the meat).*
> *I get the Essence (the Merit).*
>
> *I can't satisfy 'em with Dharma.*
> *So let 'em be satisfied with flesh.*
> *Let 'em have a good meal."*

That's the deal. They get a meal. I get free.

---

## Dealing with Spirits

If non-human spirits come? Don't be drawn in. Don't be pushed away.

If ancient deities come asking questions? Teach 'em what you know.
If they ask deep stuff you don't know? Don't fake it. Don't shame yourself.

Just say: "I'm still working on it. I'm striving. One day I'll know. Meanwhile, you listen to the intention."

---


## The Ownerless House

Finally, take a look at the woods again.⁸

The grass, the shrubs, the trees.
Who owns 'em? **Nobody.** (*asvāmika*)
Who claims 'em? **Nobody.**
Who makes 'em grow or stop? **Nobody.**

They just arise from conditions. Cause and effect. No boss.

> *"So too this body.*
> *It's like an apparition of sticks and walls.*
> *Ownerless.*
> *Without a 'Mine'.*
> *Without a Controller.*
> *Motionless. Inactive.*
>
> *It rises by causes. It stops by causes.*
> *But ultimately?*
> *No dharma ever rises or ceases."*

That's the heavy truth. The Old Willow don't pay rent. The River don't pay rent.
And this body? It ain't got no Landlord.

## The Witnesses

But don't think you're alone in a bad way.
"I got no companion to judge me," you think.

Wrong.
The Buddhas know. The Deities know. The Spirits know.
**They are my Witnesses.** (*sākṣiṇaḥ*)

If I dwell here in the holy quiet
and let my mind run back to the City—
thinking of lust, thinking of hate—
I'm deceiving the whole universe.

I'd be no different from the crowd.
And the Witnesses would know I'm a fake.

So keep it true. Keep it ownerless. Keep it pure.

*Thus ends the Eleventh Chapter: The Woodshed.*

# Theological Notes

### On the Rhinoceros
The *Khaṅgasama* ("Like a Rhinoceros") verses are the essential Blues motif of this chapter. The "Lonesome Road" is not a place of sadness, but of strength. In Blues mythology, the traveler leaves home not because he hates it, but because he has to find something that can't be found in the crowd. The Rhinoceros is the ultimate non-conformist.

### The Flood Paradox
The *Ratnakūṭa* citation—dying of thirst in a flood—is one of the most tragic images in Mahayana literature. It perfectly captures the "Blues condition": surrounded by the very thing that could save you (Dharma), but unable to drink because of your own internal blockage (thirst for defilements). It's the spiritual equivalent of "Water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drink."

### The Beast Offering
This restored section is the gritty core of the chapter. It's not a passive death wish; it's an active, radical trade. "They get a meal, I get free." This transforms the fear of death into an act of supreme generosity. In Blues terms, it's making a deal with the reality of the grave—you can have my body, but you can't take my soul.

### The Hellhounds Testimony
Translating the *Ugradattaparipṛcchā*'s list of fears as a first-person testimony ("I was scared of...") turns abstract doctrine into felt experience. This mirrors the Blues structure of "confession"—listing one's troubles to master them.

### No Landlord (*Asvāmika*)
The final metaphor of the "Ownerless" body is the liberation point. If there's no Landlord (Self), there's no rent to pay (suffering). The body is just like the woods—wild, conditioned, free.
