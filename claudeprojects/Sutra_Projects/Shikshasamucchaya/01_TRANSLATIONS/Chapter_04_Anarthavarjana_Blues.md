# Chapter 4: Avoiding the Bad Roads (Anarthavarjana)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig

---

*The fourth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on the great harms spelled out in the scriptures—root offenses, hell-road descriptions, the poison of lust, and ways you can reject the Dharma without even knowing it.*

## What Destroys a King

There are other great harms in the old texts.¹ The Ākāśagarbha Sūtra lays it out:²

> "There are five root offenses for a consecrated king. By these, a king destroys all the good he ever planted, becomes defeated, and heads straight for the lower realms in the sight of gods and humans."

### The Five Root Offenses for Kings

**First:** Stealing from stūpas, from the Saṅgha, from the property of the Four-Quarters Saṅgha, or from what's been donated—whether you take it yourself or have it taken.³

**Second:** Rejecting the Dharma—whether it's taught for Śrāvakas, Pratyekabuddhas, or the Mahāyāna. Any rejection.

**Third:** Attacking a renunciant. One who's gone forth in Buddha's name—shaven-headed, wearing the dyed robe—whether they keep the training or not, whether virtuous or fallen. If you take their robes, make them a householder, strike them, throw them in prison, or kill them.

**Fourth:** Committing any of the five immediate heinous deeds—killing your mother, killing your father, killing an arhat, splitting the Saṅgha, or deliberately shedding a Buddha's blood.

**Fifth:** Becoming a no-cause teacher. Disregarding the next world. Taking up the ten unwholesome paths and leading others into them.

**Sixth:** (abbreviated) Breaking villages, regions, cities, or kingdoms.

## What Destroys a New Bodhisattva

For beginner bodhisattvas—those just starting out on the Great Way—there are **eight root offenses**.⁴ By these, the beginner destroys all previous merit, falls, becomes defeated, sinks long in saṃsāra without spiritual friends.

### The Eight Root Offenses for Beginners

**First:** Teaching emptiness to the unprepared.

> Some beings—reborn here due to past bad deeds—have little merit but, through a spiritual friend, hear the profound Mahāyāna and generate bodhicitta despite limited understanding.
>
> Then certain bodhisattvas teach the deep emptiness sūtras to them just as they heard them, extensively, with full vocabulary.
>
> But those who haven't exerted themselves—childish ordinary people—hear it and get terrified. They turn away from supreme enlightenment and fix their minds on the Lesser Vehicle.
>
> **This is the first root offense.** By it, that well-meaning teacher destroys the beginner's merit; the beginner's bodhicitta is deceived.

**Lesson:** Know who you're teaching. Enter the ocean gradually.

**Second:** Discouraging someone from full awakening.

> You say: "You can't practice the six perfections. You can't make it to full buddhahood. Just go for the Lesser Vehicle—you'll still escape saṃsāra."

**Third:** Making someone abandon the Prātimokṣa for Mahāyāna.

> You say: "What's the point of that Prātimokṣa morality? Just generate bodhicitta, study the Mahāyāna. By that study, all your bad karma gets purified—no ripening needed."

**Fourth:** Making someone reject the whole Śrāvaka path.

> You say: "Abandon Śrāvaka talk. Don't listen, don't study, don't teach it. You won't get anything from it—it can't end your afflictions. Have faith in the Mahāyāna instead."
>
> If they listen to you and grab that view, **both of you** incur a root offense.

**Fifth:** Being double-tongued for gain.

> Studying this Mahāyāna for fame, reputation, honor, gain, and esteem. Teaching what you've only heard, not realized. Saying "We are the Mahāyāna ones—not the others." Envying others for their gain. Falsely claiming higher attainments.
>
> You're like someone who gets on a boat heading for Jewel Island, then smashes the boat yourself in the middle of the ocean. You drown right there.

**Sixth:** Selling yourself as awakened when you're not.

> Those profound sūtras—adorned with dhāraṇī, patience, samādhi—are the domain of great learned bodhisattvas who've exerted themselves. You study them, teach them, then say: "I awakened to these by my own understanding. Out of compassion I teach you. Practice and you'll be a witness like me."
>
> But you haven't realized anything. By mere study you teach. For gain and esteem you sell yourself...

---


## The Ākāśagarbha Remedy

The same sūtra gives the way out:⁵

> If those bodhisattvas, having heard the name of the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha, wish to confess their root offenses from fear of bad rebirth—if they bow to Ākāśagarbha and recite his name, that noble one will stand before them in some form: as a brahmin, or even as a girl.
>
> He'll confess those offenses. He'll show them skillful means. He'll establish them on the irreversible stage.
>
> But if he doesn't give a face-to-face vision, here's what the transgressed beginner should do:
>
> Rise in the last watch before dawn. Stand facing east. Burn incense. Invoke the god Aruṇa:
>
> "Aruṇa, Aruṇa! O greatly compassionate one, risen high in Jambudvīpa—cover me with compassion! Awaken the greatly compassionate Ākāśagarbha by my word! In my dream, show me the way to confess, the way to gain skillful wisdom in the noble Mahāyāna."
>
> Then go to sleep. Right when Aruṇa rises, Ākāśagarbha will arrive. Standing before you in your dream, he'll confess that root offense by the Mahāyāna means. He'll display such skillful knowledge that right there you obtain the samādhi called "non-confusion of bodhicitta."

For easy memorizing:⁶

> *From stealing from the Three Jewels—defeat.*
> *From rejecting true Dharma—the second offense.*
>
> *From stealing a monk's robes, even a bad monk's, from striking,*
> *From prison, from expelling—offense.*
>
> *From the five immediates, from wrong view,*
> *From breaking villages—root offense.*
>
> *From teaching emptiness to the unprepared,*
> *From turning Buddha-seekers away from awakening—*
>
> *From making them drop the Prātimokṣa for Mahāyāna,*
> *From holding that the Disciple path don't abandon desire—*
>
> *From showing off your qualities, from tearing down others*
> *For gain, esteem, and reputation—*
>
> *From falsely claiming "I'm deep!"*—
> *From having monks punished, from giving from the Three Refuges—*
>
> *From abandoning tranquility,*
> *From disturbing meditators with worldly talk—*
>
> *These are root offenses. Great hell causes.*
> *Before Ākāśagarbha, standing in dream, confess them.*

## Even a Bad Monk Has Value

The Kṣitigarbha Sūtra says:⁷

> That monk who's gone forth in my name—even if bad conduct, even if evil practice, even if a chaff-monk, impure, a non-ascetic with the ascetic's profession, a non-celibate with the celibate's claim—fallen, defeated, conquered by afflictions—
>
> Even now that monk is a displayer of spiritual friends for all beings. Even unworthy, by his shaven head and dyed robe, by the very sight of his deportment, he props up roots of virtue in many beings, shows the path to good destinies.
>
> Therefore, for one gone forth in my name—whether virtuous or fallen—I don't permit even wheel-turning kings, with just means or unjust, to:
> - Strike their body with a stick
> - Cast them in prison
> - Cut or break their limbs
> - Deprive them of life
>
> Even though he's called "dead" in this Dharma-Vinaya, that person is like yellow orpiment or musk...

## What Killing Looks Like on the Other Side

The Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna spells it out.⁸ Here's a taste:

### Killing

> There are birds called **Fire-Crest-Walkers**. They live in the middle of flames and don't burn. Excited, they break the skulls of hell-beings and drink their blood.
>
> **Skull-Interior-Walkers** break the head, drink the ignited brain-matter.
>
> **Tongue-Flesh-Eaters** split the tongue, eat it on all sides. That tongue, eaten, is born again—more tender than a lotus petal.
>
> **Tooth-Pullers, Throat-Pipe-Extractors, Lung-Eaters, Stomach-Eaters, Spleen-Turners, Intestine-Gnawers, Spine-Walkers...**
>
> **Marma-Seekers** break all the vital-point cavities, cut the marmas, enter the cavities, drink the marrow-essence of those crying out...
>
> Avīci extends 300,000 yojanas. This portion is called "Devoured by Birds." There, with other hell-beings, for many hundreds of thousands of years, he is eaten and reborn.
>
> Somehow released, wrapped in the net of suffering, he runs to **Dog-Pit-Fall**, seeking protection. Surrounded by eleven flame-masses, bound by karma's noose, surrounded by enemies in a wilderness... he runs to that place.
>
> When he falls, his foot melts utterly. Thrown up, reborn more tender. Falling and being thrown up for many hundreds of thousands of years... Eaten by vultures, crows, hawks, owls...
>
> Somehow released... he runs to **Wheel-Mark-Cavity**. Wheels with a thousand spokes appear—diamond hubs, sharp flames, spinning swiftly. They reach his body and spin, burning and crushing each limb. On his foot-soles, stakes pierce him...
>
> And on it goes.

### Stealing

> Like seeing a mirage—a gandharva city—that evil-doer sees a mass of wealth. Overcome by greed, deluded, he thinks: "This is mine." He leaps across burning coal-pits to grab it.
>
> Karma-created Yama-men seize him. In the midst of a weapon-net, he is split limb by limb, quartered, burned, reduced to bones.
>
> And even then? His greed, operating since beginningless time, does not diminish.

### Sexual Misconduct

> Released from the weapons, somehow leaping the coal-pits, he reaches **False Vision**. There he sees a karma-created woman—one he saw before when his memory was lost. The fire of desire, practiced since beginningless time, arises. He runs toward her.
>
> She's made of iron, karma-created. She seizes him. From lips onward, he is consumed until not a mustard-seed measure of him remains. Reborn, consumed again...
>
> Yet from that craving-fire he doesn't turn back. He rushes again.
>
> Then those women, with blazing iron-vajra bodies, taking him with bodies full of flame-garlands, grind him like a fistful of sand. Reborn again...

> *Women are the root of bad destinies, of wealth destroyed.*
> *Those subject to women—how can they find happiness?*
>
> *Woman is destruction among destructions, here and there.*
> *Avoid them if you wish yourself happiness.*⁹

### Lying

> Yama-men seize him, split open his mouth, extract the tongue. By karma's force it becomes 500 yojanas long. At its coming forth, they throw him on burning iron ground. 1,000 burning ploughs with blazing tips appear. Powerful bullocks carry those ploughs on his tongue...
>
> Rivers of pus, blood, and worms flow there. That tongue is tender as a god's eye. He screams, cries out. No one takes away that suffering.

### Slander

> Same as lying, but the tongue is 300 yojanas. Yama-men cut it with sharp blazing swords. In another place, jackals eat him. He cries out in inarticulate sounds, tongueless...

### Harsh Speech

> They split open the mouth, take the tongue, cut it with sharp weapons, throw it into his own mouth for food. Tormented by hunger, face emaciated, he eats his own tongue smeared with blood and saliva. Cut, reborn, cut again...
>
> The Yama-men speak:
>
> *"From the bow of your tongue, a sharp arrow of harsh words—*
> *this is the fruit that has come."*

### Idle Chatter

> That burning copper-liquid, licking the tongue, burns it. Burns the throat, the heart, the intestines, the stomach. Exits from below.
>
> The Yama-men speak:
>
> *"Unconnected words, meaningless, incoherent, unbound—*
> *what was spoken by you—this is the fruit.*
>
> *A tongue never truly speaking, not devoted to study—*
> *the wise don't see that as a tongue. It's merely a lump of flesh."*

## Every Harm Starts Here

All harms have sensual desire as their root.¹⁰ That's why:

> There's a hell called **Fire-Pit**. By what karma do beings take rebirth there? By those who, though claiming asceticism, heard women's dancing, singing, or ornament-sounds with improper attention, distracted mind, and responded with laughter, play, and... ejaculation.
>
> There those hell-beings are crushed limb by limb by iron rain, cooked by coal rain, burned...
>
> From remembering past pleasures, there's the hell called **Paduma**. From remembering your own past. There hell-beings are cooked in cauldrons, beaten with iron pestles in troughs...

## The Seven Ways You're Still Joined to Sex

Even if you're not doing the act:¹¹

1. **Gazing** at a woman's form, savoring it, becoming attached—you're joined to sexual conduct, not separated.

2. **Playing, sporting, laughing** with a woman, savoring it—joined to sexual conduct.

3. **Savoring her private parts** (even without touching)—joined.

4. **Behind a wall, savoring the sounds** of her dancing, singing—joined.

5. **Savoring another's woman** endowed with five pleasures—joined.

6. **Dedicating your celibacy to god-realm rebirth**—joined to sexual conduct, not separated.

Celibacy is more than physical. If you're gazing, laughing, remembering, savoring sounds, or practicing for heaven—you're still in it.

## The Kāma-Rejection Teaching

Because even memory and aspiration for pleasure causes such harm:¹²

> "Restrain your mind from sensual pleasures, O monk! This path is fearful, dangerous, thorny, dense—a wrong path, a bad path, a path of feeling, frequented by bad men.
>
> Don't you think: 'Why are pleasures said to be of little savor, much suffering?' The danger is greater.
>
> Sensual pleasures, O monks, are:
> - A disease
> - A boil
> - A dart
> - A misfortune
> - The root of misfortune
> - Bait on a fishhook
> - Death
>
> Impermanent, empty, deceiving, false, dream-like. The prattle of fools.
>
> Just as a trap for deer, a net for birds, a pot for fish, glue for monkeys, fire for moths—so are sensual pleasures.
>
> For one pursuing pleasures, being turned in the mouth of lions for a long night—there's no end. In the mouth of slaughterers, cow-eaters—no end. In the mouth of frogs and snakes—no end.
>
> Those pursuing pleasures, seized as thieves, beheaded—no end known. Adulterers, fence-breakers, village-destroyers, region-destroyers, knot-looseners, seized, beheaded—no end.
>
> Suffering—intense, harsh, bitter—has been experienced. Blood has flowed, gushed, more than the water in the four great oceans...
>
> This body is of much danger: a bone-collection, bound by sinews, smeared with flesh, wrapped in skin, covered by hide, full of holes, inhabited by worm-hosts, useless for beings, a basis for affliction-karma...
>
> What is your peace regarding pleasures, O monk? What seduces you?
>
> When I'm fully nirvāṇa-ed, and the true Dharma's disappeared, and you, pursuing pleasures, have gone to ruin—when will you liberate yourself from old age and death?
>
> **Enough, O monk! Restrain your mind from pleasures! This is not the time for pleasure-pursuit. This is the time for Dharma-pursuit.**"

## Worse Than Killing Everyone

The Praśāntaviniścaya Sūtra says:¹³

> Whoever kills all beings of Jambudvīpa and takes their property—or whoever creates even one obstacle for a bodhisattva's single wholesome thought, even for an animal's single mouthful of merit-food—**this second one produces incomparably more evil.**
>
> Why? He obstructs the roots of virtue that generate Buddha-arising.

> Whoever creates jealousy toward a bodhisattva in another family—three fears should be expected:
> 1. Hell rebirth
> 2. Birth blind
> 3. Border-region rebirth

And the verses:

> *With a great body, in hells, that evil-minded one*
> *is reborn ruined; he experiences painful feeling.*
>
> *500 yojanas is his height.*
> *Surrounded by krores, eaten constantly by dogs.*
>
> *5,000 heads are born to this slanderer.*
> *500 tongues on each head.*
>
> *On each tongue, 500 flame-mouthed ploughs*
> *carry for him, having spoken evil speech.*
>
> *In Pratāpana hell they are cooked.*
> *Those who oppress bodhisattvas—animal and hell births come easy!*
>
> *For 100,000 koṭis of kalpas—*
> *fallen, they become snakes of fierce poison.*
>
> *Fallen from there, reborn human,*
> *born blind, poor understanding, evil mind, unrestrained.*
>
> *For 100,000 koṭis of kalpas, born, he never sees the Buddha.*

---

## But If You Protect Them...

> *Whoever creates righteous protection for Dharma-speakers—*
> *abandoning all bad destinies, he becomes Śakra, king of gods.*
>
> *Brahmā too, Yāma, Tuṣita, Vaśavartī, again and again.*
>
> *Reborn human, he's born a wheel-turner.*
> *A merchant, householder, wealthy, great wealth.*
>
> *Endowed with wisdom and memory, happy, free from affliction.*

---


## You Don't Know Who They Are

The Śūraṅgamasamādhi Sūtra says:¹⁴

> What's the prediction of one whose bodhicitta hasn't been generated? That person is reborn in the five-fold saṃsāra—hells, animals, Yama-realm, gods, humans. Sharp faculties, exalted aspiration.
>
> The Tathāgata knows: "After so-many koṭis of kalpas, this one will generate bodhicitta. After so-many asaṃkhyeya kalpas, he'll awaken." That's the prediction for one whose bodhicitta hasn't arisen yet.
>
> Then Mahākāśyapa said: "From today, we should generate the Teacher-perception toward all beings. Why? We don't know which bodhisattva has awakening-ripening faculties and which doesn't. Not knowing, we might think them inferior. By that we'd be destroyed."
>
> The Blessed One said: "Well said, Kāśyapa! Seeing this very point, I taught: 'O monks, don't discriminate person through person. A person discriminating is quickly destroyed. Either I discriminate, or one like me.'
>
> By this teaching, bodhisattvas and śrāvakas should generate the Teacher-perception toward all beings. There might be some bodhisattva-vehicle person. Protect yourself in that matter."

And toward one who certainly has the mark of awakening? All the more should disdain be guarded against.

---


## The Subtle Rejection

The Sarvadharmavaipulyasaṃgraha Sūtra says:¹⁵

> "Subtle, O Mañjuśrī, is the karma-obstruction of rejecting true Dharma.
>
> Whoever, in a dharma spoken by the Tathāgata, makes the perception 'this is beautiful' for some and 'this is not beautiful' for some—**he rejects the true Dharma.** By that rejection, the Tathāgata is accused, the Dharma rejected, the Saṅgha slandered.
>
> Saying 'this is proper, this improper'—rejection.
>
> I didn't teach separate dharmas—Śrāvaka, Pratyekabuddha, Mahāyāna. Confused men will make my dharma diverse: 'This for Śrāvakas, this for Pratyekabuddhas, this for bodhisattvas.' By diversity-perception—rejection.
>
> 'This is bodhisattva training, this isn't'—rejection.
>
> 'The Dharma-preacher has eloquence; he doesn't'—rejection.
>
> 'When Buddha-arising passes, no dhāraṇī is obtained'—rejection.
>
> Finding fault with the Dharma-preacher's practice—rejection.
>
> Accusing through deportment, through letter-conduct, through moral failure—rejection.
>
> 'This is well-spoken, this isn't'—rejection.
>
> 'By this one, Buddha's teaching was spoken; by this one, not'—rejection.
>
> Whatever you diminish—rejection.
>
> Thinking 'this is the Dharma-preacher's form,' speaking it—monk, nun, layman, laywoman—all reject the true Dharma."

And:

> "Whoever makes even one hair stand on end for even one being when Dharma is taught, whoever makes even one tear fall—all that is by the Tathāgata's power.
>
> Those confused men, non-bodhisattvas with bodhisattva-claim, bodhisattva-faulters, Dharma-thieves and deceivers, will say to Dharma-teachers: 'What do these not understand?'...
>
> Those who disdain bodhisattvas—I don't speak of their hell as having an end.
>
> Why? Whoever slanders a Dharma-preacher—slanders the Buddha, rejects the Dharma, despises the Saṅgha.
>
> Whoever is disrespectful to a Dharma-preacher is disrespectful to the Buddha. Whoever doesn't want to see a Dharma-preacher doesn't want to see the Buddha. Whoever speaks ill of a Dharma-preacher speaks ill of the Buddha.
>
> The Buddha abandons whoever makes anger-mind toward even a first-thought-generator bodhisattva."

*Thus ends the Fourth Chapter: Avoiding the Bad Roads.*

## Endnotes

¹ **Chapter scope**: This is the longest chapter so far. It catalogs specific harms from multiple sūtras.

² **Ākāśagarbha Sūtra ("Space-Treasury")**: Enumerates root offenses for consecrated kings (5+) and beginner bodhisattvas (8).

³ **Stūpa-property, Saṅgha-property**: These are communal sacred holdings. Stealing from them is a root offense regardless of your reason.

⁴ **Ādikarmiṇa ("beginner")**: Newly set out on the Mahāyāna. Their offenses relate to teaching, discouraging, and double-tongued hypocrisy.

⁵ **Ākāśagarbha confession**: The remedy involves invoking the god Aruṇa and receiving confession through a dream-vision.

⁶ **Summary verses (saṃgrahakārikā)**: Intended for memorization. The śloka meter makes them easier to remember.

⁷ **Kṣitigarbha Sūtra**: Even a "dead" (disgraced) monk in dyed robes shouldn't be harmed—his visible renunciation plants merit in viewers.

⁸ **Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna ("Foundations of True Dharma Mindfulness")**: The most extensive hell-description text. Each sin has its own geography.

⁹ **Women as harm**: These verses reflect the renunciant male perspective of the original text. The Bluesman presents them without endorsement—they're part of the historical record of how desire was addressed in these monastic contexts.

¹⁰ **Kāmamūla ("sensual root")**: The logic behind all the anti-desire passages. Every harm traced back to craving.

¹¹ **Saptamaithunsaṃyuktasūtra ("Seven Sexual-Union Sūtra")**: Celibacy extends beyond the physical act—gazing, playing, savoring sounds, dedicating for heaven all count.

¹² **Kāmāpavādakasūtra ("Sūtra Rejecting Pleasures")**: Vivid similes—trap, net, fishhook, glue, fire. Pull-quotes intended to shock.

¹³ **Praśāntaviniścaya Sūtra**: Obstructing even one bodhisattva-thought is worse than killing all Jambudvīpa. The asymmetry is staggering.

¹⁴ **Śūraṅgamasamādhisūtra**: Even uninitiated persons may be predicted bodhisattvas. Treat all as potential teachers.

¹⁵ **Sarvadharmavaipulyasaṃgraha**: The subtlest teaching on Dharma-rejection. Saying "this teaching is good, that one bad" is already rejection.

## Theological Notes

### Root Offenses Are Specific
There are lists: 5 for kings, 8 for beginners. These aren't general guidelines—they're catalogued transgressions with specific remedies.

### The Hell-Descriptions Are Graphic
Fire-Crest birds, Skull-Interior birds, tongue-extraction by the thousands of yojanas—these aren't metaphors. In Buddhist cosmology, they're vivid descriptions of karmic consequences. The Bluesman presents them without softening.

### Sensual Desire Is the Root
This chapter hammers it: all harms trace to craving. The anti-woman verses reflect the monastic male perspective. Read them as evidence of how seriously the tradition took the craving-problem, not as timeless gender theology.

### The Seven Sexualities
Celibacy isn't just physical. Gazing, playing, savoring sounds, dedicating for heaven—all keep you joined to sexual conduct. The bar is higher than you thought.

### Disdain Toward Bodhisattvas Is Catastrophic
Obstructing even one wholesome thought of a bodhisattva is worse than killing all Jambudvīpa. The logic: you obstruct the roots of Buddha-arising itself.

### Treat Everyone as a Future Buddha
Mahākāśyapa's confession: "We don't know who has awakening-ripening faculties." Therefore, teacher-perception toward all. This is the safeguard against catastrophic disdain.

### Dharma-Rejection Is Subtle
You reject the Dharma when you say: "This teaching is good, that one bad." When you make diversity-perceptions among Buddha's teachings. When you fault the Dharma-preacher. Even when you say "by this one, the teaching was spoken; by that one, not."
