## The Great Merit of Training

From the Candrapradīpasūtra:¹

> *One who serves tens of millions of koṭis of Buddhas*
> *with food and drink, with serene mind,*
> *with parasols, banners, and rows of lamps,*
> *for koṭis of kalpas like the sands of the Gaṅgā—*
>
> *And one who, when the true Dharma is fading,*
> *when the Sugata's teaching is ceasing,*
> *practices the training for one day and night—*
> *this produces merit more distinguished than that.*

Therefore, effort should be made here.

## The Bodhisattva Training Precepts

The bodhisattva training precepts have been stated in the sūtras. As stated in the Āryaratnamegha:²

> "How, son of good family, do bodhisattvas become restrained by the bodhisattva-training-vow? Here a bodhisattva reflects thus: 'By the mere prātimokṣa restraint I am not able to fully awaken to unsurpassed perfect awakening. Rather, I must train in those bodhisattva conduct-precepts that have been established by the Tathāgata in those various sūtras.'"

And so forth at length. Therefore, for those of dull intelligence like us, since it is difficult to know due to being extensively stated:

### Kārikā 3

> **marmasthānānyato vidyād yenānāpattiko bhavet ||3||**

*"Therefore one should know the vital points by which one becomes free of transgression."*³

---

## The Core Summary: Kārikā 4

What are those vital points that are stated in the sūtras for the benefit of those devoted to the Mahāyāna?

Namely:

### Kārikā 4

> **ātmabhāvasya bhogānāṃ tryadhvavṛtteḥ śubhasya ca |**
> **utsargaḥ sarvasattvebhyas tadrakṣā śuddhivardhanam ||4||**

*The relinquishment of one's own person,⁴ enjoyments, and merit accrued in the three times,⁵ to all beings; [and] the safeguarding of that [relinquishment] is purification and increase.*⁺

> **[Professor's Note]:** *This verse presents two distinct statements: (1) the three-fold giving (ātmabhāva, bhoga, śubha) to all beings, and (2) the protection of that act of giving as itself a means of purification and increase of merit. The dual-statement structure is essential to Śāntideva's rhetoric.*

---

## The Essence of the Bodhisattva Vow

This is the summary of the bodhisattva vow-restraint, in which transgressions are established even for bodhisattvas who pause in their practice.

As stated in the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa:⁶

> "The path that the bodhisattva has taken up leads to the cessation of suffering for all beings. If, for a bodhisattva established on that path, even after the passing of ten million kalpas, a single thought of [personal] happiness should arise—even a thought of sitting down—the bodhisattva should generate this thought: 'Having taken up the urgent [welfare] of all beings, I sit down while abandoning even this [personal comfort].'"

---

## The Five Immediacies

Also Mañjuśrī said:

> "There are these five immediacies,⁷ Son of the Gods, endowed with which bodhisattvas swiftly fully awaken to unsurpassed perfect awakening. What are the five?
>
> 1. When, Son of the Gods, a bodhisattva generates the mind toward unsurpassed perfect awakening with sincere intention and does not in the meantime generate the mind toward the śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha stage—this, Son of the Gods, is the **first immediacy**.
>
> 2. Having generated the mind for the relinquishment of one's entire [being], one does not in the meantime associate with a stingy mind—this, Son of the Gods, is the **second immediacy**.
>
> 3. Having generated the thought 'All beings are to be protected by me,' one does not in the meantime sink down—this, Son of the Gods, is the **third immediacy**.
>
> 4. Having generated the thought 'I shall comprehend all dharmas as unarisen and unceasing,' one does not in the meantime fall into wrong views—this, Son of the Gods, is the **fourth immediacy**.
>
> 5. Having generated the thought 'Through wisdom united with a single moment, I shall comprehend all dharmas,' one does not in the meantime stand still, does not spit [on the path], until omniscience is attained—this, Son of the Gods, is the **fifth immediacy**."

## The Practice of Relinquishment

Therefore, the relinquishment, protection, purification, and increase of one's person, enjoyments, and merit should be cultivated as appropriate.

There, first, for the purpose of relinquishment, one should generate dispassion through the door of contemplating the faults of grasping, and should cultivate the benefits of giving.

As stated in the Candrapradīpasūtra:⁸

> *Those fools who are attached to this putrid body,*
> *to this unstable, powerless life like an illusion, like a dream—*
> *having done extremely terrible deeds, following the power of delusion,*
> *they go to terrible hells, unwise ones who have mounted the vehicle of death.*

---

## The Medicine Tree of the Body

As stated in the Anantamukhanirhāradhāraṇī:⁹

> *Whatever beings do not experience conflict—grasping is the root-cause of that.*
> *Therefore one should abandon wherever craving might arise; for one who has abandoned craving, there is dhāraṇī.*

As stated in the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa:

> "Furthermore, Śāriputra, the bodhisattva generates the perception of 'belonging to another' in all dharmas. He does not grasp any phenomenon. Why? Because grasping is fear."

As stated in the Āryogradattaparipṛcchā:¹⁰

> "What is given no longer needs to be protected; what is in the house must be protected. What is given leads to the exhaustion of craving; what is in the house increases craving. What is given is without grasping; what is in the house is with grasping. What is given is without fear; what is in the house is with fear.
>
> What is given supports the path to awakening; what is in the house supports Māra. What is given is imperishable; what is in the house perishes. From what is given comes happiness; from what is in the house, suffering arises. What is given is for the abandonment of afflictions; what is in the house increases afflictions. What is given leads to great enjoyment; what is in the house does not. What is given is the deed of a good person; what is in the house is the deed of a bad person. What is given is praised by all Buddhas; what is in the house is praised by fools."

## Giving Even the Body

From the Nārāyaṇaparipṛcchā:¹¹

> "That thing should not be taken up in which the mind of giving does not arise. The intention of giving should not proceed [stuck]. That possession should not be taken up in which the mind of relinquishment does not arise...
>
> Moreover, son of good family, the bodhisattva mahāsattva should generate this thought: 'This my person has been given up, relinquished to all beings—how much more external things!
>
> Whatever being needs whatever from me, I shall give that to them when present. I shall give my hand to those who need a hand, my foot to those who need a foot, my eye to those who need an eye, my flesh to those who need flesh, my blood to those who need blood, my marrow to those who need marrow, my limbs to those who need limbs, my head to those who need a head.
>
> How much more external things—wealth, grain, gold, silver, gems, ornaments, horses, elephants, chariots, vehicles, villages, cities, towns, districts, kingdoms, capitals, ports, slaves male and female, workers, servants, sons, daughters, and retinue!'"

---

## The Medicine Tree Metaphor

> "Just as, son of good family, when a medicine tree¹² is taken from—whether from its root, trunk, branch, bark, leaf, flower, fruit, or essence—it has no discrimination: 'It is taken from my root' up to 'It is taken from my essence.' Rather, without discrimination it removes the diseases of beings low, middling, and excellent.
>
> Just so, son of good family, the bodhisattva mahāsattva should generate the perception of medicine in this very body made of the four great elements. Whatever beings need whatever, let them take it from me—hand for those who need a hand, foot for those who need a foot..."

---

## Dedication of Merit

As stated in the Āryagaganagañjasūtra:¹³

> "May that root of virtue of mine, that Dharma-knowledge, that skill, not exist that would not be for the benefit of all beings."

---

## Dedication of Past and Future Merit

As stated in the Āryākṣayamatisūtra:¹⁴

> "The recollection of wholesome mental factors and, having recollected, their dedication to awakening—this is skill regarding the past. The intention toward future wholesome roots, the cultivation of facing toward awakening, [thinking:] 'Those wholesome mind-moments that will arise in me, I shall dedicate them to unsurpassed perfect awakening'—this is skill regarding the future."

---

## Chapter Conclusion

Thus, through mental practice of complete relinquishment, having fulfilled relinquishment through the impetus of the mind of giving, by that physical activity all possessions are relinquished. Freed from the suffering of existence rooted in possessions, one is called "liberated."

And one experiences immeasurable, incalculable kalpas of diverse, infinite mundane and supramundane showers of happiness. And by that very person and so forth, like a hook with bait, drawing others while oneself not having obtained the enjoyment,¹⁵ one ferries them across.

Therefore it is stated in the Ratnamegha:

> **"For the bodhisattva, giving (dāna) is awakening (bodhi)."**¹⁶

*Thus ends the First Chapter, the Perfection of Generosity, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*

## Soul-Check Hints for Blues Version

- Kārikā 4 is the **essence of the whole text**—must be rendered with weight
- The medicine tree metaphor is extraordinary: "Take what you need from me"
- "Given vs. kept" antitheses are perfect for Blues call-and-response
- The final statement: "Giving IS awakening" = Blues liberation
