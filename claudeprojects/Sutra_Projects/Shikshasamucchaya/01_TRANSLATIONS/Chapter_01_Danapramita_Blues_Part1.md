## The Call to Listen (Kārikās 1-4)

### Come On In, Y'all

You been through it, ain't you?

Burning down in them low places,¹
torment after torment,
suffering that don't quit—
that's what happens when the mind won't settle.

So listen up now.
Listen *good*.
This teaching here? It's medicine for all that.²

You hear me? Really *hear* me?
The one who listens without that big-head pride—³
they drop that old evil like a bad habit,
burn off all that karma debt from way back when.

And what they get? Joy they never knew was possible.
And once you got it? You don't ever fall from that sweetness again.

---

### The Rare Jewel

That waking-up happiness?⁴ It don't run dry.
You get riches that can't be matched.

This Dharma-jewel? Near impossible to find.
But you got it. Today. Right now.
This moment you're standing in? It's gold.⁵

So be here. Be *still*. Listen with respect.

---

### Everybody's Invited

Come on in, all you beings!
Gods and serpent-folk,⁶
spirits of the air and waters,
hungry ghosts and heaven-lords—
everybody with a thirst to hear:

The Blessed One speaks for one reason only:
*the good of all three worlds.*⁷

Y'all are welcome at this table.

---

## The Author Speaks (Kārikās 5-8)

### Bowing Down

I bow to the Buddhas and their children,⁸
I bow to the Dharma-body that holds it all,
I bow to everyone worth bowing to.

Now I'm gonna tell you how to walk this path—
the discipline of the Awakened One's own family—
putting together words that carry weight.

---

### I Ain't Saying Nothing New

Look here, I ain't pretending to be clever.
Nothing I say here is new under the sun.
I can't even claim I got skill with words.

So this ain't really for *your* sake—
I'm just trying to train my own stubborn heart.⁹

But maybe through this work, my faith gets stronger.¹⁰
Maybe that momentum for doing good builds up.
And if somebody like me comes across this someday?
Then maybe it'll mean something to them too.

---

### This Chance Don't Come Twice

Listen: this moment right here?
The conditions you standing in?
They're *hard* to get.¹¹ Near impossible.

But you got 'em. You *got* what it takes
to do something meaningful with this human life.

So if you don't sit down and think about what's good—
if you let this slip by—
tell me: when's that chance coming around again?

It ain't.

## The Elders Testify: What's Rare (Gaṇḍavyūhasūtra)

Now the old sūtras speak up,¹² congregation-style:

> *Rare* is getting free of the eight bad places.¹³
> *Rare* is getting born human at all.
> *Rare* is getting all the good conditions.
> *Rare* is a Buddha showing up in your world.
> *Rare* is having your senses working right.
> *Rare* is hearing the Dharma at all.
> *Rare* is meeting good folks who walk the path.
>
> *Rare* is finding true spiritual friends.
> *Rare* is getting taught the real way.
> *Rare* is making an honest living.
> *Rare*—so *rare*—is putting real effort into the truth
> here in this human world.

You hear that? Everything lined up for you right now?
That's the rare stuff. Don't waste it.

## Endnotes

¹ **"Burning down in them low places"**: The Sanskrit text speaks of *naraka* (hell realms) and *mahāpratāpa* (great burning torment). In Blues tradition, "low places" evokes both spiritual darkness and the valleys of suffering we travel through.

² **"Medicine for all that"**: The Dharma is often called the "medicine" (bhaiṣajya) for the disease of suffering.

³ **"without that big-head pride"**: Sanskrit *anuddhatātmā*—one whose self is not arrogant. The Blues ethic: you gotta be low to get lifted.

⁴ **"That waking-up happiness"**: *saṃbodhisattvasukham*—the happiness of complete awakening. Not just feeling good, but being *fully awake*.

⁵ **"This moment you're standing in"**: *kṣaṇasaṃpad*—the endowment of the opportune moment, the precious human birth with all its conditions.

⁶ **"Gods and serpent-folk"**: *suranāgasattvāḥ*—devas (gods) and nāgas (serpent beings). The teaching is for *all* beings, not just humans.

⁷ **"all three worlds"**: *tribhuvana*—the realms of desire, form, and formlessness. The whole cosmos.

⁸ **"the Buddhas and their children"**: The bodhisattvas are called *sugatātmaja*—"offspring of the Well-Gone Ones."

⁹ **"train my own stubborn heart"**: Śāntideva's famous humility, echoing Bodhicaryāvatāra 1.2. He doesn't claim to teach others—just to work on himself.

¹⁰ **"my faith gets stronger"**: *prasādavega*—the momentum or impetus of faith (prasāda = clarity, serene confidence).

¹¹ **"hard to get"**: *sudurlabhā*—extremely difficult to obtain. The 18 favorable conditions for practice are precious.

¹² **"the old sūtras speak up"**: The *Āryagaṇḍavyūhasūtra* (Flower Ornament Sūtra) is being quoted here—testimony from the ancient teachers.

¹³ **"the eight bad places"**: *aṣṭākṣaṇa*—the eight unfavorable conditions: hell, hungry ghost realm, animal realm, long-lived gods, barbarian lands, wrong views, Buddha-less eras, defective senses.

## Theological Notes

- **The Rarity of This Moment**: Śāntideva opens by emphasizing how *hard* it is to get the conditions for practice. This is pure Blues epistemology—you only know what you got when you've been without it.

- **Humility of the Teacher**: Kārikā 6 shows Śāntideva's characteristic stance: "I ain't special, I'm just working on myself." This is not false modesty—it's the bodhisattva recognizing that the Dharma is bigger than any teacher.

- **Congregational Testimony**: The Gaṇḍavyūha quotation functions like a congregation testifying—voice after voice saying "Rare! Rare! Rare!" This litany of rarities is meant to wake us up to what we have.
