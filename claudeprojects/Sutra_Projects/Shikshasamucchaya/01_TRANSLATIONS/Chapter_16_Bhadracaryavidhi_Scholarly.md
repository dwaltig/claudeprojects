# Chapter 16: The Practice of Good Conduct (Bhadracaryāvidhi)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

**Summary**: This chapter outlines the method (*vidhi*) for increasing (*vṛddhi*) the three purities established in the previous chapters: the Person (*ātmabhāva*), Goods (*bhoga*), and Merit (*puṇya*). It culminates in the liturgical practice of the *Bhadracaryāpraṇidhāna* (The Vows of Good Conduct). Key elements include the increase of strength (*bala*) and non-laziness (*anālasya*), the ten great vows from the *Daśabhūmaka Sūtra*, and the supreme dedication (*pariṇāmanā*) modeled on Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra.

### 1. The Necessity of Increase (Vṛddhi)

Now, the increase of all three (Person, Goods, Merit) must be stated. Why?

> "There are many recipients. If this [offering] is small, what is the use?
> And it does not generate supreme satisfaction. Therefore, this must be increased." (Kārikā 22)

**"Supreme satisfaction"** (*atitṛpti*) refers to Buddhahood. That is not generated for beings by mere purity common to Śrāvakas; hence the need for increase.

### 2. Increasing the Person (Ātmabhāvavṛddhi)

What is the increase of the person? **The increase of Strength (*bala*) and Non-Laziness (*anālasya*).**

#### A. Increase of Strength
The *Ratnamegha Sūtra* defines this strength:
> "There is no being in the assembly of beings who can crush the bodhisattva's strength with their own strength."

How is it increased? As stated in the *Tathāgataguhya Sūtra* (Vajrapāṇi's teaching to Ajātaśatru), a bodhisattva attains such strength by being endowed with ten dharmas:

1.  **Giving body and life**, but not abandoning the True Dharma.
2.  **Bowing to all beings**, but not increasing pride (*māna*).
3.  **Enduring weak beings**, not generating hostility (*pratigha*).
4.  **Giving best food to the hungry**, and giving fearlessness to the frightened.
5.  **Zealous for healing the sick.**
6.  **Satisfying the poor** with enjoyments.
7.  **Plastering the Tathāgata-shrine** with lime/ointment.
8.  **Speaking words of joy** (*ānandavacana*) to beings.
9.  **Sharing enjoyments** with the poor and suffering.
10. **Carrying the burden** of the weary and exhausted.

#### B. Increase of Non-Laziness (Vigor)
What is the increase of non-laziness? **The increase of Vigor (*vīrya*).**

As stated in the *Sāgaramati Sūtra*:
> "Sāgaramati, a bodhisattva should be initiated in vigor (*ārabdhavīrya*), always with firm valor... For the lazy (*kusīda*), enlightenment is very far away. The lazy one has no giving... no wisdom, no benefit for others."

As the *Candrapradīpa Sūtra* says:
> "Like a lotus in the water, he grows gradually."

### 3. Increasing Goods (Bhogavṛddhi)

> "From giving born of the womb of Emptiness and Compassion, there is the increase of goods." (Kārikā 23)

As stated in the *Vajracchedikā*:
> "The bodhisattva who gives a gift while not established [in signs] (*apratiṣṭhita*)—it is not easy to measure his merit-heap."

And in the *Great Prajñāpāramitā*:
> "A bodhisattva desiring to perform immeasurable giving... should train in the perfection of wisdom."

### 4. Increasing Merit (Puṇyavṛddhi)

The increase of merit is the root of all increases.

> "Having made Effort (*vyavasāya*) and Intention (*āśaya*) firm at the very beginning,
> And placing Compassion (*karuṇā*) in front,
> One should strive for the increase of the auspicious." (Kārikā 24)

#### A. Making Effort Firm (Vyavasāya)
How does one firm up effort? Like Ārya Sudhana approaching Maitreya.
*   Thinking of the body's dedication to the limit of the past (*pūrvāntakoṭi*).
*   Correcting the mind (*cittamanasikāra*).
*   Disregarding the fatigue of useless worldly actions.
*   Raising the power of Right Resolve (*samyaksaṃkalpa*) for all bodhisattva practices.

#### B. Making Intention Firm (Āśaya)
The *Dharmasaṃgīti* says:
> "Intention (*āśaya*), Lord, is the root of Buddha-dharmas... Just as fire burns when fuel exists, so Buddha-dharmas blaze when intention exists."

What is this intention? The *Akṣayamati Sūtra* defines it as artificial-less (*akṛtrima*), pure, straight, honesty (*ṛjuka*), steadfast.

#### C. Placing Compassion in Front (Karuṇā)
The *Dharmasaṃgīti* states:
> "Lord, a bodhisattva need not train in too many dharmas. Only **one dharma** is to be guarded and penetrated. Which one? **Great Compassion** (*mahākaruṇā*).
>
> Just as when the wheel-turning monarch's chakra-jewel goes, the whole army follows—so where Great Compassion goes, all Buddha-dharmas follow."

### 5. The Practice of Good Conduct (Bhadracaryāvidhi)

With effort, intention, and compassion thus firmed up, one begins the increase of merit.

> "The Practice of Good Conduct (*Bhadracaryāvidhi*) is to be done:
> Worshipping (*vandanā*) and so forth, always with respect."

#### The Three Heaps (Triskandha)
The *Ugradattaparipṛcchā* prescribes the **Triskandhaka** practice (Three Heaps) three times in the day and three times in the night:
1.  **Confession of Sin** (*pāpadeśanā*).
2.  **Rejoicing in Merit** (*puṇyānumodanā*).
3.  **Requesting the Buddhas** (*buddhādhyeṣaṇā*).

(*Note: Worship/Vandanā is included in Confession.*)

#### The Offering
One offers all unowned flowers, fruits, and jewels in the universe (as stated in *Ratnamegha* and *Trisamayarāja*). Even mental offerings of the jewels in the ten directions are valid.

#### The Ten Great Vows (Daśa Mahāpraṇidhāna)
From the *Daśabhūmaka Sūtra*, the ten essential vows:
1.  **Puja:** To worship all Buddhas without remainder.
2.  **Dharma:** To uphold the Dharma-eye of all Tathāgatas.
3.  **Arising:** To accompany the Buddhas in all world-systems (birth to nirvāṇa).
4.  **Practice:** To engender the vast bodhisattva conduct (*caryā*).
5.  **Ripening:** To ripen all beings (*sattvaparipācana*) in all destinies.
6.  **World-Entry:** To enter all world-systems (*lokadhātu*) with knowledge.
7.  **Purification:** To purify all Buddha-fields (*kṣetrapariśodhana*).
8.  **Mahāyāna:** To enter the Great Vehicle with all bodhisattvas of one intention.
9.  **Unfailing Action:** To practice the bodhisattva deeds which are never fruitless (*amogha*).
10. **Enlightenment:** To manifest supreme awakening (*abhisambodhi*) in all worlds.

#### The Supreme Dedication (Pariṇāmanā)
Finally, one dedicates the merit using the verses of the *Bhadracaryā* (The King of Prayers):

> "Just as the hero **Mañjuśrī** knows,
> And **Samantabhadra** too—
> Following in their training,
> I dedicate all this merit.
>
> Whatever dedication is praised as supreme
> By the Victors of the three times—
> With that dedication,
> I dedicate all this merit to the Good Conduct (*Bhadracaryā*)."

## Scholarly Notes

1.  **Atitṛpti**: "Super-satisfaction" or "Surpassing Satisfaction." This distinguishes the Mahāyāna goal (benefiting all beings limitlessly) from the Hīnayāna goal (mere personal liberation).
2.  **Sāgaramati Sūtra**: Emphasizes *vīrya* (vigor) as the prerequisite for enlightenment. Without energy, the path is impossible.
3.  **Triskandhaka**: The "Three Heap" ritual is the liturgical core of Mahāyāna practice. It remains the standard "Seven Limb Prayer" practice in Tibetan Buddhism today.
4.  **Bhadracaryā**: Often called the *Praṇidhānarāja* (King of Prayers). It is the final section of the *Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra* (Avataṃsaka). Śāntideva here explicitly instructs utilizing these verses for the ritual.
