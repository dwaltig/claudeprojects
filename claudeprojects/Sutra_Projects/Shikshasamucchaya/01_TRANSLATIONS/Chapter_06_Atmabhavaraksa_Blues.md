## How You Cut the Fruitless

We talked about avoiding fruitless activity.¹ How do you actually do it?

> **This is accomplished by constant mindfulness.** (Kārikā 8a)

By standing guard. By watching. By paying attention.

Here's twelve ways mindfulness cuts the fruitless:

**1. Remember the Boss Man's orders got consequences**
Don't transgress the Tathāgata's command.

**2. Remember your body's naturally still**
Don't move needlessly. Keep it quiet.

**3. Remember deliberate action**
When there's work for beings, keep still what don't serve it.

**4. Remember composure when excitement hits**
Beginners get confused by fear, celebration. Don't let your limbs fly.

**5. Remember to check your four postures**
Walking, standing, sitting, lying—check 'em all.

**6. Remember to check the three postures** intermittently
Check for excellence. Don't slack.

**7. Remember speech-restraint**
When speaking, don't wave hands, feet, head wildly from excitement.

**8. Remember volume**
Speak just loud enough for the hearer to understand. Not excessively.

**9. Remember to purify minds in the crowd**
Crowded gatherings of untrained people? Purify your mind.

**10. Remember the mind-elephant**
Always tie it to the post of calm. Don't let it run wild.

**11. Remember to check the state of your mind**
Again and again. Keep checking.

**12. Remember your intent in big gatherings**
Protect mindfulness even if you drop other tasks.

Twelve ways to stand guard. Twelve ways to watch the house.

## Mindfulness Comes from Earnestness

> *Mindfulness arises from intense earnestness.* (Kārikā 8b)

Earnestness means being completely oriented toward your tasks. It's the antidote to contempt.

> **Earnestness arises from ardor, knowing the greatness of calm.** (Kārikā 8cd)

---


## The Inexhaustible List

What is this "calm" we been talking about?
The Akṣayamati Sūtra gives you the full list:²

> "What is inexhaustible calm?"

Listen to all of it:

Peace of mind. Thorough peace. Non-distraction.
Sense-restraint—keeping the doors locked.
Non-agitation, non-inflation—not stirred up, not puffed up.
Non-fickleness, non-restlessness—staying put.
Gentleness. Guardedness.
Workability, thoroughbred-ness—ready to go, well-trained.
One-pointedness—focused like a laser.
Delight in solitude—loving the quiet.
Avoidance of gatherings—staying away from the crowd.
Joy in seclusion—happy alone.
Seclusion of body—body in the quiet place.
Non-confusion of mind—mind clear as water.
Mental orientation toward forest—thinking about the woods.
Few desires—wanting less.
Guarding the postures—watching how you sit, stand, walk, lie.
Knowing the right time, knowing the occasion, knowing the measure.
Knowing liberation—understanding freedom.
Being easy to support, easy to maintain—not asking for much.

That's calm. **All of that.**
Not just one thing. The whole package.

---

## What Calm Does

What's so great about calm? **It generates knowledge of things as they are.**³

> *"One who is concentrated knows things as they are,"* said the Sage.

The Dharmasaṃgīti says:

> "For one of concentrated mind, there is seeing of things as they are. For the bodhisattva who sees things as they are, great compassion operates toward beings. He thinks: 'This samādhi-gate and seeing all dharmas as they are—I must accomplish this for all beings.'
>
> Urged by compassion, fulfilling the training in higher morality, higher mind, and higher wisdom, he awakens. 'Therefore I must be well-established in morality, unshaking, unbent.'"

Understanding this—the transcendence of endless suffering, the attainment of endless happiness—cultivate ardor like one inside a burning house wanting cool water. From that, earnestness. From that, mindfulness. From mindfulness, avoiding the fruitless. From avoiding, no harms arise.

**Therefore, to protect your person, trace out the root of mindfulness. Always be of established mindfulness.**

## The Bouncer at the Door

What is right mindfulness? The Ratnacūḍa Sūtra tells you:⁴

> "That mindfulness by which all afflictions don't arise—
> That mindfulness by which all Māra-works don't get access—
> That mindfulness by which you don't fall into wrong paths or bad roads—
> That mindfulness which, acting as **bouncer**, doesn't give opportunity to unwholesome states—
> This is called right mindfulness."

You understand?
Mindfulness is **the bouncer at the door of your mind**.

Standing there. Watching.
Checking IDs. Keeping the troublemakers out.

Afflictions try to come in? Bouncer says no.
Māra's works try to slip through? Bouncer blocks the door.
Wrong paths, bad roads, unwholesome states?
The bouncer don't let 'em through.

---

## Clear Comprehension

Clear comprehension is knowing what you're doing as you're doing it:⁵

> "Walking, he knows 'I am walking.' Standing, he knows 'I am standing.' Lying down, he knows 'I am lying down.' Sitting, he knows 'I am sitting.' However his body is disposed, so he knows it...
>
> He acts with clear comprehension in going forward, in going back, in looking, in bending, in stretching, in wearing the robe, in eating, drinking, chewing, in dispelling drowsiness, in coming, going, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and being silent."

That's clear comprehension. Knowing each moment.

---


## Everything Comes Down to the Mind

Morality leads to concentration. Concentration leads to morality.
Together, they complete the work of the mind.

And this is the extent of the bodhisattva training: **mind-training**.⁶
Why? Because mind is the root of all benefit for beings.
Get the mind right, everything else follows.

The Ratnamegha says:

> "All dharmas are preceded by mind.
> When mind is fully known, all dharmas are fully known."

Everything starts with mind. Everything ends with mind.

Now listen to what mind does:

> *"The world is led by mind.*
> *Mind doesn't see mind.*
> *By mind karma is accumulated, wholesome or unwholesome.*

How wild is the mind?

> ***Mind whirls like a firebrand***—spinning fire in the dark.
> ***Mind rushes like a horse***—galloping, untamed.
> ***Mind burns like a forest fire***—consuming everything.
> ***Mind sweeps away like a great flood***—nothing can stop it."

You hear that?
Your mind is a firebrand, a wild horse, a forest fire, a flood.

So what you gonna do?

Examine this. Dwell with mindfulness well-established.
**Don't go under the power of mind.**
**Make mind come under YOUR power.**

When mind is under your power?
All dharmas come under your power.
Get the mind, you get everything.

## Your Mind Is a City

The Gaṇḍavyūha teaches about "the city of the mind":⁷

> "All bodhisattva conduct is based on your own mind.
> All ripening of beings is based on your own mind.
>
> Your own mind must be supported with all roots of virtue.
> Your own mind must be moistened with Dharma-clouds.
> Your own mind must be purified from obstructions.
> Your own mind must be strengthened with vigor."

Listen to what this means.

When Sudhana was confused upon seeing Māyādevī, the goddess Ratnanetrikā gave him instructions. She said:

**Your mind is a city. Now here's how you run it:**

> **Guard the city**—don't dwell with delight in saṃsāra's objects. Keep the doors locked.
>
> **Adorn the city**—rely on the ten Tathāgata powers. Make it beautiful.
>
> **Purify the city**—remove envy, stinginess, and guile. Clean the streets.
>
> **Increase the city**—increase vigor for omniscience. Build it bigger.
>
> **Make the city impregnable**—don't be crushed by Māra-armies. Build the walls strong.
>
> **Expand the city**—suffuse all worlds with loving-kindness. Spread out.
>
> **Cover the city**—accomplish the Dharma-umbrella against all unwholesome dharmas. Put a roof on it.
>
> **Open the city**—cause all worlds to obtain what they need. Let the good stuff out.

What happens when you do this?

> "When the city of the mind is thus purified,
> all obstructions don't stand before you—
> neither the obstruction to seeing Buddhas,
> nor the obstruction to hearing Dharma."

That's your work:
Guard it. Purify it. Expand it. Make it impregnable.
Your mind is a city. Run it right.

---


## Your Only Job

Even now, you become capable of accomplishing beings' aims by generating faith:⁸

> *Non-fickle everywhere, by slow, affectionate, gentle speech,*
> *you attract worthy people and become one whose instruction is accepted.* (Kārikā 10)

And this is the bodhisattva's very task—**attracting beings.**
That's your only job.

Priyadarśana said it plain:

> "Thus the bodhisattva should practice so that merely by seeing him, beings generate faith.
> Why? For the bodhisattva, there is no other task except attracting beings.
> The ripening of beings—this is the bodhisattva's Dharma-assembly."

You understand? **No other task.**
Just attract beings. Make 'em want what you got.

---

## What Happens If You Fail

Now here's the danger:

> *One whose instruction is not accepted—*
> *the world, having disdained that seed of the Victor,*
> ***like fire hidden by ash, is cooked in hells and such.*** (Kārikā 11)

You hear that?
People disdain you? They disdain the Dharma through you.
They end up in hell.
**Your fault.**

Like fire hidden by ash—looks cold outside, burning inside.
They gonna get cooked.

The Ratnamegha gives you the summary rule:

> **"That by which beings become displeased—**
> **that you should carefully avoid."** (Kārikā 12)

Whatever makes people turn away from you?
**Don't do it.**

---


## What Not to Say

The Sāgaramati Sūtra lists unwholesome speech:⁹

Don't have sunken speech—speech that goes nowhere.
Don't have scattered speech—all over the place.
Don't have flowing speech—running like water, endless.
Don't have blazing speech—burning people up.
Don't have speech led by desire—chasing what you want.
Don't have vulgar speech—coarse and ugly.
Don't have unguarded speech—no filter.
Don't have speech kindling hatred—lighting fires.
Don't have restless speech—fidgety, anxious.
Don't have fickle speech—changing all the time.
Don't have actor-stage speech—performing, fake.
Don't place false testimony on another's face—don't lie on people.

The Tathāgataguhya Sūtra adds more:¹⁰

The bodhisattva's speech is:
Not desirous, not hateful, not deluded, not afflicted.
Not crushed-answer speech—don't break people down.
Not speech exalting your own side—don't boost yourself.
Not speech suppressing the other's side—don't tear them down.
Not speech favoring your own appearance—don't try to look good.
Not speech just for winning the debate—it ain't about winning.

---

## What to Cultivate

The Daśabhūmika Sūtra gives you the ideal:¹¹

Having abandoned unpleasant speech that destroys continuum,
utter speech which is:

Affectionate, soft, pleasant, sweet—like honey.
Dear-making, mind-pleasing—makes people feel good.
Beneficial, ear-pleasant—good to hear.
**Heart-going, love-producing**—goes straight to the heart, makes love.
Clear in sound, knowable, worth hearing—easy to understand, worth listening to.
Desired by many, pleasing to many—people want to hear it.
Praised by the wise—smart folks approve.
Bringing welfare and happiness to all beings—helps everybody.
Uplifting the mind, gladdening the mind—lifts people up, makes 'em glad.
Pacifying desire, hatred, delusion, and all afflictions—calms the demons down.

That's how you speak.
**Heart-going. Love-producing.**
Speech that goes to the heart and makes love.

---

## The Single Dharma

The Sāgaramati Sūtra gives you the summary:¹²

> "Another single dharma conduces to Mahāyāna-synthesis:
> **by examining your own faults, you protect all beings.**"

You hear that?
One dharma. One teaching. One practice.

**Examine your own faults, you protect all beings.**

That's it. That alone protects everyone.
Not by fixing them. By fixing yourself.

---


## Sharing the Alms-Food

Regarding constant medicine (alms-food), the Ratnamegha says:¹³

> "Of the alms-food:
> - One portion for fellow practitioners
> - Second for the suffering
> - Third for the destitute
> - Fourth for yourself
>
> Partaking, you partake without desire, without attachment—only for the body's maintenance.
>
> Partake so you're neither too emaciated nor too heavy-bodied. Too emaciated turns away from wholesome. Too heavy-bodied is overcome by torpor."

---

## The Dharma-Armor

The Ratnarāśi Sūtra gives detailed instructions on alms-gathering:¹⁴

> "Going to village or town for alms, don the Dharma-armor:
>
> - Seeing unpleasant forms, don't be repelled
> - Seeing pleasant forms, don't be attracted
> - Senses well-restrained, eyes looking only a plow-length ahead
> - Trained mind, not abandoning mental orientation to prior dharmas
>
> Wherever alms-food is obtained, don't generate attachment. Wherever not obtained, don't generate aversion.
>
> If from ten houses alms isn't obtained, don't be distressed. Think: 'These householders have many tasks. They're not obliged to give. It's wonderful they even notice me.'
>
> Whatever beings come within range of your eyes—women, men, boys, girls, even animals—toward them generate loving-kindness and compassion: 'May I act so that those who give me alms, I will cause to go to good destinations.'
>
> Having gathered alms, look about: 'Who here is a poor being to whom I'll give a share?' If you see one, give. If not, think: 'There are beings not in visible range. To them I offer the first portion.'
>
> While partaking, generate this thought: 'There are in this body eighty thousand families of worms. May they dwell happy by this nourishment. Now I gather them with materiality; having awakened, I'll gather them with Dharma.'
>
> If your alms is coarse, think: 'By coarse food, my body becomes light, fit for exertion. My excretion will be little. I'll have lightness of body and mind.'
>
> When alms is abundant, be an eater of measure. Then offer the rest: 'Whatever deer and birds are interested in food—may they partake.'"

That's the Dharma-armor for alms-gathering.

---


## The Buddha Says No

Protection of your person should be done with constant medicine—food.
**But not with fish and meat.**

The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra lays down the law:¹⁵

> "All meat is not to be eaten by a bodhisattva of compassionate nature—
> so I declare."

Why not?

> *Due to your own birth,*
> *due to misconduct,*
> *due to arising from semen and blood,*
> *as horrifying to beings—*
> ***the yogī should avoid meat.***

What else should you avoid?

> *Meat, onions, various liquors,*
> *garlic, and leeks—*
> ***the yogī should always avoid.***

What happens if you don't?

> *For gain, life is killed.*
> *For meat, wealth is given.*
> ***Both those evil-doers are cooked in Raurava hell.***

Listen to the judgment:

> *Whoever, transgressing the Sage's word,*
> *foolishly eats meat—*
> *initiated in Śākya's teaching but destroying both worlds—*
>
> ***They go to the supreme terrible hell.***
> *The meat-eaters are cooked in fierce Raurava and such.*

Now here's the key point—listen close:

> ***There is no meat that is three-fold pure***—*
> *not prepared, not wished for, not caused.*
> ***Therefore, meat should not be eaten.***

You hear that? No "three-fold pure" exception.
No loopholes. No excuses.

> *By one dwelling in loving-kindness always,*
> *it's entirely censured by me.*
> *One would be together with lions, tigers, deer, etc.*
>
> *Therefore, don't eat meat, which horrifies people.*
> *Being obstructed from liberation-dharma—*
> *this is the flag of the noble ones.*

That's the prohibition. Clear as day.
No three-fold pure meat.
**All meat is prohibited** for one of compassionate nature.

You dwelling in loving-kindness?
You seeking liberation?
**Don't eat meat.**

## Nothing Is Yours

Listen to this:

> *But from enjoying with self-craving, afflicted offense arises.* (Kārikā 13cd)

Here's the teaching:¹⁶

Everything has been relinquished by the bodhisattva to all beings.
**You don't own nothing.**

If forgetfully, with craving for self-maintenance, you partake of another's property?
You incur afflicted offense.

But if, free from craving, remembering the task for beings, you partake?
No afflicted offense.

Think about it this way:

If you perceive it as another's property and you partake for your own sake—
**that's theft.**
In the Prātimokṣa, that's *pārājika* defeat. You out.

But here's the twist:

With possessions owned by beings, the person (*ātmabhāva*) owned by beings is itself protected—so there's no fault.

You understand?
**You a servant.**
A servant, always occupied with the master's work, has no own-property.
Everything belongs to the master.

The Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra says it plain:

> "By the bodhisattva there should be dwelling **like a servant**—
> causing the accomplishment of all beings' service."

That's your position.
**Servant to all beings.**
Everything you have? It's theirs.
Your food? Theirs.
Your clothes? Theirs.
Your body? Theirs.

You don't own nothing.
You a servant.
Act like it.

*Thus ends the Sixth Chapter: Protecting Your Person.*

## Theological Notes

### The Twelve Mindfulnesses Are Practical
This isn't philosophy—it's a manual for how to move, speak, and think in daily life. Keep still what doesn't serve. Control your volume. Check your postures. Tie the mind-elephant to the post of calm.

### The City of the Mind
The Gaṇḍavyūha's "city of the mind" metaphor is powerful: your mind is a city. You must guard it, purify it, expand it, make it impregnable, and open it. When the city is pure, no obstructions stand before you.

### "Examining Your Own Faults Protects All Beings"
This single teaching from the Sāgaramati Sūtra summarizes everything. You don't protect beings by correcting them. You protect beings by correcting yourself.

### The Laṅkāvatāra Meat Prohibition
Śāntideva cites the Laṅkāvatāra's famous prohibition of meat-eating. Note: this text rejects even the "three-fold pure" exception found in some vinaya codes. For one of compassionate nature, all meat is prohibited.

### The Servant's Mind
The chapter ends with a radical teaching: everything you have belongs to all beings. You're their servant. If you partake of food, medicine, clothing with self-craving—that's offense. But if you partake remembering you're serving beings—no offense.
