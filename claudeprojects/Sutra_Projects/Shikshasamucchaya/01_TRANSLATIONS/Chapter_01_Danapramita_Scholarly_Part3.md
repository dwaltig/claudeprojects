## The Four Causes of Bodhicitta

As taught in the Daśadharmakasūtra:¹

> "Here, son of good family, one abiding in the bodhisattva lineage who has not yet generated bodhicitta—when encouraged, informed, and urged by the Tathāgata or by the Tathāgata's disciples—generates the mind toward unsurpassed perfect awakening. This is the **first cause** of generating bodhicitta.
>
> Upon hearing the glories of awakening or of bodhicitta being proclaimed, one generates the mind toward unsurpassed perfect awakening. This is the **second cause**.
>
> Seeing beings without protector, without refuge, without shelter, without island,² and establishing compassionate mind, one generates the mind toward unsurpassed perfect awakening. This is the **third cause** of generating bodhicitta.
>
> Seeing the Tathāgata's complete perfection in all aspects and generating delight, one generates the mind toward unsurpassed perfect awakening. This is the **fourth cause**."

---

## Two Types of Bodhicitta

That bodhicitta is twofold: **bodhipraṇidhicitta** (aspiration-awakening-mind) and **bodhiprasthānacitta** (engagement-awakening-mind).³

As stated in the Āryagaṇḍavyūhasūtra:

> "Rare, son of good family, are those beings in all the world who set their mind on unsurpassed perfect awakening. Yet rarer still are those beings who have set forth toward unsurpassed perfect awakening."⁴

Therein, **bodhipraṇidhicitta** arises from the aspiration "I shall become a Buddha."

## Even the Slightest Good Deed Matters

Even in the Śūragamasūtra it is stated that bodhicitta generated even through deceit becomes a cause of Buddhahood.⁵ How much more so when some wholesome deed is performed!

As stated in the Bhadrakalpikasūtra:⁶

> "The Tathāgata named Ghoṣadatta—it was there that the Tathāgata Nakṣatrarāja first generated bodhicitta by offering a betel leaf while he was a cowherd.
>
> The Tathāgata named Vidyutpradīpa—it was there that the Tathāgata Yaśas first generated bodhicitta by offering a shuttle while he was a weaver.
>
> The Tathāgata named Anantaprabha—it was there that the Tathāgata Arciṣmat first generated bodhicitta by offering a grass lamp while he was a city lamplighter.
>
> The Tathāgata named Dṛḍhavikrama—it was there that the Tathāgata Duṣpradharṣa first generated bodhicitta by offering a toothpick while he was a wood-gatherer."

And so forth.

## Even Imperfect Bodhicitta Must Not Be Despised

Even when bodhicitta is incomplete in practice, it must not be despised, since it produces infinite happiness throughout saṃsāra.

As described in the Āryamaitreyavimokṣa:⁷

> "Just as, son of good family, even a broken diamond gem surpasses all excellent gold ornaments, and does not lose the name 'diamond gem,' and turns back all poverty—so too, son of good family, even the diamond gem of generating the mind of omniscience, though broken in disposition and practice, surpasses the gold ornament of all śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha qualities, does not lose the name 'bodhicitta,' and turns back the poverty of all saṃsāra."

## The King's Practice: Bodhicitta Without Full Conduct

From this it should be known that bodhicitta is beneficial even without [full] conduct. As stated in the Aparārājāvavādakasūtra:⁸

> "Since, O great king, you have many duties and many responsibilities, and are unable to train completely at all times in the perfection of generosity... through to the perfection of wisdom... therefore, O great king, whether going, standing, sitting, lying down, awake, eating, or drinking—constantly and continually remember, establish in mind, and cultivate the desire for perfect awakening, faith, and aspiration.
>
> Having gathered, weighed, and combined all the roots of virtue of all Buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyekabuddhas, noble śrāvakas, ordinary beings, and yourself in the three times—rejoice! Rejoice with the supreme rejoicing, up to equality with space, equality with nirvāṇa!
>
> Having rejoiced, dedicate it to the worship of all Buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyekabuddhas, and noble śrāvakas. Having dedicated, make it common to all beings. Then, three times daily, dedicate toward unsurpassed perfect awakening for the attainment of omniscience by all beings and the fulfillment of all Buddha-dharmas.
>
> Thus practicing, O great king, you will rule the kingdom, you will not neglect the duties of kingship, and you will fulfill the accumulations for awakening."

---

## The Ripening of the King's Merit

And there too its ripening is stated:

> "You, O great king, through the ripening of that wholesome root-action of perfect awakening-mind, have been reborn among the gods hundreds of times. You have been reborn among humans hundreds of times. In all those divine and human rebirths, you exercise sovereignty alone.
>
> And, O great king, there is no diminishment or incompleteness apparent in that wholesome action of perfect awakening-mind. Moreover, O great king, even a single perfect awakening-mind, since it aims at the rescue of all beings, the liberation of all beings, the consolation of all beings, the parinirvāṇa of all beings—produces immeasurable, incalculable accumulation of virtue. How much more so when one cultivates it abundantly!"

## Mañjuśrī's Vows

This bodhicitta arises from seeing a form-body [of the Buddha].⁹ In the former birth-stories it is read... Thus aspiration-bodhicitta should be understood.

Now this must be said: Does one who has not entered the [bodhisattva] stages¹⁰ have the qualification for the bodhisattva vow or not? It should be known that they do...

As stated in the Āryamañjuśrībudddhakṣetraguṇavyūhālaṃkārasūtra,¹¹ the Blessed One, as Mañjuśrī in a former birth-story, generated bodhicitta endowed with practice. Thus should one generate it:

### Mañjuśrī's Aspiration Verses¹²

> **yāvatī prathamā koṭiḥ saṃsārasyāntavarjitā |**
> **tāvatsattvahitārthāya cariṣyāmyamitāṃ carim ||**

*"For as long as the first ten-million [eons] of saṃsāra endure without end, for that long shall I practice immeasurable conduct for the benefit of beings."*

> **utpādayāmi saṃbodhau cittaṃ nāthasya saṃmukham |**
> **nimantraye jagatsarvaṃ dāridryānmocitāsmi tat ||**

*"I generate the mind of awakening in the presence of the Protector. I invite the whole world—I shall free them from poverty."*

> **vyāpādakhilacittaṃ vā īrṣyāmātsaryameva vā |**
> **adyāgre na kariṣyāmi bodhiṃ prāpsyāmi yāvatā |**
> **brahmacaryaṃ cariṣyāmi kāmāṃstyakṣyāmi pāpakān ||**

*"Ill-will, a hardened mind, envy, or stinginess—from today forward I shall not produce them, until I attain awakening. I shall practice celibacy; I shall abandon evil desires."*

> **buddhānāmanuśikṣiṣye śīlasaṃvarasaṃyame |**
> **nāhaṃ tvaritarūpeṇa bodhiṃ prāptumihotsahe ||**

*"I shall train after the Buddhas in the discipline of ethical restraint. I do not strive to attain awakening here in haste."*

> **parāntakoṭiṃ sthāsyāmi sattvasyaikasya kāraṇāt |**
> **kṣetraṃ viśodhayiṣyāmi aprameyamacintiyam ||**

*"I shall remain until the final end of eons for the sake of even one being. I shall purify my buddha-field, immeasurable and inconceivable."*

> **nāmadheyaṃ kariṣyāmi daśadikṣu ca viśrutam |**
> **kāyavākkarmaṇī cāhaṃ śodhayiṣyāmi sarvaśaḥ |**
> **śodhayiṣye manaskarma karma kartāsmi nāśubham ||**

*"I shall make my name renowned in the ten directions. I shall purify my bodily and verbal actions completely. I shall purify my mental action; I shall not do evil deeds."*

## The Summary of Bodhisattva Training

This, in brief, is the body of bodhisattva training. In detail, however, it is an exposition that does not end even in immeasurable eons.

Or, in brief, there are two transgressions for a bodhisattva:¹³

1. **Undertaking without examining capacity**: If one undertakes what is appropriate or inappropriate to one's ability without examining, or does not desist or [wrongly] remains indifferent—one incurs transgression.

2. **Transgressing even when capable**: If, having examined and [knowing one is] capable, one transgresses nevertheless—even if prompted by a caṇḍāla slave¹⁴—one incurs transgression.

## The Great Fruit of Even Beginning Training

Whoever desires to practice this training should make effort here in the Śikṣāsamuccaya, learning at least the gateway of practice, since even beginning training has great fruit.

As stated in the Praśāntaviniścayaprātihāryasūtra:¹⁵

> "If, Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva were to give to each Buddha, numbering as many as the sands of the Gaṅgā, buddha-fields equal in number to the sands of the Gaṅgā, filled with the great gem Vaśirāja—giving thus for kalpas equal to the sands of the Gaṅgā—
>
> Or if another bodhisattva, Mañjuśrī, having heard these kinds of dharmas, were to go to a secluded place and examine with the mind, 'I shall train in these kinds of dharmas'—
>
> That bodhisattva, Mañjuśrī, even though untrained, desiring this training, produces more merit. That merit of giving alone is not [equal to this]."

---

## Fearlessness in Face of Persecution

Therefore a bodhisattva who sees these benefits must never turn back. As stated there:

> "If, Mañjuśrī, there were beings as numerous as the dust atoms of a three-thousand-great-thousand world-system, and each one became a king, lord of Jambudvīpa, and they all proclaimed: 'Whoever takes up, holds, recites, masters, and propagates the Mahāyāna seal—we shall cause him to descend by cutting off his fingernails for a month, day by day, and by this method we shall kill him'—
>
> If, Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva when thus addressed does not tremble, does not become afraid, does not fear even for a single mind-moment, does not despair, does not doubt, and moreover strives for embracing the true Dharma, abides devoted to study and recitation—
>
> That bodhisattva, Mañjuśrī, should be called 'hero of mind,' 'hero of giving,' 'hero of discipline,' 'hero of patience,' 'hero of energy,' 'hero of meditation,' 'hero of wisdom,' 'hero of samādhi.'
>
> If, Mañjuśrī, that bodhisattva does not become angry, does not feel hostility, does not produce a defiled mind toward those executioners—that bodhisattva, Mañjuśrī, is like Brahmā, like Indra, is unshakeable."

² **[Sanskrit]** *anāthānatrāṇanaśaraṇānadvīpān*: "without protector, refuge, shelter, or island"—a powerful image of beings adrift in saṃsāra.

³ **[Philosophical]** The distinction between *praṇidhicitta* (aspiration-mind, "wishing" bodhicitta) and *prasthānacitta* (engagement-mind, "entering" bodhicitta) is fundamental to Mahāyāna ethics. Aspiration is like wanting to travel; engagement is actually setting out.

¹³ **[Philosophical]** This is a crucial summary of bodhisattva ethics: transgression comes either from (1) acting without knowing one's capacity, or (2) knowingly failing to act when capable.

¹⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *caṇḍāladāsa*: A "slave of the outcaste class"—the lowest possible social position. Even admonition from such a person should be heeded.
