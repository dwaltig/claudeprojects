# Chapter 2: Embracing the True Dharma (Saddharmaparigraha)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

*The second chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on the protection and preservation of the true Dharma.*

---

## Introduction: The Protection of What Is Given

Thus, even when one's person, enjoyments, and merit have been relinquished,¹ they must still be protected.² Why? Because:

### Kārikā 5

> **paribhogāya sattvānāmātmabhāvādi dīyate |**
> **arakṣite kuto bhogaḥ kiṃ dattaṃ yanna bhujyate ||5||**

*"One's person and so forth are given for the enjoyment of beings; if unprotected, how can there be enjoyment? What gift is it that is not consumed [by them]?"*³

Therefore, one should protect one's person and so forth for the sake of beings' enjoyment.

---

## The Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa Teaching

As stated in the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa:⁴

> "Furthermore, Śāriputra, [thinking] 'I shall protect another,' the self must be protected. Endowed with such benevolent intention, Śāriputra, the bodhisattva does not do evil action even for the sake of [preserving] life."

---

## The Vīradattaparipṛcchā Teaching

In the Vīradattaparipṛcchā it is also stated:⁵

> "Śakaṭamitra, [the body] should be borne only with the intention of Dharma, for the sake of carrying the burden."

Likewise, in the Akṣayamatisūtra:⁶

> "One is not wearied by bodily suffering because of consideration for beings."

---

## Protection Through Spiritual Friends

How, then, should one protect one's person and so forth? **Through not abandoning spiritual friends** (*kalyāṇamitrānutsarga*).⁷

As stated in the Āryagaṇḍavyūha by the noble Śrīsaṃbhava:⁸

> "Bodhisattvas upheld by spiritual friends, O son of good family, do not fall into bad rebirths. Bodhisattvas attended upon by spiritual friends do not transgress the bodhisattva training. Bodhisattvas sheltered by spiritual friends rise above the world. Bodhisattvas served by spiritual friends become unforgetful in all bodhisattva practices. Bodhisattvas embraced by spiritual friends become invincible by karma and defilements.
>
> Spiritual friends are instructors: they restrain one from what should not be done, from places of heedlessness. They are those who lead one out from the city of saṃsāra.
>
> Therefore, O son of good family, with such mental orientation, one should approach spiritual friends with relaxed confidence:
>
> With a mind like **the earth**, in order to bear all burdens;
> With a mind like **a diamond**, in unbreakable intention;
> With a mind like **a mountain range**, in not trembling before any suffering;
> With a mind like **a servant of the world**, in not disdaining undertaking all tasks;
> With a mind like **a dust-cloth**, in abandoning arrogance and pride;
> With a mind like **a vehicle**, in carrying heavy loads;
> With a mind like **a dog**, in not becoming angry;
> With a mind like **a boat**, in not being troubled by going and coming;
> Like **a good son**, in gazing upon the face of spiritual friends.
>
> And in yourself, O son of good family, you should generate the perception of being **sick**; in spiritual friends, the perception of **physicians**; in their instructions, the perception of **medicine**; in practice, the perception of **curing the disease**.
>
> And in yourself, O son of good family, you should generate the perception of being **fearful**; in spiritual friends, the perception of **heroes**; in their instructions, the perception of **weapons**; in practice, the perception of **destroying enemies**."

---

## The Acalopāsikā Testimony

In the same [Gaṇḍavyūha], in the liberation of the lay-woman Acalā, it is stated:⁹

> "For a bodhisattva, O son of good family, who practices the instructions of spiritual friends, the blessed Buddhas become of pleased mind. For a bodhisattva who stands in conformity with the words of spiritual friends, omniscience draws near. For one who has no doubt regarding the words of spiritual friends, spiritual friends draw near. For one whose mental attention is never separated from spiritual friends, all purposes come face to face."

---

## Sudhana's Devotion

For this very reason, the noble Sudhana,¹⁰ having prostrated at the feet of the monk Sāradhvaja with his head, having circumambulated him hundreds of thousands of times, looking upon him, bowing down, looking again and again, certainly prostrating, paying homage, bending low, taking to mind, reflecting, contemplating, thoroughly contemplating, giving utterances of joy, making exclamations of "hā!", bringing to mind his qualities, completing remembrance, stabilizing memory, not abandoning, mentally drawing near, fastening his aspiration, immersing himself in the vision, grasping the sign of his presence—thus he departed from his presence.

Likewise, seeing omniscience as having come from spiritual friends, with tearful face, weeping, he departed from the presence of Megha the Dramiḍa.¹¹

---

## The Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa on Dharma-Desire

In the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa it is also stated:¹²

> "Here, Śāriputra, through desire for the Dharma, there is no treasure in the world that the bodhisattva does not relinquish. There is no bodily service that he does not perform. There is no errand on foot that he will not undertake. There is no verbal action that he will not undertake, out of respect for teachers and preceptors. And so on at length.
>
> For what reason? This Dharma conduces to the cutting of bonds. This Dharma conduces to the cutting of birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, and mental distress.
>
> Having generated the thought [of the Dharma] as a jewel, having generated the thought of medicine, [thinking:] 'This Dharma conduces to the pacification of the affliction of all beings'—and: 'We must seek such a Dharma for the pacification of the affliction of all beings.'"

---

## The Ugradattaparipṛcchā on Teacher-Reverence

In the Ugradattaparipṛcchā it is also stated:¹³

> "Moreover, householder, if a bodhisattva who is desirous of recitation and study hears from someone a four-line verse, or has it pointed out, or learns it—connected with giving, morality, patience, effort, meditation, or wisdom, or connected with the accumulation of bodhisattva provisions—then for that teacher he should show reverence for the Dharma commensurate with however many name-words and syllables are in the verse so pointed out.
>
> If he were to perform service and attendance upon that teacher for that many eons, without deceit, with all gain, honor, and worship—even then, householder, the reverence for the teacher would not yet be fulfilled. How much less the reverence for the Dharma!"

---

## The Story of Sadāprarudita: Part One

In the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā it is also stated:¹⁴

> "Therefore, O son of good family, intense reverence should be generated toward spiritual friends, and love should be shown.
>
> Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita,¹⁵ proceeding with such qualities of reverent mental attention, gradually reached a certain city. There, having entered the middle of the marketplace, this thought occurred to him: 'I will sell this very body of mine, and with that price I will make offerings to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Dharmodgata.¹⁶ For a long time, my thousands of bodies have been broken, exhausted, sold away. Again, in the immeasurable saṃsāra, I have experienced immeasurable [sufferings] for the sake of desire, with desire as cause. But not for such Dharmas, nor for the offering of such beings!'
>
> Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita, having entered the middle of the marketplace, raised his voice and proclaimed: 'Who wants a man? Who wants a man? Who wants a man?'
>
> Then Māra the Evil One so arranged the brahmins and householders that they did not hear that cry. When he could not find a buyer for himself, having gone aside, he began to weep and shed tears, speaking thus: 'Alas, what misfortune for us, that we cannot find even a buyer for our own body!'
>
> Then Śakra, lord of the gods, in the form of a young brahmin, approached the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita and said: 'Why are you, O son of good family, standing here with downcast face and anxious heart, shedding tears?'
>
> Sadāprarudita said: 'Young brahmin, I wish to sell this very body of mine out of desire for the Dharma, in order to make Dharma-offering. And I cannot find a buyer for it.'
>
> And so on at length.
>
> Then that young brahmin said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita: 'I have no need of a man, O son of good family. But my father has a sacrifice to perform. For that I need a man's heart, blood, and bone-marrow. Will you give [these] for a price?'
>
> Then this thought occurred to Sadāprarudita: 'What gain I have obtained! And I know myself to be accomplished in the skill in means of Prajñāpāramitā, in that I have found a buyer for myself—for my heart, blood, and bone-marrow!'
>
> With joyful mind, glad mind, delighted mind, he said to that young brahmin: 'I will give you, young brahmin, whatever you want from this body of mine.'
>
> Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita, taking a sharp weapon, pierced his right arm and let the blood flow. And having pierced his right thigh and made it fleshless, he approached the foot of a wall to extract the bone."

---

## The Story of Sadāprarudita: Part Two

> "Then a certain merchant's daughter, from the upper terrace of her mansion, saw the bodhisattva Sadāprarudita. She approached him and said: 'What are you, O son of good family, doing to yourself in this manner?'
>
> And so on. Having heard the purpose of the offering, she said again: 'What kind of benefit will arise for you from that?'
>
> He said to her: 'That son of good family will teach me the Prajñāpāramitā and skill in means. There we shall train. Training there, we shall become a refuge for all beings.'
>
> And so on at length.
>
> Then that merchant's daughter said to the bodhisattva Sadāprarudita: 'How wonderful, O son of good family! Such noble and excellent Dharmas have been proclaimed by you! For the sake of even one such Dharma, O son of good family, bodies equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River should be given up, throughout eons. So noble and excellent are these Dharmas proclaimed by you!
>
> But, O son of good family, I will give you whatever you need—gold, gems, pearls, lapis lazuli, and so on—by which you may make offerings to the bodhisattva Dharmodgata.'"
>
> And so on, at length, until she, attended by five hundred maidens, makes the journey to him.¹⁷

---

## The Seven-Year Meditation

> "Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Dharmodgata, rising from his seat, entered his own house. For seven years he remained absorbed in a single samādhi.¹⁸
>
> For seven years the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita did not generate a thought of sense-desire, did not generate a thought of ill-will, did not generate a thought of harm, did not generate greed for tastes—except: 'When will the bodhisattva mahāsattva Dharmodgata arise? We shall prepare a Dharma-seat for him where he will sit and teach the Dharma. And we shall sprinkle that patch of ground, sweep it, and scatter it with various flowers.'
>
> Those five hundred maidens, headed by the merchant's daughter, learning from the bodhisattva Sadāprarudita, passed the time in only two postures.¹⁹
>
> Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita heard a divine utterance: 'Seven days from now, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Dharmodgata will arise from this samādhi and, sitting in the middle of the city, will teach the Dharma.'
>
> Then, having heard that utterance, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita, joyful, delighted, filled with gladness and happiness of mind, cleaned that patch of ground. Together with the five hundred maidens headed by the merchant's daughter, he prepared a Dharma-seat made of the seven jewels.
>
> Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita, wishing to sprinkle that patch of ground, could not find water anywhere, searching all around. For Māra the Evil One had made all the water disappear, [thinking:] 'Perhaps, not finding water, his mind will become distressed, or grief will arise, or there will be some change of mind, by which his roots of virtue will disappear or not shine forth.'
>
> Then this thought occurred to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita: 'What if I were to pierce my own body and sprinkle this ground with my blood? For what reason? This patch of ground is dusty. May the dust not fall upon the body of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Dharmodgata. What would I do with this body that is certainly subject to destruction anyway? Better that this body of mine perish through such action than through powerless action. For the sake of desire, with desire as cause, my thousands of bodies have been broken again and again in the immeasurable saṃsāra while wandering. If they are to be broken, let them rather be broken for such a Dharma-circumstance!'"

---

## The Blood-Offering

> "Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita, having reflected thus, taking a sharp weapon, pierced his own body all around and sprinkled that entire patch of ground with his own blood. Likewise did those maidens also.
>
> Yet there was no change of mind for the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita or for all those maidens, by which Māra the Evil One might have found an opening."²⁰

---

## Never Abandon Spiritual Friends

Thus it is also stated in the Caturdharmakasūtra:²¹

> "Bhikṣus, a spiritual friend should not be abandoned by a bodhisattva for as long as one lives—not even for the sake of [preserving] life."

Thus indeed:

### Kārikā 6

> **kalyāṇamitrānutsargāt**
> **ātmabhāvādīnāṃ rakṣādikaṃ kāryam |**
> **sūtrāṇāṃ ca sadekṣaṇāt ||6||**

*"Through not abandoning spiritual friends, and through constant examination of the sūtras, the protection and so forth of one's person and the rest should be accomplished."*²²

---

## The Sūtras as Authority

For the bodhisattva training-rules are for the most part seen in the sūtras themselves.²³ Because of the statement: "In each of those sūtrāntas, the bodhisattva conduct, the bodhisattva training-rules, are prescribed."

Therefore, lest there be transgression through not examining them, and lest one who has transgressed remain unrestrained through ignorance—constant attention should be given to seeing the sūtras.

By this—through not abandoning spiritual friends and through seeing the sūtrāntas—all embracing of the true Dharma has been stated.

---

## The Sāgaramatisūtra Definition

As stated in the Āryasāgaramatisūtra:²⁴

> "By whatever syllables and etymologies that inexpressible Dharma is indicated, the teaching that is the support of those syllables and etymologies—as far as this, it is called embracing the true Dharma.
>
> Furthermore, O son of good family, those Dharma-preachers who are teachers of such sūtrāntas and who have practice as their essence—the serving, cherishing, attending, rising for, waiting upon, revering, honoring, listening to, protecting, and embracing of those Dharma-preachers; the giving of robes, alms-food, bedding, seats, and medicines for the sick; the giving of praise; protection of their reputation; protection of their wholesome qualities; praise-speaking and concealment of blame—this too is embracing the true Dharma.
>
> And so on at length.
>
> Furthermore, O son of good family, devotion to non-disputation, and the defeat through Dharma of those who speak wrongly about what is not Dharma—this too is embracing the true Dharma.
>
> Furthermore, O son of good family, for one of unobstructed continuity, of intellect intent on liberating all beings, of mind without material reward, the gift of Dharma to others—this too is embracing the true Dharma.
>
> Furthermore, O son of good family, even a single step taken for the sake of hearing the Dharma or for teaching the Dharma, even a single inhalation and exhalation—this too is embracing the true Dharma.
>
> And so on at length.
>
> This mind, O son of good family, rushes toward sense-objects. Its restraint, protection, one-pointedness, training, calming, pacification, discipline—this is called embracing the true Dharma.
>
> And so on at length.
>
> Furthermore, O son of good family, the non-grasping and non-attachment to a dharma through which adharma operates—this too is embracing the true Dharma."
>
> And so on.

---

## The Indispensability of Dharma-Embracing

In this [passage], through serving Dharma-preachers and so forth, not abandoning spiritual friends is taught, as well as the mark of a spiritual friend.²⁵

By this: without this embracing of the true Dharma, there is no protection, no purification, no increase. And therefore one is not a bodhisattva either.

**Therefore, embracing the true Dharma is entirely necessary.**

---

## The Śrīmālāsiṃhanādasūtra Teaching

As stated in the Śrīmālāsiṃhanādasūtra:²⁶

> "Whatever numerous bodhisattva vows there are, O Blessed One, equal to the sands of the Ganges River—all are deposited in one great vow, are included in it, are established upon it: namely, in embracing the true Dharma.
>
> Of such great scope, O Blessed One, is embracing the true Dharma."

---

## The Blow to Māra

Again in the same [sūtra] it is stated:²⁷

> "Just as, O goddess, even a small blow to a vulnerable spot is painful and injurious even for a person of great strength—just so, O goddess, even a little embracing of the true Dharma is painful to Māra the Evil One, is a cause of sorrow, is productive of lamentation.
>
> I do not see, O goddess, any other single wholesome dharma that is so painful to Māra the Evil One, so grief-causing, so lamentation-producing, as even this little embracing of the true Dharma."

---

## Greater Than Mount Sumeru

Again it is stated:²⁸

> "Just as, O goddess, Mount Sumeru, king of mountains, surpassing all the subsidiary mountains, shines forth and shines well through its height and breadth—just so, O goddess, the embracing of the true Dharma by a Mahāyānist who is heedless of body and life and who does not have a grasping mind surpasses all the wholesome dharmas even of those Mahāyānists newly set out [on the path], who are heedful of body and life."
>
> And so on.

---

## The Benefits Enumerated in Verse

Likewise in the Āryasāgaramatisūtra it is also stated:²⁹

> *Embraced is one by the Victors,*
> *by gods, nāgas, and kinnaras.*
> *Embraced by merit and knowledge—*
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.* (...and so on...)
>
> *One is never born in empty fields;*
> *in every birth one sees the Victor.*
> *Seeing him, one gains serene faith—*
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.*
>
> *One becomes a great being who remembers past lives,*
> *again and again obtaining the going forth [into homelessness].*
> *[One becomes] pure in conduct, with practice as essence—*
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.* (...and so on...)
>
> *One becomes skilled and obtains dhāraṇī;*
> *the good does not perish through hundreds of eons.*
> *One becomes eloquent and unattached—*
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.*
>
> *Śakra, Brahmā, and the world-protectors,*
> *a human king, a wheel-turning monarch on earth—*
> *with ease and happiness one awakens to enlightenment—*
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.*
>
> *Thirty-two marks appear upon one's body;*
> *one becomes blameless of limb and discerning.*
> *Those gazing upon one find no satisfaction—*³⁰
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.*
>
> *One's awakening-mind does not become confused;*
> *nor is one uplifted in the practice of perfections.*
> *Skillful among hundreds, one is not led astray—*
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.*

---

*Thus ends the Second Chapter, Embracing the True Dharma, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya, [found] within the Perfection of Morality.*³¹
