# Chapter 12: Preparation of the Mind (Cittaparikarma)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

**Summary**: Having established the practice of forest dwelling in Chapter 11, Śāntideva now describes the internal work required: the **Preparation of the Mind** (*Cittaparikarma*). This involves achieving one-pointed concentration (*samādhāna*), restraining the senses, and applying specific antidotes (*pratipakṣa*) to the defilements: foulness meditation for desire, loving-kindness for hatred, and dependent origination for delusion.

### 1. Sense Restraint and Concentration

Dwelling in the forest, one should devote oneself to concentration (*samādhāna*).
As stated in the *Bhagavatī (Prajñāpāramitā)*:¹

> "For the sake of those very beings, practicing the perfection of meditation (*dhyānapāramitā*), he becomes one of undistracted mind (*avikṣiptacitta*). Why?
>
> Even worldly meditation (*laukikī dhyānopapatti*) is hard to obtain for one of distracted mind—how much more the supreme perfect awakening! Therefore, I must be of undistracted mind."

The text continues:
> "He does not grasp at signs or features (*nimittānuvyañjanagrāhī*) when seeing forms with the eye. For if he dwelt with the eye-faculty unguarded, covetousness and dejection (*abhidhyā-daurmanasya*) would overflow the mind.
>
> Walking, standing, sitting, lying down, or speaking, he does not abandon the state of concentration (*samāhitāvasthā*).
>
> He is not restless of hand, foot, or face. Not scattered in speech. Not agitated, not inflated, not fickle, not lazy.
> In gain and loss (*lābhalābha*), pleasure and pain, praise and blame, fame and disrepute, he is even (*sama*), unchanged (*nirvikāra*), not elated or dejected (*anunnatānavanata*)."

### 2. Antidotes to Torpor and Agitation

If the mind sinks into **torpor** (*līna*), he should stimulate it with the cultivation of joy (*muditā*).
If the mind becomes **agitated** (*uddhata*), he should calm it with attention to impermanence (*anityatā*).

For the antidote to both, one should remember the verses from the *Ārya-Rāṣṭrapāla Sūtra*:²

> "After hundreds of millions of kalpas,
> Once in a while a Buddha arises, a Great Sage.
> That supreme moment (*kṣaṇa*) has been obtained today;
> If you desire liberation, abandon heedlessness (*pramāda*)."

And from the *Ārya-Lalitavistara Sūtra*:

> "The triple world is ablaze with the fire of death...
> Life passes quickly like lightning in the sky,
> Like water rushing down a mountain river.
>
> The pleasures of desire (*kāmaguṇā*) are like a dung-pit, like slight-points,
> Like honey on a razor's edge.
> Like dreams, like echoes, like mirages."

### 3. The Four Great Terrors (Death Meditation)

The *Rājāvavādaka Sūtra* provides a powerful contemplation on death through the metaphor of the **Four Mountains**:³

> "Just as four great solid mountains coming from the four directions would crush everything—grass, wood, and living beings—and escape by speed or force is impossible; so come four great terrors:
> 1.  **Old Age** crushing youth.
> 2.  **Disease** crushing health.
> 3.  **Death** crushing life.
> 4.  **Loss** (vipatti) crushing prosperity.
>
> Just as a lion seizes a helpless deer, so death seizes the living being.
>
> Alone, without companion, leaving this world, entering the great darkness...
> At that time, there is no other protection, no other refuge, except the Dharma."

### 4. Antidote to Desire: Foulness Meditation

For the defilement of **desire** (*rāga*), the antidote is **Foulness Meditation** (*aśubhā bhāvanā*).
As stated in the *Ārya-Ratnamegha Sūtra*:

> "He examines this body: 'In this body there are hair, nails, teeth, dirt, skin, flesh, bones, sinews, kidneys, heart, liver, lungs, intestines, feces, urine, pus, blood, bile, phlegm...'
>
> Examining thus, he thinks: 'Even a fool knowing these substances would not generate desire—how much less a wise one!'"

The *Prajñāpāramitā* adds the "Butcher's Eye" analogy:
> "Just as a butcher, having killed a cow and cut it into four pieces, examines it not as a 'cow' but as meat; so the Bodhisattva examines the body as elements (*dhātu*): earth, water, fire, wind."

And the "Charnel Ground" contemplations:
> "Seeing corpses in the charnel ground—swollen, blue, devoured by animals, skeletonized, scattered, pulverized to dust—he applies this to his own body:
> **'This body too is of that nature (*evaṃdharmā*), of that character, has not escaped that law.'**"

### 5. Antidote to Hatred: Loving-Kindness

For the defilement of **hatred** (*dveṣa*), the antidote is **Loving-Kindness** (*maitrī*).
As stated in the *Ārya-Akṣayamati Sūtra*, maitrī is of three kinds:
1.  **With beings as object** (*sattvārambaṇā*): For beginners.
2.  **With dharmas as object** (*dharmārambaṇā*): For those practicing the path.
3.  **With no object** (*anārambaṇā*): For those with the patience of non-arising.

The practice begins with dear ones, then neutral ones, then enemies, expanding to the ten directions.

### 6. Antidote to Delusion: Dependent Origination

For the defilement of **delusion** (*moha*), the antidote is the vision of **Dependent Origination** (*pratītyasamutpāda*).
This is detailed in the *Śālistamba Sūtra* (Rice Seedling Sutra):

> "Ignorance conditions dispositions (*saṃskāra*)... up to birth conditions old age and death.
> But Ignorance does not think 'I produce dispositions.'
> Nor do dispositions think 'We are produced by ignorance.'
>
> Just as the earth element supports the body's solidity without thinking 'I support'; just as the sprout arises from the seed without the seed thinking 'I produce'—so does the causal chain operate without an agent (*kāraka*)."

*(The chapter concludes with a detailed exposition of the twelve links of dependent origination through the metaphor of seed and sprout.)*

### Footnotes

1.  **Sense Restraint**: This passage parallels the Pali *Indriya-saṃvara* teachings, emphasizing that "grasping at signs" (*nimittaggāha*) leads to the influx of defilements.
2.  **Rarity of the Buddha**: The "Blind Turtle" analogy is implied here. The *kṣaṇa* (opportune moment) is hard to obtain.
3.  **Four Mountains**: A famous simile found also in the Pali *Pabbatūpama Sutta* (SN 3.25).
