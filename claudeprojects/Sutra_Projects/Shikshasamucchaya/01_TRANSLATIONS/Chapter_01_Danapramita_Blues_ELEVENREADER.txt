PART ONE: THE CALL AND THE RARITY

The Call to Listen

Come On In, Y'all

You been through it, ain't you?

Burning down in them low places,
torment after torment,
suffering that don't quit—
that's what happens when the mind won't settle.

So listen up now.
Listen good.
This teaching here? It's medicine for all that.

You hear me? Really hear me?
The one who listens without that big-head pride—
they drop that old evil like a bad habit,
burn off all that karma debt from way back when.

And what they get? Joy they never knew was possible.
And once you got it? You don't ever fall from that sweetness again.

---

The Rare Jewel

That waking-up happiness? It don't run dry.
You get riches that can't be matched.

This Dharma-jewel? Near impossible to find.
But you got it. Today. Right now.
This moment you're standing in? It's gold.

So be here. Be still. Listen with respect.

---

Everybody's Invited

Come on in, all you beings!
Gods and serpent-folk,
spirits of the air and waters,
hungry ghosts and heaven-lords—
everybody with a thirst to hear:

The Blessed One speaks for one reason only:
the good of all three worlds.

Y'all are welcome at this table.

---

The Author Speaks

Bowing Down

I bow to the Buddhas and their children,
I bow to the Dharma-body that holds it all,
I bow to everyone worth bowing to.

Now I'm gonna tell you how to walk this path—
the discipline of the Awakened One's own family—
putting together words that carry weight.

---

I Ain't Saying Nothing New

Look here, I ain't pretending to be clever.
Nothing I say here is new under the sun.
I can't even claim I got skill with words.

So this ain't really for your sake—
I'm just trying to train my own stubborn heart.

But maybe through this work, my faith gets stronger.
Maybe that momentum for doing good builds up.
And if somebody like me comes across this someday?
Then maybe it'll mean something to them too.

---

This Chance Don't Come Twice

Listen: this moment right here?
The conditions you standing in?
They're hard to get. Near impossible.

But you got 'em. You got what it takes
to do something meaningful with this human life.

So if you don't sit down and think about what's good—
if you let this slip by—
tell me: when's that chance coming around again?

It ain't.

---

The Elders Testify: What's Rare

Now the old sūtras speak up, congregation-style:

Rare is getting free of the eight bad places.
Rare is getting born human at all.
Rare is getting all the good conditions.
Rare is a Buddha showing up in your world.
Rare is having your senses working right.
Rare is hearing the Dharma at all.
Rare is meeting good folks who walk the path.

Rare is finding true spiritual friends.
Rare is getting taught the real way.
Rare is making an honest living.
Rare—so rare—is putting real effort into the truth
here in this human world.

You hear that? Everything lined up for you right now?
That's the rare stuff. Don't waste it.

---

PART TWO: FAITH AND THE WAKING-UP MIND

The Choice That Changes Everything

When you've really seen the suffering of this world—
seen it from the inside and the outside both—
and you start wanting something better,
something that brings peace...

That's when something stirs in you.
That's when you start asking the real question:

If I don't want fear and pain for myself,
and others don't want it either—
then what makes me so special
that I only look out for number one?

You see what I'm saying? We're all in this together.

---

The Root of Everything: Faith

So what's the first step? Faith.

Not blind belief—real trust. Trust grounded in the road you've already walked. The old Ratnolkā teaching puts it this way:

By faith you follow the Victorious Ones.
By faith you trust their teaching.
By faith in how the bodhisattvas live—
that's how the waking-up mind is born in great souls.

---

What Faith Does

Faith goes before you like a mother, like a guide.
It protects everything good in you. Makes it grow.

Faith dispels all your doubts,
carries you across the flood,
shows you the way,
teaches you how to be patient.

Faith is clear-minded—no muddiness, no pride.
It's the root of real respect.

Faith is a treasure-chest of wealth,
the chief of good conduct—
like a hand that gathers up all your virtue.

---

The Chain of Faith

Now listen—this is how it builds:

Those who have faith and respect for the Buddha?
They don't throw away their discipline or training.

Those who keep their discipline?
They're praised among the virtuous.

Those with faith in the Dharma?
They can't get enough of the teaching—they keep listening.

Those who keep listening?
They start believing in the inconceivable.

Those with faith in the Sangha?
They become unshakeable, devoted to the community.

Those who are unshakeable?
Their faculties get sharp and bright.

Those with sharp faculties?
They drop the bad company.

Those who drop bad company?
They embrace dharmic friends—spiritual kinfolk.

Those with good friends?
They pile up vast merit.

Those with vast merit?
They become great souls, full of the power of causes.

Great souls with that power?
They have noble conviction, distinguished and deep.

Those with noble conviction?
All the Buddhas bless them constantly.

Those blessed by the Buddhas?
In them the waking-up mind arises.

Those with the waking-up mind?
They're devoted to the qualities of the great sages.

Those devoted to the sages?
They're born into the Buddha-family, well-born.

Those born into the Buddha-family?
They're freed from false connection.

Those who are freed?
Their hearts are purified with clarity.

Those with purified hearts?
Their higher disposition is supreme.

Those with supreme disposition?
They always practice the perfections.

Those who practice the perfections?
They've entered the Great Vehicle.

Those in the Great Vehicle?
They worship the Buddhas through practice.

Those who worship through practice?
Recollection of Buddha is pure in them.

Those with pure recollection?
They always see and contemplate the Buddhas.

Those who see the Buddhas?
The Buddha never stands apart from them.

Those from whom Buddha never stands apart?
The Dharma never departs from them.

Those from whom Dharma never departs?
They are ever blessed by all the Victorious Ones.

---

The Rarity of Faith

And the old scripture concludes:

Rare among ordinary folks are those who have faith in teachings like these.
But those who've accumulated goodness, who've made merit—
they have faith through the power of causes.

Say you served beings as numerous as the dust of ten buddha-fields
for a whole eon, with every happiness—
even that merit ain't as great
as the merit of one who simply has faith in this teaching.

You hear that? Faith itself is the great offering.

---

The Waking-Up Mind: Bodhicitta

So you got faith. Now what?

Now you strengthen that waking-up mind—that bodhicitta.
Because that's what holds all your merit together.

Prince Lion asked the Buddha:
"By what action does one gather all good things?
How do you become dear to beings wherever you're born?"

The Blessed One said:
"Bend your mind toward awakening
for the liberation of all beings.
That's how you gather all things good.
That's how you become beloved."

---

What Bodhicitta Is

The Gaṇḍavyūha—that great Flower Ornament teaching—puts it this way:

Bodhicitta is the seed of all Buddha-qualities.
It's the field where all white dharmas grow.
It's the ground where all the world takes refuge.
It's like a father protecting all bodhisattvas.

It's like Vaiśravaṇa, cutting off all poverty.
It's like the wish-fulfilling gem, accomplishing all purposes.
It's like the auspicious pot, fulfilling all intentions.

It's like a spear conquering the enemy of afflictions.
It's like a sword severing the head of the defilements.
It's like an axe cutting down the tree of suffering.
It's like a weapon protecting from all dangers.
It's like a hook drawing beings out of the waters of saṃsāra.

It's like a whirlwind scattering all hindrances like grass.
It's like a summary gathering all the bodhisattva vows.
It's like a shrine for gods, humans, and all the rest.

So bodhicitta ain't just a nice feeling.
It's a seed, a sword, a hook, a shrine—
everything you need to walk this road.

---

PART THREE: THE VOWS, THE TREE, AND THE HEART OF GIVING

Mañjuśrī's Testimony

Now listen to how the great Mañjuśrī—back when he was just starting out—made his vows in front of the Lord. This is the testimony we follow:

---

The Endless Road

"For as long as saṃsāra keeps rolling
without end—ten million eons and more—
that's how long I'll walk this road
for the good of every being."

That's the first word: I'm in this for the long haul.

---

The Invitation

"I raise up the waking-up mind
right here, in front of the Protector.
I'm inviting the whole world:
I'm gonna set you free from poverty."

That's the promise: Everybody's invited to this liberation.

---

The Vow of Purity

"Ill-will, a hardened heart,
jealousy, stinginess—
from today on, I won't make them,
not till I reach awakening.
I'll walk the holy life.
I'll let go of evil desires."

That's the discipline: I'm cleaning up my act.

---

The Patient Road

"I'll train after the Buddhas
in the restraint of good conduct.
I ain't in a hurry to get enlightened—
I'm willing to wait."

That's humility: This ain't about me getting mine quick.

---

For Even One

"I'll stand here till the end of time
for the sake of even one being.
I'll purify my buddha-field—
immeasurable, inconceivable."

That's commitment: Even one soul is worth everything.

---

The Famous Name

"I'll make my name known
in all ten directions.
I'll purify my body-action completely.
I'll purify my speech-action.
I'll purify my mind-action.
I won't do evil deeds."

That's integrity: Inside and out, I'm getting right.

---

The Heart of It All

Now here's the thing, church—Śāntideva says the full training is so vast it can't be told in infinite eons. But if you want the essence, the vital points that keep you clean, here it is:

The Summary

Give yourself away.
Give your enjoyments away.
Give your merit away—past, present, and future.
Give it all to every being.
Then protect that gift. Purify it. Make it grow.

That's it. That's the whole bodhisattva vow in four lines.

---

What's Given vs. What's Kept

The old Ugradatta teaching lays it out like this:

What's given don't need to be protected. What's kept, you got to guard it.
What's given exhausts craving. What's kept feeds craving.
What's given has no grasping. What's kept is full of grasping.
What's given has no fear. What's kept is full of fear.
What's given supports the path. What's kept supports Māra.
What's given never perishes. What's kept rots away.
What's given brings happiness. What's kept brings suffering.
What's given drops afflictions. What's kept grows afflictions.
What's given is the deed of the good. What's kept is the deed of the foolish.
What's given is praised by all Buddhas. What's kept is praised by fools.

You see the pattern? Everything you hold onto holds you back. Everything you give breaks you free.

---

The Medicine Tree

Now here's the most powerful teaching in the whole chapter.

The Nārāyaṇa scripture says the bodhisattva should think like this:

"This body of mine? It's already given away.
It belongs to all beings—how much more my stuff!"

And then—this is the hard part—

"To those who need a hand, I give my hand.
To those who need a foot, I give my foot.
To those who need an eye, I give my eye.
Flesh to those who need flesh.
Blood to those who need blood.
Marrow. Limbs. Even my head."

---

The Tree That Heals

The teaching goes on:

"Think of a medicine tree.
When people come and take from it—
root, trunk, branch, bark, leaf, flower, fruit, sap—
the tree don't complain. It don't discriminate.
It just heals whoever comes.
Low, middling, or high—all get healed.

That's what the bodhisattva body is:
medicine for the world.
Whoever needs whatever—take it.
Hand, foot, eye, flesh, blood, bone—
it's all here for you."

That's radical generosity. Not "what can I spare?" but "take what you need from me."

---

The Five Immediacies

Mañjuśrī also taught the five things that lead straight to awakening:

First: Hold the waking-up mind and don't slip back to just saving yourself.
Second: Give everything away and don't let stinginess creep back in.
Third: Commit to protecting all beings and don't get tired and sit down.
Fourth: See all things as unarisen and unceasing and don't fall into wrong views.
Fifth: Aim for one-moment wisdom and don't stop or quit until you reach omniscience.

Those who keep these five? They wake up quick.

---

The Great Exchange

Now here's the thing about giving:

The scriptures say that even one thought of bodhicitta—aimed at rescuing all beings, liberating all beings, consoling all beings, bringing all beings to nirvāṇa—produces immeasurable, incalculable merit.

How much more when you actually live it?

And here's the paradox: By giving away everything—even your own body—you become like a hook with bait, drawing beings to liberation. You don't even get to enjoy what you give. You just... give.

And in that giving, you are liberated.

---

The Final Word

The Ratnamegha puts it plain:

"For the bodhisattva, giving IS awakening."

Not "giving leads to awakening." Not "giving prepares you for awakening."

Giving IS awakening.

The act of opening your hand, your heart, your whole self—that's it. That's the path and the goal in one.

---

Thus ends the First Chapter: The Road of Generosity.
