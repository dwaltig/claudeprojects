> **stacchrotumādaramudārataraṃ bhajadhvam ||1||**

*That [teaching],¹ through the hearing of which² the intense, repeated, endless suffering—the great burning³ and other torments of hell and other [realms]—experienced by you whose minds are unquiet, ceases to exist:⁴ cultivate with most excellent respect [the desire] to hear that!*⁵

---

### Kārikā 2: The Power of Hearing

> **śrutvā [ca yaṃ tyajati] pāpamanuddhatātmā**
> **pūrvārjitaṃ ca vipulaṃ kṣapayatyaśeṣam |**
> **aprāptapūrvamapi saukhyamavāpnuvanti**
> **hāniṃsukhācca na kadācidapi prayānti ||2||**

*Having heard [this teaching], one whose mind is not arrogant³ abandons evil and exhausts completely the vast [karmic debt] accumulated in the past. Such persons attain happiness never before obtained, and never again do they fall from that bliss.*

---

### Kārikā 3: The Rare Treasure

> **saṃbodhisattvasukhamuttamamakṣayaṃ [ca]**
> **[...]pyasamasaṃpadamāpnuvanti |**

> **labdhakṣaṇāḥ śṛṇuta sādaramucyamānam ||3||**

*[They] attain the supreme, inexhaustible happiness of perfect awakening⁴ and unequalled spiritual wealth. That jewel of Dharma, so exceedingly rare to obtain, has been obtained today. You who have gained this [precious] opportunity⁵—listen respectfully as it is proclaimed!*

---

### Kārikā 4: Invitation to All Beings

> **āyāntu ca tribhuvanaikahitasya vākyaṃ**

> **pretādayaḥ śravaṇajātatṛṣaḥ saharṣāḥ ||4||**

*Let gods, nāgas,⁶ and [all] beings come with serene minds to hear the words of the One whose sole purpose is the benefit of the three worlds.⁷ Let gandharvas, yakṣas, garuḍas, asuras, kinnara lords, hungry ghosts, and others come with joy, thirsting to hear!*

---

### Kārikā 5: The Author's Purpose

> **sugatān sasutān sadharmakāyān**
> **praṇipatyādarato'khilāṃśca vandyān |**
> **sugatātmajasaṃvarāvatāraṃ**
> **kathayiṣyāmi samuccitārthavākyaiḥ ||5||**

*Having bowed with reverence to the Sugatas⁸ together with their sons⁹ and [their] Dharma-bodies,¹⁰ and to all who are worthy of worship, I shall expound the entrance into the discipline of the Sugata's offspring¹¹ with carefully compiled meaningful statements.*

---

### Kārikā 6: Humility

> **na ca kiṃcidapūrvamatra vācyaṃ**
> **na ca saṃgrathanakauśalaṃ mamāsti |**
> **ata eva na me parārthayatnaḥ**
> **svamano bhāvayituṃ mamedamiṣṭam ||6||**

*Nothing new is to be said here, nor do I possess skill in composition.¹² Therefore this effort is not for the benefit of others—my wish is simply to cultivate my own mind.*¹³

---

### Kārikā 7: Potential Benefit

> **mama tāvadanena yāti vṛddhiṃ**
> **kuśalaṃ bhāvayituṃ prasādavegaḥ |**
> **yadi matsamadhātureva paśyed**
> **aparo'pyenamato'pi sārthako'yam ||7||**

*Through this [work], my impetus of faith¹⁴ for cultivating virtue increases. If another of similar disposition should see [this compilation], then from that [perspective] too, this is meaningful.*

---

### Kārikā 8: The Precious Opportunity

> **kṣaṇasaṃpadiyaṃ sudurlabhā**
> **pratilabdhā puruṣārthasādhanī |**
> **yadi nātra vicintyate hitaṃ**
> **punarapyeṣa samāgamaḥ kutaḥ ||8||**

*This endowment of favorable circumstances¹⁵ is extremely difficult to obtain, [yet] it has been obtained—it accomplishes the goal of human life. If one does not reflect upon what is beneficial here [and now], from where will such an opportunity come again?*

---

## The Rarity of Human Birth: Quotation from Gaṇḍavyūhasūtra

As stated in the Āryagaṇḍavyūhasūtra,¹⁶ in the Liberation [chapter on] Āryajayoṣmāyatana:¹⁷

> *"Rare is the cessation of the eight unfavorable conditions.¹⁸ Rare is obtaining a human body. Rare is the purity of favorable circumstances. Rare is the arising of a Buddha. Rare is the possession of complete sense faculties. Rare is hearing the Buddha-dharma. Rare is association with good persons.*
> 
> *Rare are genuine spiritual friends. Rare is proper instruction in the true method. Rare is right livelihood. Rare is compatible effort in the true Dharma in the human world."*

## Soul-Check Hints for Blues Version

- The opening is an *invitation*—call-and-response energy
- Verse 6's humility: "I ain't saying nothing new, just trying to fix my own heart"
- Verse 8's urgency: "This chance don't come twice"
- The Gaṇḍavyūha quotation is a *litany of rarities*—could be treated as congregational testimony


### Part 2: Faith as Foundation and the Arising of Bodhicitta


## The Arising of Bodhicitta in the Great Being

Having encountered such an opportunity, one who has well understood the suffering of saṃsāra from both conventional and ultimate perspectives, and who aspires to the peace of its cessation—through the influence of the Buddha-gotra,¹ this reflection arises in such a great being:

### Verse from [Bodhicaryāvatāra 1.1]²

> **yadā mama pareṣāṃ ca bhayaṃ duḥkhaṃ ca na priyam |**
> **tadātmanaḥ ko viśeṣo yattaṃ rakṣāmi netaram ||**

*When neither fear nor suffering is dear to me or to others, what distinction is there in the self such that I protect it and not the other?*

Thus, for the sake of oneself and the realm of beings:

### Kārikā [2]³

> **duḥkhāntaṃ kartukāmena sukhāntaṃ gantumicchatā |**
> **śraddhāmūlaṃ dṛḍhīkṛtya bodhau kāryā matirdṛḍhā ||**

*By one who wishes to make an end of suffering, by one who desires to reach the culmination of happiness: having made firm the root of faith, a firm resolve toward awakening must be made.*


## The Glory of Faith: Quotation from Ratnolkā-dhāraṇī

As stated in the Ratnolkā-dhāraṇī:⁴

> *By faith one follows the Victors;⁵ by faith one trusts the Victor's Dharma; by faith in the conduct of the Buddha's sons⁶ arises the mind of great beings toward unsurpassed awakening.*
>
> *Faith goes before, like a mother, like a guide; it protects and increases all good qualities. It dispels doubt, ferries one across the flood,⁷ it shows the way, is the forerunner of patience.*
>
> *Faith is the clarity of an undefiled mind; it is the root of respect, free from pride. Faith is the treasure-store of wealth, the chief of good conduct—like a hand, it is the root of gathering virtue.*
>
> *Faith produces joy in giving; faith produces delight in the Buddha-dharma. Faith creates distinction in the knowledge of qualities; it leads one to the Buddha-path.*
>
> *For sharpness and radiance of the faculties—faith is the power. For invincibility—faith. For being unassailable by afflictions—faith in the qualities of the Self-Arisen Ones.*
>
> *Faith is non-attachment to the pleasures of attachment; it avoids unfavorable moments, foremost in [seizing] the opportune moment. Faith crosses beyond the path of Māra;⁸ it shows the supreme path of liberation.*
>
> *Faith is the uncorrupted seed, the cause of qualities; faith makes the bodhi-tree⁹ sprout. It increases wisdom, distinction, and happiness; faith reveals all the Victors.*
>
> *Those who ever have faith and respect for the Buddha—they do not abandon discipline or training. Those who do not abandon discipline or training—they are praised as virtuous, those who possess virtue.*
>
> *Those who ever have faith and respect for the Dharma—they listen insatiably to the Victor's Dharma. Those who listen insatiably to the Victor's Dharma—in them arises conviction in the inconceivable Dharma.*
>
> *Those who ever have faith and respect for the Saṅgha—they are irreversible, devoted to the Saṅgha. Those irreversible, devoted to the Saṅgha—they are irreversible through the power of faith.*
>
> *Those irreversible through the power of faith—their faculties are sharp and radiant. Those whose faculties are sharp and radiant—they have abandoned evil companions.*
>
> *Those who have abandoned evil companions—they embrace dharmic friends.¹⁰ Those who embrace dharmic friends—they accumulate vast merit.*
>
> *Those who accumulate vast merit—they are great beings endowed with the power of causes. Great beings endowed with the power of causes—they have distinguished noble conviction.*
>
> *Those with distinguished noble conviction—they are ever blessed by all the Victors. Those ever blessed by all the Victors—in them arises the mind of awakening.*
>
> *Those in whom arises the mind of awakening—they are devoted to the qualities of the great ṛṣis. Those devoted to the qualities of the great ṛṣis—they are born in the Buddha-family, well-born.*
>
> *Those born in the Buddha-family, well-born—they are freed from [wrong] connection and disconnection. Those freed from connection and disconnection—their disposition is purified with clarity.*
>
> *Those whose disposition is purified with clarity—their higher disposition is supreme and excellent. Those whose higher disposition is supreme—they ever practice the perfections.*
>
> *Those who ever practice the perfections—they have entered the Great Vehicle here. Those who have entered the Great Vehicle—they worship the Buddhas through practice.*
>
> *Those who worship the Buddhas through practice—in them recollection of Buddha is undefiled. Those in whom recollection of Buddha is undefiled—they ever see and contemplate the Buddhas.*
>
> *Those who ever see and contemplate the Buddhas—the Buddha never stands apart from them. Those from whom the Buddha never stands apart—the Dharma never departs from them.*
>
> *Those from whom the Dharma never departs—they are ever blessed by all the Victors.*

Thus is the endless elaboration of the root of faith spoken there. Having completed that [section], it concludes briefly:

> *Rare among ordinary sentient beings are those who have faith in such Dharmas. But those who have accumulated virtue and made merit—they have faith through the power of causes.*
>
> *One who might attend upon beings equal to the dust of ten fields¹¹ for a kalpa with all happiness—that merit is not as great as the merit of one who has faith in these Dharmas.*


## Additional Testimonies on Faith

### From Āryadadaśadharmasūtra¹²

> *Faith is the supreme vehicle by which the guides depart. Therefore the wise person should cultivate following faith.*
>
> *For one without faith, white dharmas do not grow—like green shoots from seeds burned by fire.*

### From Āryalalitavistarasūtra¹³

*"Ānanda, effort should be made in faith. This the Tathāgata declares."*

### From Siṃhaparipṛcchā¹⁴

*"Through faith, one avoids unfavorable moments."*


## Making Bodhicitta Firm

Thus, having made firm the root of faith, bodhicitta must be made firm, since it encompasses all merit. As stated in the Āryasiṃhaparipṛcchā, when the Blessed One was questioned by Prince Siṃha:

> **saṃgrahaḥ sarvadharmāṇāṃ karmaṇā kena jāyate |**
> **priyaśca bhoti sattvānāṃ yatra yatropapadyate ||**

*"By what action does the encompassing of all dharmas arise? And [how does one become] dear to beings wherever one is reborn?"*

The Blessed One said:

> **sarvasattvapramokṣāya cittaṃ bodhāya nāmayet |**
> **eṣa saṃgraha dharmāṇāṃ bhavate tena ca priyaḥ ||**

*"One should bend the mind toward awakening for the liberation of all beings. This is the encompassing of dharmas; thereby one becomes dear [to all]."*


## The Glories of Bodhicitta: Quotation from Gaṇḍavyūhasūtra

Likewise in the Āryagaṇḍavyūhasūtra it is described:

> *"Bodhicitta, son of good family, is the seed of all Buddha-dharmas. It is the field for the growth of white dharmas of all the world.¹⁵ It is the ground as refuge for all the world... It is like a father for the protection of all bodhisattvas.*
>
> *...It is like Vaiśravaṇa¹⁶ for cutting off all poverty. It is like the wish-fulfilling gem-king for accomplishing all purposes. It is like the auspicious pot¹⁷ for fulfilling all intentions. It is like a spear for conquering the enemy of afflictions. It is like Dharma for cutting off improper mental engagement.*
>
> *It is like a sword for severing the head of afflictions. It is like an axe for cutting the tree of suffering. It is like a weapon for protecting from all dangers. It is like a hook for drawing beings out of the waters of saṃsāra. It is like a whirlwind for scattering the grass of all obscurations and hindrances.*
>
> *It is like a summary for collecting all the vows and aspirations of bodhisattvas. It is like a caitya for the world with its gods, humans, and asuras.*
>
> *Thus, son of good family, bodhicitta is endowed with these and other immeasurable distinct qualities."*

- Faith here isn't blind belief—it's *trust grounded in experience*. Blues epistemology: "I believe because I've been there."
- The image of faith as "mother" and "guide" is powerful—maternal/ancestral wisdom
- Bodhicitta as "seed," "field," "sword," "axe"—rich metaphor territory


### Part 3: Types of Bodhicitta, Mañjuśrī's Vows, and the Bodhisattva Discipline


## The Four Causes of Bodhicitta

As taught in the Daśadharmakasūtra:¹

> "Here, son of good family, one abiding in the bodhisattva lineage who has not yet generated bodhicitta—when encouraged, informed, and urged by the Tathāgata or by the Tathāgata's disciples—generates the mind toward unsurpassed perfect awakening. This is the **first cause** of generating bodhicitta.
>
> Upon hearing the glories of awakening or of bodhicitta being proclaimed, one generates the mind toward unsurpassed perfect awakening. This is the **second cause**.
>
> Seeing beings without protector, without refuge, without shelter, without island,² and establishing compassionate mind, one generates the mind toward unsurpassed perfect awakening. This is the **third cause** of generating bodhicitta.
>
> Seeing the Tathāgata's complete perfection in all aspects and generating delight, one generates the mind toward unsurpassed perfect awakening. This is the **fourth cause**."


## Two Types of Bodhicitta

That bodhicitta is twofold: **bodhipraṇidhicitta** (aspiration-awakening-mind) and **bodhiprasthānacitta** (engagement-awakening-mind).³

As stated in the Āryagaṇḍavyūhasūtra:

> "Rare, son of good family, are those beings in all the world who set their mind on unsurpassed perfect awakening. Yet rarer still are those beings who have set forth toward unsurpassed perfect awakening."⁴

Therein, **bodhipraṇidhicitta** arises from the aspiration "I shall become a Buddha." 


## Even the Slightest Good Deed Matters

Even in the Śūragamasūtra it is stated that bodhicitta generated even through deceit becomes a cause of Buddhahood.⁵ How much more so when some wholesome deed is performed!

As stated in the Bhadrakalpikasūtra:⁶

> "The Tathāgata named Ghoṣadatta—it was there that the Tathāgata Nakṣatrarāja first generated bodhicitta by offering a betel leaf while he was a cowherd.
>
> The Tathāgata named Vidyutpradīpa—it was there that the Tathāgata Yaśas first generated bodhicitta by offering a shuttle while he was a weaver.
>
> The Tathāgata named Anantaprabha—it was there that the Tathāgata Arciṣmat first generated bodhicitta by offering a grass lamp while he was a city lamplighter.
>
> The Tathāgata named Dṛḍhavikrama—it was there that the Tathāgata Duṣpradharṣa first generated bodhicitta by offering a toothpick while he was a wood-gatherer."

And so forth.


## Even Imperfect Bodhicitta Must Not Be Despised

Even when bodhicitta is incomplete in practice, it must not be despised, since it produces infinite happiness throughout saṃsāra.

As described in the Āryamaitreyavimokṣa:⁷

> "Just as, son of good family, even a broken diamond gem surpasses all excellent gold ornaments, and does not lose the name 'diamond gem,' and turns back all poverty—so too, son of good family, even the diamond gem of generating the mind of omniscience, though broken in disposition and practice, surpasses the gold ornament of all śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha qualities, does not lose the name 'bodhicitta,' and turns back the poverty of all saṃsāra."


## The King's Practice: Bodhicitta Without Full Conduct

From this it should be known that bodhicitta is beneficial even without [full] conduct. As stated in the Aparārājāvavādakasūtra:⁸

> "Since, O great king, you have many duties and many responsibilities, and are unable to train completely at all times in the perfection of generosity... through to the perfection of wisdom... therefore, O great king, whether going, standing, sitting, lying down, awake, eating, or drinking—constantly and continually remember, establish in mind, and cultivate the desire for perfect awakening, faith, and aspiration.
>
> Having gathered, weighed, and combined all the roots of virtue of all Buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyekabuddhas, noble śrāvakas, ordinary beings, and yourself in the three times—rejoice! Rejoice with the supreme rejoicing, up to equality with space, equality with nirvāṇa!
>
> Having rejoiced, dedicate it to the worship of all Buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyekabuddhas, and noble śrāvakas. Having dedicated, make it common to all beings. Then, three times daily, dedicate toward unsurpassed perfect awakening for the attainment of omniscience by all beings and the fulfillment of all Buddha-dharmas.
>
> Thus practicing, O great king, you will rule the kingdom, you will not neglect the duties of kingship, and you will fulfill the accumulations for awakening."


## The Ripening of the King's Merit

And there too its ripening is stated:

> "You, O great king, through the ripening of that wholesome root-action of perfect awakening-mind, have been reborn among the gods hundreds of times. You have been reborn among humans hundreds of times. In all those divine and human rebirths, you exercise sovereignty alone.
>
> And, O great king, there is no diminishment or incompleteness apparent in that wholesome action of perfect awakening-mind. Moreover, O great king, even a single perfect awakening-mind, since it aims at the rescue of all beings, the liberation of all beings, the consolation of all beings, the parinirvāṇa of all beings—produces immeasurable, incalculable accumulation of virtue. How much more so when one cultivates it abundantly!"


## Mañjuśrī's Vows

This bodhicitta arises from seeing a form-body [of the Buddha].⁹ In the former birth-stories it is read... Thus aspiration-bodhicitta should be understood.

Now this must be said: Does one who has not entered the [bodhisattva] stages¹⁰ have the qualification for the bodhisattva vow or not? It should be known that they do...

As stated in the Āryamañjuśrībudddhakṣetraguṇavyūhālaṃkārasūtra,¹¹ the Blessed One, as Mañjuśrī in a former birth-story, generated bodhicitta endowed with practice. Thus should one generate it:

### Mañjuśrī's Aspiration Verses¹²

> **yāvatī prathamā koṭiḥ saṃsārasyāntavarjitā |**
> **tāvatsattvahitārthāya cariṣyāmyamitāṃ carim ||**

*"For as long as the first ten-million [eons] of saṃsāra endure without end, for that long shall I practice immeasurable conduct for the benefit of beings."*

> **utpādayāmi saṃbodhau cittaṃ nāthasya saṃmukham |**
> **nimantraye jagatsarvaṃ dāridryānmocitāsmi tat ||**

*"I generate the mind of awakening in the presence of the Protector. I invite the whole world—I shall free them from poverty."*

> **vyāpādakhilacittaṃ vā īrṣyāmātsaryameva vā |**
> **adyāgre na kariṣyāmi bodhiṃ prāpsyāmi yāvatā |**
> **brahmacaryaṃ cariṣyāmi kāmāṃstyakṣyāmi pāpakān ||**

*"Ill-will, a hardened mind, envy, or stinginess—from today forward I shall not produce them, until I attain awakening. I shall practice celibacy; I shall abandon evil desires."*

> **buddhānāmanuśikṣiṣye śīlasaṃvarasaṃyame |**
> **nāhaṃ tvaritarūpeṇa bodhiṃ prāptumihotsahe ||**

*"I shall train after the Buddhas in the discipline of ethical restraint. I do not strive to attain awakening here in haste."*

> **parāntakoṭiṃ sthāsyāmi sattvasyaikasya kāraṇāt |**
> **kṣetraṃ viśodhayiṣyāmi aprameyamacintiyam ||**

*"I shall remain until the final end of eons for the sake of even one being. I shall purify my buddha-field, immeasurable and inconceivable."*

> **nāmadheyaṃ kariṣyāmi daśadikṣu ca viśrutam |**
> **kāyavākkarmaṇī cāhaṃ śodhayiṣyāmi sarvaśaḥ |**
> **śodhayiṣye manaskarma karma kartāsmi nāśubham ||**

*"I shall make my name renowned in the ten directions. I shall purify my bodily and verbal actions completely. I shall purify my mental action; I shall not do evil deeds."*


## The Summary of Bodhisattva Training

This, in brief, is the body of bodhisattva training. In detail, however, it is an exposition that does not end even in immeasurable eons.

Or, in brief, there are two transgressions for a bodhisattva:¹³

1. **Undertaking without examining capacity**: If one undertakes what is appropriate or inappropriate to one's ability without examining, or does not desist or [wrongly] remains indifferent—one incurs transgression.

2. **Transgressing even when capable**: If, having examined and [knowing one is] capable, one transgresses nevertheless—even if prompted by a caṇḍāla slave¹⁴—one incurs transgression.


## The Great Fruit of Even Beginning Training

Whoever desires to practice this training should make effort here in the Śikṣāsamuccaya, learning at least the gateway of practice, since even beginning training has great fruit.

As stated in the Praśāntaviniścayaprātihāryasūtra:¹⁵

> "If, Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva were to give to each Buddha, numbering as many as the sands of the Gaṅgā, buddha-fields equal in number to the sands of the Gaṅgā, filled with the great gem Vaśirāja—giving thus for kalpas equal to the sands of the Gaṅgā—
>
> Or if another bodhisattva, Mañjuśrī, having heard these kinds of dharmas, were to go to a secluded place and examine with the mind, 'I shall train in these kinds of dharmas'—
>
> That bodhisattva, Mañjuśrī, even though untrained, desiring this training, produces more merit. That merit of giving alone is not [equal to this]."


## Fearlessness in Face of Persecution

Therefore a bodhisattva who sees these benefits must never turn back. As stated there:

> "If, Mañjuśrī, there were beings as numerous as the dust atoms of a three-thousand-great-thousand world-system, and each one became a king, lord of Jambudvīpa, and they all proclaimed: 'Whoever takes up, holds, recites, masters, and propagates the Mahāyāna seal—we shall cause him to descend by cutting off his fingernails for a month, day by day, and by this method we shall kill him'—
>
> If, Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva when thus addressed does not tremble, does not become afraid, does not fear even for a single mind-moment, does not despair, does not doubt, and moreover strives for embracing the true Dharma, abides devoted to study and recitation—
>
> That bodhisattva, Mañjuśrī, should be called 'hero of mind,' 'hero of giving,' 'hero of discipline,' 'hero of patience,' 'hero of energy,' 'hero of meditation,' 'hero of wisdom,' 'hero of samādhi.'
>
> If, Mañjuśrī, that bodhisattva does not become angry, does not feel hostility, does not produce a defiled mind toward those executioners—that bodhisattva, Mañjuśrī, is like Brahmā, like Indra, is unshakeable."

## Key Concepts

- **Bodhipraṇidhicitta** (बोधिप्रणिधिचित्त): Aspiration-bodhicitta—the wish to attain awakening
- **Bodhiprasthānacitta** (बोधिप्रस्थानचित्त): Engagement-bodhicitta—actually entering the path
- **Catvāri kāraṇāni** (चत्वारि कारणानि): The four causes of generating bodhicitta
- **Śūra** (शूर): Hero—the epithet for a fearless bodhisattva


## Soul-Check Hints for Blues Version

- Mañjuśrī's vows are *personal testimony*—"I will..." statements of commitment. Treat as Blues commitment/vow.
- The broken diamond image is powerful: even flawed bodhicitta outshines perfect self-centered virtue
- The King's practice shows that *everyone* can practice, regardless of circumstances
- The persecution passage has martyrdom energy—the willingness to suffer for the truth


### Part 4: The Core Summary, Self-Offering, and Dedication of Merit


## The Great Merit of Training

From the Candrapradīpasūtra:¹

> *One who serves tens of millions of koṭis of Buddhas*
> *with food and drink, with serene mind,*
> *with parasols, banners, and rows of lamps,*
> *for koṭis of kalpas like the sands of the Gaṅgā—*
>
> *And one who, when the true Dharma is fading,*
> *when the Sugata's teaching is ceasing,*
> *practices the training for one day and night—*
> *this produces merit more distinguished than that.*

Therefore, effort should be made here.


## The Bodhisattva Training Precepts

The bodhisattva training precepts have been stated in the sūtras. As stated in the Āryaratnamegha:²

> "How, son of good family, do bodhisattvas become restrained by the bodhisattva-training-vow? Here a bodhisattva reflects thus: 'By the mere prātimokṣa restraint I am not able to fully awaken to unsurpassed perfect awakening. Rather, I must train in those bodhisattva conduct-precepts that have been established by the Tathāgata in those various sūtras.'"

And so forth at length. Therefore, for those of dull intelligence like us, since it is difficult to know due to being extensively stated:

### Kārikā 3

> **marmasthānānyato vidyād yenānāpattiko bhavet ||3||**

*"Therefore one should know the vital points by which one becomes free of transgression."*³


## The Core Summary: Kārikā 4

What are those vital points that are stated in the sūtras for the benefit of those devoted to the Mahāyāna?

Namely:

### Kārikā 4

> **ātmabhāvasya bhogānāṃ tryadhvavṛtteḥ śubhasya ca |**
> **utsargaḥ sarvasattvebhyas tadrakṣā śuddhivardhanam ||4||**

*The relinquishment of one's own person,⁴ enjoyments, and merit accrued in the three times,⁵ to all beings; [and] the safeguarding of that [relinquishment] is purification and increase.*⁺

> **[Professor's Note]:** *This verse presents two distinct statements: (1) the three-fold giving (ātmabhāva, bhoga, śubha) to all beings, and (2) the protection of that act of giving as itself a means of purification and increase of merit. The dual-statement structure is essential to Śāntideva's rhetoric.*


## The Essence of the Bodhisattva Vow

This is the summary of the bodhisattva vow-restraint, in which transgressions are established even for bodhisattvas who pause in their practice.

As stated in the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa:⁶

> "The path that the bodhisattva has taken up leads to the cessation of suffering for all beings. If, for a bodhisattva established on that path, even after the passing of ten million kalpas, a single thought of [personal] happiness should arise—even a thought of sitting down—the bodhisattva should generate this thought: 'Having taken up the urgent [welfare] of all beings, I sit down while abandoning even this [personal comfort].'"


## The Five Immediacies

Also Mañjuśrī said:

> "There are these five immediacies,⁷ Son of the Gods, endowed with which bodhisattvas swiftly fully awaken to unsurpassed perfect awakening. What are the five?
>
> 1. When, Son of the Gods, a bodhisattva generates the mind toward unsurpassed perfect awakening with sincere intention and does not in the meantime generate the mind toward the śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha stage—this, Son of the Gods, is the **first immediacy**.
>
> 2. Having generated the mind for the relinquishment of one's entire [being], one does not in the meantime associate with a stingy mind—this, Son of the Gods, is the **second immediacy**.
>
> 3. Having generated the thought 'All beings are to be protected by me,' one does not in the meantime sink down—this, Son of the Gods, is the **third immediacy**.
>
> 4. Having generated the thought 'I shall comprehend all dharmas as unarisen and unceasing,' one does not in the meantime fall into wrong views—this, Son of the Gods, is the **fourth immediacy**.
>
> 5. Having generated the thought 'Through wisdom united with a single moment, I shall comprehend all dharmas,' one does not in the meantime stand still, does not spit [on the path], until omniscience is attained—this, Son of the Gods, is the **fifth immediacy**."


## The Practice of Relinquishment

Therefore, the relinquishment, protection, purification, and increase of one's person, enjoyments, and merit should be cultivated as appropriate.

There, first, for the purpose of relinquishment, one should generate dispassion through the door of contemplating the faults of grasping, and should cultivate the benefits of giving.

As stated in the Candrapradīpasūtra:⁸

> *Those fools who are attached to this putrid body,*
> *to this unstable, powerless life like an illusion, like a dream—*
> *having done extremely terrible deeds, following the power of delusion,*
> *they go to terrible hells, unwise ones who have mounted the vehicle of death.*


## The Medicine Tree of the Body

As stated in the Anantamukhanirhāradhāraṇī:⁹

> *Whatever beings do not experience conflict—grasping is the root-cause of that.*
> *Therefore one should abandon wherever craving might arise; for one who has abandoned craving, there is dhāraṇī.*

As stated in the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa:

> "Furthermore, Śāriputra, the bodhisattva generates the perception of 'belonging to another' in all dharmas. He does not grasp any phenomenon. Why? Because grasping is fear."

As stated in the Āryogradattaparipṛcchā:¹⁰

> "What is given no longer needs to be protected; what is in the house must be protected. What is given leads to the exhaustion of craving; what is in the house increases craving. What is given is without grasping; what is in the house is with grasping. What is given is without fear; what is in the house is with fear.
>
> What is given supports the path to awakening; what is in the house supports Māra. What is given is imperishable; what is in the house perishes. From what is given comes happiness; from what is in the house, suffering arises. What is given is for the abandonment of afflictions; what is in the house increases afflictions. What is given leads to great enjoyment; what is in the house does not. What is given is the deed of a good person; what is in the house is the deed of a bad person. What is given is praised by all Buddhas; what is in the house is praised by fools."


## Giving Even the Body

From the Nārāyaṇaparipṛcchā:¹¹

> "That thing should not be taken up in which the mind of giving does not arise. The intention of giving should not proceed [stuck]. That possession should not be taken up in which the mind of relinquishment does not arise...
>
> Moreover, son of good family, the bodhisattva mahāsattva should generate this thought: 'This my person has been given up, relinquished to all beings—how much more external things!
>
> Whatever being needs whatever from me, I shall give that to them when present. I shall give my hand to those who need a hand, my foot to those who need a foot, my eye to those who need an eye, my flesh to those who need flesh, my blood to those who need blood, my marrow to those who need marrow, my limbs to those who need limbs, my head to those who need a head.
>
> How much more external things—wealth, grain, gold, silver, gems, ornaments, horses, elephants, chariots, vehicles, villages, cities, towns, districts, kingdoms, capitals, ports, slaves male and female, workers, servants, sons, daughters, and retinue!'"


## The Medicine Tree Metaphor

> "Just as, son of good family, when a medicine tree¹² is taken from—whether from its root, trunk, branch, bark, leaf, flower, fruit, or essence—it has no discrimination: 'It is taken from my root' up to 'It is taken from my essence.' Rather, without discrimination it removes the diseases of beings low, middling, and excellent.
>
> Just so, son of good family, the bodhisattva mahāsattva should generate the perception of medicine in this very body made of the four great elements. Whatever beings need whatever, let them take it from me—hand for those who need a hand, foot for those who need a foot..."


## Dedication of Merit

As stated in the Āryagaganagañjasūtra:¹³

> "May that root of virtue of mine, that Dharma-knowledge, that skill, not exist that would not be for the benefit of all beings."


## Dedication of Past and Future Merit

As stated in the Āryākṣayamatisūtra:¹⁴

> "The recollection of wholesome mental factors and, having recollected, their dedication to awakening—this is skill regarding the past. The intention toward future wholesome roots, the cultivation of facing toward awakening, [thinking:] 'Those wholesome mind-moments that will arise in me, I shall dedicate them to unsurpassed perfect awakening'—this is skill regarding the future."


## Chapter Conclusion

Thus, through mental practice of complete relinquishment, having fulfilled relinquishment through the impetus of the mind of giving, by that physical activity all possessions are relinquished. Freed from the suffering of existence rooted in possessions, one is called "liberated."

And one experiences immeasurable, incalculable kalpas of diverse, infinite mundane and supramundane showers of happiness. And by that very person and so forth, like a hook with bait, drawing others while oneself not having obtained the enjoyment,¹⁵ one ferries them across.

Therefore it is stated in the Ratnamegha:

> **"For the bodhisattva, giving (dāna) is awakening (bodhi)."**¹⁶


*Thus ends the First Chapter, the Perfection of Generosity, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*

## Key Concepts

- **Marmasthāna** (मर्मस्थान): "Vital points"—the essential summary of bodhisattva training
- **Ātmabhāvotsarga** (आत्मभावोत्सर्ग): Relinquishment of one's person/body
- **Ānantarya** (आनन्तर्य): Immediacy—actions leading directly to awakening

## Soul-Check Hints for Blues Version

- Kārikā 4 is the **essence of the whole text**—must be rendered with weight
- The medicine tree metaphor is extraordinary: "Take what you need from me"
- "Given vs. kept" antitheses are perfect for Blues call-and-response
- The final statement: "Giving IS awakening" = Blues liberation

# Chapter 2: Embracing the True Dharma (Saddharmaparigraha)

---

*The second chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on the protection and preservation of the true Dharma.*

---

## Introduction: The Protection of What Is Given

Thus, even when one's person, enjoyments, and merit have been relinquished,¹ they must still be protected.² Why? Because:

### Kārikā 5

> **paribhogāya sattvānāmātmabhāvādi dīyate |**
> **arakṣite kuto bhogaḥ kiṃ dattaṃ yanna bhujyate ||5||**

*"One's person and so forth are given for the enjoyment of beings; if unprotected, how can there be enjoyment? What gift is it that is not consumed [by them]?"*³

Therefore, one should protect one's person and so forth for the sake of beings' enjoyment.

---

## The Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa Teaching

As stated in the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa:⁴

> "Furthermore, Śāriputra, [thinking] 'I shall protect another,' the self must be protected. Endowed with such benevolent intention, Śāriputra, the bodhisattva does not do evil action even for the sake of [preserving] life."

---

## The Vīradattaparipṛcchā Teaching

In the Vīradattaparipṛcchā it is also stated:⁵

> "Śakaṭamitra, [the body] should be borne only with the intention of Dharma, for the sake of carrying the burden."

Likewise, in the Akṣayamatisūtra:⁶

> "One is not wearied by bodily suffering because of consideration for beings."

---

## Protection Through Spiritual Friends

How, then, should one protect one's person and so forth? **Through not abandoning spiritual friends** (*kalyāṇamitrānutsarga*).⁷

As stated in the Āryagaṇḍavyūha by the noble Śrīsaṃbhava:⁸

> "Bodhisattvas upheld by spiritual friends, O son of good family, do not fall into bad rebirths. Bodhisattvas attended upon by spiritual friends do not transgress the bodhisattva training. Bodhisattvas sheltered by spiritual friends rise above the world. Bodhisattvas served by spiritual friends become unforgetful in all bodhisattva practices. Bodhisattvas embraced by spiritual friends become invincible by karma and defilements.
>
> Spiritual friends are instructors: they restrain one from what should not be done, from places of heedlessness. They are those who lead one out from the city of saṃsāra.
>
> Therefore, O son of good family, with such mental orientation, one should approach spiritual friends with relaxed confidence:
>
> With a mind like **the earth**, in order to bear all burdens;
> With a mind like **a diamond**, in unbreakable intention;
> With a mind like **a mountain range**, in not trembling before any suffering;
> With a mind like **a servant of the world**, in not disdaining undertaking all tasks;
> With a mind like **a dust-cloth**, in abandoning arrogance and pride;
> With a mind like **a vehicle**, in carrying heavy loads;
> With a mind like **a dog**, in not becoming angry;
> With a mind like **a boat**, in not being troubled by going and coming;
> Like **a good son**, in gazing upon the face of spiritual friends.
>
> And in yourself, O son of good family, you should generate the perception of being **sick**; in spiritual friends, the perception of **physicians**; in their instructions, the perception of **medicine**; in practice, the perception of **curing the disease**.
>
> And in yourself, O son of good family, you should generate the perception of being **fearful**; in spiritual friends, the perception of **heroes**; in their instructions, the perception of **weapons**; in practice, the perception of **destroying enemies**."

---

## The Acalopāsikā Testimony

In the same [Gaṇḍavyūha], in the liberation of the lay-woman Acalā, it is stated:⁹

> "For a bodhisattva, O son of good family, who practices the instructions of spiritual friends, the blessed Buddhas become of pleased mind. For a bodhisattva who stands in conformity with the words of spiritual friends, omniscience draws near. For one who has no doubt regarding the words of spiritual friends, spiritual friends draw near. For one whose mental attention is never separated from spiritual friends, all purposes come face to face."

---

## Sudhana's Devotion

For this very reason, the noble Sudhana,¹⁰ having prostrated at the feet of the monk Sāradhvaja with his head, having circumambulated him hundreds of thousands of times, looking upon him, bowing down, looking again and again, certainly prostrating, paying homage, bending low, taking to mind, reflecting, contemplating, thoroughly contemplating, giving utterances of joy, making exclamations of "hā!", bringing to mind his qualities, completing remembrance, stabilizing memory, not abandoning, mentally drawing near, fastening his aspiration, immersing himself in the vision, grasping the sign of his presence—thus he departed from his presence.

Likewise, seeing omniscience as having come from spiritual friends, with tearful face, weeping, he departed from the presence of Megha the Dramiḍa.¹¹

---

## The Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa on Dharma-Desire

In the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa it is also stated:¹²

> "Here, Śāriputra, through desire for the Dharma, there is no treasure in the world that the bodhisattva does not relinquish. There is no bodily service that he does not perform. There is no errand on foot that he will not undertake. There is no verbal action that he will not undertake, out of respect for teachers and preceptors. And so on at length.
>
> For what reason? This Dharma conduces to the cutting of bonds. This Dharma conduces to the cutting of birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, and mental distress.
>
> Having generated the thought [of the Dharma] as a jewel, having generated the thought of medicine, [thinking:] 'This Dharma conduces to the pacification of the affliction of all beings'—and: 'We must seek such a Dharma for the pacification of the affliction of all beings.'"

---

## The Ugradattaparipṛcchā on Teacher-Reverence

In the Ugradattaparipṛcchā it is also stated:¹³

> "Moreover, householder, if a bodhisattva who is desirous of recitation and study hears from someone a four-line verse, or has it pointed out, or learns it—connected with giving, morality, patience, effort, meditation, or wisdom, or connected with the accumulation of bodhisattva provisions—then for that teacher he should show reverence for the Dharma commensurate with however many name-words and syllables are in the verse so pointed out.
>
> If he were to perform service and attendance upon that teacher for that many eons, without deceit, with all gain, honor, and worship—even then, householder, the reverence for the teacher would not yet be fulfilled. How much less the reverence for the Dharma!"

---

## The Story of Sadāprarudita: Part One

In the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā it is also stated:¹⁴

> "Therefore, O son of good family, intense reverence should be generated toward spiritual friends, and love should be shown.
>
> Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita,¹⁵ proceeding with such qualities of reverent mental attention, gradually reached a certain city. There, having entered the middle of the marketplace, this thought occurred to him: 'I will sell this very body of mine, and with that price I will make offerings to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Dharmodgata.¹⁶ For a long time, my thousands of bodies have been broken, exhausted, sold away. Again, in the immeasurable saṃsāra, I have experienced immeasurable [sufferings] for the sake of desire, with desire as cause. But not for such Dharmas, nor for the offering of such beings!'
>
> Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita, having entered the middle of the marketplace, raised his voice and proclaimed: 'Who wants a man? Who wants a man? Who wants a man?'
>
> Then Māra the Evil One so arranged the brahmins and householders that they did not hear that cry. When he could not find a buyer for himself, having gone aside, he began to weep and shed tears, speaking thus: 'Alas, what misfortune for us, that we cannot find even a buyer for our own body!'
>
> Then Śakra, lord of the gods, in the form of a young brahmin, approached the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita and said: 'Why are you, O son of good family, standing here with downcast face and anxious heart, shedding tears?'
>
> Sadāprarudita said: 'Young brahmin, I wish to sell this very body of mine out of desire for the Dharma, in order to make Dharma-offering. And I cannot find a buyer for it.'
>
> And so on at length.
>
> Then that young brahmin said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita: 'I have no need of a man, O son of good family. But my father has a sacrifice to perform. For that I need a man's heart, blood, and bone-marrow. Will you give [these] for a price?'
>
> Then this thought occurred to Sadāprarudita: 'What gain I have obtained! And I know myself to be accomplished in the skill in means of Prajñāpāramitā, in that I have found a buyer for myself—for my heart, blood, and bone-marrow!'
>
> With joyful mind, glad mind, delighted mind, he said to that young brahmin: 'I will give you, young brahmin, whatever you want from this body of mine.'
>
> Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita, taking a sharp weapon, pierced his right arm and let the blood flow. And having pierced his right thigh and made it fleshless, he approached the foot of a wall to extract the bone."

---

## The Story of Sadāprarudita: Part Two

> "Then a certain merchant's daughter, from the upper terrace of her mansion, saw the bodhisattva Sadāprarudita. She approached him and said: 'What are you, O son of good family, doing to yourself in this manner?'
>
> And so on. Having heard the purpose of the offering, she said again: 'What kind of benefit will arise for you from that?'
>
> He said to her: 'That son of good family will teach me the Prajñāpāramitā and skill in means. There we shall train. Training there, we shall become a refuge for all beings.'
>
> And so on at length.
>
> Then that merchant's daughter said to the bodhisattva Sadāprarudita: 'How wonderful, O son of good family! Such noble and excellent Dharmas have been proclaimed by you! For the sake of even one such Dharma, O son of good family, bodies equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River should be given up, throughout eons. So noble and excellent are these Dharmas proclaimed by you!
>
> But, O son of good family, I will give you whatever you need—gold, gems, pearls, lapis lazuli, and so on—by which you may make offerings to the bodhisattva Dharmodgata.'"
>
> And so on, at length, until she, attended by five hundred maidens, makes the journey to him.¹⁷

---

## The Seven-Year Meditation

> "Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Dharmodgata, rising from his seat, entered his own house. For seven years he remained absorbed in a single samādhi.¹⁸
>
> For seven years the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita did not generate a thought of sense-desire, did not generate a thought of ill-will, did not generate a thought of harm, did not generate greed for tastes—except: 'When will the bodhisattva mahāsattva Dharmodgata arise? We shall prepare a Dharma-seat for him where he will sit and teach the Dharma. And we shall sprinkle that patch of ground, sweep it, and scatter it with various flowers.'
>
> Those five hundred maidens, headed by the merchant's daughter, learning from the bodhisattva Sadāprarudita, passed the time in only two postures.¹⁹
>
> Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita heard a divine utterance: 'Seven days from now, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Dharmodgata will arise from this samādhi and, sitting in the middle of the city, will teach the Dharma.'
>
> Then, having heard that utterance, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita, joyful, delighted, filled with gladness and happiness of mind, cleaned that patch of ground. Together with the five hundred maidens headed by the merchant's daughter, he prepared a Dharma-seat made of the seven jewels.
>
> Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita, wishing to sprinkle that patch of ground, could not find water anywhere, searching all around. For Māra the Evil One had made all the water disappear, [thinking:] 'Perhaps, not finding water, his mind will become distressed, or grief will arise, or there will be some change of mind, by which his roots of virtue will disappear or not shine forth.'
>
> Then this thought occurred to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita: 'What if I were to pierce my own body and sprinkle this ground with my blood? For what reason? This patch of ground is dusty. May the dust not fall upon the body of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Dharmodgata. What would I do with this body that is certainly subject to destruction anyway? Better that this body of mine perish through such action than through powerless action. For the sake of desire, with desire as cause, my thousands of bodies have been broken again and again in the immeasurable saṃsāra while wandering. If they are to be broken, let them rather be broken for such a Dharma-circumstance!'"

---

## The Blood-Offering

> "Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita, having reflected thus, taking a sharp weapon, pierced his own body all around and sprinkled that entire patch of ground with his own blood. Likewise did those maidens also.
>
> Yet there was no change of mind for the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāprarudita or for all those maidens, by which Māra the Evil One might have found an opening."²⁰

---

## Never Abandon Spiritual Friends

Thus it is also stated in the Caturdharmakasūtra:²¹

> "Bhikṣus, a spiritual friend should not be abandoned by a bodhisattva for as long as one lives—not even for the sake of [preserving] life."

Thus indeed:

### Kārikā 6

> **kalyāṇamitrānutsargāt**
> **ātmabhāvādīnāṃ rakṣādikaṃ kāryam |**
> **sūtrāṇāṃ ca sadekṣaṇāt ||6||**

*"Through not abandoning spiritual friends, and through constant examination of the sūtras, the protection and so forth of one's person and the rest should be accomplished."*²²

## The Sūtras as Authority

For the bodhisattva training-rules are for the most part seen in the sūtras themselves.²³ Because of the statement: "In each of those sūtrāntas, the bodhisattva conduct, the bodhisattva training-rules, are prescribed."

Therefore, lest there be transgression through not examining them, and lest one who has transgressed remain unrestrained through ignorance—constant attention should be given to seeing the sūtras.

By this—through not abandoning spiritual friends and through seeing the sūtrāntas—all embracing of the true Dharma has been stated.

---

## The Sāgaramatisūtra Definition

As stated in the Āryasāgaramatisūtra:²⁴

> "By whatever syllables and etymologies that inexpressible Dharma is indicated, the teaching that is the support of those syllables and etymologies—as far as this, it is called embracing the true Dharma.
>
> Furthermore, O son of good family, those Dharma-preachers who are teachers of such sūtrāntas and who have practice as their essence—the serving, cherishing, attending, rising for, waiting upon, revering, honoring, listening to, protecting, and embracing of those Dharma-preachers; the giving of robes, alms-food, bedding, seats, and medicines for the sick; the giving of praise; protection of their reputation; protection of their wholesome qualities; praise-speaking and concealment of blame—this too is embracing the true Dharma.
>
> And so on at length.
>
> Furthermore, O son of good family, devotion to non-disputation, and the defeat through Dharma of those who speak wrongly about what is not Dharma—this too is embracing the true Dharma.
>
> Furthermore, O son of good family, for one of unobstructed continuity, of intellect intent on liberating all beings, of mind without material reward, the gift of Dharma to others—this too is embracing the true Dharma.
>
> Furthermore, O son of good family, even a single step taken for the sake of hearing the Dharma or for teaching the Dharma, even a single inhalation and exhalation—this too is embracing the true Dharma.
>
> And so on at length.
>
> This mind, O son of good family, rushes toward sense-objects. Its restraint, protection, one-pointedness, training, calming, pacification, discipline—this is called embracing the true Dharma.
>
> And so on at length.
>
> Furthermore, O son of good family, the non-grasping and non-attachment to a dharma through which adharma operates—this too is embracing the true Dharma."
>
> And so on.

## The Indispensability of Dharma-Embracing

In this [passage], through serving Dharma-preachers and so forth, not abandoning spiritual friends is taught, as well as the mark of a spiritual friend.²⁵

By this: without this embracing of the true Dharma, there is no protection, no purification, no increase. And therefore one is not a bodhisattva either.

**Therefore, embracing the true Dharma is entirely necessary.**

---

## The Śrīmālāsiṃhanādasūtra Teaching

As stated in the Śrīmālāsiṃhanādasūtra:²⁶

> "Whatever numerous bodhisattva vows there are, O Blessed One, equal to the sands of the Ganges River—all are deposited in one great vow, are included in it, are established upon it: namely, in embracing the true Dharma.
>
> Of such great scope, O Blessed One, is embracing the true Dharma."

---

## The Blow to Māra

Again in the same [sūtra] it is stated:²⁷

> "Just as, O goddess, even a small blow to a vulnerable spot is painful and injurious even for a person of great strength—just so, O goddess, even a little embracing of the true Dharma is painful to Māra the Evil One, is a cause of sorrow, is productive of lamentation.
>
> I do not see, O goddess, any other single wholesome dharma that is so painful to Māra the Evil One, so grief-causing, so lamentation-producing, as even this little embracing of the true Dharma."

---

## Greater Than Mount Sumeru

Again it is stated:²⁸

> "Just as, O goddess, Mount Sumeru, king of mountains, surpassing all the subsidiary mountains, shines forth and shines well through its height and breadth—just so, O goddess, the embracing of the true Dharma by a Mahāyānist who is heedless of body and life and who does not have a grasping mind surpasses all the wholesome dharmas even of those Mahāyānists newly set out [on the path], who are heedful of body and life."
>
> And so on.

---

## The Benefits Enumerated in Verse

Likewise in the Āryasāgaramatisūtra it is also stated:²⁹

> *Embraced is one by the Victors,*
> *by gods, nāgas, and kinnaras.*
> *Embraced by merit and knowledge—*
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.* (...and so on...)
>
> *One is never born in empty fields;*
> *in every birth one sees the Victor.*
> *Seeing him, one gains serene faith—*
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.*
>
> *One becomes a great being who remembers past lives,*
> *again and again obtaining the going forth [into homelessness].*
> *[One becomes] pure in conduct, with practice as essence—*
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.* (...and so on...)
>
> *One becomes skilled and obtains dhāraṇī;*
> *the good does not perish through hundreds of eons.*
> *One becomes eloquent and unattached—*
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.*
>
> *Śakra, Brahmā, and the world-protectors,*
> *a human king, a wheel-turning monarch on earth—*
> *with ease and happiness one awakens to enlightenment—*
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.*
>
> *Thirty-two marks appear upon one's body;*
> *one becomes blameless of limb and discerning.*
> *Those gazing upon one find no satisfaction—*³⁰
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.*
>
> *One's awakening-mind does not become confused;*
> *nor is one uplifted in the practice of perfections.*
> *Skillful among hundreds, one is not led astray—*
> *[through] upholding the true Dharma of the Tathāgatas.*

# Chapter 3: Protection of Dharma-Preachers and Others (Dharmabhāṇakādirakṣā)

---

*The third chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on protecting Dharma-teachers and avoiding the various harms that assail the bodhisattva's path.*

---

## Introduction: The General Method of Protection

The method of protection and so forth for all three [i.e., person, enjoyments, merit] has been stated in general. Now the particulars of protection must be explained.¹

### Kārikā 7

> **tatrātmabhāve kā rakṣā yadanarthavivarjanam |**

*"Therein, what is the protection of one's person? It is the avoidance of harm."*²

Here, "therein" refers to one who abides in the embracing of the true Dharma [from Chapter 2]. The protection of one's person is to be considered as how one does not destroy others.³

---

## Part I: The Vow of the Dharma-Holders

This teaching on the avoidance of harm was spoken by bodhisattvas devoted to upholding the true Dharma in the Āryagaganagañjasūtra:⁴

> "We venture, O Blessed One, after the extinction of the Foremost Among Bipeds,
> We shall uphold the true Dharma, having abandoned body and life.
>
> Having relinquished gain and honor, having cast off all praise,
> Not relinquishing this Dharma that reveals the Buddha's wisdom.
>
> Abuse and harsh criticism, and words of ill-speaking—
> Through patience we shall endure them, for the sake of embracing the true Dharma.
>
> Raised fists and threats, and defamation and disgrace—
> All these we shall endure, upholding this method...
>
> In such a dreadful time of great danger, when monks are in want and distressed,
> In the time of devastation for beings, we shall uphold the true Dharma.
>
> Those profound sūtrāntas connected with the fruit of liberation—
> Those who accept them will not break; they will brush aside confused talk...
>
> Loving-kindness we shall practice toward those who are not established in the Dharma,
> And compassion we shall practice, upholding this method.
>
> Having seen beings of bad conduct, established in desire and greed,
> We shall shed tears—for where will such ones be reborn?
>
> And having seen just such an obstructor of the true Dharma,
> We shall befriend him from afar, lest he become angry with us.
>
> We shall protect as we are able, restrained in speech and action,
> We shall not suddenly address those who are established in their own evil.
>
> With gifts and also with respect, we shall ripen such persons here;
> And we shall urge them toward truth, away from the domain of evil.
>
> Having abandoned household production, wandering in the edges of the wilderness,
> We shall be like deer—with few concerns, with few tasks...
>
> Tamed, peaceful, and liberated, and having descended into a village,
> We shall teach the Dharma to beings who are seekers of Dharma.
>
> Even far we shall go, having heard of those who desire the Dharma,
> Having attained the delight in the Dharma-garden, we shall accomplish the welfare of the embodied.
>
> Having seen face to face the abundant stumbling of beings,
> We shall be self-observant, established in kindness toward the Dharma.
>
> Whether dishonored or honored, like Mount Meru established,
> Untainted by the world, we shall become guides for the world.
>
> Having heard the censure of monks whose conduct has split,
> We shall mind our own actions—may their karma not ripen [for us].
>
> They will hire assassins for those who abide in these dharmas—
> 'These dharmas are nowhere to be found among us!'
>
> 'Our śramaṇas have no śramaṇa qualities!'—
> Having heard true accusation, they reject this sūtra.
>
> For those whose ears and noses are cut off, how is a mirror pleasing?
> Having heard true accusation, they reject the true Dharma.
>
> Those monks who will embrace the true Dharma—
> They will strive so that someone may hear this Dharma.
>
> Kings will seize them, and great multitudes will break them;
> Through the Buddha's empowerment, beings will then hear this Dharma.
>
> In that harsh time, we, having abandoned body and life,
> Shall uphold the true Dharma, for the sake of beings' welfare."

---

## Part II: The Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Teaching

In the Āryasaddharmapuṇḍarīka it is also stated:⁵

> "One should protect one's conduct and sphere of activity; one should be unassociated and pure.
> One should always avoid intimacy with princes and kings.
>
> And also with the men of kings—one should not be intimate with them;
> With outcasts, boxers, drunkards, and all manner of sectarians.
>
> One should not serve those who are conceited, [even if] established in Vinaya and Āgama,
> Monks thought to be arhats—but the ill-conducted one should be avoided.
>
> The bhikṣuṇī should always be avoided whose sphere is laughter and gossip;
> And the upāsikās who are exposed and unsettled should be avoided.
>
> Women and hermaphrodites—intimacy with them should be avoided;
> And in households, young brides and maidens should be avoided.
>
> One should never befriend them or ask them 'How are you?' skillfully;
> And intimacy should be avoided with pig-dealers and sheep-dealers.
>
> Those who support women—intimacy with them should be avoided;
> With actors, jugglers, wrestlers, and all such people.
>
> One should not serve courtesans or others who live by entertainment;
> Greeting such persons should be entirely avoided.
>
> And when the wise one teaches the Dharma to women,
> One should not enter alone there, nor should one indulge in laughter."

---

## Part III: The Works of Māra

This is another harm that there would be—namely, what is called the work of Māra, stated in the Prajñāpāramitā:⁶

> "Māra the Evil One will zealously exert great effort near the bodhisattva who has recently set out in the Vehicle."

Here also it is said:⁷

> "Furthermore, Ānanda, at whatever time a bodhisattva mahāsattva applies himself to the Prajñāpāramitā, at that time the Māras, the Evil Ones, bring forth harassment of the bodhisattva; they generate fear.
>
> They let loose and display meteor-falls and conflagrations in all directions, [thinking:] 'Perhaps this bodhisattva mahāsattva will become discouraged, or perhaps his hair will stand on end!'—by which even one of his thought-moments might be diminished regarding supreme perfect enlightenment.
>
> Furthermore, others of different awareness will write [it] down... [and] acquire it. [Saying:] 'We are not obtaining any taste from this!'—they will rise from their seats and depart. Thus yawning, laughing... they will acquire it. This is the work of Māra.
>
> Thus, thoughts about the countryside, villages, and so forth will arise. Thus, mental attention to teachers, preceptors, mothers, fathers, friends, ministers, relatives, and blood-relations [will arise]. Thus, mental attention to thieves [will arise]. Thus, mental attention to robes and so forth [will arise].
>
> Furthermore, the Dharma-preacher will be eager to have someone copy, or recite, this profound Prajñāpāramitā, but the Dharma-hearer will become diseased. Or vice versa. The Dharma-preacher will wish to go to another region, but the Dharma-hearers will say no to this.
>
> Thus, the Dharma-preacher will be of great desire, while the Dharma-hearer is of few desires—this is not right. In brief, whatever discord there is between Dharma-preacher and Dharma-hearer, all of that is said to be the work of Māra."

---

## Part IV: The Ten Māra-Hooks

In the Āryagaganagañjasūtra it is also stated:⁸

> "Indeed, whatever continuance in unwholesome dharmas there is, and whatever abandonment of wholesome dharmas—all of that is the work of Māra."

In the Āryasāgaramatisūtra it also says:⁹

> "Furthermore, O Blessed One, the bodhisattva who is a forest-dweller, delighting in secluded lodgings, is of few desires, content, secluded, unassociated with householders and renunciants. Because of having few concerns and few tasks, he dwells happily, yet he is not diligent in seeking vast learning, nor does he consider it necessary to cross over to ripen beings, or in the hearing of Dharma, in Dharma-talk, in definitive-meaning discourse.
>
> He is not of the nature of inquiry; he is not devoted to 'What is skillful?' His afflictions do not operate because of his forest-dwelling and because of his single-taste delight. He finds satisfaction merely in the suppression of active defilements. He does not cultivate the path for the eradication of latent tendencies.
>
> Thus he is not practicing for his own benefit or for the benefit of others. This, O Blessed One, is the bodhisattva's **seventh Māra-hook** connected with forest-dwelling...
>
> Furthermore, O Blessed One, the bodhisattva serves, resorts to, and attends upon evil friends who appear to be spiritual friends. They, having diverted him from the means of attraction, having diverted him from the accumulation of merit, from embracing the true Dharma, they engage him in seclusion; they engage him in having few concerns and few tasks. They teach him discourses connected with the Śrāvaka and Pratyekabuddha [vehicles].
>
> And at whatever time the bodhisattva, through dwelling in seclusion, would advance in the Great Vehicle, at that time they engage that bodhisattva in the disturbance of service [to others]. 'Service must certainly be done by a bodhisattva!' And at whatever time the bodhisattva should be engaged in service, at that time they engage him in seclusion.
>
> Thus they say to him: 'Enlightenment is for one of aroused vigor, not for one who is lazy. And if you do not awaken to supreme perfect enlightenment in eight or nine kalpas, you will no longer be capable of awakening to supreme perfect enlightenment.'
>
> There, O Blessed One, it is possible that through excessively aroused vigor the bodhisattva might attain the fruit of nirvāṇa [as an arhat]. This, O Blessed One, is the bodhisattva's **tenth Māra-hook** from those appearing as spiritual friends.
>
> Those who are also Mahāyāna persons, unknowing of the Māra-hooks, who practice dharmas that have been turned away from—with them he finds pleasure. For they become followers of that [path], and the one who resorts to the inferior, not having attained distinction, goes to an inferior destiny—namely, a desert destiny, a destiny of dullness and muteness...up to the **eleventh Māra-hook**."

---

## Part V: The Right Kind of Vigor

Because of this [danger], continuous aroused vigor produces disenchantment with the bodhisattva-state in all ways. Therefore, as stated in the Ratnamegha:¹⁰

> "Here the bodhisattva arouses vigor in all postures. And he arouses it in such a way that he does not generate bodily fatigue, nor mental fatigue. This is called the bodhisattva's continuous vigor.
>
> What kind of vigor is it by which fatigue does not occur? Namely, the undertaking of heavy work by one of little strength, or at an excessive time, or the undertaking of difficult work by one whose aspiration is not yet ripened—such as the giving of one's own flesh, and so forth.
>
> Moreover, one's person has been given. But he [the bodhisattva] prevents it from being consumed at the wrong time. For otherwise, through the bodhisattva's fatigue, through the destruction of the bodhicitta-seed for those very beings, there would be destruction of a great mass of fruit."

Thus in the Gaganagañjasūtra it is also stated:¹¹

> "Expectation of [gifts given] before the proper time is the work of Māra."

---

## Part VI: Protection of One's Person

Nor should the giving up of one's person be left unproduced just because it is not the [proper] time. For without undertaking practice, one would never give.¹² Therefore, having established mindfulness thus, one's person should be protected from:

- Those who contradict the ripening of bodhicitta
- Those who through delusion destroy one's own welfare
- Flesh-eaters [carnivorous beings]¹³
- Those who do karma [harmful agents]

### Kārikā 8 (verse from source)

> *"Just as the seed of the well-appearing medicine tree,*
> *whose root and so forth are to be enjoyed—*
> *even having given it, it should be protected from untimely consumption:*
> *just so the medicine tree of the Fully Awakened One."*¹⁴

This is, in brief, the harm that is the work of Māra.

---

## Part VII: Dispelling the Works of Māra

The dispelling of this is stated in the Ratnameghasūtra:¹⁵

> "And how, O son of good family, does the bodhisattva become skillful in the method of avoiding the work of Māra? Here, the bodhisattva entirely avoids unwholesome friends. He entirely avoids dwelling in an unsuitable place, the cultivation of service to worldly sciences and mantras, [excessive preoccupation with] gain, honor, reverence, service, and esteem.
>
> And whatever other secondary afflictions there are that obstruct the path to the factors of enlightenment—all these he entirely avoids. And he cultivates the antidotes to those."

---

## Part VIII: Characteristics of Unwholesome Friends

Here also the characteristic of an unwholesome friend is stated:¹⁶

> "The avoidance of evil friends is to be known through the avoidance of persons whose morality has failed. Likewise through avoidance of persons whose view has failed, whose conduct has failed, whose livelihood has failed. Through avoidance of persons who delight in communal life. Through avoidance of lazy persons. Through avoidance of persons who take pleasure in saṃsāra. Through avoidance of persons who have turned away from enlightenment. Through avoidance of association with householders—the avoidance of evil friends is to be known.
>
> And, O son of good family, by one avoiding these circumstances, a hostile mind should not be produced toward those persons, nor an angry mind, nor a contemptuous mind.
>
> Thus his mind should be established. For it was said by the Blessed One: 'Beings, according to their element—desire-element and so forth—flow together, are born, and stream forth; through association they are destroyed. Therefore I shall avoid association.'"

---

## Part IX: Confusion of Bodhicitta

The confusion of bodhicitta is also a harm.¹⁷ And its cause is stated in the Ratnakūṭa:

> "By four dharmas, O Kāśyapa, the bodhisattva's bodhicitta becomes confused. What are the four?
>
> 1. Through deceiving teachers, guides, and those worthy of gifts;
> 2. Through generating remorse in others who have no remorse;
> 3. Through spreading defamation and disgrace about beings who have set out in the Mahāyāna;
> 4. Through approaching others with deceit and cunning, not with superior intention."

---

## Part X: Avoidance of Bodhicitta Confusion

The avoidance of this is also stated here:¹⁸

> "By four dharmas, O Kāśyapa, the bodhisattva's bodhicitta becomes manifest in all births from the moment of birth; it does not become confused in between, up until sitting at the seat of enlightenment. What are the four?
>
> 1. He does not speak a deliberate lie even for the sake of [preserving] life—not even for the sake of laughter;
> 2. He stands before all beings with superior intention, having abandoned deceit and cunning;
> 3. He generates the perception of Teacher regarding all bodhisattvas;
> 4. He proclaims their praise in the four directions.
>
> And whatever beings he ripens, all of them he establishes in supreme perfect enlightenment, through non-aspiration to partial vehicles. By these four, O Kāśyapa..."

---

## Part XI: Dharma-Gift Protection

In the Siṃhaparipṛcchā it also says:¹⁹

> "One who never creates an obstacle to the gift of Dharma—
> By that, one quickly obtains meeting with the World-Protectors.
> Thus from the Dharma-gift one remembers [past] births—know this, O prince!
>
> By that one does not abandon bodhicitta in all births;
> Even in dream, that mind [is present]—how much more when awake!
>
> In whatever places of cessation, villages or cities,
> One takes up [the Dharma] for enlightenment—by that the mind does not abandon [bodhicitta]."

---

## Part XII: Four Dharmas of Non-Falling

In the Āryamañjuśrībuddhakṣetraguṇavyūhālaṃkārasūtra it also says:²⁰

> "Endowed with four dharmas, the bodhisattva does not fall from [his] vow...
> He becomes one whose pride is struck down; he becomes one who avoids jealousy and stinginess; and having seen the success of others, he does not become conceited."

---

## Part XIII: Unwavering Bodhicitta

This very thing—the most clear cause for the non-confusion of the suitable bodhicitta—is what is stated here in the Ratnakūṭa:²¹

> "Through mental cultivation of bodhicitta in all postures, through making bodhicitta foremost."

As the reading in the Candrapradīpasūtra states:²²

> "I declare and announce to you:
> However much a person thinks repeatedly,
> So his mind becomes inclined to those;
> He is supported by those thoughts."

---

## Part XIV: Discouragement as Harm

Discouragement is also a harm.²³ The avoidance of this is seen in the Ratnamegha:

> "Here the bodhisattva does not generate the thought: 'Enlightenment is hard to attain for one who is a human being. And this vigor of mine is small. I am lazy. And enlightenment requires many kalpas, many hundreds of kalpas, many thousands of kalpas, like one whose head is on fire [requiring immediate attention]. I am not capable of shouldering such a burden.'
>
> Rather, the bodhisattva should generate such a thought: 'Whatever tathāgatas, arhats, samyaksaṃbuddhas have awakened, are awakening, or will awaken—they too have awakened, are awakening, and will awaken by just such a method, by just such a practice, by just such vigor.
>
> They were not already in the state of tathāgata when they awakened. I too will strive in the same way, exert myself in the same way, with vigor common to all beings, with vigor that has all beings as its object—so that I may awaken to supreme perfect enlightenment.'"

---

## Part XV: The Bodhisattva's Stumbling

Another harm is seen in the Ratnakūṭa:²⁴

> "Trust in beings who have not been ripened is a stumbling of the bodhisattva. The proclamation of exalted Buddha-dharma to beings who have become unsuitable vessels is a stumbling of the bodhisattva. The proclamation of the Lesser Vehicle to beings of exalted aspiration is a stumbling of the bodhisattva.
>
> Disdain toward those who are properly mindful and endowed with morality and good dharmas, [combined with] gathering those of bad morality and unwholesome dharmas, is a stumbling of the bodhisattva."

---

## Part XVI: Lack of Aspiration as Harm

Lack of aspiration is also a harm.²⁵ As stated in the Rāṣṭrapālasūtra:

> "One for whom aspiration toward the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha does not exist—
> In the training and precepts, for that one there is no aspiration.
> One of evil thought, opening to the three lower destinies—
>
> He, fallen from here, through the force of karma, is among humans, yet ignorant, confused.
> In the hells, in animal destinies, in hungry ghost destinies, he finds suffering."

---

## Part XVII: Avoidance of Lack of Aspiration

The dispelling of this is seen as stated in the Ratnakūṭa:²⁶

> "Regarding those profound [teachings] into which his intellect does not penetrate, he does not reject them, having made the Tathāgata himself the witness: 'The Tathāgata knows thus; I do not know. The Buddha's enlightenment is infinite; through the diversity of aspirations, the teaching of Dharma of the Tathāgatas proceeds to beings.'"

---

## Part XVIII: Skill in Avoiding Harm While Serving

One who is engaged in service should become skillful in avoidance of harm.²⁷ For in the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa, service is enjoined regarding a fellow practitioner in Dharma-hearing, and regarding worship of the Tathāgata.

The procedure for this has come from the Ratnarāśisūtra:²⁸

> "There, by the monk who performs service, the minds of the entire Saṅgha of monks should be satisfied.
>
> There, for those monks who are forest-dwellers and dwell in secluded lodgings, by the service-performing monk absolutely no assignment of work should be given.
>
> But if work belonging to the Saṅgha, being trainee-work, should fall to a forest-dwelling monk, by this service-performing monk that should be done himself, or another monk should be requested—the forest-dwelling monk should not be oppressed.
>
> For the monk who lives on alms-round, by that service-performing monk a share of excellent food should be given.
>
> For the monk who is a practitioner of yoga, by that service-performing monk suitable requisites should be brought—medicines and equipment for sickness. And in whatever place that yoga-practitioner monk dwells, in that place no loud noise should be made. The yoga-practitioner monk should be protected by the service-performing monk. His bedding and seat should be propped up. Excellent foods, pleasing, suitable for the yoga-practitioner's stage, should be offered...
>
> For those monks who are devoted to vast learning, enthusiasm should be given. They too should be protected. For those monks who will be Dharma-preachers, the manner of reception should be performed. Dharma-hearers should be encouraged. The assembly-circle should be prepared. The discourse-circle should be purified...and one should be abundant in applause...
>
> The perception of lordship should not be produced regarding any matter. Even the smallest task should be done according to the intention of the Saṅgha, not according to one's own intention...
>
> That belonging to the Saṅgha should not be mixed with that belonging to the Saṅgha of the Four Quarters. Likewise the mutual non-mixing with stūpa-property is prohibited...
>
> Whoever, O Kāśyapa, is a service-performing monk [and] with angry mind issues a command to virtuous ones worthy of gifts because of [his sense of] lordship—by that unwholesome karma he becomes one bound for hell...
>
> If one who threatens a monk with punishment through fear—by that unwholesome karma, the hell named Many Terrors becomes his place of rebirth...until his body is pierced by thousands, blazing, burning, aflame...
>
> His tongue becomes extended a hundred yojanas; in that tongue-faculty many hundreds of thousands of blazing iron stakes are driven...
>
> Whoever, O Kāśyapa, is a service-performing monk [and] hoards incoming gains belonging to the Saṅgha, does not give them at proper times, gives while having harassed and troubled, and does not give to some—by that unwholesome root, the hungry ghost destiny called 'Shank' [or 'Leg'], made of excrement and clay, becomes his place of rebirth.
>
> There, other hungry ghosts take food and make it disappear from him. He, being harassed, looking at that food with unblinking eyes, afflicted by hunger and thirst, experiences painful feeling, and even for a thousand years there is no obtaining of that food..."

## Part XIX: The Saṃgharakṣita Narrative

In the Saṃgharakṣitāvadāna also, harms are stated:²⁹

> "Those beings whom you, Saṃgharakṣita, saw in the form of walls—they were monks. By them, that which belonged to the Saṅgha—the wall—was destroyed by phlegm. By the ripening of that karma, they became wall-shaped.
>
> Those beings whom you saw in the form of pillars—they were monks. By them, a pillar belonging to the Saṅgha was destroyed by mucus. Therefore they became pillar-shaped.
>
> Those beings whom you saw in the forms of trees, leaves, flowers, fruits—they too were monks. By them, trees, leaves, flowers, and fruits belonging to the Saṅgha were consumed for personal enjoyment. Therefore they became tree-, leaf-, flower-, and fruit-shaped.
>
> Those beings whom you saw in the forms of ropes and brooms—they were monks. By them, ropes and brooms belonging to the Saṅgha were used for personal enjoyment. Therefore they became rope-shaped and broom-shaped.
>
> The being whom you saw in the form of a ladle—he was a novice. He was making porridge-scum. Guest monks had arrived. Seen by them, he was asked: 'Novice, will this porridge be for the Saṅgha?' He, with mind overcome by stinginess, said: 'Don't you see the scum being made? The porridge has been drunk.' They, [thinking] 'The time has passed,' became discouraged and departed with dejected faces. By the ripening of that karma, he became ladle-shaped.
>
> The being whom you saw in the form of a mortar—he too was a monk. Work [grinding] was due for his bowl. And there a single novice, an arhat, was appointed to the grinding of beans. He said to him: 'Novice, give me a little of the chaff for grinding.' He said: 'Venerable one, wait a moment. I am busy. Afterward, having ground it, I will give it.' He, having become angry, said: 'Novice, if I had the power to strike, I would put you in a mortar and pound you—let alone the chaff!'
>
> That novice reflected: 'This one is overcome by intense mental disturbance. If I give him a reply, he will become angry to an even greater degree.' So he remained silent.
>
> When the disturbance had passed, he approached and said: 'Venerable one, do you know who I am?' He said: 'I know you to be a novice who went forth under Kāśyapa the Perfectly Enlightened One. I too am an elder monk.'
>
> The novice said: 'Even though that is so, nevertheless what was to be done by me, having gone forth, has been done. What has been done? The abandonment of afflictions. I, with all bonds cut, am released from all bonds. Harsh speech has been uttered by you. Acknowledge the transgression as a transgression. Perhaps this karma may go to diminution, thinness, and exhaustion.'
>
> By him the transgression was not acknowledged as a transgression. By that karma, he became mortar-shaped."

And so forth through the various forms: pot-shaped, split down the middle being carried by a thread, and others.³⁰

¹² **[Philosophical]** The paradox: one must practice giving of the body gradually through habituation, or one will never be able to give it when truly called upon.

¹³ **[Sanskrit]** *Piśitāśana*: Flesh-eaters, i.e., carnivorous demons or beings who would consume the bodhisattva's given body destructively.

¹⁴ **[Verse]** The bodhisattva's body is like a medicine tree whose seed should be protected—if harvested too early or by wrong agents, the tree (awakening) is lost.

## Soul-Check Hints for Blues Version

- **"Māra's work" is everywhere**: Discord between teacher and student, impatience, wrong associations, discouragement
- **The Gaganagañja vow is powerful**: Bodhisattvas promise to withstand abuse, hire assassins, kings seizing them
- **Ten Māra-hooks**: Forest-dwelling laziness, false friends urging quick nirvāṇa, association with the fallen
- **The mortar-story is vivid**: A monk who spoke rashly to an arhat-novice became a mortar—acknowledge your transgressions!
- **Discouragement is harm**: Don't think "I can't do this"—think "All buddhas did it this way"

# Chapter 4: Avoidance of Harm (Anarthavarjana)

---

*The fourth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on the great harms enumerated in the sūtras—root offenses, karmic consequences, the dangers of sensual desire, and the rejection of true Dharma.*

---

## Introduction: The Great Harms

Other great harms also are stated in the sūtrāntas.¹

---

## Part I: The Root Offenses of Kings

As stated in the Ākāśagarbhasūtra:²

> "There are, O son of good family, these five root offenses (*mūlāpatti*) for a consecrated king (*kṣatriya mūrdhābhiṣikta*), by which root offenses the consecrated king destroys all previously planted roots of virtue, becomes fallen in [his] ground (*vastupatita*), defeated (*parājika*), bound for bad destinies in the sight of all gods and humans.
>
> **First Root Offense:** Whoever, O son of good family, steals stūpa-property, or that belonging to the Saṅgha, or that belonging to the Saṅgha of the Four Quarters, or that which has been donated—whether taking it himself or having it taken.
>
> **Second Root Offense:** Whoever, moreover, rejects the Dharma—whether spoken for the Śrāvaka vehicle, the Pratyekabuddha vehicle, or the Mahāyāna vehicle—rejects and repudiates it.
>
> **Third Root Offense:** Whoever, moreover, [attacks] one who has gone forth in my name, shaven-headed, wearing the dyed robe—whether observing the training or not, whether of bad conduct or virtuous—takes away his dyed robes, or causes them to be taken; or makes him a householder; or strikes his body with weapons; or casts him into prison; or deprives him of life.
>
> **Fourth Root Offense:** Whoever, moreover, a king, deliberately deprives his mother of life, or his father, or an arhat, or a Blessed One's disciple; or splits a harmonious Saṅgha; or, with malicious mind, deliberately sheds the blood of a Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyaksaṃbuddha. By any of these five immediate [heinous deeds], he produces one or another action.
>
> **Fifth Root Offense:** Whoever, moreover, a king, becomes a proponent of no-cause (*ahetuvādin*), disregards the other world, takes up the ten unwholesome paths of action and establishes himself in them, and establishes many other beings in the ten unwholesome paths of action, leads them, settles them, fixes them.
>
> **Sixth Root Offense:** (abbreviated) Whoever causes the breaking of villages, regions, cities, or kingdoms..."

---

## Part II: The Eight Root Offenses for Beginners

> "For beginner bodhisattvas (*ādikarmiṇa*) who have set out in the Mahāyāna, there are eight root offenses, by which root offenses, stumbling, the beginner bodhisattvas destroy all previously planted roots of virtue. Fallen in ground, defeated, fallen from the happiness of gods, humans, and the Mahāyāna, bound for bad destinies, they sink long in saṃsāra, bereft of spiritual friends.
>
> **First Root Offense for Beginners:** Those beings who, due to formerly performed bad actions, are reborn in this defiled world of five corruptions—they, having little roots of virtue, relying on a spiritual friend, hear this supremely profound Mahāyāna. Although of limited intelligence, they generate the thought [aimed at] supreme perfect enlightenment.
>
> To these beginners, certain bodhisattvas who hear this supremely profound sūtrānta connected with emptiness (*śūnyatāpratisaṃyukta*) proclaim it extensively, just as they heard it, just as they obtained it, with proper wording and meaning, to others of former understanding.
>
> But those who have not exerted themselves, those childish ordinary people, hearing it, become terrified, frightened, extremely frightened. Being frightened, they turn away, and having turned away from the thought [aimed at] supreme perfect enlightenment, they fix their minds on the Śrāvaka vehicle.
>
> This is the first root offense of the beginner bodhisattva, by which root offense that son of good family destroys all previously planted roots of virtue, fallen in ground, defeated, [fallen] from the happiness of heaven and liberation. His bodhicitta is deceived. He becomes bound for bad destinies.
>
> Therefore, by the bodhisattva mahāsattva, first having known the inclinations and latent tendencies of other persons, the Dharma should be taught gradually to beings according to their inclinations, just as one enters the great ocean gradually...
>
> **Second Root Offense:** Furthermore, a beginner bodhisattva says to someone: 'You are not capable of practicing in the six perfections. You are not capable of awakening to supreme perfect enlightenment. Quickly generate the thought [aimed at] the Śrāvaka vehicle or the Pratyekabuddha vehicle. By that you will escape from saṃsāra.'...
>
> **Third Root Offense:** Furthermore, a beginner bodhisattva says to someone: 'What is the use of the Prātimokṣa, of morality well-protected? Quickly generate the thought [aimed at] supreme perfect enlightenment. Study the Mahāyāna. Whatever unwholesome karma has been accumulated by your body, speech, and mind through the condition of afflictions—by that study there is purification without karmic ripening.'...
>
> **Fourth Root Offense:** Furthermore, a beginner bodhisattva says to some: 'Abandon the talk of the Śrāvaka vehicle. Do not hear it, do not study it, do not teach it to others. Conceal the Śrāvaka talk. You will not obtain great fruit from it. You are not capable of making an end of afflictions from it. Have faith in the Mahāyāna talk. Hear, study the Mahāyāna, and teach it to others. By that you will pacify all paths to bad destinies, and quickly awaken to supreme perfect enlightenment.' If they become doers of his words, they would grasp such a view. For both there is a root offense...
>
> **Fifth Root Offense:** Furthermore, beginner bodhisattvas become double-tongued. They display things otherwise. And they study, recite, retain, and teach this Mahāyāna for the sake of fame, reputation, honor, gain, and esteem. They teach to others only what they have merely heard. And they say: 'We are Mahāyānikasno others.' They envy others for the sake of gain and esteem... For the sake of jealousy, they proclaim themselves with higher human dharmas. Then by that ground, fallen, defeated, from the happiness of the Mahāyāna, they incur this great grave offense, by which they become bound for bad destinies...
>
> **Sixth Root Offense:** Furthermore, in the future, householders and renouncers, beginner bodhisattvas, [will come who take] those profound sūtrāntas connected with emptiness, adorned with dhāraṇī, patience, samādhi, and stages—the domain of bodhisattvas who are great learned men, who have exerted themselves—they will retain, study, recite [these sūtrāntas], and, having taught them extensively to others, will proclaim: 'I have awakened to these dharmas by my own understanding. And furthermore, out of compassion I teach them to you. You must practice in such a way that you will become a witness to these profound dharmas. Your knowledge and vision will be just like mine.' But he does not give thus. By mere study I teach such profound dharmas—not through direct realization. For the sake of gain and esteem he sells himself..."

---

## Part III: Remedy for Root Offenses

The escape from these [offenses] is stated in this same sūtra:³

> "If those bodhisattvas, having heard the name of the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha, should wish to see him, wishing to confess their root offenses from fear of falling into bad destinies—if they should bow to the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha and recite his name, that son of good family, according to his fortune, will stand before him in his own form, or in the form of a brahmin... or in the form of a girl he will stand before him.
>
> To that beginner bodhisattva he confesses those offenses as they have arisen. He displays the profound skillful means and the practice in the Mahāyāna. He establishes him on the irreversible stage...
>
> If he does not give him a face-to-face vision, then that beginner bodhisattva who is transgressed, rising in the last watch from his seat, standing facing east, should burn incense and invoke the god Aruṇa.
>
> And he should speak thus: 'Aruṇa, Aruṇa, O greatly compassionate, O greatly fortunate one, you who have risen high in Jambudvīpa—cover me with compassion! Quickly awaken the greatly compassionate Ākāśagarbha by my word! In my dream, display to me that means by which I may confess the offense, by which I may obtain skillful wisdom in the noble Mahāyāna.'
>
> At that time, he should go to sleep on his bed. At the very moment Aruṇa rises, here in Jambudvīpa the bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha arrives, in his own form. Standing before that beginner bodhisattva in his dream, he confesses that root offense by the Mahāyāna means. And he displays to him such skillful knowledge that by that skillful means that beginner bodhisattva right there obtains the samādhi called 'non-confusion of bodhicitta,' and becomes firmly established in the Mahāyāna..."

---

## Part IV: Summary Verses on Root Offenses

For the sake of easy grasping and retention of these root offenses, and for the collection of those going together [in theme], summary verses are stated:⁴

> *From stealing from the Three Jewels, the offense of defeat is considered.*
> *From rejecting the true Dharma, the second is declared by the Sage.*
>
> *From stealing the robes of a monk, even of bad conduct, from striking,*
> *From casting into prison, from expelling [from the order]—*
>
> *From committing the five immediates, from grasping wrong view,*
> *Or from breaking villages and so forth—root offense is declared by the Victor.*
>
> *From teaching emptiness to beings of unprepared understanding,*
> *From turning those set out for Buddhahood away from enlightenment—*
>
> *From making them abandon the Prātimokṣa to engage in Mahāyāna,*
> *Or from grasping that the Disciple vehicle does not abandon desire and so forth—*
>
> *From others' grasping, or again from displaying one's own qualities,*
> *From disparaging others for the sake of gain, esteem, and reputation—*
>
> *From falsely saying 'I am one tolerant of the profound,' again,*
> *From having ascetics punished, or from giving from the Three Refuges—*
>
> *Or from taking what is being given, again from abandoning tranquility,*
> *From announcing to reciters the enjoyment of one in retreat—*
>
> *These root offenses are indeed causes of great hells.*
> *Before the noble Ākāśagarbha, standing in dream, they should be confessed.*
>
> *From abandoning bodhicitta, from not giving to a suppliant,*
> *From intense stinginess and greed, from striking beings out of anger—*
>
> *Though being entreated earnestly, one does not forbear toward beings,*
> *Or from following others out of affliction, from praising the semblance of true Dharma.*

---

## Part V: The Teaching on Harming Monastics

In the Āryakṣitigarbhasūtra it is also stated:⁵

> "That monk who has gone forth in my name, O great brahmin, who is of bad conduct and evil practice—whether a chaff-monk, impure, a non-ascetic with the profession of an ascetic, a non-celibate with the profession of a celibate—fallen, defeated, conquered by various afflictions—
>
> Yet even now that monk of bad conduct and evil practice is a displayer of spiritual friends, a treasure of merit, for all gods up to all humans. Even though he has become unworthy, yet by virtue of his shaven head and the donning of the dyed robe, by the mere seeing of his deportment, he becomes a propper of various roots of virtue for many beings, a shower of the path to good destinies.
>
> Therefore, for one who has gone forth in my name, whether virtuous or of bad conduct, I do not permit even wheel-turning kings—let alone by unjust means—to give a blow of punishment to the body of one gone forth in my name with a stick; or to cast him into prison; or to make a cutting or breaking of limbs; or to deprive him of life.
>
> Even though he is called 'dead' in this Dharma-Vinaya, yet that person is like yellow orpiment or musk..."

---

## Part VI: Karmic Consequences of the Ten Unwholesome Paths

The ten unwholesome paths of action are to be seen as harms with bitter ripening, from the Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna.⁶ A small portion of the sūtra is indicated:

### Killing

> "Just as there are birds called Fire-Crest-Walkers who dwell in the midst of flame-crests and are not burned, and, being excited, having broken the skulls of hell-beings, drink their blood. So also the birds called Skull-Interior-Walkers, having broken the head, drink the ignited brain-matter. So the birds called Tongue-Flesh-Eaters, having split the tongue, eat it on all sides. And that tongue, eaten, is born again, more tender than a lotus petal.
>
> Similarly [there are birds] called Tooth-Pullers, Throat-Pipe-Extractors, Lung-Eaters, Stomach-Contents-Eaters, Spleen-Turners, Intestine-Cavity-Gnawers, Spine-Walkers, and the birds called Marma-Seekers, who, having broken all the marma-cavities, having cut the marmas, entering the cavities, drink the marrow-essence of those crying out...
>
> Thus the place of Avīci [extends] 300,000 yojanas. This portion [of Avīci] is called 'Devoured by Birds.' There, with other hell-beings, for many hundreds of thousands of years, he is eaten and is [reborn] again.
>
> Somehow released from all that, wrapped in the net of suffering, he goes to the second place called 'Dog-Pit-Fall,' seeking protection, seeking refuge, seeking safety... Surrounded on all sides by eleven flame-masses, without companion, bound by the bonds of the karma-noose, surrounded on all sides by enemies, having entered a wilderness, having entered a calamity more than all the heaps of hell, he runs to that place called 'Dog-Pit-Fall.'
>
> When he falls, his foot melts utterly. Thrown up, he is reborn, more tender, more smooth. Overcome by harsh, intense feelings... For many hundreds of thousands of years, falling and being thrown up, [he is thus]... Eaten by vultures, crows, hawks, and owls...
>
> Somehow released from that... he runs to the place called 'Wheel-Mark-Cavity.' There, wheels with a thousand spokes appear, with diamond hubs, with sharp flames, spinning swiftly. Just as he arrives, those wheels, reaching his body, spin... burning, crushing each limb separately. And on the sole of his foot, stakes pierce him..."

### Stealing

> "That evil-action-doer, like a firebrand-circle, like a gandharva city, like a mirage, sees a great mass of wealth—jewels, clothes, grain, heaps. For him, overcome by greed, deluded by karma, the thought arises: 'This is mine.' Thus deluded, that evil-doer, having leapt across burning coal-pits, runs after that treasure. He is seized by karma-created Yama-men. Entering the midst of a weapon-net, he is split limb by limb, quartered, burned, reduced to bones. And even in that state, his greed, operating since beginningless time, does not diminish..."

### Sexual Misconduct

> "That evil-doer, somehow released from the weapon-crisis, somehow having leapt across the coal-pits, deluded by karma, reaches another place called 'False Vision.' There he sees a karma-created woman, whom he saw before when his memory was lost. Having seen her, the fire of desire, practiced since beginningless time, arises. He runs toward those women. And those women are made of iron, karma-created. By them he is seized. Having seized him, from lips onward he is so consumed that not even a mustard-seed measure remains of his body. He is reborn again, consumed again...
>
> Yet from that craving-fire he does not turn back. He rushes again toward those women... Then those women, with blazing iron-vajra bodies, taking that man, with bodies full of flame-garlands, grind that hell-being like a fistful of sand. He is reborn again..."

> *Women are the root of bad destinies, of the destruction of wealth in every way.*
> *Those men who are subject to women—how can there be happiness for them?*
>
> *Woman is destruction among destructions, in this world and the next.*
> *Therefore, women should be avoided if one wishes happiness for oneself.*

### Lying

> "He is seized by those Yama-men. Having seized him, they split open that mouth, extract the tongue. And that tongue, by the force of karma, becomes 500 yojanas in measure. At the time of its coming forth, those Yama-men throw him onto a burning iron ground. And 1,000 burning ploughs with blazing tips appear, karma-created. Powerful bullocks carry those ploughs on his tongue, entering into it. There rivers of pus, blood, and worms flow..."

### Slander

> "Just as for lying, with this difference: the tongue is 300 yojanas. Those Yama-men, taking sharp blazing swords, cut the tongue. In another place he is eaten by jackals. He experiences extremely bitter feeling. He cries out, screams, [makes] inarticulate sounds, being without a tongue..."

### Harsh Speech

> "They seize that tongue. Having split open the mouth, they take it. Having cut it with sharp-edged weapons, they throw it into his own mouth for food. And he, tormented by hunger, with face emaciated by hunger, eats that very tongue of his, smeared with his own blood and saliva. And that tongue, cut, is reborn again by the force of karma...
>
> The Yama-men speak an instructive verse:
>
> *'From the bow of the tongue, a sharp arrow of words by you*
> *Was seen as "harsh speech"—this is the fruit that has come.'"

### Idle Chatter

> "That burning copper-liquid, licking the tongue, burns it. Having burned the tongue, it burns the throat. Having burned the throat, it burns the heart. Having burned the heart, it burns the intestines. Having burned them, it burns the stomach. Having also burned the stomach, it exits from below.
>
> The Yama-men speak a verse:
>
> *'Unconnected words before and after, meaningless, incoherent,*
> *Unbound—what was spoken by you—this is the fruit that has come.*
>
> *That which is never truly speaking, which is not devoted to study—*
> *That is not seen as a tongue by the wise, but merely a lump of flesh.'"

---

## Part VII: The Dangers of Sensual Desire

All harms have sensual desire as their root; therefore, one should feel disgust toward them.⁷ As stated here:

> "There is, they say, a hell called Fire-Pit. By what karma do beings take rebirth there? By one who is a non-ascetic with the profession of an ascetic, who, having heard the sounds of women's dancing and singing, or of ornaments, with improper attention, with distracted mind, hearing it, has ejaculated impurity laughing, playing, sporting...
>
> There those hell-beings are crushed limb by limb by iron rain, and by coal rain they are cooked, burned...
>
> Thus, from the memory of savoring past sensual pleasures, the hell called Paduma is taught; from the memory of one's own past [pleasures]. There those hell-beings are cooked in cauldrons. They are beaten in troughs with iron pestles..."

---

## Part VIII: The Seven Kinds of Sexual Union

In the Saptamaithunsaṃyuktasūtra it is also stated:⁸

> "Here, O brahmin, a certain one professes himself to be a celibate. He does not engage in intercourse with a woman here. But gazing upon a woman's form with his eye, he sees it, savors it, becomes attached to it, and so remains. This, O brahmin, is called a celibate joined with the dharma of sexual union, not separated.
>
> Similarly, regarding playing, sporting, laughing with a woman—savoring [this], he practices impure celibacy.
>
> Similarly, regarding savoring the private parts of a woman...
>
> Similarly, for one behind a wall or behind a cloth, savoring the sounds of a woman's dancing, singing, and so forth—[this is] joining with sexual union.
>
> Similarly, savoring another's [woman] endowed with the five strands of sensuality...
>
> Similarly, from dedicating celibacy to [rebirth in] a god-realm and so forth—joined with the dharma of sexual union, not separated..."

---

## Part IX: The Kāma-Rejection Teaching

Because these sensual pleasures, even when gone to the domain of memory and aspiration, cause such harm, it is stated in the Kāmāpavādakasūtra:⁹

> "Restrain your mind from sensual pleasures, O monk! This path is fearful, dangerous, thorny, dense, a wrong path, a bad path, a path of feeling, frequented by bad men. This path is not frequented by good men.
>
> Do you not think thus: 'Why are sensual pleasures said by the Blessed One to be of little savor, of much suffering, much affliction, much trouble?' The danger here is greater.
>
> Sensual pleasures, O monks, are a disease, a boil, a dart, a misfortune, the root of misfortune, bait on a fishhook, death. Sensual pleasures are impermanent, empty, of the nature of deceiving falsehood, dream-like. Such are sensual pleasures—merely the prattle of fools...
>
> Just as a trap for deer, just as a net for birds, just as a copper pot for fish, just as glue for monkeys, just as a mass of fire for moths—so are sensual pleasures...
>
> For one going about in the pursuit of sensual pleasures, being turned about in the mouth of lions for a long night—there is no end known. Being turned about in the mouth of slaughterers, cow-eaters—there is no end known. Being turned about in the mouth of frogs and snakes—there is no end known.
>
> Of those long pursuing sensual pleasures, seized as thieves, beheaded—there is no end known. Adulterers, fence-breakers, village-destroyers, region-destroyers... knot-looseners, seized, beheaded—there is no end known.
>
> Suffering—intense, harsh, bitter—has been experienced. Blood has flowed, gushed forth, which is more than the water in the four great oceans...
>
> For this body is of much danger, a collection of bones, bound by sinews, smeared with flesh, wrapped in skin, covered by hide, full of holes, inhabited by hosts of worms, useless for beings, a basis for afflictions and karma...
>
> What is your peace regarding sensual pleasures, O monk? What seduces you? How are you led, infatuated, attached, having attained attachment? When I am fully nirvāṇa-ed, and the true Dharma has disappeared, and you, having pursued sensual pleasures, have gone to ruin—when will you liberate yourself from old age and death?
>
> Enough, O monk! Restrain your mind from sensual pleasures! This is not the time for the pursuit of sensual pleasures. This is the time for the pursuit of Dharma."

## Part X: The Harm of Obstructing Bodhisattvas

Another harm is stated in the Praśāntaviniścayaprātihāryasūtra:¹⁰

> "Whoever, O Mañjuśrī, whether son of good family or daughter of good family, should deprive all beings of Jambudvīpa of life and take all their property—or whoever else, O Mañjuśrī, should create an obstacle for even one wholesome thought of a bodhisattva, even for [a being in] animal birth, even for one root of virtue accompanied by a single mouthful of food—this one produces incomparably more evil.
>
> Why is that? He becomes an obstructor of roots of virtue that generate the arising of Buddhas.
>
> Whoever, O Mañjuśrī, should create jealousy and stinginess toward a bodhisattva in other families—for him, at that time, from that very cause, three fears are to be expected: fear of rebirth in hell, fear of birth blind, fear of rebirth in border regions..."

> *"With a great self-body, in the hells, that evil-minded one,*
> *Ruined in self, is reborn; he experiences painful feeling.*
>
> *500 yojanas is his height when born.*
> *Surrounded by krores, he is eaten constantly by dogs.*
>
> *5,000 heads are born to this slanderer.*
> *And 500 tongues are born on each head.*
>
> *On each tongue, 500 flame-mouthed [devices]*
> *Carry ploughs for him, having spoken evil speech.*
>
> *In Pratāpana [hell] they are cooked, in intense suffering and fire,*
> *Those who create oppression for bodhisattvas, the unassociated.*
>
> *Animal birth with hell—for them it is not hard to obtain!*
> *For 100,000 koṭis of kalpas, hundreds and niyutas—*
>
> *Fallen from there, they become snakes of fierce poison, terrifying.*
> *Overcome by hunger and thirst, they do dreadful deeds.*
>
> *Having obtained even food and drink, they never attain satisfaction.*
>
> *Fallen from there, if reborn among humans,*
> *Born blind, of poor understanding, of evil mind, unrestrained.*
>
> *Having spoken words displeasing and harsh to the noble ones,*
> *Fallen from humans also, again he goes to bad destinies.*
>
> *For 100,000 koṭis of kalpas, born, he does not see the Buddha."*

---

## Part XI: Merit of Protecting Bodhisattvas

The ripening of honoring [bodhisattvas] is stated in the Praśāntaviniścayaprātihāryasūtra:¹¹

> *"Whoever creates righteous protection for these speakers of Dharma,*
> *Abandoning all bad destinies, he becomes Śakra, king of gods.*
>
> *Brahmā too, [lord of] Yāma, Tuṣita, and Vaśavartī, again and again.*
>
> *Reborn among humans, he is born a wheel-turning [monarch].*
> *A merchant, a householder too, he becomes wealthy, of great wealth.*
>
> *Endowed with wisdom and memory, happy, free from affliction."*

---

## Part XII: The Śūraṅgamasamādhi Teaching

As stated in the Śūraṅgamasamādhisūtra:¹²

> "What, O Dṛḍhamati, is the prediction of one whose bodhicitta has not been generated?
>
> Here, O Dṛḍhamati, that person is reborn in the five-fold saṃsāra—whether in hells, in animal birth, in the world of Yama, among gods, or among humans. And that person is of sharp faculties, of exalted aspiration.
>
> The Tathāgata knows him: 'This man-person, after so-many 100,000 niyutas of kalpa-koṭis, will generate the thought [aimed at] supreme perfect enlightenment. And after so-many 100,000 asaṃkhyeya kalpas, he will awaken to enlightenment.' This, O Dṛḍhamati, is called the prediction of the bodhisattva whose bodhicitta has not been generated.
>
> Then the venerable Mahākāśyapa said to the Blessed One: 'From today onward, O Blessed One, we should generate the perception of Teacher toward all beings. Why is that? For this knowledge does not operate for us: which bodhisattva has faculties that ripen enlightenment? Which does not? Therefore, O Blessed One, not knowing, we might generate the perception of [them being] inferior toward such persons. By that we would be destroyed.'
>
> The Blessed One said: 'Well said, well said, Kāśyapa! This word of yours is well-spoken. And seeing this very point, Kāśyapa, this Dharma has been taught by me to you: O monks, a person should not discriminate through another person. For a person discriminating through a person is quickly destroyed. Either I would discriminate a person, or one who would be like me.
>
> By this teaching, Kāśyapa, by a bodhisattva or a śrāvaka, the perception of Teacher should be generated toward all beings... For there might be some person of the bodhisattva vehicle. Therefore, the self should be protected in that matter.' And [toward one] who certainly has the mark of attaining enlightenment, all the more should disdain be guarded against."

---

## Part XIII: The Dharma-Rejection Teaching

Another harm is stated in the Āryasarvadharmavaipulyasaṃgrahasūtra:¹³

> "Subtle, O Mañjuśrī, is the karma-obstruction of rejecting the true Dharma.
>
> Whoever, O Mañjuśrī, in a dharma spoken by the Tathāgata, makes the perception 'this is beautiful' for some, and 'this is not beautiful' for some—he rejects the true Dharma. By him rejecting the true Dharma, the Tathāgata is falsely accused, the Dharma is rejected, the Saṅgha is slandered.
>
> One who says 'this is proper, this is improper'—he rejects the true Dharma...
>
> I have not taught any separate dharma—whether connected with the Śrāvaka vehicle, the Pratyekabuddha vehicle, or the Mahāyāna. Those confused men will make this dharma of mine diverse: 'This was taught for Śrāvakas, this for Pratyekabuddhas, this for bodhisattvas.'
>
> By the perception of diversity, he rejects the true Dharma—'this is the training of the bodhisattva, this is not the training of the bodhisattva'—thus he rejects the true Dharma.
>
> 'The Dharma-preacher has eloquence; he has no eloquence'—thus he rejects the true Dharma.
>
> He speaks the Dharma in terms of [mere] dharma—thus he rejects the true Dharma.
>
> 'When the arising of a Buddha has passed, there is no obtaining of dhāraṇī'—thus he rejects the Dharma.
>
> 'There is no obtaining of dhāraṇī for the Dharma-preacher'—thus he rejects the Dharma.
>
> He finds fault with the practice of the Dharma-preacher—'the Dharma-preacher is not accomplished in practice'—thus he rejects the Dharma.
>
> He accuses him through heedlessness, through deportment, through conduct with letters, through moral failure—thus he rejects the Dharma...
>
> Whoever, O Mañjuśrī, whether monk, nun, layman, or laywoman, thinks 'this is the form of the Dharma-preacher,' speaks it—all of these reject the true Dharma..."

- **Root offenses are specific and enumerated**—kings and beginners have different lists
- **The hell descriptions are graphic and detailed**—Fire-Crest birds, Skull-Interior birds, tongue-extraction
- **Sensual desire is the root of all harms**—the extended kāma-rejection passages are central
- **Even disdaining a future bodhisattva is catastrophic**—treat all as potential teachers
- **Dharma-rejection is subtle**—saying "this teaching is good, that is bad" is rejection

# Chapter 5: Avoidance of Harm in the Perfection of Morality (Śīlapāramitāyām Anarthavarjana)

---

*The fifth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on how to avoid harm within the context of moral perfection—through vows, reverence for bodhisattvas, avoidance of gain-seeking, and renunciation of fruitless activities.*

---

## Introduction

Harm has been stated in brief [in the previous chapter].¹ Its avoidance is as follows.

---

## Part I: The Vows of Harm-Avoidance

As stated in the Adhyāśayasaṃcodanasūtra:²

> "Beginner bodhisattvas, fearing the hearing of such harms, should do just as they have undertaken. For thus have they spoken:
>
> 'We, O Blessed One, from this day forward, make the following undertaking before the Tathāgata:
>
> **Vow 1:** If we, from this day forward, should accuse a bodhisattva-vehicle person—whether householder or renunciant—of an offense, whether truly or falsely, we would deceive the Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyaksaṃbuddha.
>
> **Vow 2:** If we, from this day forward, should disdain a bodhisattva-vehicle person and speak ill of him, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 3:** If we, seeing a bodhisattva-vehicle person—whether householder or renunciant—playing with, enjoying the five strands of sensual pleasure, should generate disaffection, or generate vexation of mind, or generate disrespect, or not generate the perception of Teacher toward him, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 4:** If we, from this day forward, due to patronage-families or alms-families, should create bodily or mental affliction for bodhisattva-vehicle persons, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 5:** If we, from this day forward, seeing a bodhisattva-vehicle person, should address him with even one unpleasant word, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 6:** If we, from this day forward, should not bow to a bodhisattva-vehicle person three times at night and three times during the day, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 7:** If we, from this day forward, should not give up kingdom, wealth, or body and life for the sake of this vow-undertaking, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 8:** If we, from this day forward, should disdain a Śrāvaka-vehicle or Pratyekabuddha-vehicle person [thinking] "we are more distinguished, not they," we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 9:** If we, O Blessed One, should not dwell with lowly minds, with minds like outcastes, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 10:** If we, from this day forward, should exalt ourselves or disparage others, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 11:** If we, from this day forward, should not flee a yojana or a hundred yojanas from fear of hatred and conflict, being driven, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 12:** If we, from this day forward, should proclaim ourselves as moral, or as learned, or as endowed with ascetic practices, or should display ourselves with one or another quality, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 13:** If we, from this day forward, should not dwell with concealed good and revealed evil, we would deceive the Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyaksaṃbuddha...'"
>
> There the Blessed One addressed Maitreya the bodhisattva mahāsattva: "By a son of good family or daughter of good family wishing to exhaust karma-obstruction, O Maitreya, such an undertaking should be made, just as it has been made by these sons of good family."

---

## Part II: Reverence for All Bodhisattvas

In the Sarvadharmāpravṛttinirdeśa it is also stated:³

> *Three times at night and three times during the day,*
> *he should bow to bodhisattvas with his head.*
>
> *He should not search for any fault of theirs;*
> *let them practice their conduct as they wish.*
>
> *When he sees [one] delighting in sensual pleasures,*
> *he should not search for any fault of his.*
>
> *With infinite qualities, that excellent bodhisattva practice—*
> *even this one, in time, will touch it.*
>
> *By gradual reasoning, by gradual action,*
> *one does not become a Victor by a single word.*
>
> *Many koṭis and niyutas of kalpas—*
> *he who has set out with armor does not become otherwise.*

And here it is also stated:

> "Those sons of good family who are free from such karma-obstruction should not find fault with any conduct of another bodhisattva. All his actions should be released. The thought should be generated thus: 'I do not know another's mind. The conduct of beings is hard to know.'
>
> And seeing this very point, the Tathāgata teaches this Dharma: 'A person should not be measured by [another] person. Either I would measure a person, or one who would be like me.'
>
> By one, O son of good family, wishing to protect himself, no one's conduct should be discriminated. No disparagement of others should be made: 'This one is like this, that one is like that.' One should be devoted to the Buddha-dharma, day and night, with a mind grasping the Dharma."

---

## Part III: The Kṣitigarbha Vows

In the Kṣitigarbhasūtra too it is stated:⁴

> Then at that very time, many hundreds of thousands of learned beings, rising from their seats, joining palms toward the Blessed One, spoke thus:
>
> "We, O Venerable Blessed One, make this aspiration before the Blessed One:
>
> 'For as long as we wander in saṃsāra—having obtained even a little patience—may we NOT obtain the station of a king, may we NOT obtain the station of a minister, may we NOT obtain the station of a town-elder, may we NOT obtain the station of a village-elder, may we NOT obtain the station of a regional-elder, may we NOT obtain the station of a chief-priest, may we NOT obtain the station of a general... may we NOT obtain any station as a leader over beings—until we have obtained patience.
>
> For from such [stations], we might create such extremely heinous karma as to damage the teaching of the Buddhas...'"

---

## Part IV: The Candrapradīpa Verses

In the Candrapradīpasūtra too, avoidance of harm is stated:⁵

> *"There is no evil that will not be done by them, O Kumāra, in the future evil time.*
> *Do not have intimacy with them, O Kāli, in the last [age].*
>
> *If you should speak or converse, you would create disrespect toward them.*
> *Unshrunken, you should honor [them], due to their not-yet-awakening.*
>
> *Having asked about the number of rains [ordination seniority], whoever is your elder—*
> *create respect there, bowing at his feet with your head.*
>
> *Do not see any fault in those who behold the seat of enlightenment.*
> *Do not generate opposition; always be of loving mind.*
>
> *If you see a fault in them, do not proclaim their faults.*
> *Whatever karma one does, such fruit one will obtain.*
>
> *With a smiling moon-face, toward elders and newcomers,*
> *be always the first to speak, with pride destroyed, patient.*
>
> *With robes and alms-food, make assistance for them.*
> *Thus place your mind: "All will become Leaders."'"

---

## Part V: Praise of Bodhicitta

For one in whom reverence and faith do not arise toward one who has generated bodhicitta, for the sake of protecting oneself from falling into bad destinies, for the sake of experiencing joy in seen and unseen [matters], for the sake of clarifying one's own murky mind, for the sake of obtaining pliancy and workability of mind—one should meditate on the qualities of one who has generated bodhicitta, as the noble Maitreya displayed to the noble Sudhana in the Āryagaṇḍavyūha:⁶

> *He, having seen beings afflicted by old age and disease,*
> *assailed by hundreds of sufferings,*
> *tormented by the fear and grief of birth and death—*
> *for their sake he practices, with a mind of compassion.*
>
> *Having seen the world tormented by the machine of suffering*
> *in the wheel-turn of the five destinies,*
> *he [seeks] that firm knowledge-vajra,*
> *the shattering of the machine-wheel of suffering.*
>
> *Having seen the field of beings with the thorns, splinters, and prickles of desire and hatred,*
> *entangled in the dense undergrowth of views and attachments,*
> *seeking to purify the field of beings,*
> *he firmly seeks the plough of wisdom.*
>
> *The world, with its jungle of delusion and ignorance,*
> *with wisdom-eye destroyed, without a guide—*
> *He will become a lord, a guide showing safety,*
> *a caravan-leader for the world.*
>
> *Wearing the armor of patience, mounted on the three liberations,*
> *with the sword of knowledge, vanquishing the enemy afflictions,*
> *having become a hero, a giver of fearlessness—*
> *he will become a guide for the world.*
>
> *He launches the Dharma-boat,*
> *well-trained in the path of the knowledge-ocean,*
> *a leader to the peace-jewel's excellent island—*
> *he is a helmsman in the triple ocean.*
>
> *He, with the disk of knowledge-rays and aspiration,*
> *illuminating all being-worlds,*
> *rising from the ocean of the dharma-realm sky—*
> *he is proclaimed as the Buddha-sun.*
>
> *Cool as sandalwood of loving-kindness,*
> *of equal, benevolent mind toward all beings,*
> *with the full disk of white dharmas—*
> *he is proclaimed as the Buddha-moon.*
>
> *Established on a firm foundation of aspiration,*
> *having gradually risen in bodhisattva practice,*
> *a mine of all dharma-jewels—*
> *he will become the supreme knowledge-ocean.*
>
> *Born from the nāga-king of bodhicitta,*
> *risen in the sky of the dharma-realm,*
> *raining Dharma-clouds simultaneously,*
> *increasing all white-fruit harvests.*
>
> *The lamp-wick of faith, destroying the darkness of the three stains,*
> *a firm vessel of loving-kindness, oil, and mindfulness,*
> *bright with the stainless fire of bodhicitta—*
> *he will light the Dharma-lamp.*
>
> *Bodhicitta is the embryonic mass, compassion is the membrane,*
> *loving-kindness is the flesh, [with] immovable, firm aspiration,*
> *limbs of awakening gradually arising—*
> *this Buddha-embryo increases.*
>
> *He will increase the womb of merit,*
> *he will purify the womb of wisdom,*
> *he is proclaimed as the womb of knowledge—*
> *one born from the womb of aspiration.*
>
> *Such ones, armored with compassion and loving-kindness,*
> *with minds intent on liberating beings, with benevolent intent—*
> *rare in the world with its gods and humans—*
> *such as this one, with purified mind.*
>
> *Established in such a root of aspiration,*
> *increased in such firm exertion,*
> *such a one, with light covering the three realms—*
> *the knowledge-tree bearing fruit is extremely rare.*
>
> *He, seeking the arising of all qualities,*
> *seeking to question all dharmas,*
> *seeking to split all doubts—*
> *he serves all friends, untiring.*
>
> *He is the subduer of Māra, the Kali-age [destroyer], and afflictions,*
> *he is the purifier of the stains of views and craving,*
> *he is the one intent on liberating the entire world—*
> *he is always your distinguished sage.*
>
> *He will purify the bad destinies,*
> *he will display the path to heaven,*
> *he will lead the world to the path of liberation—*
> *such a one, established in the path of qualities.*
>
> *He is the liberator from suffering in all destinies,*
> *he is the giver of happiness in all destinies,*
> *he is the cutter of the snares of all becomings—*
> *he will become the destroyer of the courses of becoming."*

## Part VI: Four Dharmas of Harm-Avoidance

By this meditation, avoidance of harm becomes easy to accomplish.⁷

In the Adhyāśayasaṃcodanasūtra too, avoidance of harm is stated:

> "By four dharmas, O Maitreya, a bodhisattva-vehicle person, in the last five hundred [years] when the true Dharma is being lost, will be liberated unharmed, uninjured, safely. By which four?
>
> 1. By examining one's own faults
> 2. By not accusing other bodhisattva-vehicle persons of offenses
> 3. By not looking at patronage-families and alms-families
> 4. By refraining from heedless speech
>
> By another four:
>
> 1. By avoiding beings of little learning
> 2. By not taking up assemblies [i.e., not building a following]
> 3. By dwelling in border lodging-places
> 4. By being devoted to the practice of self-discipline and tranquility"

---

## Part VII: Dangers of Gain and Honor

And here it is also stated:⁸

> "A beginner bodhisattva who has attained the power of wisdom, O Maitreya, should be one who has avoided gain and honor, seeing the danger in gain and honor.
>
> One should be free from delight in gatherings, seeing the danger in delight in gatherings.
>
> One should be free from delight in talk, seeing the danger in delight in talk.
>
> One should be free from delight in sleep, seeing the danger in delight in sleep.
>
> One should be free from delight in work, seeing the danger in delight in work.
>
> One should be free from delight in elaboration, seeing the danger in delight in elaboration...
>
> Here, O Maitreya, gain and honor should be examined by the bodhisattva mahāsattva as:
>
> - Generating desire (*rāgasaṃjanana*)
> - Destroying mindfulness (*smṛtividhvaṃsanakara*)
> - Causing rising and falling by gain and non-gain (*lābhālābhatayā unnāmāvanāmakara*)
> - Generating delusion (*mohotpādana*)
> - Resolving on stinginess toward families (*kulamātsaryādhyavasāna*)
> - Generating deceit for the sake of accomplishing one's own aims (*ātmārthaniṣpādanatayā śāṭhayotpādana*)
> - Avoiding the four noble lineages, generating shamelessness (*caturāryavaṃśaparivarjanatayā āhīkyānapatrāpyasaṃjanana*)
> - Not approved by all Buddhas (*sarvabuddhānanujñāna*)
> - Generating pride and intoxication (*mānamadotpādana*)
> - Disdaining teachers (*gurūṇāmavamānana*)
> - The side of Māra (*mārapakṣa*)
> - The sole root of heedlessness, stealing roots of virtue (*ekāntapramādamūlaḥ kuśalamūlāpaharaṇa*)
> - Like lightning, a wheel, a thunderbolt (*vidyucakrāśanisadṛśa*)
> - Polluted by many obstacles, looking at patronage-families and alms-families, generating depression (*daurmanasyasaṃjanana*)
> - Confusing the intellect (*buddhivibhrāmaṇa*)
> - Becoming a vessel for grief due to transformation of pleasant things (*priyavastupariṇāmanatayā śokabhājana*)
> - Stealing the four foundations of mindfulness, weakening white dharmas (*catuḥsmṛtyupasthānasaṃbhoṣaṇaḥ śukladharmadurbalīkaraṇa*)
> - Causing loss of the four right exertions (*catuḥsamyakprahāṇaparihāṇakaraṇa*)
> - Causing loss of supernormal powers and higher knowledges (*ṛddhyabhijñāparihāṇakaraṇa*)
> - Creating disrespect after prior respect (*pūrva satkārapaścādasatkārakaraṇa*)
> - Honoring enemies, abandoning friends (*amitrasatkaraṇamitraprahāṇa*)
> - Like a courtesan, through seeking connection with others (*parābhisaṃdhānatayā gaṇikāsadṛśa*)
> - Avoiding dhyānas and immeasurables (*dhyānāpramāṇaparivarjana*)
> - Casting into hell, animal births, and the world of Yama (*narakatiryagyoniyamalokaprapātana*)
> - Like the conduct of Devadatta and Udraka (*devadattodrakasamācāra*)"

---

## Part VIII: The Benefits of Few Desires

> "Such, O Maitreya, are the dangers in gain and honor that should be examined by the bodhisattva. Having examined them, one should delight in few desires (*alpecchatā*), not be tormented.
>
> Why is that? For one of few desires, O Maitreya, such faults do not arise, nor do obstructions to Buddha-dharmas arise.
>
> He is not disgusted with householders and renounciants.
> He is to be protected by gods and humans, established in pure intention.
> He is unafraid of falling into any bad destiny.
> He is unshaken, having transcended threats.
> He is unmoved, freed from the domain of Māra.
> He is unassailable by all calamities.
> He is sought after by gods and humans, established in the practice of dhyāna.
> He is clear, having abandoned deceit and guile.
> He is unheedless, seeing the danger in the five strands of sensual pleasure.
> He is one who practices as he speaks, established in the noble lineage.
> He is sought after by learned fellow-practitioners.
>
> Knowing such benefits, O Maitreya, a wise bodhisattva should delight in few desires with full intention. Few desires should be cultivated for the sake of abandoning all gain and honor."

---

## Part IX: Dangers of Delight in Gatherings

Regarding delight in gatherings:⁹

> *"Having abandoned desire, having abandoned hatred—the yogī does not dwell among gatherings.*
> *He becomes inclined in that direction, bending that way—by this fault one should not delight [in them].*
>
> *Excitement, laughter, and thoughts—all of these arise among gatherings.*
> *Of mixed behavior he becomes, unrestrained, who does gatherings that are without essence.*
>
> *Fools delight in worldly mantras [gossip]; fools diminish in foremost talk [Dharma].*

> *For one dwelling in the forest, seeking qualities, the faults of others are not to be observed.*
> *"I am distinguished, I alone am best"—such a thought should not be taken up.*
>
> *This is pride, the root of all heedlessness; inferior monks are not to be disdained.*
> *This is gradual in this teaching; one does not attain enlightenment in a single birth."*

## Part X: Dangers of Delight in Talk

Regarding delight in talk:¹⁰

> *"He becomes disrespectful, intoxicated with learning, dwelling in disputatious mantras.*
> *With stolen mindfulness, without clear comprehension—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *He becomes far from inner contemplation; neither mind nor body are peaceful.*
> *He goes through many risings and fallings—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*

> *Destroyed in the mind of true Dharma, the fool becomes very harsh, with unlubricated mind.*
> *Far from insight and calm—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *He becomes always disrespectful to teachers, generating delight in polluting mantras.*

> *He becomes very miserable, without obtaining firm ground—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *He becomes unsteady, like a straw stirred [by wind]; that one doubts, no great doubt.*
> *He never has firm understanding—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *Like an actor standing on stage, he speaks of the qualities of other heroes,*
> *but he himself is without practice—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *He becomes deceitful, fickle, hopeless; again and again he resorts to dispute.*
> *He becomes far from the noble Dharma—these are the faults of one delighting in talk...*
>
> *Having delighted in talk for a long time, one does not find the bliss of self-joy here.*
> *Better indeed is contemplation on a single quarter-verse, where one may obtain infinite bliss in [that] quarter-verse.*
>
> *There is nothing whatsoever of essence in the rind of sugarcane; in the middle is that essence, most delightful.*
> *Having eaten the rind, then one cannot here again obtain the superior sugarcane-juice.*
>
> *Just as the rind—so understand talk; just as the juice—so is contemplation on meaning here.*
> *Therefore, having abandoned delight in talk, may you always contemplate meaning, unheeding."*

---

## Part XI: Dangers of Delight in Sleep

Regarding delight in sleep:¹¹

> *"He increases a great net of delusion; he becomes doubtful, grasping views.*
> *Many views arise for him who does not proceed to delight in torpor [but wrongly]...*
>
> *His wisdom becomes very weak, his understanding diminishes and is not his.*
> *He is always diminished in knowledge, who does not proceed to delight in torpor...*
>
> *Lazy, unknowing, slothful, unwise—non-human beings obtain access to him.*
> *They harass him dwelling in the forest, who does not proceed to delight in torpor...*
>
> *Uninterested in wholesome mind always, he has no desire for Dharma.*

>
> *That which destroys all suffering and darkness, which is the root for avoiding bad destinies,*
> *always praised by all Buddhas—cultivate always that noble vigor."*

---

## Part XII: Dangers of Delight in Work

Regarding delight in work:¹²

> *"He becomes hard to admonish when urged by teachers, he does not take instruction right-handedly.*
> *He quickly becomes one of failed morality—these are the faults of one delighting in work.*
>
> *He is always anxious, always thinking of householder-tasks.*
> *He has nothing to do with dhyāna-abandonment—these are the faults of one delighting in work.*
>
> *Intense desire arises in him for tastes and non-tastes; seized, he is infatuated.*
> *He is not satisfied with one thing or another—these are the faults of one delighting in work.*
>
> *He is pleased with a large assembly; he becomes miserable when deprived of it.*
> *He becomes mixed, like a donkey here—these are the faults of one delighting in work...*
>
> *Day and night, with mind on nothing else, he is constantly [thinking] about food and robes.*
> *He is always interested in his own aims with all qualities—these are the faults of one delighting in work.*
>
> *He asks about worldly tasks and proceeds to delight in improper mantras.*
> *He does not find delight in proper mantras—these are the faults of one delighting in work..."*

Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya said to the Blessed One: "Those bodhisattvas, O Blessed One, will be of very little wisdom, of diminished wisdom, who, having avoided foremost dharmas, will take up inferior works."

Thus addressed, the Blessed One said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya: "So it is, Maitreya, so it is, as you say... But I tell you, Maitreya, I declare to you: Those bodhisattvas are not gone forth in the Tathāgata's teaching who have no yoga, no dhyāna, no abandonment, no study, no search for learning.

But, O Maitreya, the Tathāgata's teaching is empowered by dhyāna and abandonment, constructed by knowledge, established by knowledge, empowered by application—not empowered by householder-work, service, and drudgery...

This is the work of those unyoked to yoga, who delight in saṃsāra—namely, service, pollution by worldly tasks. The bodhisattva should not generate aspiration for that...

If, O Maitreya, a service-delighting bodhisattva should fill this three-thousand great thousand world-system with stūpas made of the seven jewels, I would not be pleased by him, not honored, not respected...

There, Jambudvīpa should be filled with service-doing bodhisattvas. All of them should do attendance and service for one bodhisattva devoted to recitation and study. And by Jambudvīpa-sized [numbers of] bodhisattvas devoted to recitation and study, attendance and service should be done for one bodhisattva devoted to reflection...

Why is that? This is difficult work—namely, wisdom-work, superior, unsurpassed, distinguished above the whole triple world, transcendent. Therefore, O Maitreya, by a bodhisattva seeking yoga, wishing to undertake vigor, wisdom should be engaged in."

---

## Part XIII: Dangers of Delight in Elaboration

Regarding delight in elaboration (*prapañcārāma*):¹³

> *"The eight unfavorable states (*akṣaṇa*) are not far from him; the excellence of favorable moment (*kṣaṇasaṃpad*) is not supreme for him.*
> *These harms arise for him always—these are the faults of one going about in elaboration...*
>
> *Having properly understood these faults, the wise one should avoid all elaborations.*
> *Harms are easy for one going about in elaboration; therefore, one should not cohabit with elaboration.*
>
> *Go a hundred yojanas—that is better—wherever there is elaboration or conflict.*
> *Do not make a dwelling there, not a residence, not even for a moment where there is affliction.*
>
> *Those who have gone forth are not interested in wealth, they are interested in qualities; do not create conflict with evil minds.*
> *You have no field, no agriculture, no commerce—for whose sake are these elaborations?*
>
> *You have no son, no daughter, no wife; no friend, no band of relatives.*
> *You have no female servants, no male servants, no lordship—do not create conflict, having gone forth.*
>
> *Having taken the dyed robes with faith—they are cultivated by the peaceful and very peaceful.*
> *Be peaceful and very peaceful, tranquil! Having avoided elaboration, generate patience.*
>
> *Guard against poisonous snakes with fierce minds, and hells and animal realms and Yama's domain—*
> *they are not far from one going about in elaboration; therefore, generate vigor in patience...*
>
> *By this yoga one obtains purity, having exhausted karma-obstruction without remainder.*
> *He opposes Māra with army and vehicle—whoever, the wise one, generates patience for that."*

---

## Part XIV: The Root Verse

In brief, avoidance of harm is stated thus:¹⁴

> **By what is this attained? By avoidance of all fruitless activity.** (Kārikā 7)

"By what is this attained?" By avoidance of all fruitless activity (*sarvaniṣphalaspandavarjana*). The fruit here is for the sake of others. Whatever activity does not conduce to that—being fruitless—is to be avoided.

As the Candrapradīpasūtra teaches regarding bodily restraint:

> "He is not one whose hands are restless, not one whose feet are restless; restrained in hands and feet..."

And in the Daśadharmakasūtra too it is taught:

> "Waving the hands, waving the feet, running, running about, jumping, leaping—this is called bodily agitation."

---

## Part XV: All Action for Beings' Sake

In the Āryādharmasaṃgītisūtra, how for bodhisattvas no action other than for others' sake is appropriate, is clearly illuminated:¹⁵

> "Whatever bodily action, O Blessed One, of bodhisattvas; whatever verbal action; whatever mental action—all of that proceeds with observation of beings, with great compassion as chief, with the aim of establishing beings' welfare, proceeding with the intention of welfare and happiness for all beings.
>
> He, with such benevolent intention, with such perception, [thinks]: 'That practice should be practiced by me which brings welfare and happiness to all beings...'
>
> The practice is observation of sense-bases like an empty village. And he does not aspire to abandonment of sense-bases."

In the Āryagaganagañjasūtra it is also stated:¹⁶

> "Just as wind enters through a crack, so from wherever there is a crack in the mind, from there Māra obtains access. Therefore, the bodhisattva should always be of crackless mind. That cracklessness of mind is the fulfillment of the emptiness of all-aspect knowledge."

---

*Thus ends the Fifth Chapter, Avoidance of Harm in the Perfection of Morality, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*

# Chapter 6: Protection of One's Person (Ātmabhāvarakṣā)

---

*The sixth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on how to protect one's person through mindfulness, calm, mind-training, right speech, proper use of food and medicine, and protective mantras.*

---

## Introduction: The Twelve Mindfulnesses

Avoidance of fruitless activity has been stated [in the previous chapters].¹ How is this accomplished? He says:

> **This is accomplished by constant mindfulness.** (Kārikā 8a)

Twelve kinds of mindfulness (*smṛti*) conduce to the avoidance of fruitless activity:

1. **Mindfulness of respecting the ripening consequence of not transgressing the Tathāgata's command**
2. **Mindfulness that the entire body is established in immovable nature**
3. **Mindfulness of steady, deliberate action**—when there is benefit for beings, whatever limb is not useful should be firmly kept still, with one's intention dependent on stronger mindfulness and equanimous aspiration
4. **Mindfulness of the beginner when confused by fear, celebration, etc.**—not letting the limbs move freely
5. **Mindfulness of examining the four postures** (walking, standing, sitting, lying)
6. **Mindfulness of observing excellence in the three postures** for the sake of protecting them intermittently
7. **Mindfulness of restraining**—when speaking, not making excessive non-pleasing gestures of hands, feet, head, and face due to over-excitement, agitation, partiality, etc.
8. **Mindfulness of speaking in a volume** such that the hearer understands the meaning conveyed, not excessively—except when there would be a fault from another's suspicion
9. **Mindfulness of purifying one's own and others' minds** when in crowded gatherings of untrained people
10. **Mindfulness of the mind-elephant**—always bound to the post of calm (*śamatha*)
11. **Mindfulness of repeatedly examining the state of the mind**
12. **Mindfulness of intent**—in large gatherings, even abandoning other tasks, protecting mindfulness as stated

---

## Part I: Mindfulness Arises from Earnestness

Thus, by these mindfulnesses, avoidance of fruitless activity is accomplished. And:²

> *Mindfulness arises from intense earnestness.* (Kārikā 8b)

Therein, earnestness (*ādara*) means complete orientation toward tasks in every way—the antidote to contempt. And this:

> **Earnestness arises from ardor, knowing the greatness of calm.** (Kārikā 8cd)

---

## Part II: What Is Calm?

What is this "calm" (*śama*)? That which is called *śamatha* in the Āryākṣayamatisūtra:³

> "What is the inexhaustible calm? It is:
> - Peace of mind, thorough peace, non-distraction
> - Sense-restraint
> - Non-agitation
> - Non-inflation
> - Non-fickleness
> - Non-restlessness
> - Gentleness
> - Guardedness
> - Workability
> - Thoroughbred-ness
> - One-pointedness
> - Delight in solitude
> - Avoidance of gatherings
> - Joy in seclusion
> - Seclusion of body
> - Non-confusion of mind
> - Mental orientation toward forest
> - Few desires
> - Guarding the postures
> - Knowing the right time
> - Knowing the occasion
> - Knowing the measure
> - Knowing liberation
> - Being easy to support
> - Being easy to maintain..."

---

## Part III: The Greatness of Calm

What is the greatness of this calm? It is **the power to generate knowledge of things as they are**. For:⁴

> *"One who is concentrated knows things as they are,"* said the Sage.

As stated in the Dharmasaṃgīti:

> "For one of concentrated mind, there is seeing of things as they are. For the bodhisattva who sees things as they are, great compassion operates toward beings. And thus for him: 'This samādhi-gate and seeing all dharmas as they are—I must accomplish this for all beings.'
>
> He, urged by that great compassion, fulfilling the training in higher morality, higher mind, and higher wisdom, awakens to the four right complete awakenings. 'Therefore I must be well-established in morality, unshaking, unbent.'
>
> This is the greatness of calm."

Understanding this greatness—the transcendence of one's own and others' endless suffering in bad destinies, the attainment of the summit of endless worldly and supramundane happiness—ardor should be cultivated by desiring it, like one inside a burning house desiring cool water. By that, intense earnestness arises toward the trainings. By that, mindfulness stands firm. With mindfulness firm, one avoids the fruitless. And one who avoids—for that one, harms do not arise.

**Therefore, by one wishing to protect one's person, having traced out the root of mindfulness, one should always be of established mindfulness.**

---

## Part IV: Mindfulness for Householders and Renounciants

Hence in the Ugraparipṛcchā, regarding the householder bodhisattva, it is stated:⁵

> "By him, having refrained from the heedlessness-ground of liquor, wine, and intoxicants, being un-intoxicated, un-mad, non-fickle, non-restless, non-confused, non-chattering, non-inflated, non-agitated, of established mindfulness and clear comprehension..."

And here, regarding the renunciant bodhisattva:

> "Non-distraction in mindfulness and clear comprehension..."

---

## Part V: What Is Right Mindfulness?

Mindfulness is described in the Āryaratnacūḍasūtra:⁶

> "That mindfulness by which the arising of all afflictions does not occur;
> That mindfulness by which one does not give access to all works of Māra;
> That mindfulness by which one does not fall into a wrong path or a bad road;
> That mindfulness which, acting as gatekeeper, does not give opportunity to all unwholesome mental and mental-associated dharmas—
> This is called right mindfulness."

---

## Part VI: What Is Clear Comprehension?

Clear comprehension (*saṃprajanya*) is stated in the Prajñāpāramitā:⁷

> "Walking, he knows 'I am walking.' Standing, he knows 'I am standing.' Lying down, he knows 'I am lying down.' Sitting, he knows 'I am sitting.' However his body is disposed, so he knows it...
>
> He is one who acts with clear comprehension in going forward, in going back, in looking, in bending, in stretching, in wearing the saṃghāṭī, the pātra, the cīvara, in eating, drinking, chewing, in dispelling drowsiness and fatigue, in coming, going, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and being silent, in withdrawal."

---

## Part VII: Morality and Concentration

For morality conduces to concentration. As stated in the Candrapradīpasūtra:⁸

> *Quickly he obtains concentration, unobstructed—these are the benefits of purified morality.*

From this it is understood: Whatever applications are causes of concentration—all of them are included within morality. Therefore, by one desiring concentration, one should have morality of mindfulness and clear comprehension.

Likewise, by one desiring morality too, effort should be made in concentration, due to the statement in that very sūtra. Regarding the benefits of dhyāna:

> *He is not of bad conduct, well-established in [good] conduct.*
> *The yogī ranges in proper pasture, avoiding improper pasture.*
>
> *Dwelling without burning, guarded, with senses restrained.*

---

## Part VIII: Mind-Training Is the Bodhisattva Training

By these two—morality and concentration—mutually increasing each other, the completion of the work of the mind is accomplished. And this is the extent of the bodhisattva training: **mind-training** (*cittaparikarma*), since this is the root of all benefit for beings.⁹

For it is stated in the Āryaratnamegha:

> "All dharmas are preceded by mind. When mind is fully known, all dharmas are fully known."

And:

> *"The world is led by mind; mind does not see mind.*
> *By mind karma is accumulated, whether wholesome or unwholesome.*
>
> *Mind whirls like a firebrand. Mind rushes like a horse.*
> *Mind burns like a forest fire. Mind sweeps away like a great flood."*

Examining thus, he dwells with mindfulness well-established in the mind, not going under the power of mind. Rather, the mind comes under his power. When mind is under his power, all dharmas come under his power.

---

## Part IX: The City of the Mind

In the Āryagaṇḍavyūhasūtra too it is described:¹⁰

> "All bodhisattva conduct is based on one's own mind; all ripening and disciplining of beings is based on one's own mind..."
>
> "One's own mind must be supported with all roots of virtue. One's own mind must be moistened with Dharma-clouds. One's own mind must be purified from obstructive dharmas. One's own mind must be strengthened with vigor..."

And here, when the noble Sudhana became confused upon seeing Māyādevī, this instruction was given by the city-goddess Ratnanetrikā regarding seeing her:

> "By you, O son of good family, there should be skill in guarding the city of the mind—by not dwelling with delight in the objects of all saṃsāra.
>
> By you there should be engagement in adorning the city of the mind—by relying on the ten Tathāgata powers.
>
> By you there should be engagement in purifying the city of the mind—by removing envy, stinginess, and guile.
>
> By you there should be engagement in increasing the city of the mind—by increasing the great vigor of the accumulations of omniscience.
>
> By you there should be engagement in making the city of the mind impregnable—by not being crushed by all affliction-Māras, bodily evil-friend Māras, and Māra-armies.
>
> By you there should be engagement in expanding the city of the mind—by suffusing all worlds with great loving-kindness.
>
> By you there should be engagement in covering the city of the mind—by accomplishing the great Dharma-umbrella as antidote to all unwholesome dharmas.
>
> By you there should be engagement in opening the city of the mind—by causing all worlds to obtain internal and external things...
>
> Thus, O son of good family, for the bodhisattva engaged in purifying the city of the mind, all roots of virtue can be attained. Why is that? For when the bodhisattva's city of the mind is thus purified, all obstructions do not stand before him—neither the obstruction to seeing Buddhas, nor the obstruction to hearing Dharma..."

---

## Part X: Mind Does Not Waver from Calm

Therefore it is established:

> **Mind-training is indeed the bodhisattva training.** (Kārikā 9ab)

And this is for one of non-fickle mind:

> **And mind does not waver from calm, due to cessation of external activities.** (Kārikā 9cd)

For one dependent on non-clear-comprehension, whose mindfulness is stolen—the mind wavers, being drawn elsewhere from the intended object. But when by mindfulness and clear comprehension external activities are ceased, then, due to being under their control, bound to a single object, [the mind] remains as long as wished. And from that, the detailed benefits as before.

---

## Part XI: Attracting Beings

Even now, one becomes capable of accomplishing beings' aims, due to generating faith:¹¹

> *Non-fickle everywhere, by slow, affectionate, gentle speech,*
> *one attracts worthy people and becomes one whose [instruction] is accepted.* (Kārikā 10)

And this is the bodhisattva's very task—the attraction of beings. As illuminated by the bodhisattva Āryapriyadarśana in the Āryādharmasaṃgītisūtra:

> "Thus, O Blessed One, the bodhisattva should practice so that merely by seeing him, beings generate faith. Why is that? For the bodhisattva, O Blessed One, there is no other task except the attraction of beings. The ripening of beings—this, O Blessed One, is the bodhisattva's Dharma-assembly."

---

## Part XII: The Danger of Displeasing Others

What is the fault if one does not act thus?

> *But one whose [instruction] is not accepted—the world, having disdained that seed of the Victor,*
> *like fire hidden by ash, is cooked in hells and such.* (Kārikā 11)

As previously indicated. And the cause of his disdain is this harm:

> *In the Ratnamegha the Victor stated the summary restraint:*
> *That by which beings become displeased—that one should carefully avoid.* (Kārikā 12)

As He said:¹²

> "And what are those bodhisattva behaviors? Here the bodhisattva does not dwell in an improper place, not at an improper time. He is not one who speaks at the wrong time, not one who does not know the time, not one who does not know the place. From whatever cause beings might become displeased toward him—he, for the sake of protecting all beings and for the sake of fulfilling his own accumulation of awakening, becomes one of accomplished deportment, soft-spoken, gentle-spoken, not associated with gatherings, oriented toward seclusion, with a pleasing face."

Hence in the Dharmasaṃgītisūtra it is taught:

> "One who protects beings protects morality."

By this slight [rule], protection of the world is accomplished regarding private sitting with young women, etc. Likewise, in water and land places for enjoyment, one should not void urine, feces, phlegm, pus, etc.—disgusting things—secretly or openly, for the sake of protecting the minds of gods and humans.

---

## Part XIII: Rules of Speech

In the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa too, avoidance of displeasing [behavior] is stated:

> "One should not chew a tooth-stick in front [of others]; one should not spit in front [of others]..."

This rule of respect and modesty should be applied everywhere, not only among fellow-practitioners. But in this sūtra, regarding fellow-practitioners, [it is specified] to show the fear of greater offense.

And as stated here:

> "One should not be loud-speaking..."

And this rule is not limited to one place.

Likewise in the Brahmaparipṛcchā it is also stated:

> "The bodhisattva should not be like an executioner."

And also from the Prātimokṣa, seeking out and avoiding what displeases the world. There:

> *One should not eat with mouth full, noisily, with extended face.*
> *One should not sit with dangling legs, nor rub the arms simultaneously.*

Thus, by one's own inference, seeing, and hearing, one should protect against displeasing the world.

---

## Part XIV: The Sāgaramati Precepts on Speech

Avoidance of displeasing speech is not easy, so it is shown for the purpose of awakening memory. As taught in the Āryasāgaramatisūtra:¹³

> "He is not of sunken speech. Not of scattered speech. Not of flowing speech. Not of blazing speech. Not of speech led by desire. Not of vulgar speech. Not of unguarded speech. Not of speech kindling hatred. Not of restless speech. Not of fickle speech. Not of actor-stage speech. He is not one who places false testimony on [another's] face."

---

## Part XV: The Tathāgataguhya Precepts on Speech

In the Āryatathāgataguhyasūtra it is also said:¹⁴

> "Indeed, O son of good family, the bodhisattva's speech is not desirous, not hateful, not deluded, not afflicted, not of crushed-answer, not speech exalting one's own side, not speech suppressing the other's side, not speech favoring one's own appearance, not speech opposing the other's appearance, not speech just for winning the debate, not speech of proud explanation."

---

## Part XVI: The Daśabhūmika Precepts on Speech

In the Āryadaśabhūmakasūtra too it is stated:¹⁵

> "That speech which is unpleasant, destroying one's own and others' continuum—having abandoned such speech, he utters speech which is affectionate, soft, pleasant, sweet, dear-making, mind-pleasing, beneficial, ear-pleasant, heart-going, love-producing, clear in sound, knowable, worth hearing, not dependent, desired by many, pleasing to many, mind-pleasing to many, praised by the wise, bringing welfare and happiness to all beings, uplifting the mind, gladdening the mind, delighting one's own and others' continuum, pacifying desire, hatred, delusion, and all afflictions—he utters such speech. He avoids even speech with legends and history, avoiding it."

---

## Part XVII: Protecting Beings by Examining One's Own Faults

In brief, protecting the disaffection of others is taught in the Āryasāgaramatisūtra:¹⁶

> "Another single dharma conduces to the Mahāyāna-synthesis: **by examining one's own faults, one protects all beings.**"

---

## Part XVIII: Summary Verse on Protecting One's Person

> *This is the protection of one's person—* (Kārikā 13a)

—how one is not destroyed by others, and how one does not destroy others. The condensed meaning of this extensive text should always be held in mind by the bodhisattva:

> *"Firmly stable, well-pleased, steady, with earnest respect,*
> *modest, with fear, peaceful, intent on pleasing others,*
> *always under control of self and beings in blameless matters,*
> *I hold this mind like a magical creation, without pride."*

---

## Part XIX: Protection Through Medicine, Clothing, Etc.

Is this the extent of protecting one's person? No. What then?

> *...with medicine, clothing, etc.* (Kārikā 13b)

Therein, medicine is of two kinds: constant medicine and illness-condition medicine.¹⁷

Regarding constant medicine, it is stated in the Āryaratnamegha:

> "Therefore, of the alms-food, one portion he sets aside for fellow practitioners. A second [portion] for the suffering. A third for the destitute. The fourth he himself partakes. Partaking, he partakes without desire, without attachment, without greed, without clinging—only for the sake of the body's maintenance, for its support.
>
> He partakes in such a way that he is neither too emaciated nor too heavy-bodied. Why is that? One who is too emaciated turns away from the wholesome side. One who is too heavy-bodied is overcome by torpor. Therefore, having partaken of that alms-food, one should be oriented toward the wholesome side..."

---

## Part XX: The Dharma-Armor for Alms-Gathering

In the Āryaratnarāśi it is also stated:¹⁸

> "By him, going to village, town, or hamlet for alms, the Dharma-armor should be donned. What is that Dharma-armor?
>
> Having seen unpleasant forms, one should not be repelled. Having seen pleasant [forms], one should not be attracted. Thus regarding pleasant and unpleasant sounds, smells, tastes, and touchables—one should not be attracted, not be repelled.
>
> With senses well-restrained, with eyes not upturned, looking only a plow-length ahead, with a trained thoroughbred mind, not abandoning the mental orientation to prior dharmas, not with a continuum cast toward baits—thus one should go for alms, going house-to-house.
>
> Wherever alms-food is obtained, there one should not generate attachment. Wherever not obtained, there one should not generate aversion. In ten houses' entry, if from the eleventh house alms-food is not obtained, even then one should not be distressed. And the thought should be generated: 'These householders and brahmins have many tasks. They are not obliged to give to me. It is already wonderful that they notice me—let alone that they will give alms.'
>
> Thus, not distressed, one should go for alms.
>
> And whatever beings come within the range of one's eyes—women, men, boys, girls, even animals—toward them the thought of loving-kindness and compassion should be generated: 'May I act so that those beings who come within range of my eyes, who will give me alms-food, I will cause to go to good destinations. Such a yoga I will pursue.'
>
> Then, having gathered the alms-food, coarse or refined, one should look about in the four directions: 'Who here in this village is a poor being to whom I will give a share of this alms-food?' If one sees a poor being, a share should be given from that alms-food.
>
> If one does not see any poor being, the thought should be generated: 'There are beings not in visible range who do not come within range of my eyes. To them I offer the first portion of this alms-food. Having taken it, may they partake.'
>
> Then, having taken that alms-food, ascending to that forest-hermitage, with washed hands, with fine conduct, endowed with the appearance of renunciant practice, sitting with legs crossed, that alms-food should be partaken...
>
> While partaking, this mental orientation should be generated: 'There are in this body eighty thousand families of worms. May they, by this very nourishment, dwell happy and comfortable. Now I will gather them with materiality; having attained awakening, I will gather them with Dharma.'
>
> If his alms-food is coarse, the thought should be generated: 'By coarse food, my body will become light, fit for exertion. My excretion will be little. Faith-offerings will be little. I will have lightness of body and lightness of mind. I will have little sickness and torpor.'
>
> When his alms-food is abundant, one should be an eater of measure, one whose nature is to relinquish. Then, descending onto some rock from that alms-food, the thought should be generated: 'Whatever flocks of deer and birds are interested in material food—may they, having taken it, partake.'"

---

## Part XXI: Avoidance of Meat

Thus, protection of one's person should be done with constant medicine. But not with fish and meat, since it is prohibited in the Laṅkāvatārasūtra:¹⁹

> "All meat is not to be eaten by a bodhisattva of compassionate nature—so I declare..."
>
> *Due to one's own birth, due to misconduct,*
> *due to arising from semen and blood,*
> *as horrifying to beings—*
> *the yogī should avoid meat.*
>
> *Meat, onions, various liquors,*
> *garlic, and leeks—*
> *the yogī should always avoid.*
>
> *One should avoid anointing with oil;*
> *one should not sleep among creatures pierced by thorns,*
> *nor in places of great danger for beings with hollows and non-hollows...*
>
> *For gain, life is killed; for meat, wealth is given.*
> *Both those evil-doers are cooked in Raurava and such...*
>
> *Whoever, transgressing the Sage's word, foolishly eats meat—*
> *for the destruction of both worlds, initiated in Śākya's teaching—*
>
> *They go to the supreme terrible hell;*
> *those evil-doers are cooked in fierce Raurava and such, the meat-eaters.*
>
> *There is no meat that is three-fold pure—*
> *not prepared, not wished for, not caused.*
> *Therefore, meat should not be eaten...*
>
> *By one dwelling in loving-kindness always, it is entirely censured by me.*
> *One would be together with lions, tigers, deer, etc.*
>
> *Therefore, one should not eat meat, which horrifies people.*
> *Being obstructed from liberation-dharma—this is the flag of the noble ones.*

Regarding what is recited in the Jñānavatīparivarta about eating meat—that is without fault because it accomplishes a great purpose.

---

## Part XXII: Illness-Condition Medicine

Constant medicine has been stated. Illness-condition medicine—that should certainly be used.²⁰

Even in the Śrāvaka-vinaya, for one's own sake, for the sake of the holy life, even selling the bowl and robe for the maintenance of the body is stated—how much more for the sake of saving limitless people, the bodhisattva's body. "Rare is the festival of obtaining such a moment-opportunity."

And for showing this, the Blessed One himself demonstrated the use of medicine there.

---

## Part XXIII: The Mind of a Servant

> *But from enjoying with self-craving, afflicted offense arises.* (Kārikā 13cd)

For everything has been relinquished by the bodhisattva to all beings. Therein, if forgetfully, with craving for self-maintenance, he partakes of another's property, he incurs afflicted offense.²¹

But if, free from craving, attached to another or remembering the task for beings, he partakes—he does not incur afflicted offense.

If perceiving it as another's property, he partakes for his own sake—he incurs the offense of theft. In the earlier rule, in the Prātimokṣa, this is a *pārājika* defeat.

But with possessions owned by beings, the person (*ātmabhāva*) owned by beings is itself protected—so there is no fault. For a servant, always occupied with the master's work, has no own-property by which he would live.

As stated in the Dharmasaṃgītisūtra:

> "By the bodhisattva there should be dwelling like a servant—causing the accomplishment of all beings' service."

---

*Thus ends the Sixth Chapter, Protection of One's Person, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*

# Chapter 7: Protection of Enjoyments and Merit (Bhogapuṇyarakṣā)

---

*The seventh chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on how to protect enjoyments and merit through proper use of material goods, avoiding gain and honor, cultivating humility, and dedicating merit to awakening.*

---

## Introduction

Thus, protection of one's person is to be understood [as stated in the previous chapter].¹ But protection of enjoyments (*bhogarakṣā*) is to be stated. There:

> **By one who undertakes good deeds, and by one knowing measure in everything,**
> **from this training-precept, protection of enjoyments is not difficult.** (Kārikā 14)

---

## Part I: Knowing Measure in Enjoyments

For in the Ugraparipṛcchā, the training-precept is stated:²

> "Acting with well-considered action; acting with well-done action."

By this, examination of the improper disposition of enjoyments [is enjoined]. The prohibition of contempt becomes established. And by the presentation on calm, knowing measure (*mātrajñatā*) and knowing propriety (*yuktijñatā*) have been stated.

By this, the following is established: "Even when the task can be accomplished with little and low enjoyments, one should not—oneself or through others—neglect the destruction of many superior enjoyments."

---

## Part II: Proper Use of Servants and Possessions

Hence in the Ugraparipṛcchā it is stated:³

> "By the proper use of sons, wives, female servants, male servants, workers, and employees..."

Likewise, neither relinquishing nor non-relinquishing should be done when it causes obstruction to one's own and others' awakening-factors, learning, etc.

For a bodhisattva of greater or equal power in beings' welfare, neither relinquishing nor non-relinquishing should be done when it causes obstruction to greater or equal wholesome [deeds]—this is established.

---

## Part III: The Renunciant's Dharma-Gift

Regarding this, in the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa it is stated:⁴

> "What indeed, Śāriputra, should a bodhisattva who has gone forth from household life, devoted to the limbs of awakening—how should he give gifts? What gifts should he give? How much should he give?...
>
> He should be a Dharma-giver, a Dharma-patron.
>
> And, Śāriputra, if a householder bodhisattva, having filled buddha-fields equal to the sands of the Ganges with the seven treasures, should give this gift to the Tathāgatas, Arhats, Samyaksaṃbuddhas—and if a renunciant bodhisattva should illuminate a single four-line verse, this latter generates far more merit.
>
> **Śāriputra, material gift (*āmiṣadāna*) has not been approved by the Tathāgata for the renunciant.**...
>
> If, however, there should be gain that has come into the bowl, that is in the bowl, righteous, rightfully obtained—he should be one who eats in common with his fellow-practitioners.
>
> If someone should come asking for a bowl or robe, he should give what is superfluous beyond the Buddha-approved three robes, as long as it is not relinquished.
>
> But if his robe would be insufficient—that on which the holy life depends—that should not be relinquished. Why is that? The Tathāgata has said the three robes are not to be given away.
>
> But if, Śāriputra, a bodhisattva, having relinquished the three robes, should become one who is heavy toward beggars—by him few desires would not have been cultivated.
>
> By a bodhisattva who has gone forth from household life, the Dharma should be cultivated. He should be devoted to that."

---

## Part IV: The Danger of Obstructing Greater Good

For otherwise, for the sake of gathering one [person], great harm would be done to a great mass of beings—and to that being's own future preparation as a bodhisattva—harm to a great purpose.⁵

Hence, avoiding the excellent wholesome side is called "non-washing" (*apakṣāla*).

Thus, the prohibition of relinquishing [is stated]. The prohibition of non-relinquishing is also [stated], as in the Āryasāgaramatisūtra, where having many gains is seen among the obstacles to the Mahāyāna.

---

## Part V: The Vimalakīrti Exchange

In the Āryavimalakīrtinirdeśa too it is stated:⁶

> "What should one afraid of the fear of saṃsāra resort to?"
>
> He said: "One afraid of the fear of saṃsāra, O Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattva should resort to the greatness of the Buddha."
>
> "Where should one wishing to stand in the greatness of the Buddha stand?"
>
> He said: "One wishing to stand in the greatness of the Buddha should stand in equality with all beings."
>
> "Where should one wishing to stand in equality with all beings stand?"
>
> He said: "One wishing to stand in equality with all beings should stand for the liberation of all beings."

---

## Part VI: Dharmasaṃgīti on Beings' Liberation

In the Dharmasaṃgīti too, the bodhisattva Sārthavāha said:⁷

> "Whatever bodhisattva, O Blessed One, wishes for enlightenment first for all beings, not for himself... this, O Blessed One, is the Dharma-assembly."

And from the very relinquishment [of all to beings], the absence of self-interest is established. However, due to fear of harm to beings' welfare, one does not place one's own burden on an unsuitable being.

But where one does not see harm to beings' welfare, what difference is there whether one accomplishes the world's welfare oneself or through another? Because one does not relinquish one's own wholesome [deed] for the sake of accomplishing another bodhisattva's wholesome [deed].

If one fears one's own suffering in bad destinies—that very suffering belongs to the second [bodhisattva] as well. If one is indifferent [thinking] "That suffering does me no harm"—by the sūtras stated [above], one incurs offense.

---

## Part VII: The Four Bodhisattva-Pretenders

As in the Ratnakūṭasūtra:⁸

> "There are, O Kāśyapa, four who are pretenders (*pratirūpaka*) of bodhisattvas..."

It is stated: "He is one who seeks his own happiness, not one who seeks to remove the suffering of all beings."

Therefore, by the rule of the Ugraparipṛcchā, as before, oneself should be blamed.

---

## Part VIII: Protection of Merit

Protection of enjoyments has been stated in summary. Protection of merit (*puṇyarakṣā*) is to be stated.⁹

> **By freedom from craving for the ripening of self-interest, merit is well-protected.** (Kārikā 15ab)

As stated in the Nārāyaṇaparipṛcchā:

> "He does not protect morality for his own sake, not for the sake of heaven, not for the sake of Śakra-hood, not for the sake of enjoyments, not for the sake of power, not for the sake of form, not for the sake of beauty, not for the sake of fame... not afraid of hell does he protect morality... not afraid of animal birth does he protect morality.
>
> Rather, he protects morality for the sake of establishing the Buddha-guidance. He protects morality seeking the welfare, benefit, happiness, and security of all beings."

He, the bodhisattva endowed with such a morality-aggregate, does not diminish in ten dharmas. Which ten?
- He does not diminish from universal-monarch sovereignty
- He is unheedful, aspiring to awakening, aspiring to see Buddhas
- He does not diminish from Brahma-hood, from seeing Buddhas
- He does not diminish from Dharma-hearing
- He does not diminish from bodhisattva-vow undertaking for accomplishing practice as heard
- He does not diminish from all wholesome dharmas, dhyānas, due to unobstructed eloquence...

Thus, the bodhisattva mahāsattva established in the morality-aggregate is always honored by gods, always praised by nāgas, always honored by yakṣas, always worshipped by gandharvas, always respected by nāga-lords and asura-lords, always well-regarded by brahmins, kṣatriyas, merchants, and householders, always to be approached by the wise, always attended by Buddhas, approved by the Teacher for the world with its gods, and compassionate toward all beings...

He does not go to four destinies. Which four?
- He does not go to the unfavorable-moment destiny, except for the sake of ripening beings
- He does not go to a buddha-field empty of Buddhas
- He does not go to birth in a wrong-view family
- He does not go to any bad destiny.

---

## Part IX: No Regret After Giving

Thus, even merit that was previously relinquished, when taken up again under the power of afflictions—its protection should be made. Even from merit-giving, whatever merit [arises], from that too no ripening should be sought, except for others' welfare.¹⁰

Moreover, one wishing to protect merit:

> **Should not create regret afterward.** (Kārikā 15c)

As stated in the Ugraparipṛcchā:

> "And having given, one should not generate a regretful mind."

From weakness of the back comes weakness [of the whole]. From regret, even merit would be exhausted like evil—this is the intention.

---

## Part X: Do Not Proclaim Good Deeds

> **And having done, should not make it public.** (Kārikā 15d)

For in many ways by the Blessed One, having concealed good and revealed evil (*pracchannakalyāṇatā vivṛtapāpatā*) is praised.¹¹ Therein, the exhaustion of what is revealed is understood—of evil through sorrow, of merit through elation.

There is no offense for one who publicizes [good deeds] for beings' sake, with a mind without bait.

As in the Ratnamegha, by the physician analogy, self-exaltation is stated to be without fault.

---

## Part XI: Avoiding Gain, Honor, and Pride

Moreover, one wishing to protect merit:

> **Should be afraid of gain and honor, should always avoid exaltation;**
> **the bodhisattva should be serene, should abandon doubt in the Dharma.** (Kārikā 16)

In the Ratnakūṭa it is stated:¹²

> "By four dharmas, O Kāśyapa, a bodhisattva's arisen wholesome dharmas are diminished—by which [four] they do not increase in wholesome dharmas. Which four?
>
> 1. By the conceited one's search for *lokāyata* mantras (worldly philosophy)
> 2. By one intent on gain and honor, through looking at families
> 3. By hatred-accusation of bodhisattvas
> 4. By rejection of unheard and un-expounded sūtras"

---

## Part XII: Merit Exhausted by Ill-Will

In the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya it is recited:¹³

> "See, O monks, this monk generating faith by prostrating with his whole body at the stūpa of hair and nails? Yes, Venerable One. By this monk, O monks, as much earth as was touched—down eighty thousand yojanas to the golden wheel—as many sands as there are, so many thousands of universal-monarch sovereignties are to be enjoyed by this monk.
>
> Then the venerable Upāli, approaching the Blessed One, joining palms, said to the Blessed One: 'The Blessed One has said that this monk has such great roots of virtue. Where, O Blessed One, do these roots of virtue become thin, exhausted, depleted?'
>
> 'Upāli, I do not see such diminution and impairment as when a fellow-practitioner generates an ill mind toward a fellow-practitioner. There, Upāli, these great roots of virtue become thin, exhausted, depleted.'
>
> 'Therefore, Upāli, thus should you train: "We will not corrupt our minds even toward a burnt post—how much less toward a body possessing consciousness."'"

---

## Part XIII: Ill-Will Destroys a Kalpa's Merit

In the Āryamañjuśrīvikrīḍitasūtra it is also said:¹⁴

> "'Opposition, opposition'—it destroys roots of virtue accumulated over a hundred kalpas; therefore it is called 'opposition' (*pratigha*)."

In the Āryagaṇḍavyūhasūtra too, the night-goddess Samantasattvaparitrāṇyojaḥśrī, telling a previous story, stated:

> "They, by that root of unwholesomeness arisen from mutual disdain, were diminished even from their lifespan, from their beauty, from their strength, from their happiness..."

And here, "always" is stated to show that exaltation should never be made.

---

## Part XIV: When Gain May Be Accepted

Gain and honor, however, are sometimes accepted. As stated in the Āryaratnamegha:¹⁵

> "Here, O son of good family, a bodhisattva, receiving even a Sumeru-sized heap of jewels, accepts it; receiving even a lesser thing, [he accepts it].
>
> Why is that? Thus he thinks: 'These beings are stingy, greedy, overcome by greed. Due to that cause, that condition, that basis, they, like those held by a great mass of water, bob up and down in the ocean of saṃsāra. This will be for their long-term welfare, benefit, and happiness.'
>
> Having accepted everything, he does not make it his own. He does not generate a greedy mind. Rather, he makes an offering to Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha in common with all beings. He makes it a means of livelihood for all suffering beings. And he encourages and delights that patron."

And here it is also stated:

> "And by that gift he is not exalted."

And again:

> "If, due to that cause, that condition, that basis, fame-word-renown arises for him—there he is not exalted-born, not proud-born, not intoxicated-born. Thus he thinks: 'Before long, he for whom this fame-word-renown has arisen, and this fame-word-renown itself—all three will entirely cease to be. What person of wise nature, among dharmas that are impermanent, unstable, not lasting, would generate a mind of attachment, be exalted, or be proud and arrogant?'
>
> Thus the bodhisattva dwells with mindfulness well-established regarding gain, honor, fame-word-renown."

---

## Part XV: Dwelling Like an Outcaste Youth

And again:¹⁶

> "They dwell in the world like outcaste youths, with a low, low mind; they become ones who have arrived at pride, intoxication, and arrogance, due to the constant presence of the perception of slander."

And again:

> "Here, O son of good family, a renunciant bodhisattva who has gone forth from household life, [thinking] 'I am like a corpse to friends, relatives, and kin,' is one whose pride has been struck down.
>
> 'Disfigurement has arisen in me, discolored garments are worn by me, another appearance has befallen me'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'With shaved head, bowl in hand, I go from family to family for alms, because of alms, due to alms'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'With a low, low mind, like an outcaste youth, I go for alms'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'I have become a bowl-liver; my livelihood depends on others'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'I accept what is rejected, what is disdained'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'My teachers, masters, and venerable ones are to be pleased'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'My fellow-practitioners are to be satisfied—by such and such conduct, pasture, and behavior'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'I shall attain Buddha-dharmas not yet attained'—his pride is struck down.
>
> 'Among beings who are angry, with corrupted minds, I shall dwell abounding in patience'—his pride is struck down."

---

## Part XVI: The Ten Māra-Works

In the Āryalokottaraparivarta it is stated:¹⁷

> "These, O son of the Victor, are ten Māra-works of bodhisattvas. Which ten?
>
> 1. **Disrespect** toward teachers, venerable ones, ācāryas, fathers, mothers, śramaṇas, brāhmaṇas, and those rightly going, rightly practicing—this is Māra-work.
>
> 2. **Not bowing** to Dharma-preachers, to those who have attained distinguished dharmas, to expounders of excellent dharmas, to those mounted on the Mahāyāna, to those who know the procedure of the nirvāṇa-path, to those who have obtained dhāraṇī-sūtra-supremacy; being haughty and stiff; not generating respect for the Dharma-preacher, not causing service, not causing appreciation—Māra-work. Seated in a Dharma-hearing conversation, when the great Dharma-wave arises, not giving applause to the Dharma-preacher, [thinking] 'May no one praise this one'—Māra-work.
>
> 3. **Generating conceit** and grasping oneself, not grasping others; not entering into self-knowledge; not generating mental satisfaction—Māra-work.
>
> 4. **Generating pride**, not knowing, not understanding, concealing the praises of praise-worthy persons, speaking ill of them, and not being delighted by another's quality-praise—Māra-work.
>
> 5. **Knowing** 'This is Dharma, this is Vinaya, this is true Buddha-word,' yet making Dharma-hatred due to person-hatred, rejecting the true Dharma, and causing others to quarrel—Māra-work.
>
> 6. **Seeking high position**, not seeking what counteracts diminution, approaching and delighting in others' service, not rising for or going out to meet old, long-practiced holy-lifers—Māra-work.
>
> 7. **Being frown-faced**, not smile-faced; not of affectionate, sweet speech; always hard-minded, seeking faults, looking for entry-points—Māra-work.
>
> 8. **Having fallen into conceit**, not approaching the wise, not serving, not attending, not waiting upon, not asking, not inquiring: 'What is wholesome, what is unwholesome? What, done, is for long-term welfare, benefit, and happiness? What, not done, is for long-term non-welfare, non-benefit, and non-happiness?' He becomes stupid, even more stupid, wrapped in delusion, grasping pride, not seeing escape—Māra-work.
>
> 9. **Overcome by pride**, he becomes disgusted with Buddha-arising, exhausts former roots of virtue, does not raise new ones, expounds what is not to be expounded, undertakes quarrels, and is full of disputes. Living thus, there is occasion for him to fall into a wrong great precipice. And yet, by the power of the bodhicitta-commitment, he attains wonder. He does not encounter Buddha-arising for a hundred thousand kalpas—let alone Dharma-hearing. This is the tenth Māra-work.
>
> These, O son of the Victor, are the ten Māra-works which, having avoided, bodhisattvas obtain ten knowledge-works. And here, among the knowledge-works, it is stated: 'Humility toward all beings.'"

---

## Part XVII: The Rāṣṭrapāla Verse

In the Āryarāṣṭrapālasūtra too it is stated:¹⁸

> *Bad-destiny-ground, unfavorable-moment destinies,*
> *poverty, birth in a low family,*
> *blind-birth, weakness, and little strength—*
> *those fools, overcome by pride, grasp these.*

---

## Part XVIII: Beings as Buddha-Field

In the Dharmasaṃgītisūtra too it is stated:¹⁹

> "The being-field is the bodhisattva's buddha-field, since from the buddha-field comes the acquisition of Buddha-dharmas. I am not fit to err regarding it.
>
> And thus he thinks: 'All good conduct and bad conduct proceed depending on beings. From the basis of bad conduct, bad destinies proceed; from the basis of good conduct, gods and humans [proceed].'"

---

## Part XIX: The Ten Mind-States Toward Beings

Hence, in the Ratnolkādhāraṇī too it is stated:²⁰

> "Here, O sons of the Victor, a bodhisattva of first thought-arising, from the very beginning, generates toward all beings a ten-fold mind. Which ten?
>
> 1. Welfare-mind
> 2. Happiness-mind
> 3. Nurse-mind
> 4. Affectionate-mind
> 5. Dear-mind
> 6. Assistance-mind
> 7. Protection-mind
> 8. Equal-mind
> 9. Ācārya-mind
> 10. Teacher-mind
>
> This ten-fold mind he generates."

## Part XX: Servant to All Beings

In the Śraddhābalādhānāvatāramudrāsūtra too it is stated:²¹

> "'I am established in the undertaking of being a student of all beings. And I shall establish others in the undertaking of being students of all beings'—thus he obtains confidence...
>
> 'I am established in bowing and prostrating to all beings'—as before."

Therein, bowing and prostrating to all beings is humility toward all beings.

Likewise, in the Āryavimalakīrtinirdeśa, teacher-love toward all beings is stated for the sake of arising in a pure buddha-field.

For the sake of protecting the world's faith, even by one doing foot-showing work [i.e., menial service] on a seat, mentally, toward women or those who have attained unfavorable moments or the fallen—the bodhisattva should practice love and respect.

---

## Part XXI: The Blessed One's Service

For it is stated in the Gaṇḍavyūha, when that company sat on that great lion-throne, all that crowd stood facing, palms joined, honoring that very king...

And as stated in the Bhikṣuprakīrṇaka:²²

> "The Blessed One said: 'Do not fear, monk, do not fear, monk! I, O monk, will attend you. Bring, O monk, the robes, that I may wash them.'
>
> Thus addressed, the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: 'May the Blessed One not wash the impurity-stained robes of this sick one. I, O Blessed One, will wash them.'
>
> The Blessed One said: 'Then, Ānanda, you wash this monk's robes. The Tathāgata will pour the water.'
>
> Then the venerable Ānanda washed the robes of that sick monk. The Blessed One poured the water...
>
> Then the venerable Ānanda, having properly and well taken up that sick monk, having brought him outside, bathed him. The Blessed One poured the water."

---

## Part XXII: Verses on Serving Beings

And it is said:²³

> *Those whom, having pleased, one attains greatness; having opposed, one attains terrible ruin—*
> *is it not right to satisfy them even by abandoning life?*
>
> *These are those beings by pleasing whom many have attained success.*
> *There is no field of success other than beings in the world.*
>
> *These are wish-fulfilling jewels, good vessels, and wish-granting cows.*
> *Like a teacher, like a deity—therefore they are to be pleased.*
>
> *Moreover, for those who are genuine relatives, who bring immeasurable benefit,*
> *having abandoned pleasing beings, what other atonement could there be?*
>
> *One should carry on one's head, as formerly the Protector did as wished,*
> *the beings who dwelt in his matted hair, having become [such], with firm effort.*
>
> *Those for whose sake one breaks the body and enters Avīci—*
> *when that is done for them, [the task] is done.*
>
> *Therefore, toward even great harm-doers, one should practice only good.*
>
> *My very masters, after all—for whose sake I am indifferent even to myself—*
> *how can I make pride toward those various masters, not servant-nature?*
>
> *Those in whose happiness the sage-lords go to joy,*
> *those in whose suffering they enter anger—*
> *from satisfying them, satisfaction of all sage-lords;*
> *in harm to them, harm done to the sages.*
>
> *Just as for one whose body is entirely on fire,*
> *there is no well-being from all pleasures—*
> *so too when beings are suffering,*
> *there is no means of joy for the greatly compassionate.*
>
> *Therefore, whatever suffering I have created for beings,*
> *which has saddened all the greatly compassionate—*
> *that evil I now confess;*
> *may the sages, whom I have grieved, forgive me.*
>
> *And for the sake of pleasing the Tathāgatas,*
> *I undertake servitude to the world with my entire being.*
> *Let crowds of people place their feet on my head,*
> *or let them strike—may the World-Protector be pleased.*
>
> *This entire world has been taken as their own by those of compassionate nature—*
> *of this there is no doubt.*
> *Are these not seen in the form of beings—*
> *those very Protectors? Why disrespect here?*
>
> *This very thing is pleasing of the Tathāgatas;*
> *this very thing is accomplishing one's own aim;*
> *this very thing removes the suffering of the world—*
> *therefore, may this be my vow.*
>
> *Just as a single king's man assaults a great crowd,*
> *acts cruelly—and the far-seeing crowd cannot [resist],*
> *since he is not alone—the king's power is his power—*
> *so one should not disdain any weak offender.*
>
> *For the guardians of hell and the compassionate—that is their power.*
> *Therefore, one should please beings as a servant [pleases] a fierce king.*
>
> *What would an angry king do that would equal the suffering of hell*
> *which is experienced from creating sorrow for beings?*
>
> *What would a pleased king give that would equal Buddha-hood*
> *which is experienced from creating joy for beings?*
>
> *Let alone future Buddha-hood arising from pleasing beings—*
> *do you not see in this very life good fortune, fame, and well-being?*
>
> *Beauty, health, joy, and long life—*
> *the patient one, wandering [in saṃsāra], obtains abundant universal-monarch happiness.*
>
> *That loving-intention is to be honored—that is the very greatness of beings.*
> *That merit from Buddha-faith—that is the very greatness of the Buddha.*

---

## Part XXIII: Loving-Kindness Surpasses All Worship

Hence, in the Candrapradīpasūtra, the fruit of loving-kindness meditation is displayed:²⁴

> *Whatever immeasurable, various worships*
> *in a hundred fields, in niyutas and crores—*
> *having made that worship of incomparable Leaders,*
> *it does not equal a fraction of the mind of loving-kindness.*

Therefore, toward such great venerable ones, one should always avoid exaltation.

---

## Part XXIV: Avoiding Improper Mental Attention

And this exaltation arises from improper mental attention (*ayoniśomanaskāra*).²⁵

Effort should be made toward its non-arising. As stated in the Ratnamegha:

> "And how, O son of good family, is a bodhisattva free from improper mental attention? Here, a bodhisattva, alone, gone to a secluded place, established in solitude, does not generate such a thought: 'I am one who dwells unmixed. I am established in solitude. I am one who practices in the Tathāgata's Dharma-Vinaya. But other śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas—they all dwell mixed, are full of association, are disturbed from the Tathāgata's Dharma-Vinaya.'
>
> Thus a bodhisattva is free from improper mental attention."

---

## Part XXV: Not Exalted by Vigor

And here again:²⁶

> "Here, a bodhisattva, undertaking vigor, does not relish that great vigor. He does not exalt himself by that vigor. He does not disparage others. Thus he thinks: 'What person of wise nature, devoted to one's own work, would reproach others?'
>
> Thus a bodhisattva is one of non-exalted vigor."

---

## Part XXVI: The Summary of Merit-Protection

This, then, is the summary of merit-protection: **dedication to awakening (*bodhipariṇāmanā*)**.²⁷

For thus it is stated in the Āryākṣayamatisūtra:

> "For there is no intermediate exhaustion of a root of virtue dedicated to awakening, until sitting on the seat of enlightenment. Just as, O venerable Śāradvatīputra, for a drop of water that has fallen into the great ocean, there is no intermediate exhaustion until the end of the kalpa."

---

*Thus ends the Seventh Chapter, Protection of Enjoyments and Merit, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*

# Chapter 8: Purification of Evil (Pāpaśodhana)

---

*The eighth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on how to purify evil through the four dharmas: confession, antidote practice, restraint-power, and refuge-power. Includes the famous Suvarṇaprabhāsottama confession verses and teachings on bodhicitta as the supreme purifier.*

---

## Introduction: Why Purification?

Protection of the three—person, enjoyments, and merit—has been stated.¹ Purification is now to be stated. For what purpose?

> **Of one whose person is purified, enjoyment will be wholesome,**
> **like food for embodied beings, rightly prepared, free from husk.** (Kārikā 17)

As stated in the Āryatathāgataguhyasūtra:²

> "And in great cities there are great charnel grounds, filled with hundreds of thousands of living beings. There too, the bodhisattva displays a great dead body of his own person. There, those beings born in animal wombs, having eaten their fill for a month, at the end of their lifespan, having died, are reborn among the gods of the happy destiny, the heavenly world. And he becomes the cause for them up to parinirvāṇa—namely, by the complete purity of that very bodhisattva's former aspiration. By him, for a long time, such an aspiration was made: 'Those who would eat my dead body for a month—may he become the cause for them for arising in heaven up to parinirvāṇa, for that morally disciplined one.' The prayer succeeds. The aspiration succeeds."

And again:

> "He, empowered by the Dharma-body, does benefit for beings even by being seen. He does benefit for beings by being heard, by being touched. Just as, O Śāntamati, the physician-king Jīvaka, having gathered all medicines, made a girl-form composed of medicine-trees—pleasing, beautiful, well-made, well-finished, well-adorned. She comes, goes, stands, sits, and lies down. Those who come—great beings, kings, ministers, merchants, householders, officers—that physician-king Jīvaka joins them with that medicine-girl. Having joined with her, all their diseases are calmed, and they become healthy, happy, without affliction.
>
> Just so, O Śāntamati, that bodhisattva empowered by the Dharma-body—whatever beings touch his body, women, men, boys, girls, afflicted by desire, hatred, and delusion, for them, having been touched, all afflictions are calmed, and they perceive the body as free from burning—namely, by the complete purity of that very bodhisattva's former aspiration."

For this purpose, one's person should be purified.

---

## Part I: The Danger of Not Purifying

And He states the fault of not purifying:

> **Just as grain covered by grass withers by diseases and does not thrive,**
> **so the Buddha-sprout, covered by afflictions, does not go to growth.** (Kārikā 18)

The intention is: for the purpose of growth, by dispelling the antidote.

---

## Part II: What Is Purification?

> **What is purification of person? Purification from evil and affliction.**
> **By the essence of the Perfectly Awakened One's statement; but without effort, one goes to bad destinies.** (Kārikā 19)

---

## Part III: The Four Dharmas for Overcoming Evil

Therein, purification of evil is taught in the Caturdharmasūtra:³

> "By four dharmas, O Maitreya, is a bodhisattva mahāsattva endowed who overcomes evil that has been done and accumulated. Which four?
>
> 1. **Condemnation-practice** (*vidūṣaṇāsamudācāra*)
> 2. **Antidote-practice** (*pratipakṣasamudācāra*)
> 3. **Restraint-power** (*pratyāpattibala*)
> 4. **Refuge-power** (*āśrayabala*)
>
> Therein, **condemnation-practice**: one who has done unwholesome karma becomes remorseful regarding it again and again.
>
> **Antidote-practice**: having done unwholesome karma, one engages intensely in wholesome karma.
>
> **Restraint-power**: from undertaking restraint, obtaining the restraint of non-doing.
>
> **Refuge-power**: going to refuge in Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, and not abandoning bodhicitta.
>
> With a strong support, one cannot be overcome by evil.
>
> By these four dharmas, O Maitreya, is a bodhisattva mahāsattva endowed who overcomes evil that has been done and accumulated."

---

## Part IV: The Suvarṇaprabhāsottama Confession

How should condemnation-practice be cultivated? As stated in the Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra:⁴

> *May the Buddhas attend to me, with minds of compassion and care.*
> *May they accept my transgression, established in the ten directions.*
>
> *And those who stand in the ten directions of the world, supreme among two-footed beings—*
> *whatever evil karma I have done before, most terrible,*
> *all that I will confess, standing before those of ten powers.*
>
> *Not knowing parents, not knowing Buddhas,*
> *not knowing the wholesome—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *Drunk with the intoxication of lordship, with the intoxication of family and enjoyments,*
> *drunk with the intoxication of youth—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *By ill-thought, ill-spoken, and by ill-done action,*
> *not seeing danger—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *By the conduct of a fool's understanding, with mind covered by ignorance,*
> *by the power of evil companions, with mind disturbed by afflictions—*
>
> *By the power of play and delight, by the power of sorrow and disease,*
> *by the fault of unsatisfied wealth—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *By association with ignoble people, by the cause of envy and stinginess,*
> *by the fault of guile and poverty—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *In this time of adversity's approach, by the cause of fear of desires,*
> *even by one without mastery—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *By the power of an unsteady mind, by the power of desire and anger,*
> *even afflicted by hunger and thirst—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *For the sake of drink, for the sake of food, for the sake of clothes, for the cause of women,*
> *by various affliction-torments—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *The evil of body, speech, and mind, the threefold misconduct accumulated—*
> *whatever was done with such forms, all that I confess.*
>
> *Whatever disrespect may have been done toward Buddhas, toward Dharma, and toward Śrāvakas—*
> *all that I confess.*
>
> *Whatever disrespect may have been done toward Pratyekabuddhas, or toward Bodhisattvas—*
> *all that I confess.*
>
> *Whatever disrespect may have been done toward Dharma-preachers, or toward those of other virtues—*
> *all that I confess.*
>
> *If the True Dharma was rejected by me, always not knowing,*
> *disrespect toward parents—all that I confess.*
>
> *By foolishness, by childishness, covered by pride and arrogance,*
> *by desire, hatred, and delusion—all that I confess.*
>
> *May the Buddhas look upon me, with minds of attention.*
> *May they accept my transgression, with minds offered to compassion.*
>
> *Whatever evil was done before by me, in hundreds of kalpas,*
> *on account of that I am sorrowful-minded, pitiful, tormented by fear.*
>
> *I fear the evil karma, constantly with a despairing mind.*
> *Wherever I will go, there is no power for me anywhere.*
>
> *All Buddhas are compassionate, all are removers of fear in the world.*
> *May they accept my transgression and release me from fear.*
>
> *May the Tathāgatas wash away the fruit of affliction and karma for me.*
> *May the Buddhas bathe me with the waters of the river of compassion.*
>
> *All evil I confess, whatever was done before by me.*
> *Whatever evil is mine now—all that I confess.*
>
> *For the future, I undertake restraint from all evil actions.*
> *I do not hide that evil, whatever misconduct may have been mine.*
>
> *The threefold bodily karma, and the fourfold of speech,*
> *by three kinds from mind—all that I confess.*
>
> *Done by body, done by speech, and thought by mind,*
> *the tenfold karma done—all that I confess.*
>
> *Whatever evil karma of mine, giver of undesired fruit—*
> *all that I will confess, standing before the Buddhas.*

---

## Part V: The Upāli Teaching on Offenses

Especially, the confession of bodhisattva offenses, heavy and light, is stated in the Āryopāliparipṛcchā:⁵

> "What is the heavy root offense? Generally, it is stated there: 'If, O Upāli, a bodhisattva mahāsattva set out in the Mahāyāna should incur offenses connected with desire equal to the sands of the Ganges, and should incur a single offense connected with hatred, taking the bodhisattva-vehicle as authority... this [latter] is a heavier offense.
>
> Why is that? Hatred, O Upāli, conduces to the abandonment of beings. Desire conduces to the gathering of beings. And, O Upāli, with regard to the affliction that conduces to gathering beings—there the bodhisattva has no deception, no fear...'
>
> Therefore, O Upāli, whatever offenses are connected with desire—all those I call non-offenses."

What is the intention here? It is because one who gathers beings is preeminent. For this teaching is for one with sincere intention and compassion.

For immediately after, He says:

> "Therein, O Upāli, bodhisattvas who are unskillful in means fear offenses connected with desire. But bodhisattvas who are skillful in means fear offenses connected with hatred, not those connected with desire."

---

## Part VI: Who Is Skillful in Means?

Who are skillful in means? Those who are restrained from abandoning beings by wisdom and compassion.⁶ For abandonment of beings occurs in two ways: by wisdom alone, from understanding the emptiness of suffering; and by compassion alone. By the power of affliction, compassion is quickly lost.

As stated in the Upāyakauśalyasūtra:

> "Just as, O son of good family, a man skilled in mantra-lore, bound by the king with a five-fold binding, when he wishes to escape, by the power of a single mantra-lore cuts all bonds and escapes—just so, O son of good family, a bodhisattva skilled in means finds delight in the five strands of desire, and dwells surrounded by them. But when he wishes, by the power of wisdom-commitment and by one omniscience-mind, having enjoyed all strands of desire, he dies and is reborn in a Brahma-world."

---

## Part VII: The Story of Jyotirmāṇavaka

In the Upāyakauśalyasūtra, regarding the brahmin youth Jyotirmāṇavaka who practiced celibacy for forty-two thousand years:⁷

> "Standing at the seventh step, compassion arose [in him]. 'Even if I, having broken this vow, would be destined for hell—still I am able to experience hellish suffering. And may this woman be happy. May she not make an end [of herself].'
>
> Thus, O son of good family, the brahmin youth Jyotirmāṇavaka, turning back, taking that woman by the right hand, said thus: 'Rise, O beautiful one. I will do whatever you wish.'...
>
> And I, O son of good family, by a great-compassion-mind-arising, though urgent, connected with desire, turned back for ten thousand kalpas.
>
> See, O son of good family: what for others is karma conducing to hell, for the bodhisattva skillful in means is karma conducing to arising in a Brahma-world."

---

## Part VIII: The Ratnamegha Permission

Clearly in the Āryaratnamegha, permission is given for killing a man about to commit an immediate retribution [crime].⁸ Even in the Śrāvaka-vinaya, in the very situation of a root offense, non-offense is stated for releasing a deer, etc., out of compassion.

---

## Part IX: Antidote-Practice

Condemnation-practice has been stated. Antidote-practice is stated.⁹ Therein, by familiarity with profound sūtras, exhaustion of evil occurs.

As stated in the Vajracchedikā:

> "O Subhūti, whatever sons or daughters of good family will take up these sūtras of such a kind, up to mastery—they will become despised, greatly despised. Why is that? Whatever karma of those beings done in former births, conducing to bad destinies—by that state of being despised, in this very life they will exhaust it, and will attain Buddha-awakening."

---

## Part X: Purification by Emptiness-Intent

By intent on emptiness, too, purification of evil occurs. As stated in the Tathāgatakoṣasūtra:¹⁰

> "If, O Kāśyapa, a single being should be endowed with these ten unwholesome karma-paths, extremely serious:
>
> - This is the supreme taking of life: if his father were a Pratyekabuddha, and he killed him
> - This is the supreme taking what is not given: stealing the property of the Three Jewels
> - This is the supreme sexual misconduct: if the mother were an arhat-woman
> - This is the supreme false speech: slander of the Tathāgata
> - This is the supreme divisive speech: disparaging the Noble Saṅgha
> - This is the supreme harsh speech: reviling the Noble Ones
> - This is the supreme idle chatter: distracting those who desire the Dharma
> - This is the supreme ill-will: dragging [others] into immediate-retribution [crimes]
> - This is the supreme covetousness: mind of taking the gains of those rightly going
> - This is the supreme wrong view: the entangled-view
>
> These, O Kāśyapa, are the ten unwholesome karma-paths, extremely serious.
>
> If, O Kāśyapa, a single being endowed with these ten unwholesome karma-paths—he should enter the Tathāgata's Dharma-teaching connected with cause and condition: 'There is no self here, no being, no life, no person who acts or experiences. Thus, uncreated, uncompounded, dream-nature, non-affliction-nature, naturally luminous nature of all dharmas he enters; originally pure, all dharmas he trusts-in, believes-in—I do not say that being goes to bad destinies.'"

---

## Part XI: The Trisamayarāja Antidote

In the Trisamayarāja too, antidote-practice is stated:¹¹

> "Closing the eyes, with mind focused on Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, one should recite the hundred-syllable [mantra] eight thousand times. With eyes closed, one sees Buddhas and Bodhisattvas; one becomes free from evil.
>
> Or, circumambulating a caitya, one should recite eight thousand times. With a caitya-image or true Dharma-book as focus, this is the very procedure."

---

## Part XII: The Cundā Dhāraṇī

Or one should recite the Cundā Dhāraṇī until one sees the signs of evil's exhaustion in dreams:¹²

> "Namely: from weeping, shelter, eating yogurt, milk, etc., one becomes free from evil. Or from vomiting, or from seeing sun and moon, from traveling through space, from defeating blazing fire, black buffalo, black man; from seeing the assembly of monks and nuns; from ascending a milk-tree, mountain, lion-throne, palace, or ship; and from hearing the Dharma—exhaustion of evil should be discerned."

---

## Part XIII: The Bhaiṣajyaguru Teaching

In the Bhaiṣajyaguruvaidūryaprabharājasūtra too:¹³

> "Those who hold the five training-precepts, those who hold the ten training-precepts, those who hold the bodhisattva-vow of four hundred training-precepts, those renunciants who, as monks, hold two hundred fifty training-precepts, those nuns who hold five hundred training-precepts—and those who, having undertaken training-restraint, have fallen from some training-precept—if those, afraid of bad-destiny fear, should hold the name of that Blessed One, the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyaguru Vaidūryaprabharāja, and should worship according to their capacity, no going to bad destinies is to be expected for them ever again."

---

## Part XIV: Restraint-Power

Antidote-practice has been stated in summary. Restraint-power (*pratyāpattibala*) is now stated.¹⁴

As stated in the Āryakṣitigarbhasūtra:

> "A bodhisattva mahāsattva, having refrained from taking life, gives fearlessness to all beings—non-terror, non-disturbance, non-hair-raising.
>
> By that root of virtue, by that karma-ripening, whatever karma-obstruction, affliction-obstruction, dharma-obstruction was done or caused to be done or approved, by body, speech, and mind, by the cause of taking life, mounted on the five-destiny wheel since beginningless time, tossed in the river of saṃsāra—all that he crushes by the wheel of refraining from taking life, up to making it ripen without remainder.
>
> He becomes dear to gods and humans of similar class, without affliction, long-lived..."

And likewise for the remaining ten wholesome karma-paths, each crushing its opposite unwholesome [karma].

---

## Part XV: Refuge-Power and the Pig-Story

Restraint-power has been stated. Refuge-power (*āśrayabala*) is to be stated.¹⁵ Here the pig-story is to be cited:

> *Those who go to the Buddha for refuge do not go to bad destinies.*
> *Having abandoned human bodies, they obtain divine bodies.*

Thus, taking Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha as objects, evil is exhausted.

---

## Part XVI: Bodhicitta as Supreme Purifier

In the Āryamaitreyavimokṣa, purification of evil by bodhicitta is stated:¹⁶

> "Like a kalpa-end fire, by burning all misconduct.
> Like the netherworld, by consuming all unwholesome dharmas...
>
> Just as, O son of good family, there is a gold-substance called Hāṭakaprabhāsa. One pala of it makes a thousand iron palas into gold. And that pala cannot be consumed by those thousand iron palas, cannot be made into iron.
>
> Just so, a single omniscience-mind-arising substance, held by the knowledge of dedicating roots of virtue, consuming all karma-and-affliction-obstruction-iron, makes all dharmas into the color of omniscience. And the omniscience-mind-arising substance cannot be afflicted or consumed by all karma-affliction-iron.
>
> Just as, O son of good family, a single lamp, in whatever house or cave it is brought, having been brought in, even darkness accumulated for a thousand years it dispels, and makes light.
>
> Just so, a single omniscience-mind-arising-lamp, in whatever being's thicket of ignorance-darkness it is brought—having been brought in, it dispels even karma-affliction-obstruction-darkness accumulated for ineffable hundred thousand kalpas, and makes the light of knowledge.
>
> Just as, O son of good family, for great nāga-kings crowned with the wish-fulfilling-jewel-king-diadem, there is no fear of attack from others—just so, for bodhisattvas crowned with the bodhicitta-great-compassion-wish-fulfilling-jewel-king-diadem, there is no fear of attack from bad destinies."

## Part XVII: The Upāli Teaching on Bodhicitta Purification

In the Āryopāliparipṛcchā too:¹⁷

> "Here, O Upāli, a bodhisattva set out in the Mahāyāna—if he should incur an offense in the morning period, and in the midday period should dwell not separated from the omniscience-mind—the bodhisattva's morality-aggregate is boundless.
>
> If he should incur an offense in the midday period, and in the evening period should be not separated from the omniscience-mind—the bodhisattva's morality-aggregate is boundless.
>
> Thus, the procedure is stated for each watch.
>
> Thus, O Upāli, the training has a remedy for bodhisattvas set out in the Mahāyāna.
>
> There, the bodhisattva should not generate excessive remorse, should not be excessively regretful.
>
> But if a Śrāvaka-vehicle person should incur offense again and again—the morality-aggregate of that Śrāvaka person is to be known as destroyed."

*Thus ends the Eighth Chapter, Purification of Evil, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*

# Chapter 9: Perfection of Patience (Kṣāntipāramitā)

---

*The ninth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on the Perfection of Patience. Contains the famous Sarvadharmasukhākrānta samādhi teaching—how the bodhisattva attains a concentration where all dharmas are pervaded by happiness, feeling pleasure even under torture.*

---

## Introduction

Thus, protecting the constantly arising, highly pleasant arising of immorality, and removing the bondage of karma-obstruction, one should strive for the purification of afflictions.¹

---

## Part I: The Kārikā 20 Teaching

Therein, at first:

> **One should be patient.** (Kārikā 20a)

For the impatient one's vigor regarding learning and the rest is obstructed, since he cannot bear unweariness.² And one without learning does not know the method of concentration, nor the method of affliction-purification.

Therefore, unwearied:

> **One should approach learning.** (Kārikā 20b)

Even through knowledge, concentration is difficult for one whose conduct is mixed.

> **Therefore one should resort to the forest.** (Kārikā 20c)

Even there, the mind of one not devoted to calming distraction is not concentrated.

> **One should apply oneself to concentration.** (Kārikā 20d)

And for the concentrated one, there is no fruit other than affliction-purification.

> **One should cultivate the foul and the rest.** (Kārikā 20e)

Thus, these are the heading-words (*uddeśapada*) for affliction-purification.

---

## Part II: The Three Types of Patience

Now the exposition is stated.³ Therein, patience is threefold, as stated in the Dharmasaṃgītisūtra:

1. **Patience of enduring suffering** (*duḥkhādhivāsanakṣānti*)
2. **Patience of contemplating dharmas** (*dharmanidhyānakṣānti*)
3. **Patience of bearing harm from others** (*parāpakāramarṣaṇakṣānti*)

Therein, the opponent of patience of enduring suffering is:
- From the arrival of the undesired: **suffering-wailing** (*duḥkhamīrutā*)
- From the obstruction of the desired: **clinging to pleasure** (*sukhābhiṣvaṅga*)

From these two arises sorrow, from that arise hatred and depression.

---

## Part III: Non-Attachment to Pleasure, Non-Aversion to Pain

Hence He states in the Candrapradīpasūtra:⁴

> "Non-attachment to pleasure. Non-aversion to pain."

In the Ratnameghasūtra too:

> "These internal sorrows, lamentations, sufferings, sorrows, and disturbances—these he endures, tolerates."

---

## Part IV: The Eight Worldly Dharmas

In the Āryaugradattaparipṛcchā too:⁵

> "Moreover, O householder, a householder bodhisattva should be free from attraction and repulsion, unstained by the eight worldly dharmas.
>
> By gain, by gain of wife and son, by gain of wealth, grain, and possessions—he should not be elated, should not be overjoyed.
>
> And in all misfortunes, by this one he should not be cast down. He should not be sorrowful.
>
> And thus he should contemplate: 'All conditioned things are magically created, characterized by the presence of disappearance. These—mother, father, son, wife, female servant, male servant, worker, employee, friend, relative, kin—are produced by karma-ripening. These are not mine, I am not theirs.'"

---

## Part V: Verses on Remedy and Sorrow

Moreover:⁶

> *If there is indeed a remedy, what use is sorrow?*
> *Even in remedy, the sorrowful one, faint with anger, is confused.*
>
> *Or, depressed, with killed vigor, he is seized by the opponent's misfortune.*
> *By that worry, his short life goes vainly, moment by moment.*
>
> *Therefore, by practice, one should abandon this useless, harm-bringing [affliction].*

And how is abandonment of sorrow practiced? By relinquishing the light, delicate mind.

As stated in the Ugradattaparipṛcchā:

> "Gone is the cotton-fluff-likeness of the mind."

---

## Part VI: The Three Minds from Gaṇḍavyūha

In the Āryagaṇḍavyūha too:⁷

> "A **difficult-to-conquer mind**, O girl, should be generated for the destruction of all afflictions.
>
> An **unconquered mind** for the breaking through of all attachments.
>
> An **imperturbable mind** for those gone into the ocean-whirlpools of corrupt intentions."

---

## Part VII: Nothing Difficult for Practice

And there is nothing called difficult for practice.⁸ For even among the most foolish—burden-carriers, fishermen, farmers—by practice of suffering, in even trivial matters, the mind marked with hardened calluses is not overcome by discouragement.

How much more so in work whose fruit is the attainment of the unsurpassed state of all saṃsāra-happiness, all bodhisattva-happiness!

Likewise, even ordinary people, toward those who harm them slightly—though themselves destroyed by their own misdeeds—fight even unto death, willing to experience even the intense pain of blows.

How much more should there be vigor for striking and bearing of suffering toward affliction-enemies:
- Who harm over long periods
- Who steal even a fragment of the wealth of suffering-obtained wholesomeness
- Who do not kill in hell but make one wander
- Who destroy the door and direction of escape
- Who cause greater harm even in favorable [conditions]
- Who are enemies though one has done them no harm
- Who are firmly-bound enemies for immeasurable kalpas

Especially for one who has bound on armor for conquering the three worlds, fighting for the release of the world-captive seized by the Māra-hunter!

---

## Part VIII: The Sarvadharmasukhākrānta Samādhi

And just as by practice, beings have perceptions of suffering and pleasure—so by practicing the arising of the perception of pleasure in all arising of suffering, the perception of pleasure alone arises.⁹

This is the outflow-fruit (*niṣyandaphala*): one attains the concentration called **Sarvadharmasukhākrānta** ("All-Dharmas-Pervaded-by-Happiness").

For it is stated in the Pitāputrasamāgama:¹⁰

> "There is, O Blessed One, a concentration called Sarvadharmasukhākrānta. By the attainment of that concentration, the bodhisattva experiences only pleasant feeling in all object-matters, not unpleasant-nor-pleasant.
>
> For him, even when hellish torture is being done, the perception of pleasure alone arises.
>
> Even when human torture is being done—when hands are being cut off, when feet, when ears, when nose are being cut off—the perception of pleasure alone arises.
>
> Even when being beaten with rods, with half-rods, with whips—the perception of pleasure alone proceeds.
>
> Even when thrown into prison...
>
> Even when being boiled in oil, or being pounded like sugarcane, or being pressed like reeds, or being burned with oil-lamps, or being burned with butter-lamps, or being burned with yogurt-lamps—the perception of pleasure alone arises.
>
> Even when being carried with a torch in the mouth, when being carried with a 'lion's happiness' [torture], when being wrapped with dry wicks...
>
> Even when being cut coin-by-coin, when being cooked like flour, when being trampled by elephants—the perception of pleasure alone proceeds.
>
> Even when eyes are being plucked out, even when being impaled alive, even when the whole body is being struck and the head is being split—the perception of pleasure alone proceeds, not the perception of suffering, not the perception of neither-suffering-nor-pleasure.
>
> Why is that? For thus, the bodhisattva mahāsattva practicing the practice for a long time had this aspiration:
>
> 'Those who would feed me—may they become attainers of the happiness of calm and peace.
>
> Those who would protect me, honor me, make me weighty, respect me, worship me—may all of them become attainers of the happiness of peace.
>
> Those who would revile me, strike me, injure me, cut me with weapons, even kill me—may all of them become attainers of the happiness of awakening, may they awaken to unsurpassed perfect awakening.'
>
> He, endowed with these mental applications, by this karma, endowed with these aspirations, cultivates, practices, develops, and multiplies the perception of pleasure following all beings. By the ripening of that karma, he attains the concentration called Sarvadharmasukhākrānta.
>
> At that time when the bodhisattva has attained the concentration called Sarvadharmasukhākrānta, at that time he becomes imperturbable, unassailable by all Māra-works."

---

## Part IX: The Supreme Practice

For this practice fulfills all relinquishment, accomplishes all difficult practices, makes firm all patience, brings all vigor to non-failure, and is the equipment of all meditation and wisdom limbs.¹¹

Therefore, one should always be joyful. As He states in the Candrapradīpasūtra:

> *With respect, with pleased mind, he should always be;*
> *he should always stand with gentle gaze.*

---

## Part X: The Qualities of Joy (Muditā)

As stated in the Akṣayamatisūtra:¹²

> "What is joy (*muditā*)? Whatever is joy, faith, gladness, non-depression, non-oppression, non-affliction of mind from recollecting the Dharma; the pulling away from all desire-delights, the establishment in all Dharma-delights; the gladness of mind, the exuberance of body, the delighting of understanding, the uplifting of mind; the delighting in the Tathāgata-body, the skill in seeking the adornments of marks and signs; the unweariness in hearing wholesome dharmas; the joy, faith, and gladness from the practice of taking the ultimate Dharma as refuge—the Dharma-uplifting of the joyful one.
>
> Constant unobstructed understanding toward beings; intense desire; non-abandonment of that Dharma-desire in seeking Buddha-dharmas; faith in excellent Buddha-dharmas; liberation; mind-arising pulled away from partial-vehicle [teachings]; mind-arising not contracted by stinginess; desire to give what is asked for; when giving and having given, the rejoicing in gifts purified in the three circles (*trimaṇḍalapariśuddha*).
>
> Constant faith in the morally disciplined; joyful grace toward the immorally-disciplined; relief surpassing all bad odors by purification of one's own morality; dedication to Tathāgata-morality; firm unbreakability; unobstructed mind toward harsh, ill-mannered speech-paths of others; patience-gentleness; humility.
>
> Respect, bowing, appreciation toward teachers; always smile-faced; gone from frowning; speaking first; non-deceitfulness; not striving for what should not be strived for; pure intention; non-hardness of mind; non-crookedness; seeing benefit everywhere; examining one's own stumbling; self-accusation in offenses; conforming to endearing dharmas.
>
> Teacher-love toward bodhisattvas; self-love toward dharmas; life-love toward Tathāgatas; parent-love toward teachers; child-love toward beings; Buddha-love toward ācāryas and preceptors; head-and-limbs-love toward practices; hand-and-feet-love toward the perfections; all-jewel-love toward Dharma-preachers; all-delight-and-play-love toward instructions.
>
> Health-love toward contentment; medicine-love toward Dharma-seeking; physician-love toward counselors and reminders."

Thus, whatever is non-depression of all faculties—this is called joy (*muditā*).

---

## Part XI: Hell-Bound Resolve

And here, this statement adorns trained bodhisattvas.¹³ As stated in the Āryamahāmegha:

> "They are those whose minds are constantly concentrated on the hell-destiny; they are those who love the hell-destiny; they are those who are merchants sailing to the hell-destiny. They are those who desire hell; they are those who are stingy-greedy for hell; they are those whose minds are attuned to hell-fire."

Patience of enduring suffering has been stated.

---

## Part XII: The Āryasāgaramatisūtra Teaching

In the Āryasāgaramatisūtra, all three types of patience are stated:¹⁴

> "Here, O Sāgaramati, the bodhisattva mahāsattva, regarding the jewel of the omniscience-mind-arising, being harassed, disturbed, shaken, threatened, struck by ignoble, immoral beings, by Māras, by Māra-realm deities, by Māra-possessed [beings], or by Māra-messengers—he is not broken from that arising of sincere-intention-mind.
>
> He is not broken due to the vigor-undertaking of great compassion for the liberation of all beings.
>
> He is not broken due to the exertion for the non-interruption of the Three Jewel lineage.
>
> He is not broken due to the wholesome application of bringing together all dharmas.
>
> He is not broken due to the accumulation of the merit-equipment for the accomplishment of marks and signs.
>
> He is not broken due to the eagerness drawn from the aspiration for buddha-field purification.
>
> He is not broken due to the relinquishment of body and life devoted to the non-grasping of all dharmas.
>
> He is not broken due to the non-reliance on self-happiness devoted to the ripening of all beings.
>
> He, being thus endowed with sincere intention, bears the looking-down of all beings.
>
> He bears the contempt of all beings.
>
> He bears the reviling, abuse, and harsh, ill-mannered speech-paths of all beings.
>
> He bears the oppression of all beings.
>
> He bears the burdens of all beings and raises them up.
>
> He is not wearied. He is not depressed. He does not shrink. He does not despair.
>
> He displays strength. He generates firmness. He undertakes vigor. He exerts exertion. He generates enthusiasm. He restrains the disturbed mind.
>
> **He, reviled, does not revile in return.**
>
> **He, struck, does not strike in return.**
>
> **He, provoked to anger, does not provoke in return.**
>
> **He, angered at, does not become angry in return.**"

---

## Part XIII: The Armor of Mind-Computation

And thus he binds on the armor of mind-computation:¹⁵

> "If all these beings in the ten directions who are being oppressed were all to pursue me from behind with swords, spears, javelins, and clubs—in whatever place on earth I stand, sit, walk, or lie and generate bodhicitta, or generosity-mind, up to wisdom-mind, or learning-root-of-virtue-mind—in that place on earth they would cut my body into pieces the size of a jujube leaf, would wound it, would destroy it.
>
> Even if all those beings were to revile me, abuse me, disdain me, disparage me, utter false words, harsh words, being established in harm-doing actions, cut my body into pieces the size of a jujube leaf, wound it, destroy it—thus I should not generate a hostile mind toward any being.
>
> Why is that? The beginningless beginning of saṃsāra is made immeasurable, wherein this person of mine—whether gone to hell, gone to animal birth, gone to the Yama-world, gone to the human world, as one who swallows meat of desire, as one who has not heard the Dharma, as one whose livelihood-pasture is corrupt, as one whose life is purposeless—has been cut a hundredfold, part by part, wounded, and tortured by various tortures.
>
> And from that as cause, neither my own purpose was accomplished nor others' purpose.
>
> If, however, all these beings were to cut, wound, scatter, and destroy me to the end of the future—still, omniscience is not to be abandoned by me. All beings are not to be abandoned. The wholesome Dharma-desire is not to be abandoned.
>
> Why is that? For all this bodily oppression, bodily transformation does not equal even a hundredth part of hellish suffering, does not approach even the semblance. I am able to bear even dwelling in hell. But the Buddha-dharmas are not to be abandoned by me, nor the great compassion with all beings as object."

---

## Part XIV: Abandoning Body-Clinging

> "Whatever is the cause from which ill-will arises—that dharma we will abandon. And what is that dharma? Namely: body-love, body-nest, body-reliance.¹⁶
>
> The body is relinquished; ill-will is relinquished.
>
> Thus, the bodhisattva, O Sāgaramati, stationed in Dharma-computation, bears the oppression of all beings."

---

## Part XV: The Six Perfections in Patience

> "What is the relinquishment of the body, the abandonment of the body, the non-regard for the body—this is his **Perfection of Giving**.¹⁷
>
> When the body is being cut, to pervade all beings with loving-kindness, and not to withdraw the feelings—this is his **Perfection of Morality**.
>
> When the body is being cut, to endure precisely for the liberation of those who are cutting his body, and not to be injured in mind, and to display patience-power—this is his **Perfection of Patience**.
>
> The vigor by which he does not abandon that omniscience-desire, takes hold of mind-power-commitment, and pursues saṃsāra itself, and undertakes the undertaking of roots of virtue alone—this is his **Perfection of Vigor**.
>
> When the body is being scattered, not to be confused regarding making that omniscience-mind-arising-jewel, to contemplate awakening alone, to examine the peaceful and calmed alone—this is his **Perfection of Meditation**.
>
> When the body is being cut, to examine the grass-wood-wall-like appearance of the body, to enter the dream-nature of the body, to contemplate the true impermanence, true suffering, true non-self, and true peace of the body—this is his **Perfection of Wisdom**."

---

## Part XVI: The Lazy Being

Moreover, thus he thinks:¹⁸

> "This being is lazy, devoid of white dharmas. He reviles me, abuses me. Come! We shall become those of undertaken vigor, unsatisfied, devoted to seeking roots of virtue.
>
> This very being should first be caused to sit on the seat of awakening by me. Afterwards, unsurpassed perfect awakening should be awakened to by me.
>
> For such beings as these—untamed, unguarded, uncalmed—armors should be bound on by us."

---

## Part XVII: Searching for Self and Other

> "Come! We will resort to the Dharmatā. Who reviles, or is reviled? Searching, he does not find that dharma—the one who reviles or is reviled.¹⁹
>
> He, with the view of non-apprehension of self and other removed, is patient."

---

## Part XVIII: The Prajñāpāramitā Teaching

In the Bhagavatī too:²⁰

> "Thus he generates the mind: 'I, by whom the dispute of all beings is to be removed—I myself am disputing! My gains are ill-gotten, that I am speaking back when spoken to. I, by whom a bridge for all beings is to be made—I speak even the word "you" to another, or give a harsh reply.
>
> This should not be spoken by me, being like a dumb fool. In quarrels and disputes, I should be like a deaf-mute sheep.
>
> Hearing harsh, ill-mannered, ill-spoken speech-paths being spoken by others, I should not injure my mind.
>
> It is not good or proper for me to generate fault-finding toward another. It is not proper for me even to hear of another's fault-finding.
>
> Why is that? My intention is not to be corrupted, for by me all beings are to be made happy with all happiness-provisions, and are to be brought to parinirvāṇa, having awakened to unsurpassed perfect awakening. There I should not be ill-willed.
>
> Nor should I be ill-willed toward others even for their own offenses. I will be going to delusion, to hostility!
>
> But this should be done by me: I should exert with firm exertion. Not even when life-obstruction is being made should agitation be made by me. I should not raise a frown on my face.'"

---

## Part XIX: Soothing the Angry

In the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa too:²¹

> "Those beings who are angry—he soothes them, makes them patient, makes them conformable, satisfies them with the Dharma."

---

*Thus ends the Ninth Chapter, the Perfection of Patience, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*

# Chapter 10: Perfection of Vigor (Vīryapāramitā)

---

*The tenth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on the Perfection of Vigor. Contains the benefits of learning, the Uttara jātaka, the famous 80 modes of entering learning from the Akṣayamatisūtra, and what treatises to study or avoid.*

---

## Part I: Vigor in Learning

Thus, established in patience, one should undertake vigor regarding learning.¹ Otherwise, learning itself becomes destruction for him.

As stated in the Candrapradīpasūtra:²

> *Though one comprehends many dharmas,*
> *if one does not guard morality, intoxicated by learning—*
> *he cannot be protected by much learning,*
> *the immorally-disciplined going to bad destinies.*

---

## Part II: Benefits of Learning

But the benefits of learning are stated in the Nārāyaṇaparipṛcchā:³

> "For thus, O sons of good family, for one with learning there is the attainment of wisdom. For one with wisdom there is the calming of afflictions. For one free from afflictions, Māra finds no opening."

---

## Part III: The Uttara Jātaka

And here, having done the jātaka of the great sage Uttara at length, He states:⁴

> "For those who desire the Dharma, O Vimalatejas, for bodhisattvas mahāsattvas with respect and confidence—even Buddhas, Blessed Ones established in other world-realms display their faces and cause them to hear the Dharma.
>
> For those who desire the Dharma, O Vimalatejas, for bodhisattvas mahāsattvas, **Dharma-treasures are deposited in mountain-caves and among trees**. Innumerable Dharma-gates are in books, come to hand.
>
> For those who desire the Dharma, O Vimalatejas, for bodhisattvas who have seen former Buddhas, **deities bring Buddha-inspiration**.
>
> For those whose lifespan is exhausted, **Buddhas, Blessed Ones and deities bring strength of life**. By Buddha-empowerment and deity-empowerment, when they desire it, they remain for a thousand years... up to a kalpa or remainder of a kalpa, as long as they desire.
>
> For those born with Dharma-respect, for bodhisattvas, **Buddhas, Blessed Ones remove even old age**. They remove illness. They bring memory. They bring movement, understanding, and eloquence. They remove views. They bring right view.
>
> By Dharma-respect, O Vimalatejas, for bodhisattvas mahāsattvas, **there is no fear of any harm**.
>
> Therefore, O Vimalatejas, a bodhisattva should be devoted to skill in the learning-accumulation."

## Part VI: What Should Be Studied

What should be heard?⁷ The Blessed One stated in the Jñānavaipulyasūtra:

> "Purposeful treatises should be studied. Purposeless ones should be avoided. Namely:
>
> - **Lokāyata treatises** (materialist philosophy)
> - **Daṇḍanīti treatises** (political treatises)
> - **Crow-[omen] treatises**
> - **Debate treatises** (sophistry)
> - **Child-play treatises**
> - **Jambhaka-lore treatises** (sorcery)
>
> And whatever other treatises are contrary to liberation—they all conduce to confusion—all those should be avoided by one set out in the bodhisattva-vehicle."

## Part VII: Resort to the Forest

Thus, one with learning should resort to the forest to purify the mind.⁸

But how is household life permitted in the Ugradattaparipṛcchā even for one endowed with intention? Due to inability even for one making effort.

But then, would there be no offense even regarding others' wives? No. For even in their inability, they are naturally corrupt; and household life is proclaimed to be with-fault (*prajñaptisāvadya*).

*Thus ends the Tenth Chapter, the Perfection of Vigor, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*

# Chapter Eleven: The Exposition of Dwelling in the Wilderness (*Araṇyasaṃvarṇana*)

## [The Call to the Wilderness]

Now, it is established that one who has heard the Dharma, having contemplated the faults of household life according to the instruction given in the *Ugradattaparipṛcchā*, should resort to the forest in order to purify his mind.[^1] And thus it is stated in the *Candrapradīpasūtra*:

> "Never indeed, indulging in desires, having generated craving for sons and wives, and having dwelt in a house, which is despicable, will he attain the supreme enlightenment.
> Those who abandon desires like a pit of fire, having generated craving for sons and wives, and, terrified, depart from the house—for them this supreme enlightenment is not difficult to obtain.
> No Buddha existed in the past, nor will one arise in the future, who, remaining [at home], attained this supreme, highest enlightenment.
> Having abandoned a kingdom like a lump of phlegm, let him dwell in the forests, desiring seclusion (*viveka*). Having abandoned the defilements, having crushed pride, they awaken to the stainless, unconditioned enlightenment." ... [*peyālaṃ*]
> "The best of men, the Jinas, are not served with food, drink, robes, flowers, perfumes, and unguents as they are when, having gone forth, they practice the Dharma.
> And he who, longing for enlightenment, is wearied of the evil constructions [of the world] for the sake of beings, should take seven steps toward the forest; he then becomes distinguished by merit."

If, however, due to affection for beings of similar disposition, or due to desire for an assembly, or due to desire for gain, etc., he should delay in entering seclusion, for that purpose it is stated here:

> "The wise do not quarrel with fools; having honored fools, they avoid them.
> The wise do not serve fools, knowing the natural continuity of fools (*bālāna svabhāvasaṃtatim*).
> However long one may serve a fool, they again become like enemies.
> The wise do not trust fools here, knowing the natural continuity of fools.
> Fools are broken by nature (*svabhāvabhinnā*); where is there a friend for ordinary people?
> Spoken to with righteous words, they manifest anger, hatred, and disbelief; pure ones (*vijñā*) knowing this meaning, do not trust fools.
> Fools match with fools, just as impurity with impurity;
> But the wise match with the wise, just as ghee with the cream of ghee."

And thus it is said again here:

> "Happy always are those men in the world for whom there is no beloved or unloved anywhere.
> And those who do not delight in caves experience the great happiness of the ascetic life (*śrāmaṇakaṃ susukhaṃ*).
> For whom there is no 'mine' anywhere, for whom there is no possession at all,
> They wander the world like a rhinoceros (*khaṅgasamā*), just as the wind wanders in the sky.[^2]
> Happy indeed would be those men in the world whose mind does not stick to the world.
> Their mind is always like the wind, and no attachment to beloved or unloved is found.
> For those to whom living with the suffering is unpleasant, and separation from the suffering is pleasant—
> Abandoning these two extremes, happy are those men who delight in the Dharma."

Again it is said here:

> "He is constantly yoked to few duties (*alpakṛtyayogī*), having avoided all extensive qualities and faults.
> He never disputes, being yoked to the yoke (*yuktayogī*); these qualities become his in forest-dwelling.
> He is always weary of the conditioned (*saṃskṛta*); he has no desire anywhere in the world.
> And there is no increase of inflows (*āsravas*) for him; living in the forest, these are his benefits.
> No dispute (*adhikaraṇa*) ever arises for him; always delighting in peace, walking in seclusion.
> Restrained in speech, mind, and body, many qualities become his in forest-dwelling.
> And liberation (*mokṣa*) becomes favorable for him; he quickly penetrates the peaceful resolve (*adhimukti*).
> Cultivating the resolve of wandering in the forest, all these qualities become his, the forest-dweller."

He says again:

> "Resort to forest thickets (*vanaṣaṇḍa*), always secluded, having abandoned going to villages and towns.
> Be without a second, like a rhinoceros, always; before long you will obtain the supreme samādhi."

In the *Ārya-Rāṣṭrapālasūtra* it is also said:

> "Having abandoned the home, a thicket of endless faults, always regardless of anxiety,
> They obtain delight in the wilderness, virtuous, with peaceful senses, gentle.
> No enjoyment of women or men is found anywhere for them;
> They dwell alone (*ekākī*), like a rhinoceros, with pure intentions, stainless.
> They are not thrilled by gains, nor do they cower at lack of gain in their own mind;
> Of few desires, satisfied with whatever comes, free from deceit and hypocrisy."

In the *Ugradattaparipṛcchā* it is also said: "Association with beings is not to be done by me, for I should not generate the roots of virtue of a single being," etc.

If, however, a learned one (*śrutavān*), having obtained this perfection of the moment (*kṣaṇasaṃpad*), attached to gain and the like, should not purify his mind, he alone in the world with its gods would be deceived. For it is said in the *Ārya-Ratnakūṭa*:

> "Just as, Kāśyapa, a certain man, being carried away by a great flood of water, should die of thirst for water, just so, Kāśyapa, here some ascetics and brahmins, having grasped and mastered many Dharmas, do not dispel the thirst for passion, do not dispel the thirst for hatred, do not dispel the thirst for delusion. Being carried away by the great flood of Dharma, they die of the thirst for defilements and go to a bad destiny, a downfall."

Therefore, one must necessarily resort to the forest. And he should resort to such places where the alms-round is not too far and not too near, where waters are clear, pure, stainless, involving little trouble, and pleasant to use. And he should resort to such places that are endowed with trees, flowers, fruits, and leaves, free from dangerous beasts, endowed with caves and mountain slopes, pleasant to wander in, peaceful, and solitary (*advitīya*).

Dependent on those places, whatever he has previously recited, that he recites three times in the night and three times in the day—not with too high a voice, not too low, not with excited senses, not with a scattered mind—living on faith, supporting the text, grasping the signs, driving away torpor.

If a king, or a royal minister, or others—brahmins, kṣatriyas, citizens, or country folk—should approach the forest-dwelling monk, he should welcome them with respect. And he should speak to him thus: "Sit, O Great King, on the seat prepared." If he sits, he [the monk] should also sit. If he does not sit, neither should sit. If his senses are agitated, he should be calmed. "Those gains are well-gained by you, O Great King, in whose territory virtuous, qualified, learned ascetics and brahmins dwell, unmolested by thieves, soldiers, and the like."

If he is steady, disciplined, with peaceful senses, and capable of Dharma teaching, then a varied Dharma teaching should be offered to him. If he does not like the varied one, a Dharma teaching conducive to agitation (*saṃvega*) should be offered. If he does not like the one conducive to agitation, the lofty greatnesses of the Tathāgata should be taught. Suitable actions should also be offered to brahmins, kṣatriyas, citizens, and country folk who approach. Being thus learned, he becomes capable of propitiating the mind of the hearers of Dharma. And those beings obtain joy, faith, and gladness in his presence.

In the *Ugradattaparipṛcchā* it is also said: "Furthermore, O householder, a bodhisattva who has gone forth and dwells in the forest should examine thus: 'For what purpose do I dwell in the forest? One does not become an ascetic merely by forest-dwelling. Even many untamed, undisciplined, unyoked, unexerting ones dwell here—namely, herds of deer, monkeys, birds, thieves, and caṇḍālas dwell here. And they are not endowed with the qualities of an ascetic. But rather, that purpose for which I dwell in the forest, that purpose must be fulfilled by me—namely, the purpose of asceticism (*śrāmaṇyārtha*).'" ... [*peyālaṃ*]

"Furthermore, O householder, a bodhisattva who has gone forth and dwells in the forest should examine thus: 'For what purpose have I come to the forest?' He should investigate thus: 'I have come to the forest terrified by fear. Terrified by fear of what? Terrified by the fear of society (*saṃgaṇikā*). Terrified by the fear of association, by the fear of lust, hatred, and delusion... by the fear of pride, intoxication, and hypocrisy... by the fear of greed, jealousy, and miserliness... by the fear of form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Terrified by the fear of I-making and mine-making (*ahaṃkāramamakāra*)... by the fear of restlessness and doubt... by the fear of the Māra of the aggregates (*skandhamāra*)... the Māra of defilements (*kleśamāra*)... the Māra of death... the Māra of the sons of gods. Terrified by the fear of the perversion of permanence in the impermanent... self in the non-self... purity in the impure... happiness in suffering. Terrified by the fear of mind, thought, and consciousness... by the fear of hindrances, obstructions, and outbursts... by the fear of the view of the transitory collection (*satkāyadṛṣṭi*)... by the fear of bad friends... by the fear of gain and honor... by the fear of untimely counsel... by the fear of 'seen' in the unseen, 'heard' in the unheard, 'thought' in the unthought, 'known' in the unknown... by the fear of the intoxication of asceticism in the non-ascetic... by the fear of mutual hatred... by the fear of the desire realm, form realm, and formless realm... by the fear of rebirth in all states of existence... by the fear of the realms of hell, animals, and the world of the fathers. Simply put, terrified by the fear of all unwholesome mental engagements. Terrified by these fears and terrors of such a kind, I have resorted to forest-dwelling.'"

... [*peyālaṃ*] "Furthermore, O householder, a bodhisattva standing in forest-dwelling, terrified or frightened, should train thus: 'Whatever fears arise, all of them arise from grasping at a self (*ātmagrāha*).' ... [*peyālaṃ*] 'If, while dwelling in the forest, I should not abandon self-grasping, self-adherence, self-possession, self-cause, self-thirst, self-perception, self-view-appropriation, self-view, self-basis, self-imagination, self-protection—my forest-dwelling would be meaningless. But rather, O householder, there is no forest-dwelling for one who perceives a self, no forest-dwelling for one who perceives an other.' ... [*peyālaṃ*] 'Forest-dwelling, O householder, is called the dwelling of non-arising in all dharmas, the dwelling of non-attachment in all dharmas.' ...

Just as, O householder, in the forest, grass, shrubs, herbs, and trees dwelling there do not fear, are not terrified, do not tremble, do not fall into terror, just so, O householder, a bodhisattva who has gone forth and dwells in the forest should produce a body of perception similar to grass, shrubs, herbs, trees, sticks, and walls—similar to a reflection of oneself. He should produce a mind equal to an illusion (*māyā*). Who fears here? Who trembles in this? By him, terrified or frightened, the body should be examined wisely thus: 'There is no self, or being, or life, or soul, or person, or human in this body. This is a false imagination (*abhūtaparikalpa*), namely, fear. That false imagination should not be imagined by me.' By him, knowing that just as grass, shrubs, herbs, and trees dwell in the forest without 'mine', without possession, just so, without 'mine', without possession, the forest is just all dharmas—knowing this, having attained it, he should dwell. For what reason? Forest-dwelling is the cutting of conflict (*raṇaccheda*), without 'mine', without possession."

... [*peyālaṃ*] "Furthermore, O householder, knowing 'Forest-dwelling is permitted by the Buddha,' one should dwell in the forest. For here the fulfillment of pure dharmas occurs. Having supported the roots of virtue, afterwards, having descended to villages, towns, markets, kingdoms, and capitals, I will teach the Dharma." ... [*peyālaṃ*] "If, however, O householder, the bodhisattva who has gone forth descends to a group for the sake of recitation or study, he should be respectful there, with deference to teachers and preceptors, to elder, middle, and new monks, acting rightfully, not lazy, acting himself, not annoying others. And he should not be one who values attendance. And he should examine thus: 'Even the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, worshipped by the world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmas, by the generation with its ascetics and brahmins, worthy of gifts from all beings—even he does not accept attendance from anyone; how much less we, untrained, wishing to train? Rather, we ourselves will become attendants for all beings. We ourselves will perform attendance and service for others, and we will not accept attendance and service from anyone. For what reason? For, O householder, the monk who is burdened with attendance loses the beneficial influence of virtuous qualities. And for those whom he supports, they think thus: "For the sake of attendance, he supports us."'"

He further says here: "If, O householder, a forest-dwelling Bodhisattva, desirous of hearing the Dharma, or wishing to see a teacher or preceptor, or inquiring after the sick, should come to a dwelling on the outskirts of a village, he should produce the thought of returning in the evening and of setting out [early]. If, however, his recitation or study is dependent on another, then, dwelling in the monastery, he should have a mind inclined to the forest. This itself is his forest-dwelling: the perception of all things as the forest and insatiety in the search for Dharma."

In the *Ārya-Ratnarāśisūtra* [Note: Source likely *Ratnarātri-sūtra* per text, but *Ratnarāśi* is a known text on this topic] it is also said: "If, while he is dwelling in that forest abode, as an ordinary person who has not attained the fruit, poisonous beasts should come, he should not produce fear or terror there. And he should produce this thought: 'Formerly, I have already renounced body and life; I have approached forest-dwelling. I should not be afraid here, not terrified; rather, having produced loving-kindness, I will avoid fault, I will remove fear. Even if, having done so, those poisonous beasts should deprive me of life and eat me, then I should produce this thought: "My gains are easily obtained, by which the essence will be taken from this essence-less body. But I am not able to satisfy these poisonous beasts with flesh. Having eaten my flesh, they will dwell experiencing pleasant contact."'"

... [*peyālaṃ*] "But if, while dwelling in that forest retreat, non-humans should approach—whether fair or foul in appearance—he should neither be drawn in nor repulsed by them. If deities who have seen Buddhas of the past should approach a forest-dwelling monk and ask him questions, then that forest-dweller should, according to his ability, his strength, and his realization of the Dharma, teach the Dharma to those deities. But if they ask very profound questions which that forest-dwelling monk is unable to answer, he should speak after manifesting a created form (*nirmāṇa*); he should not be disparaged for being unlearned. [He should think:] 'I will strive, I will exert myself in the Buddha’s teaching. There will come a time, an occasion, when, having heard and mastered the Dharma, I will be able to answer all questions. Meanwhile, may the inspiration for listening to the Dharma arise in you.'"

"Furthermore, dwelling in that forest retreat, one should take as an object of contemplation (*nimittaṃ grahītavyam*) the grasses, shrubs, herbs, and trees. How do these come to be? Just as these beings, which are ownerless (*asvāmikānām*), without a ‘mine’ (*amamānām*), without appropriation (*aparigrahāṇām*), thus motionless (*niśceṣṭānāṃ*) and inactive (*nirvyāpārāṇāṃ*), have production and dissolution, and yet there is no one who produces them or stops them, so too this body is like an apparition of grass, sticks, and a wall—ownerless, without a ‘mine’, without appropriation, motionless, and inactive. It arises due to the assemblage of causes and conditions, and ceases due to the deficiency of causes and conditions. Yet ultimately, no dharma whatsoever arises or ceases (*na punaratra kaściddharmaḥ paramārthata utpadyate vā nirudhyate*)."

Furthermore, it is said: "Dwelling in that forest retreat, one should produce this thought: 'Although I have come to the forest alone, without a companion, I have no companion who would accuse me of good or bad deeds. Yet, indeed, there are for me deities, Nāgas, Yakṣas, and Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, who know the intent of my mind. They are my witnesses (*sākṣiṇaḥ*). So I, dwelling here in the forest retreat, go under the power of an unwholesome mind ($akuśalacitta*). If I, having come so far, alone, without a second, unsupported, without 'mine', without possession, should think a thought of desire, or should think a thought of malice or violence, or should think another unwholesome thought, I would be no different from those beings delighting in association and society. And those deities, Nāgas, and Yakṣas would be deceived by me, and the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, would be unpropitiated."

*Thus ends the eleventh chapter, named "The Description of the Forest," in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Source Sūtras Cited
The *Śikṣāsamuccaya* is a compendium of sūtra quotations. This chapter cites the following texts:

1.  **Candrapradīpasūtra** (a.k.a. *Samādhirājasūtra*): Cites verses on the necessity of leaving the household life and the faults of desire.
2.  **Ārya-Rāṣṭrapālasūtra** (or *Rāṣṭrapālaparipṛcchā*): Cites verses on the virtues of the solitary bodhisattva ("like a rhinoceros").
3.  **Ugradattaparipṛcchā**: Extensive citations (prose) on the motivation for forest dwelling, fearlessness, and the analysis of fear as self-grasping (*ātmagrāha*).
4.  **Ārya-Ratnakūṭa** (likely the *Kāśyapaparivarta* section): Cites the analogy of dying of thirst while being carried away by a flood (dying of defilements while holding the Dharma).
5.  **Ārya-Ratnarātrisūtra** (some editions read *Ratnarāśi*): Cites passages on dealing with fear of wild beasts and non-humans.

### Key Sanskrit Terms
*   **Araṇya** (अरण्य): The forest, wilderness; etymologized as *a-raṇa* (without conflict/passion).
*   **Viveka** (विवेक): Seclusion, discrimination, solitude. The physical and mental separation from the "crowd" (*saṃgaṇikā*).
*   **Khaṅgasama** (खङ्गसम): "Like a rhinoceros." A famous simile for solitary wandering (reference to the *Rhinoceros Sutra*).
*   **Ātmagrāha** (आत्मग्राह): Grasping at a self. Identified in the *Ugradattaparipṛcchā* citation as the root of all fear.
*   **Asvāmika** (अस्वामिक): Ownerless. A descriptor for the body and phenomena, likened to grass and trees—functioning without a controller.
*   **Nirmāṇa** (निर्माण): Created form/emanation. The forest monk uses this to teach deities when his own form is insufficient.

### Critical Notes
[^1]: **Ugradattaparipṛcchā**: This sūtra is central to the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s treatment of the lay vs. monastic bodhisattva vocation. Here it establishes the premise: the household is full of faults (*gṛhadoṣa*).
[^2]: **Khaṅgasamā**: This echoes the famous refrain of the *Pratyekabuddha* vehicle ("wander alone like a rhinoceros"), but here it is integrated into the Bodhisattva path as a necessary phase of intensification.

# Chapter 12: Preparation of the Mind (Cittaparikarma)

---

**Summary**: Having established the practice of forest dwelling in Chapter 11, Śāntideva now describes the internal work required: the **Preparation of the Mind** (*Cittaparikarma*). This involves achieving one-pointed concentration (*samādhāna*), restraining the senses, and applying specific antidotes (*pratipakṣa*) to the defilements: foulness meditation for desire, loving-kindness for hatred, and dependent origination for delusion.

---

### 1. Sense Restraint and Concentration

Dwelling in the forest, one should devote oneself to concentration (*samādhāna*).
As stated in the *Bhagavatī (Prajñāpāramitā)*:¹

> "For the sake of those very beings, practicing the perfection of meditation (*dhyānapāramitā*), he becomes one of undistracted mind (*avikṣiptacitta*). Why?
>
> Even worldly meditation (*laukikī dhyānopapatti*) is hard to obtain for one of distracted mind—how much more the supreme perfect awakening! Therefore, I must be of undistracted mind."

The text continues:
> "He does not grasp at signs or features (*nimittānuvyañjanagrāhī*) when seeing forms with the eye. For if he dwelt with the eye-faculty unguarded, covetousness and dejection (*abhidhyā-daurmanasya*) would overflow the mind.
>
> Walking, standing, sitting, lying down, or speaking, he does not abandon the state of concentration (*samāhitāvasthā*).
>
> He is not restless of hand, foot, or face. Not scattered in speech. Not agitated, not inflated, not fickle, not lazy.
> In gain and loss (*lābhalābha*), pleasure and pain, praise and blame, fame and disrepute, he is even (*sama*), unchanged (*nirvikāra*), not elated or dejected (*anunnatānavanata*)."

### 2. Antidotes to Torpor and Agitation

If the mind sinks into **torpor** (*līna*), he should stimulate it with the cultivation of joy (*muditā*).
If the mind becomes **agitated** (*uddhata*), he should calm it with attention to impermanence (*anityatā*).

For the antidote to both, one should remember the verses from the *Ārya-Rāṣṭrapāla Sūtra*:²

> "After hundreds of millions of kalpas,
> Once in a while a Buddha arises, a Great Sage.
> That supreme moment (*kṣaṇa*) has been obtained today;
> If you desire liberation, abandon heedlessness (*pramāda*)."

And from the *Ārya-Lalitavistara Sūtra*:

> "The triple world is ablaze with the fire of death...
> Life passes quickly like lightning in the sky,
> Like water rushing down a mountain river.
>
> The pleasures of desire (*kāmaguṇā*) are like a dung-pit, like slight-points,
> Like honey on a razor's edge.
> Like dreams, like echoes, like mirages."

### 3. The Four Great Terrors (Death Meditation)

The *Rājāvavādaka Sūtra* provides a powerful contemplation on death through the metaphor of the **Four Mountains**:³

> "Just as four great solid mountains coming from the four directions would crush everything—grass, wood, and living beings—and escape by speed or force is impossible; so come four great terrors:
> 1.  **Old Age** crushing youth.
> 2.  **Disease** crushing health.
> 3.  **Death** crushing life.
> 4.  **Loss** (vipatti) crushing prosperity.
>
> Just as a lion seizes a helpless deer, so death seizes the living being.
>
> Alone, without companion, leaving this world, entering the great darkness...
> At that time, there is no other protection, no other refuge, except the Dharma."

### 4. Antidote to Desire: Foulness Meditation

For the defilement of **desire** (*rāga*), the antidote is **Foulness Meditation** (*aśubhā bhāvanā*).
As stated in the *Ārya-Ratnamegha Sūtra*:

> "He examines this body: 'In this body there are hair, nails, teeth, dirt, skin, flesh, bones, sinews, kidneys, heart, liver, lungs, intestines, feces, urine, pus, blood, bile, phlegm...'
>
> Examining thus, he thinks: 'Even a fool knowing these substances would not generate desire—how much less a wise one!'"

The *Prajñāpāramitā* adds the "Butcher's Eye" analogy:
> "Just as a butcher, having killed a cow and cut it into four pieces, examines it not as a 'cow' but as meat; so the Bodhisattva examines the body as elements (*dhātu*): earth, water, fire, wind."

And the "Charnel Ground" contemplations:
> "Seeing corpses in the charnel ground—swollen, blue, devoured by animals, skeletonized, scattered, pulverized to dust—he applies this to his own body:
> **'This body too is of that nature (*evaṃdharmā*), of that character, has not escaped that law.'**"

### 5. Antidote to Hatred: Loving-Kindness

For the defilement of **hatred** (*dveṣa*), the antidote is **Loving-Kindness** (*maitrī*).
As stated in the *Ārya-Akṣayamati Sūtra*, maitrī is of three kinds:
1.  **With beings as object** (*sattvārambaṇā*): For beginners.
2.  **With dharmas as object** (*dharmārambaṇā*): For those practicing the path.
3.  **With no object** (*anārambaṇā*): For those with the patience of non-arising.

The practice begins with dear ones, then neutral ones, then enemies, expanding to the ten directions.

### 6. Antidote to Delusion: Dependent Origination

For the defilement of **delusion** (*moha*), the antidote is the vision of **Dependent Origination** (*pratītyasamutpāda*).
This is detailed in the *Śālistamba Sūtra* (Rice Seedling Sutra):

> "Ignorance conditions dispositions (*saṃskāra*)... up to birth conditions old age and death.
> But Ignorance does not think 'I produce dispositions.'
> Nor do dispositions think 'We are produced by ignorance.'
>
> Just as the earth element supports the body's solidity without thinking 'I support'; just as the sprout arises from the seed without the seed thinking 'I produce'—so does the causal chain operate without an agent (*kāraka*)."

*(The chapter concludes with a detailed exposition of the twelve links of dependent origination through the metaphor of seed and sprout.)*

---

### Footnotes

1.  **Sense Restraint**: This passage parallels the Pali *Indriya-saṃvara* teachings, emphasizing that "grasping at signs" (*nimittaggāha*) leads to the influx of defilements.
2.  **Rarity of the Buddha**: The "Blind Turtle" analogy is implied here. The *kṣaṇa* (opportune moment) is hard to obtain.
3.  **Four Mountains**: A famous simile found also in the Pali *Pabbatūpama Sutta* (SN 3.25).

# Chapter 13: Foundations of Mindfulness (Smṛtyupasthāna)

---

**Summary**: Building on the mind-training of Chapter 12, Chapter 13 details the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness** (*Smṛtyupasthāna*). Unlike the Śrāvaka version which focuses on impermanence, the Mahāyāna version presented here emphasizes **emptiness (*śūnyatā*)** and the **non-obtaining (*anupalabdhi*)** of any self-nature in the body, feelings, mind, or dharmas.

---

### 1. Mindfulness of Body (Kāyasmṛtyupasthāna)

The Bodhisattva establishes mindfulness in the body.
As stated in the *Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra*:¹

> "This body is a collection of feet, toes, shins, thighs... skull and head. It is accumulated by karma and housing a hundred thousand defilements.
> It contains various substances: hair, nails, teeth, bones, pus, blood, mucus, brain.
>
> Examining it, he thinks: 'What here is the body?'
> He realizes: **'This body is like space (*ākāśasama*).'**
> He establishes mindfulness in the body as space. Because of this full knowledge (*parijñāna*), his mindfulness does not scatter."

The *Vīradattaparipṛcchā* provides sixty-one metaphors for the body, including:
*   Like an anthill (housing serpents).
*   Like an ungrateful friend (*mitradrohin*).
*   Like a foam ball (*phenapiṇḍa*).
*   Like an empty village (*śūnyagrāma*).
*   Like a potter's vessel (fragile).

> "Just as a fool rubs a piece of coal thinking 'I will make it white,' but it only goes to destruction; so one who bathes and perfumes this body cannot make it pure. It goes to destruction, not purity."

### 2. Mindfulness of Feelings (Vedanāsmṛtyupasthāna)

The Bodhisattva establishes mindfulness in feelings.
As stated in the *Ārya-Ratnacūḍa Sūtra*:

> "When feeling a **pleasant feeling**, he generates great compassion for beings of **desire-nature**, and abandons his own tendency to attachment (*rāgānuśaya*). He knows it as **impermanent**.
>
> When feeling a **painful feeling**, he generates great compassion for beings of **hatred-nature**, and abandons his own tendency to aversion (*pratighānuśaya*). He knows it as a **thorn** (*śalya*).
>
> When feeling a **neutral feeling**, he generates compassion for beings of **delusion-nature**, and abandons his own tendency to ignorance (*avidyānuśaya*). He knows it as **peace/non-self** (*śānta/anātma*)."

The *Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra* adds the non-dual observation:
> "Feeling is experienced. But by what?
> **The feeler (*vedaka*) is not found separate from the feeling.**"

### 3. Mindfulness of Mind (Cittasmṛtyupasthāna)

The Bodhisattva searches for the mind.
As stated in the *Ārya-Ratnakūṭa (Kāśyapaparivarta)*:²

> "He searches for the mind. Which mind? Past, future, or present?
> Past mind is destroyed. Future mind has not arrived. Present mind has no stability (*sthiti*).
>
> Mind, O Kāśyapa, is not found inside, not outside, not in between.
> **Mind has not been seen by any Buddhas, is not seen, will not be seen.**
> What is not seen—what process (*pracāra*) can it have?"

The text provides metaphors for the illusion-like nature of mind:
*   Like a river current (unstable).
*   Like a lamp flame (dependent on conditions).
*   Like lightning (momentary).
*   Like a thief (stealing wholesome roots).

Also, mind cannot see itself:
> "Just as a sword-edge cannot cut itself, just as a fingertip cannot touch itself; so mind cannot see mind."

### 4. Mindfulness of Dharmas (Dharmasmṛtyupasthāna)

The Bodhisattva establishes mindfulness in dharmas (phenomena).
As stated in the *Ārya-Ratnacūḍa Sūtra*:

> "Observing dharmas, he does not see any dharma...
> He enters the samādhi called 'No Obstruction.'
> He perceives: 'These dharmas are unafflicted (*niḥkleśa*). By awakening to these very defilements, there is awakening.'
> **The own-nature of defilements is the own-nature of awakening.**"

The *Lalitavistara* provides verses on the dependent origination of dharmas, using the examples of:
*   **Seed and Sprout**: Not the same, not different.
*   **Seal and Impression**: Appearance without transference (*saṃkrānti*).
*   **Eye and Form**: Consciousness arises from their meeting, but form represents no essence.
*   **Fire from Sticks**: Arises from conditions, goes nowhere when ceased.
*   **The Lute**: Sound arises from wood, strings, and effort; but sound is not in the wood or the strings.

### 5. The Emptiness of Names

The chapter concludes with the *Lokanāthavyākaraṇa*:

> "Dharmas are empty, nameless.
> In the name, no name-nature is found.
> Name is only a designation (*prajñapti*).
> All dharmas are nameless, yet illuminated by names."

---

### Footnotes

1.  **Body as Space**: The Mahāyāna move here is to dissolve the solidity of the body not just into "parts" (as in Early Buddhism) but into "space" (*ākāśa*), emphasizing emptiness.
2.  **Unfindability of Mind**: This is a classic *Kāśyapaparivarta* passage, central to Zen and Mahāmudrā discussions on looking for the mind and not finding it.

# Chapter 14: Purification of the Person (Ātmabhāva-pariśuddhi)

---

**Summary**: Having established the applications of mindfulness (*smṛtyupasthāna*) in the previous chapter, Śāntideva now moves to the ontological ground of purification: the realization of emptiness (*śūnyatā*). This chapter analyzes the person (*ātmabhāva*) through the six elements (*dhātu*), proving they are devoid of intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*). It employs the classic metaphors of the dream, the illusion, and the banana tree to deconstruct the "Self" (*ātman*), thereby purifying the bodhisattva's engagement with the world.

---

### 1. The Root of Purification: Emptiness

The applications of mindfulness have been stated. Thus, with a mind yoked to yoga, one should descend into the **emptiness of all dharmas** (*sarvadharmaśūnyatā*) for the sake of lifting the remaining world from the ocean of suffering, for the sake of the method of awakening (*abhisaṃbodhyupāya*), and for the sake of mastery over all dharmas in the three times as boundless as the sky space.¹

For in this way, the emptiness of the person (*pudgalaśūnyatā*) becomes established. And from that, due to the cutting of the root, the defilements (*kleśāḥ*) do not arise.

As stated in the *Ārya-Tathāgataguhya Sūtra*:²

> "Just as, Śāntamati, when the root of a tree is cut, all the branches, leaves, and foliage wither—just so, Śāntamati, from the pacification of the view of the existing body (*satkāyadṛṣṭi*), all defilements are pacified."

### 2. The Praise of Emptiness

The benefits (*anuśaṃsā*) of cultivating emptiness are endless. As the *Candrapradīpa Sūtra* says:³

> "He who trains in this does not tremble at the Sugatas' teaching;
> That hero never goes under the sway of women.
> He finds joy in the teaching of the Sugatas—
> He who knows the self-nature of dharmas as thoroughly pacified.
>
> Not long from now, he will become a Lord of Two-Legged Beings (Buddha);
> He will become a physician, a doctor, a giver of happiness.
> He extracts the dart of suffering entirely from those in pain—
> He who knows the self-nature of dharmas as thoroughly pacified.
>
> That Moon of Men is risen by the power of patience;
> Struck by clods and sticks, he does not get angry.
> Even if cut limb from limb, he is not agitated—
> He who knows the self-nature of dharmas as thoroughly pacified."

### 3. Analysis of the Elements (Dhātuvibhāga)

Now, how are all dharmas selfless (*nirātmāna*)? How is there non-contradiction of the karma-result connection (*karmaphalasaṃbandha*) despite absence of intrinsic nature (*niḥsvabhāvatā*)?⁴

As demonstrated in the *Pitṛputrasamāgama Sūtra*:

> "This person (*puruṣa*), Great King, consists of **six elements** (*ṣaḍdhātu*), **six spheres of contact** (*ṣaṭsparśāyatana*), and **eighteen mental approaches** (*aṣṭādaśamanaupavicāra*).
>
> What are the six elements?
> 1. Earth element (*pṛthivīdhātu*)
> 2. Water element (*abdhātu*)
> 3. Fire element (*tejodhātu*)
> 4. Wind element (*vāyudhātu*)
> 5. Space element (*ākāśadhātu*)
> 6. Consciousness element (*vijñānadhātu*)

#### A. The Earth Element (Solidity)
> What is the internal earth element? Whatever in this body internally is hard, solid, organically appropriated (*upātta*). Hair, nails, teeth, etc.
>
> When the internal earth element arises, it does not come from anywhere. When it ceases, it does not go to any accumulation (*saṃnicaya*).
>
> Consider the embryo. From the union of sperm and blood (*śukra-śoṇita*), the *kalala* arises. But in that union, neither the man exists (inherently) nor the woman. The intention (*saṃkalpa*) arises from the unreal. That intention does not exist by own-nature. Just so, the solidity arises from conditions, but has no arrival or departure.
>
> **Ultimately, the earth element is empty of earth-element-ness.** It is not perceived except by convention (*vyavahāra*).

#### B. The Water Element (Cohesion)
> What is the internal water element? Tears, sweat, saliva, mucus, oil, lymph, marrow, fat, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, urine.
>
> When one sees a beloved, tears flow. From grief or from religious emotion (*dharmasaṃvega*), tears flow. But this water element does not come from anywhere. When the body dries up at death, it does not go anywhere.
>
> Even the great oceans at the end of the kalpa dry up completely. **Ultimately, the water element is empty of water-element-ness.**

#### C. The Fire Element (Maturation)
> What is the internal fire element? That by which the body is heated, digested, by which what is eaten and drunk gets cooked.
>
> It arises, yet comes from nowhere. It ceases, yet goes nowhere. It exists having not existed (*abhūtvā bhāva*), and having existed, it disappears. Why? Because it is devoid of own-nature (*svabhāvarahita*).

#### D. The Wind Element (Motion)
> What is the internal wind element? Upward winds, downward winds, winds in the limbs, breath.
>
> Just as a great storm arises, knocks down trees, and vanishes without a trace—so too the internal wind.

#### E. The Space Element (Opening)
> What is the internal space element? The eye-holes, the mouth, the throat, the gaps where food is swallowed.
>
> Just like a man digging a well in dry ground: where does the space come from? Nowhere. Where does it go when filled? Nowhere. **Space is empty of space-element-ness.** It is motionless, immutable (*avikāra*).

#### F. The Consciousness Element (Cognition)
> What is the consciousness element? The recognition (*prativijñapti*) of the object dependent on the eye, etc.
>
> This consciousness element does not rely on the sense-organ, does not come from the object, does not stay in between. It is not inside, not outside.
>
> **Ultimately, the consciousness element is empty of consciousness-element-ness.**

### 4. The Dream Metaphor (Svapnopama)

The senses are like an illusion (*māyopamā*). The objects are like a dream (*svapnopamā*).

> "Consider, Great King, a man sleeping. In a dream, he enjoys himself with a beautiful, charming woman (*janapadakalyāṇī*). Waking up, he remembers her.
>
> Does that woman exist in the dream? No.
> Is the man wise if he clings to her? No.
>
> Just so, the childish ordinary person (*bālapṛthagjana*) sees forms with the eye and clings to them. Clinging, he generates passion. Passionate, he creates karma.
>
> But that karma is exhausted from the start. It doesn't reside in the East, West, North, or South.
>
> At the moment of death, the final consciousness (*carama-vijñāna*) ceases. Dependent on that, the first consciousness (*prathama-vijñāna*) of the next life arises.
>
> **No dharma goes from this world to the next.** Yet death and rebirth appear to happen.
>
> The final consciousness is empty of final consciousness.
> The first consciousness is empty of first consciousness.
> **There is no agent (*kartā*) here, no experiencer (*bhoktā*), except by name-convention (*nāmasaṃketa*).**"

### 5. The Truth of Convention and Ultimate

Conventional truth (*saṃvṛti*) was taught by the Buddha for the sake of the world's benefit. Ultimate truth (*paramārtha*) is inexpressible, unknowable, unmanifest.

> "The Lion of Men taught convention
> Speaking of the six destinies (*gati*),
> Hell-beings, ghosts, gods, and men,
> But ultimately, no being (*sattva*) is found."

### 6. The Emptiness of the Agent

The *Druma-Kinnararāja-Paripṛcchā Sūtra* uses the chariot metaphor:⁵

> "Look at the assembly of chariot-parts (*śakaṭāṅga*),
> And look at the action of the chariot.
> Just as fire does not turn back from the tree moved by wind,
> So too the agents of karma.
>
> **The doer (*kartā*) is not found in the ten directions.**"

### 7. Purification Through Realization

Therefore, the Perfection of Wisdom (*Prajñāpāramitā*) is to be cultivated by one desiring purification of the mind.

As the *Saṃgīti Sūtra* says:

> "The proponent of emptiness (*śūnyatāvādin*) is not shaken by worldly dharmas.
> He is not delighted by gain, not depressed by loss.
> He doesn't stick to pleasure, doesn't clash with pain.
>
> He who is not shaken by worldly dharmas—he knows emptiness."

---

## Scholarly Notes

1.  **Traikālya**: The three times (past, present, future). Mastery here implies the *dhāraṇī*-power of the bodhisattva.
2.  **Cutting the Root**: A crucial metaphor. While *śamatha* (calm) suppresses defilements like placing a rock on grass, *vipaśyanā* (insight into emptiness) cuts the root so they cannot grow back.
3.  **Candrapradīpa Sūtra**: Also known as the *Samādhirāja Sūtra*. It emphasizes the soteriological power of the emptiness view—it's not just philosophy, it's the mechanism of liberation.
4.  **Karmaphalasaṃbandha**: The connection between action and result. The Madhyamaka challenge is always: "If things are empty, how does karma work?" The answer lies in the dream metaphor—karma functions *precisely because* it is empty (dependent arising), not static.
5.  **Chariot Metaphor**: The classic reductionist analysis. A chariot is neither its wheels, nor axle, nor the collection, nor separate from them. It is a designation (*prajñapti*). So too the Person.

# Chapter 15: Purification of Goods and Merit (Bhogapuṇyaśuddhi)

---

**Summary**: Following the purification of the person (*ātmabhāva*), Śāntideva turns to the purification of the bodhisattva's resources (*bhoga*) and merit (*puṇya*). The core principle for goods is **Right Livelihood** (*samyagājīva*)—avoiding hypocrisy (*kuhanā*) and wrong means. The core principle for merit is **Sky-Like Purity** (*gaganasama-viśuddhi*)—practicing the six perfections without the three concepts (giver, gift, receiver), thereby making merit boundless and unpolluted.

---

### 1. Purification of Goods Through Right Livelihood

Immediately after the purification of the self, the purification of goods (*bhogaśuddhi*) is written here separately due to the absence of accumulation (*saṃcayābhāva*).¹

One should know the purification of goods through the purification of **Right Livelihood** (*samyagājīva*).

As stated in the *Ārya-Ugraparipṛcchā*:

> "Here, householder, the lay bodhisattva seeks enjoyments by the Dharma, not by adharma. By fair means (*samena*), not by unfair means (*viṣameṇa*). It becomes Right Livelihood, not wrong livelihood."

### 2. Avoiding Hypocrisy (Kuhanā)

The *Ārya-Ratnamegha Sūtra* details the avoidance of hypocrisy in seeking alms:²

> "A bodhisattva, seeing a donor or patron (*dānapati*), does not construct a posture (*īryāpatha*).
>
> **How does he not construct a posture?**
> He does not lift and place his feet slowly, slowly, sluggishly. Not looking only a yoke's length ahead (*yugamātraprekṣikayā*). But looking confidently, looking naturally (*anābhogaprekṣikayā*). Thus he does not perform **bodily hypocrisy** (*kāyakuhanā*).
>
> **How does he not perform vocal hypocrisy?**
> For the sake of gain, for the cause of gain, he does not become soft-spoken, gentle-spoken, sweet-spoken. He does not utter flattering words.
>
> **How does he not form mental hypocrisy?**
> Even when offered gain by a donor, he displays fewness of desires (*alpecchatā*). He does not generate longing in the mind.
>
> *'This is internal burning, son of good family: when there is fewness of desire in speech, but desire for gain in the mind.'*
>
> Thus the bodhisattva is free from hypocrisy and lapana (hinting/chatter)."

### 3. Avoiding Hinting and Hinting-Actions

> "He does not make a sign (*nimitta*) upon seeing a donor: 'I am distressed by lack of robes, I am distressed by lack of a bowl.'
>
> He does not ask or pray for anything. He does not utter words like: 'Such and such donor gave me such and such object... because he thought I was virtuous, learned, of few desires.'
>
> Thus he is free from **hinting-gain** (*nimittalābha*)."

### 4. Purification of Merit (Puṇyaśodhanam)³

> "From the activity born of the womb of Emptiness and Compassion, there is purification of merit." (Kārikā 21)

As stated in the *Ārya-Gaganagañja Sūtra*: The purity of merit is like the sky (*gagana*).

> "He gives that gift purified of 'I-making' (*ahaṃkāra*).
> Purified of 'Mine-making' (*mamakāra*).
> Purified of view, sign, and diversity.
> Purified of expecting a result (*vipākapratikāṅkṣaṇā*).
>
> **He gives a gift equal to the sky (*gaganasama*).**
>
> Just as the sky is boundless (*aparyanta*), so he gives with a boundless mind.
> Just as the sky is vast and unobstructed, so he gives a gift dedicated to awakening (*bodhipariṇāmita*).
> Just as the sky is formless (*arūpin*), so he gives not relying on any form.
>
> Just as a magically created man (*nirmita*) gives to a magically created man—without discrimination, without effort (*anābhoga*), free from mind-thought-consciousness—so the bodhisattva gives that gift purified by the self-nature of illusion (*māyālakṣaṇa*).
>
> Such a bodhisattva becomes a **Sky-Like Donor** (*gaganasamadāna*)."

### 5. The Sky-Like Perfections

The *Gaganagañja Sūtra* applies this sky-metaphor to all perfections:

*   **Sky-Like Morality (*Śīla*)**: Pure, stainless, calm, not elevated (*anunnata*), not dependent. "Whatever morality is sky-like, that is the bodhisattva's supreme morality."
*   **Sky-Like Patience (*Kṣānti*)**: Unobstructed like the sky. Equal toward all beings.
    *   *Metaphor*: "Just as if there were a great Sāla forest. Someone comes and cuts down a Sāla tree. The remaining trees do not think: 'He is cut, we are uncut.' They have no attachment or aversion. Just so is the sky-like patience."
*   **Sky-Like Vigor (*Vīrya*)**: Knowledge of the body as a reflection (*pratibhāsa*), speech as inexpressible, mind as untroubled.
*   **Sky-Like Meditation (*Dhyāna*)**: The meditation endowed with the best of all forms (*sarvākāravaropeta*) but accomplished through the aspect of emptiness.
    *   Calm by nature, but not calm (inactive) in karma and defilements.
    *   Indifferent to all dharmas, but attentive to Buddha-dharmas.
    *   Cool through peace, but blazing in ripening beings.

### 6. The Realm of the Bodhisattva

As stated in the *Vimalakīrtinirdeśa*:

> "The realm of turning the Wheel of the True Dharma, and the realm of demonstrating Great Parinirvāṇa, and the realm of not abandoning the bodhisattva practice—this too is the bodhisattva's realm (*gocara*)."

---

## Scholarly Notes

1.  **Saṃcayābhāva**: "Absence of accumulation." Unlike ordinary wealth which is hoarded (*saṃcita*), the bodhisattva's goods are pure because they are constantly flowing out to beings. They are "accumulated" only in the sense of merit, not possession.
2.  **Five Wrong Livelihoods**: The text alludes to the classic list: *kuhanā* (hypocrisy/posturing), *lapanā* (hinting/chatter), *naimittika* (fortune-telling/sign-reading), *niṣpeṣikā* (bullying/extortion), and *lābhena lābhaniścikīrṣā* (seeking gain with gain/interest).
3.  **Puṇyaśodhanam**: Purification of merit prevents it from becoming a cause for saṃsāric happiness (which is exhausted) and transforms it into a cause for awakening (which is inexhaustible). The mechanism is *pariṇāmanā* (dedication) sealed with *śūnyatā* (emptiness).

# Chapter 16: The Practice of Good Conduct (Bhadracaryāvidhi)

---

**Summary**: This chapter outlines the method (*vidhi*) for increasing (*vṛddhi*) the three purities established in the previous chapters: the Person (*ātmabhāva*), Goods (*bhoga*), and Merit (*puṇya*). It culminates in the liturgical practice of the *Bhadracaryāpraṇidhāna* (The Vows of Good Conduct). Key elements include the increase of strength (*bala*) and non-laziness (*anālasya*), the ten great vows from the *Daśabhūmaka Sūtra*, and the supreme dedication (*pariṇāmanā*) modeled on Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra.

---

### 1. The Necessity of Increase (Vṛddhi)

Now, the increase of all three (Person, Goods, Merit) must be stated. Why?

> "There are many recipients. If this [offering] is small, what is the use?
> And it does not generate supreme satisfaction. Therefore, this must be increased." (Kārikā 22)

**"Supreme satisfaction"** (*atitṛpti*) refers to Buddhahood. That is not generated for beings by mere purity common to Śrāvakas; hence the need for increase.

### 2. Increasing the Person (Ātmabhāvavṛddhi)

What is the increase of the person? **The increase of Strength (*bala*) and Non-Laziness (*anālasya*).**

#### A. Increase of Strength
The *Ratnamegha Sūtra* defines this strength:
> "There is no being in the assembly of beings who can crush the bodhisattva's strength with their own strength."

How is it increased? As stated in the *Tathāgataguhya Sūtra* (Vajrapāṇi's teaching to Ajātaśatru), a bodhisattva attains such strength by being endowed with ten dharmas:

1.  **Giving body and life**, but not abandoning the True Dharma.
2.  **Bowing to all beings**, but not increasing pride (*māna*).
3.  **Enduring weak beings**, not generating hostility (*pratigha*).
4.  **Giving best food to the hungry**, and giving fearlessness to the frightened.
5.  **Zealous for healing the sick.**
6.  **Satisfying the poor** with enjoyments.
7.  **Plastering the Tathāgata-shrine** with lime/ointment.
8.  **Speaking words of joy** (*ānandavacana*) to beings.
9.  **Sharing enjoyments** with the poor and suffering.
10. **Carrying the burden** of the weary and exhausted.

#### B. Increase of Non-Laziness (Vigor)
What is the increase of non-laziness? **The increase of Vigor (*vīrya*).**

As stated in the *Sāgaramati Sūtra*:
> "Sāgaramati, a bodhisattva should be initiated in vigor (*ārabdhavīrya*), always with firm valor... For the lazy (*kusīda*), enlightenment is very far away. The lazy one has no giving... no wisdom, no benefit for others."

As the *Candrapradīpa Sūtra* says:
> "Like a lotus in the water, he grows gradually."

### 3. Increasing Goods (Bhogavṛddhi)

> "From giving born of the womb of Emptiness and Compassion, there is the increase of goods." (Kārikā 23)

As stated in the *Vajracchedikā*:
> "The bodhisattva who gives a gift while not established [in signs] (*apratiṣṭhita*)—it is not easy to measure his merit-heap."

And in the *Great Prajñāpāramitā*:
> "A bodhisattva desiring to perform immeasurable giving... should train in the perfection of wisdom."

### 4. Increasing Merit (Puṇyavṛddhi)

The increase of merit is the root of all increases.

> "Having made Effort (*vyavasāya*) and Intention (*āśaya*) firm at the very beginning,
> And placing Compassion (*karuṇā*) in front,
> One should strive for the increase of the auspicious." (Kārikā 24)

#### A. Making Effort Firm (Vyavasāya)
How does one firm up effort? Like Ārya Sudhana approaching Maitreya.
*   Thinking of the body's dedication to the limit of the past (*pūrvāntakoṭi*).
*   Correcting the mind (*cittamanasikāra*).
*   Disregarding the fatigue of useless worldly actions.
*   Raising the power of Right Resolve (*samyaksaṃkalpa*) for all bodhisattva practices.

#### B. Making Intention Firm (Āśaya)
The *Dharmasaṃgīti* says:
> "Intention (*āśaya*), Lord, is the root of Buddha-dharmas... Just as fire burns when fuel exists, so Buddha-dharmas blaze when intention exists."

What is this intention? The *Akṣayamati Sūtra* defines it as artificial-less (*akṛtrima*), pure, straight, honesty (*ṛjuka*), steadfast.

#### C. Placing Compassion in Front (Karuṇā)
The *Dharmasaṃgīti* states:
> "Lord, a bodhisattva need not train in too many dharmas. Only **one dharma** is to be guarded and penetrated. Which one? **Great Compassion** (*mahākaruṇā*).
>
> Just as when the wheel-turning monarch's chakra-jewel goes, the whole army follows—so where Great Compassion goes, all Buddha-dharmas follow."

### 5. The Practice of Good Conduct (Bhadracaryāvidhi)

With effort, intention, and compassion thus firmed up, one begins the increase of merit.

> "The Practice of Good Conduct (*Bhadracaryāvidhi*) is to be done:
> Worshipping (*vandanā*) and so forth, always with respect."

#### The Three Heaps (Triskandha)
The *Ugradattaparipṛcchā* prescribes the **Triskandhaka** practice (Three Heaps) three times in the day and three times in the night:
1.  **Confession of Sin** (*pāpadeśanā*).
2.  **Rejoicing in Merit** (*puṇyānumodanā*).
3.  **Requesting the Buddhas** (*buddhādhyeṣaṇā*).

(*Note: Worship/Vandanā is included in Confession.*)

#### The Offering
One offers all unowned flowers, fruits, and jewels in the universe (as stated in *Ratnamegha* and *Trisamayarāja*). Even mental offerings of the jewels in the ten directions are valid.

#### The Ten Great Vows (Daśa Mahāpraṇidhāna)
From the *Daśabhūmaka Sūtra*, the ten essential vows:
1.  **Puja:** To worship all Buddhas without remainder.
2.  **Dharma:** To uphold the Dharma-eye of all Tathāgatas.
3.  **Arising:** To accompany the Buddhas in all world-systems (birth to nirvāṇa).
4.  **Practice:** To engender the vast bodhisattva conduct (*caryā*).
5.  **Ripening:** To ripen all beings (*sattvaparipācana*) in all destinies.
6.  **World-Entry:** To enter all world-systems (*lokadhātu*) with knowledge.
7.  **Purification:** To purify all Buddha-fields (*kṣetrapariśodhana*).
8.  **Mahāyāna:** To enter the Great Vehicle with all bodhisattvas of one intention.
9.  **Unfailing Action:** To practice the bodhisattva deeds which are never fruitless (*amogha*).
10. **Enlightenment:** To manifest supreme awakening (*abhisambodhi*) in all worlds.

#### The Supreme Dedication (Pariṇāmanā)
Finally, one dedicates the merit using the verses of the *Bhadracaryā* (The King of Prayers):

> "Just as the hero **Mañjuśrī** knows,
> And **Samantabhadra** too—
> Following in their training,
> I dedicate all this merit.
>
> Whatever dedication is praised as supreme
> By the Victors of the three times—
> With that dedication,
> I dedicate all this merit to the Good Conduct (*Bhadracaryā*)."

---

## Scholarly Notes

1.  **Atitṛpti**: "Super-satisfaction" or "Surpassing Satisfaction." This distinguishes the Mahāyāna goal (benefiting all beings limitlessly) from the Hīnayāna goal (mere personal liberation).
2.  **Sāgaramati Sūtra**: Emphasizes *vīrya* (vigor) as the prerequisite for enlightenment. Without energy, the path is impossible.
3.  **Triskandhaka**: The "Three Heap" ritual is the liturgical core of Mahāyāna practice. It remains the standard "Seven Limb Prayer" practice in Tibetan Buddhism today.
4.  **Bhadracaryā**: Often called the *Praṇidhānarāja* (King of Prayers). It is the final section of the *Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra* (Avataṃsaka). Śāntideva here explicitly instructs utilizing these verses for the ritual.

# Chapter 17: The Benefits of Worship (Vandanānuśaṃsā)

---

**Summary**: This chapter details the immense karmic fruits (*anuśaṃsā*) of the worship practices described in the previous chapter. Drawing primarily from the *Avalokana Sūtra* and *Ratnarāśi Sūtra*, it catalogs the physical and spiritual benefits of circumambulating stūpas, offering flowers, lamps, and flags. It concludes with the superior merit of **Rejoicing** (*anumodanā*) and **Great Compassion**, which surpass even material offerings in their capacity to generate Buddhahood.

---

### 1. The Power of a Single Moment (Ekakṣaṇa)

The method of worship has been stated. From where is it known that this causes the increase of merit? From the *Ārya-Avalokana Sūtra*:

> "He avoids the eight inopportune births (*akṣaṇa*)¹ taught by me,
> And he obtains the one opportune moment (*kṣaṇa*), a beautiful arising of a Buddha.
>
> Endowed with color, possessed of form, adorned with marks,
> Endowed with strength and power, he never falls into laziness.
> Wealthy, possessed of great riches, unassailable, and meritorious—
> Having pleased the Lamp of the World, he honors him again and again."

### 2. Benefits of Stūpa Circumambulation (Pradakṣiṇā)

> "It is not possible to exhaust the praise, even in kotis of kalpas,
> Of the man who would perform circumambulation of the Lord of the World's stūpa.
>
> He never becomes blind or crippled, for kotis of kalpas—
> He who, having generated the Awakening Mind (*bodhicitta*), worships the Teacher's stūpa.
>
> Firm in vigor, firm in stamina, heroic, firm in valor,
> He goes quickly to skillfulness (*kauśalya*), having done circumambulation of the stūpa."

### 3. Benefits of Offerings

#### A. Flowers (Puṣpa)
> "He who takes a flower-handful (*puṣpamuṣṭi*) and with an uplifted mind (*udagracitta*)
> Scatters it over the Lord of the World out of faith—
> He becomes meritorious in the human world,
> And having stood in protection, honors the Victor."

#### B. Garlands (Mālā)
> "Having given a garland to the stūpa, he is born among the Thirty-Three Gods.
> He obtains a divine lotus-pond...
> He becomes a Wheel-Turning King (*Cakravartin*), and Śakra, and Brahmā."

#### C. Incense (Dhūpa)
> "He who would offer incense—even smaller than a mustard seed—to the Lord's shrines:
> He wanders in all directions, free from disease, firm in mind, heedful.
> He dispels sorrow... he becomes dear to the multitude."

#### D. Robes (Cīvara) and Flags (Dhvaja/Patākā)
> "He becomes possessor of beautiful robes... golden colored...
> Having given a flag, he defeats the dust of passion... he obtains abundant wealth."

#### E. Lamps (Dīpa)
> "It is not possible to measure the life and glory
> Of one who offers a single lamp to the Buddha-stūpa.
> He attains the Eye... He obtains illumination (*ālokaprāpta*)."

#### F. Music (Vādya) and Parasols (Chatra)
> "Having offered a parasol... he is never burned by the fire of defilements.
> Having offered music... he obtains a melodious voice (*manojñaghoṣa*)."

### 4. Cleaning the Stūpa (Stūpa-saṃśodhana)

> "He who removes withered flowers from the shrine...
> He abandons attachment, hatred, and delusion.
> He abandons all diseases... He attains the unequaled state of a Buddha."

### 5. The Superior Merit of the Mind

The *Ratnarāśi Sūtra* contrasts material offerings with the mind of omniscience:

> "If all beings in the three worlds were to build stūpas as high as Mount Sumeru...
> And if a bodhisattva who **never lacks the Mind of Omniscience** (*avirahitasarvajñatācitta*) were to offer just a single flower...
> This produces greater merit than that previous heap of merit."

And regarding lamps:
> "If a bodhisattva who has left the household life makes a wick soaked in oil and offers it...
> The previous offering of lamps [by worldly kings] does not approach even a hundredth part of this wick."

### 6. The Benefits of Rejoicing (Anumodanā)

The *Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* establishes the supremacy of **Rejoicing**:

> "If a son or daughter of good family rejoices in the arising of the thought (*cittotpāda*) of bodhisattvas... how much merit does he produce?
>
> The Lord said: 'It might be possible, Kauśika, to measure the weight of the Trisāhasra world system... but not to measure the merit of rejoicing.'
>
> Those who do not know this merit of rejoicing act on the side of Māra.
> Those who rejoice will quickly please the Tathāgatas. They will not see unpleasant forms... they will be born in heaven."

### 7. The Final Weighing

The text concludes by weighing the merit of the four dhyānas (meditations) against the merit of rejoicing:

> "Subhūti, if all beings were to establish themselves in supreme awakening and practice the four dhyānas for eons...
>
> And if a bodhisattva... were to rejoice in the aggregate of morality, concentration, and wisdom (*śīla-samādhi-prajñā-skandha*) of all Buddhas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Śrāvakas... and dedicate it to supreme awakening...
>
> The previous heap of merit does not approach even a hundredth part of this merit of rejoicing."

Thus, the greatest increase of merit comes from:
1.  **Bodhicitta** (The Mind of Awakening).
2.  **Great Compassion** (*Mahākaruṇā*).
3.  **Rejoicing** (*Anumodanā*) in the good of others.

---

## Scholarly Notes

1.  **Eight Akṣaṇas**: The eight inopportune births where one cannot hear the Dharma: hells, hungry ghosts, animals, long-lived gods, border regions, imperfect faculties, wrong views, and a world without a Buddha.
2.  **Stūpa**: The architectural embodiment of the Buddha's Dharmakāya. Worship here is not idolatry but a technique for *buddhānusmṛti* (recollection of the Buddha).
3.  **Pradakṣiṇā**: Circumambulation (keeping the object to one's right). A sign of supreme respect common in Indian culture.
4.  **Avalokana Sūtra**: A key text for lay devotion, detailing the karmic results of simple ritual acts.
5.  **Rejoicing**: This is the "economizer" of the Mahāyāna. By rejoicing in the merit of Buddhas, one cognitively participates in their infinite good, thereby generating immense merit without physical resources.

# Chapter 18: Recollection of the Three Jewels (Ratnatrayānusmṛti)

---

**Summary**: Having detailed the benefits of worship in Chapter 17, Śāntideva now turns to the mental cultivation that sustains it: the **Recollection (*Anusmṛti*) of the Three Jewels** (*Ratnatraya*). This chapter is a treasure trove of Mahāyāna devotional literature, citing the *Rāṣṭrapāla Paripṛcchā* for the Buddha, the *Dharmasaṃgīti* for the Dharma, and the *Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa* for the Sangha. It concludes with a spectacular section from the *Ratnolkādhāraṇī* describing the infinite "Light Rays" (*raśmi*) of the Tathāgata that enact buddha-work across the cosmos.

---

### 1. The Necessity of Constant Practice

The increase of merit through the Practice of Good Conduct (*Bhadracaryā*) has been stated. Here is another cause for it: **the constant practice (*sadābhyāsa*) of faith (*śraddhā*) and the other faculties.**

As stated in the *Ārya-Tathāgataguhya Sūtra*:¹

> "Four things, Great King, lead to distinction (*viśeṣagāmitā*) and non-degeneration (*aparihāṇi*) for those set out in the Mahāyāna. What four?
> 1.  **Faith (*śraddhā*)**: By which one approaches the Noble Ones (*āryas*) and does not do what should not be done.
> 2.  **Respect (*gaurava*)**: By which one listens to the Well-Spoken (*subhāṣita*) and hears the Dharma with an attentive ear.
> 3.  **Humility (*nirmānatā*)**: By which one bows to and reveres the Noble Ones.
> 4.  **Vigor (*vīrya*)**: By which one gains physical and mental lightness (*laghutā*) and accomplishes all tasks."

### 2. The Five Faculties (Indriya)

One must constantly practice faith and the rest. Or, following the *Ārya-Akṣayamati Sūtra*, the **Five Faculties**:

1.  **Faculty of Faith (*Śraddhendriya*)**: Belief in the world-transcending Right View, karma and result, and the Bodhisattva conduct. One believes in the emptiness of the person and phenomena but does not fall into nihilism (*uccheda*).
2.  **Faculty of Vigor (*Vīryendriya*)**: Gathering those dharmas one believes in.
3.  **Faculty of Mindfulness (*Smṛtīndriya*)**: Not losing the dharmas one has gathered.
4.  **Faculty of Concentration (*Samādhīndriya*)**: Making the mind one-pointed (*ekāgra*) on the retained dharmas.
5.  **Faculty of Wisdom (*Prajñendriya*)**: Investigating and penetrating those concentrated dharmas.

### 3. Recollection of the Buddha (Buddhānusmṛti)

How should one recollect the Buddha?
As praised in the *Rāṣṭrapāla Sūtra*:²

> "I worship You, of golden hue and excellent marks,
> Face like a stainless moon, knowledge unequaled;
> None in the three worlds is like You, dustless One.
>
> Your hair is soft, beautiful, glossy, and pure;
> Your uṣṇīṣa is like the King of Mountains.
> None can look down upon Your crown;
> The ūrṇā (hair-tuft) shines between Your brows, O Sage.
>
> Eyes like blue lotuses, pure and white as conch or moon;
> With compassion You gaze upon this world—
> I worship You, O Jina, of stainless vision.
>
> Your tongue is broad, thin, copper-colored;
> With it, You cover Your own face.
> Speaking Dharma, You discipline the world—
> I worship You of sweet, glossy speech.
>
> This world is known by You as like an illusion (*māyopama*),
> Like a stage-play, a dream, a mirage.
> No self (*ātman*), no being, no life-course exists;
> Dharmas are like a mirage, like a flash of lightning.
>
> Seeing the world always confused by passion and a hundred ills,
> Like a peerless Physician, You wander,
> Liberating hundreds of beings, O Sugata."

### 4. Recollection of the Dharma (Dharmānusmṛti)

As stated in the *Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra*:

> "Here, the Bodhisattva reflects:
> 'The Dharma is **Same** (*sama*); it functions equally toward beings.
> The Dharma is **Impartial** (*apakṣapatita*); it does not function with a view to pleasure.
> The Dharma is **Timeless** (*akālika*); not waiting for time.
> The Dharma is **Without High or Low**; it functions neither for the lofty nor the lowly.
> The Dharma is **Beyond Purity or Impurity** (*utkarṣāpakarṣāpagata*).
> The Dharma is **Solidly Established** (*sadādhiṣṭhita*); it functions night and day.
> The Dharma is **Unlimited** (*aprameya*); like space, it does not decrease or increase.
> The Dharma is **Not Protected**; it protects beings.
> The Dharma is **Not a Refuge Seeker**; it is the refuge of the whole world.'"³

### 5. Recollection of the Sangha (Saṅghānusmṛti)

The Sangha consists of those who speak Dharma, think Dharma, and are a Field of Dharma.
As stated in the *Arya-Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa*, the qualities of the Bodhisattvas should be cultivated:⁴

> "In a single moment (*ekakṣaṇa*), these confident Bodhisattvas
> Display the forms, sounds, and voices of all beings.
>
> They appear old, sick, or dead;
> For the ripening of beings, they play with illusion-dharmas.
>
> They show the burning of the kalpa, earth consumed by fire;
> To those with the notion of permanence, they show impermanence.
>
> Invited by hundreds of thousands of beings in one kingdom,
> They eat in everyone's house,
> And bend them all toward Awakening (*bodhi*).
>
> Whatever arts, sciences, or crafts exist,
> They have reached perfection in all, bringing happiness to beings.
>
> They become suns, moons, Indras, Brahmas,
> Lords of Creatures, Water, Fire, Earth, and Wind.
>
> During kalpas of disease, they become supreme medicines;
> During kalpas of famine, they become food and drink;
> During kalpas of weapons, they become meditators on Maitrī (Love)."

### 6. The Light Rays of the Tathāgata (Ratnolkādhāraṇī)

Just as the *Ratnolkādhāraṇī* describes the Bodhisattva qualities, so should they be cultivated:⁵

> "Releasing the ray called **Garland-Array** (*Mālyavyūhā*):
> It rains down garlands, ornaments, and canopies.
> With these scattered everywhere, Great Beings worship the Jina.
>
> Releasing the ray called **Peace-Maker** (*Śāntikarī*):
> Beings urged by its light become free of passion, hate, and delusion.
> Turning away from bad friends and crowds,
> They praise the peace of the forest (*araṇya*).
>
> Releasing the ray called **Produce-Promoter** (*Sasyasaṃpādanī*):
> It rains down rain, producing crops and herbs,
> Satisfying those tormented by hunger and thirst.
>
> Releasing the ray called **Insight-Lamp** (*Prajñāpradīpa*):
> It reveals dharmas as empty, selfless, unborn, like illusions.
> Beings understand that phenomena are like dreams or mirages.
>
> Releasing the ray called **Fear-Remover** (*Abhayaṃdadā*):
> Beings touched by it are freed from bonds, beatings, and threats.
> They refrain from taking life and become protectors of the fearful.
>
> Releasing the ray called **Wealth-Shower** (*Arthanidarśanī*):
> Lists of treasures appear to the poor.
> Obtaining inexhaustible wealth, they practice giving.
>
> Releasing the ray called **Sense-Purifier** (*Indriyaviśodhanī*):
> The blind see forms; the deaf hear sounds;
> The noseless smell fragrances; the mute speak sweetly;
> The crippled gain perfect bodies; the mad regain their minds."

### 7. Conclusion

Just as the wind, unlearned in the perfections, brings happiness to the world,
Just as the magician displays illusions without attachment,
Just as the sun shines on the blind without discrimination—
So do the Tathāgatas and their children (Bodhisattvas) perform their work.

**This is the Recollection of the Three Jewels.**

<div id='chapter-19'></div>

# Chapter 19: The Increase of Merit (Puṇyavṛddhi)

---

**Summary**: This is the final chapter of the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*. Having established the protections and purifications, Śāntideva concludes with the **Increase of Merit** (*Puṇyavṛddhi*). The central theme is the Bodhisattva's transformation of everyday actions into merit through **dedication (*pariṇāmanā*)** and the cultivation of **emptiness/compassion**. It culminates in a spectacular praise of Mañjuśrī, the embodiment of wisdom and the patron of this text.

---

### 1. Dedication in Daily Life

Another cause for the increase of merit is the **welfare of beings in all states** (*sarvāvasthāsu sattvārthaḥ*).
As stated in the *Ārya-Ratnamegha Sūtra*:¹

> "When offering a flower or incense to a Tathāgata shrine, he dedicates it: 'May all beings be free from the stench of immorality (*dauḥśīlya*) and attain the fragrance of the Tathāgata's morality.'
>
> When sweeping or cleaning, he dedicates it: 'May I sweep away the ungraceful conduct of all beings.'
>
> When raising a parasol, he dedicates it: 'May I remove the burning heat of defilements (*kleśa-paridāha*) for all beings.'
>
> When entering a monastery: 'May I lead all beings into the city of Nirvāṇa.'
> When leaving: 'May I liberate all beings from the prison of Saṃsāra.'
>
> When opening a door: 'May I open the door to the Sugata ways with transcendental knowledge.'
> When closing a door: 'May I close the doors to all evil destinies (*apāya*).'
>
> When sitting down: 'May all beings sit on the seat of awakening (*bodhimaṇḍa*).'
> When lying on the right side: 'May I lead all beings to Parinirvāṇa.'
> When rising: 'May I raise all beings from the ambush of defilments.'
>
> When washing hands: 'May I wash away the residual traces (*vāsanā*) of defilements for all beings.'
> When washing feet: 'May I wash away the dust of defilements.'
> When cleaning teeth: 'May I remove the stains of defilements.'"

### 2. Fearlessness in the Wilderness

The Bodhisattva's merit increases through **fearlessness** (*atrāsa*).
As stated in the *Ārya-Prajñāpāramitā*:²

> "Śāriputra, a Bodhisattva in a wilderness full of wild beasts (*vyālakāntāra*) should not be afraid. Why? Because he has renounced everything for the sake of beings.
>
> He should think: 'If beasts eat me, may it be a gift to them. My perfection of giving (*dānapāramitā*) will be fulfilled.'
>
> If in a wilderness of thieves (*corakāntāra*): 'If they take my belongings, let it be a gift. If they take my life, let me generate no anger. Thus my perfections of giving, morality, and patience will be fulfilled.'
>
> If in a wilderness of waterless wastes (*pānīyakāntāra*): 'I must train to cut off the thirst of all beings.'
>
> If in a wilderness of famine (*bubhukṣākāntāra*): He should armor himself (*saṃnāha*): 'I will purify my Buddha-field so that such famines never exist there. I will ensure all beings are satisfied with food and drink thought of by mind alone, like the trāyastriṃśa gods.'"

### 3. The Gift of Dharma (Dharmadāna)

The **Gift of Dharma** (*dharmadāna*) without material desire (*nirāmiṣa*) is a supreme cause of merit.
As stated in the *Ārya-Adhyāśayasaṃcodana Sūtra*, there are twenty benefits, including:
*   Mindfulness (*smṛti*)
*   Intelligence (*mati*)
*   Protection by non-humans (*amanuṣya*)
*   Meeting the Buddhas

The *Ārya-Prajñāpāramitā* declares: teaching even a single verse of the Perfection of Wisdom to another Bodhisattva generates more merit than teaching the entire Śrāvaka-Dharma to the entire universe. Why? Because the Bodhisattva preserves the lineage of the Buddhas.³

**How to Give Dharma**:
As stated in the *Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (Lotus Sutra)*:
> "Entering the abode, wearing clean robes,
> Sitting on a comfortable seat,
> With a mind free from envy or fatigue,
> He should teach the Dharma day and night.
> He seeks nothing for himself—
> Only thinking: 'May I and these beings become Buddhas.'"

### 4. The Root of Merit: Bodhicitta

In summary, the **Bodhicitta** is the root of the increase of merit.
As stated in the *Ārya-Ratnakaraṇḍaka Sūtra*:

> "Just as aromatic trees grow from the four elements, Mañjuśrī, so the Bodhisattva's roots of good, gathered by Bodhicitta and dedicated to omniscience, grow continuously."

### 5. Final Arguments on Self and Other

Śāntideva concludes with verses (likely from the *Bodhicaryāvatāra* tradition) deconstructing the Self to justify altruism:⁴

> "If fear and suffering are disliked by me and others equally,
> What is so special about 'Me' that I protect myself and not the other?
>
> 'My future suffering does not harm me now'—this is a false assumption.
> The 'I' who acts is dead; the 'I' who suffers is another birth.
>
> The foot's pain is not the hand's pain, yet the hand protects the foot.
> Why? Because they are part of one organism.
> Thus should one view the world as an organism (*ātmabhāva*).
>
> 'Self' is a fiction. It is a heap of elements/aggregates.
> Suffering exists, but there is no 'Sufferer.'
> Therefore, suppress suffering simply because it is suffering.
> Do not ask 'Whose?'"

### 6. Homage to Mañjuśrī

The text concludes with a final dedication and praise of Mañjuśrī, the Prince of Wisdom:

> "I bow to Mañjuśrī, the condensed form of the world's welfare.
> He who walks in the ocean of Buddha-fields in all directions.
> He who destroys the armies of Māra.
> He who is the cool lake for those scorched by suffering.
> To Mañjughoṣa, the Teacher, I bow."

**This is the nineteenth chapter, The Increase of Merit.**

**Here ends the Śikṣāsamuccaya, the Compendium of Training.**

### Footnotes

1.  **Ritualization of Daily Life**: These verses from the *Ratnamegha* serve as the prototype for "Gāthās" used in Zen and Vinaya practice, transforming mundane acts (opening doors, washing) into Mahāyāna rituals.
2.  **Wilderness Training**: The *kāntāra* (wilderness) is the testing ground for the perfections. The Bodhisattva uses danger to radicalize his generosity.
3.  **Superiority of Mahāyāna Dharma**: The mathematical comparison (1 verse of Prajñā vs. whole Śrāvaka canon) emphasizes that the *cause* (Bodhisattva training) is more valuable than the *result* (Arhatship) because it leads to the total liberation of all beings.
4.  **Parātmasamatā**: These philosophical verses mirror *Bodhicaryāvatāra* Chapter 8, arguing that since "Self" is a delusion using temporal continuity (child -> adult), we can equally use spatial continuity (self -> other) to justify compassion.
