## Introduction: The Twelve Mindfulnesses

Avoidance of fruitless activity has been stated [in the previous chapters].¹ How is this accomplished? He says:

> **This is accomplished by constant mindfulness.** (Kārikā 8a)

Twelve kinds of mindfulness (*smṛti*) conduce to the avoidance of fruitless activity:

1. **Mindfulness of respecting the ripening consequence of not transgressing the Tathāgata's command**
2. **Mindfulness that the entire body is established in immovable nature**
3. **Mindfulness of steady, deliberate action**—when there is benefit for beings, whatever limb is not useful should be firmly kept still, with one's intention dependent on stronger mindfulness and equanimous aspiration
4. **Mindfulness of the beginner when confused by fear, celebration, etc.**—not letting the limbs move freely
5. **Mindfulness of examining the four postures** (walking, standing, sitting, lying)
6. **Mindfulness of observing excellence in the three postures** for the sake of protecting them intermittently
7. **Mindfulness of restraining**—when speaking, not making excessive non-pleasing gestures of hands, feet, head, and face due to over-excitement, agitation, partiality, etc.
8. **Mindfulness of speaking in a volume** such that the hearer understands the meaning conveyed, not excessively—except when there would be a fault from another's suspicion
9. **Mindfulness of purifying one's own and others' minds** when in crowded gatherings of untrained people
10. **Mindfulness of the mind-elephant**—always bound to the post of calm (*śamatha*)
11. **Mindfulness of repeatedly examining the state of the mind**
12. **Mindfulness of intent**—in large gatherings, even abandoning other tasks, protecting mindfulness as stated

---

## Part I: Mindfulness Arises from Earnestness

Thus, by these mindfulnesses, avoidance of fruitless activity is accomplished. And:²

> *Mindfulness arises from intense earnestness.* (Kārikā 8b)

Therein, earnestness (*ādara*) means complete orientation toward tasks in every way—the antidote to contempt. And this:

> **Earnestness arises from ardor, knowing the greatness of calm.** (Kārikā 8cd)

---

## Part II: What Is Calm?

What is this "calm" (*śama*)? That which is called *śamatha* in the Āryākṣayamatisūtra:³

> "What is the inexhaustible calm? It is:
> - Peace of mind, thorough peace, non-distraction
> - Sense-restraint
> - Non-agitation
> - Non-inflation
> - Non-fickleness
> - Non-restlessness
> - Gentleness
> - Guardedness
> - Workability
> - Thoroughbred-ness
> - One-pointedness
> - Delight in solitude
> - Avoidance of gatherings
> - Joy in seclusion
> - Seclusion of body
> - Non-confusion of mind
> - Mental orientation toward forest
> - Few desires
> - Guarding the postures
> - Knowing the right time
> - Knowing the occasion
> - Knowing the measure
> - Knowing liberation
> - Being easy to support
> - Being easy to maintain..."

---

## Part III: The Greatness of Calm

What is the greatness of this calm? It is **the power to generate knowledge of things as they are**. For:⁴

> *"One who is concentrated knows things as they are,"* said the Sage.

As stated in the Dharmasaṃgīti:

> "For one of concentrated mind, there is seeing of things as they are. For the bodhisattva who sees things as they are, great compassion operates toward beings. And thus for him: 'This samādhi-gate and seeing all dharmas as they are—I must accomplish this for all beings.'
>
> He, urged by that great compassion, fulfilling the training in higher morality, higher mind, and higher wisdom, awakens to the four right complete awakenings. 'Therefore I must be well-established in morality, unshaking, unbent.'
>
> This is the greatness of calm."

Understanding this greatness—the transcendence of one's own and others' endless suffering in bad destinies, the attainment of the summit of endless worldly and supramundane happiness—ardor should be cultivated by desiring it, like one inside a burning house desiring cool water. By that, intense earnestness arises toward the trainings. By that, mindfulness stands firm. With mindfulness firm, one avoids the fruitless. And one who avoids—for that one, harms do not arise.

**Therefore, by one wishing to protect one's person, having traced out the root of mindfulness, one should always be of established mindfulness.**

---

## Part IV: Mindfulness for Householders and Renounciants

Hence in the Ugraparipṛcchā, regarding the householder bodhisattva, it is stated:⁵

> "By him, having refrained from the heedlessness-ground of liquor, wine, and intoxicants, being un-intoxicated, un-mad, non-fickle, non-restless, non-confused, non-chattering, non-inflated, non-agitated, of established mindfulness and clear comprehension..."

And here, regarding the renunciant bodhisattva:

> "Non-distraction in mindfulness and clear comprehension..."

---

## Part V: What Is Right Mindfulness?

Mindfulness is described in the Āryaratnacūḍasūtra:⁶

> "That mindfulness by which the arising of all afflictions does not occur;
> That mindfulness by which one does not give access to all works of Māra;
> That mindfulness by which one does not fall into a wrong path or a bad road;
> That mindfulness which, acting as gatekeeper, does not give opportunity to all unwholesome mental and mental-associated dharmas—
> This is called right mindfulness."

---

## Part VI: What Is Clear Comprehension?

Clear comprehension (*saṃprajanya*) is stated in the Prajñāpāramitā:⁷

> "Walking, he knows 'I am walking.' Standing, he knows 'I am standing.' Lying down, he knows 'I am lying down.' Sitting, he knows 'I am sitting.' However his body is disposed, so he knows it...
>
> He is one who acts with clear comprehension in going forward, in going back, in looking, in bending, in stretching, in wearing the saṃghāṭī, the pātra, the cīvara, in eating, drinking, chewing, in dispelling drowsiness and fatigue, in coming, going, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and being silent, in withdrawal."

---

## Part VII: Morality and Concentration

For morality conduces to concentration. As stated in the Candrapradīpasūtra:⁸

> *Quickly he obtains concentration, unobstructed—these are the benefits of purified morality.*

From this it is understood: Whatever applications are causes of concentration—all of them are included within morality. Therefore, by one desiring concentration, one should have morality of mindfulness and clear comprehension.

Likewise, by one desiring morality too, effort should be made in concentration, due to the statement in that very sūtra. Regarding the benefits of dhyāna:

> *He is not of bad conduct, well-established in [good] conduct.*
> *The yogī ranges in proper pasture, avoiding improper pasture.*
>
> *Dwelling without burning, guarded, with senses restrained.*

---

## Part VIII: Mind-Training Is the Bodhisattva Training

By these two—morality and concentration—mutually increasing each other, the completion of the work of the mind is accomplished. And this is the extent of the bodhisattva training: **mind-training** (*cittaparikarma*), since this is the root of all benefit for beings.⁹

For it is stated in the Āryaratnamegha:

> "All dharmas are preceded by mind. When mind is fully known, all dharmas are fully known."

And:

> *"The world is led by mind; mind does not see mind.*
> *By mind karma is accumulated, whether wholesome or unwholesome.*
>
> *Mind whirls like a firebrand. Mind rushes like a horse.*
> *Mind burns like a forest fire. Mind sweeps away like a great flood."*

Examining thus, he dwells with mindfulness well-established in the mind, not going under the power of mind. Rather, the mind comes under his power. When mind is under his power, all dharmas come under his power.

---

## Part IX: The City of the Mind

In the Āryagaṇḍavyūhasūtra too it is described:¹⁰

> "All bodhisattva conduct is based on one's own mind; all ripening and disciplining of beings is based on one's own mind..."
>
> "One's own mind must be supported with all roots of virtue. One's own mind must be moistened with Dharma-clouds. One's own mind must be purified from obstructive dharmas. One's own mind must be strengthened with vigor..."

And here, when the noble Sudhana became confused upon seeing Māyādevī, this instruction was given by the city-goddess Ratnanetrikā regarding seeing her:

> "By you, O son of good family, there should be skill in guarding the city of the mind—by not dwelling with delight in the objects of all saṃsāra.
>
> By you there should be engagement in adorning the city of the mind—by relying on the ten Tathāgata powers.
>
> By you there should be engagement in purifying the city of the mind—by removing envy, stinginess, and guile.
>
> By you there should be engagement in increasing the city of the mind—by increasing the great vigor of the accumulations of omniscience.
>
> By you there should be engagement in making the city of the mind impregnable—by not being crushed by all affliction-Māras, bodily evil-friend Māras, and Māra-armies.
>
> By you there should be engagement in expanding the city of the mind—by suffusing all worlds with great loving-kindness.
>
> By you there should be engagement in covering the city of the mind—by accomplishing the great Dharma-umbrella as antidote to all unwholesome dharmas.
>
> By you there should be engagement in opening the city of the mind—by causing all worlds to obtain internal and external things...
>
> Thus, O son of good family, for the bodhisattva engaged in purifying the city of the mind, all roots of virtue can be attained. Why is that? For when the bodhisattva's city of the mind is thus purified, all obstructions do not stand before him—neither the obstruction to seeing Buddhas, nor the obstruction to hearing Dharma..."

---

## Part X: Mind Does Not Waver from Calm

Therefore it is established:

> **Mind-training is indeed the bodhisattva training.** (Kārikā 9ab)

And this is for one of non-fickle mind:

> **And mind does not waver from calm, due to cessation of external activities.** (Kārikā 9cd)

For one dependent on non-clear-comprehension, whose mindfulness is stolen—the mind wavers, being drawn elsewhere from the intended object. But when by mindfulness and clear comprehension external activities are ceased, then, due to being under their control, bound to a single object, [the mind] remains as long as wished. And from that, the detailed benefits as before.

---

## Part XI: Attracting Beings

Even now, one becomes capable of accomplishing beings' aims, due to generating faith:¹¹

> *Non-fickle everywhere, by slow, affectionate, gentle speech,*
> *one attracts worthy people and becomes one whose [instruction] is accepted.* (Kārikā 10)

And this is the bodhisattva's very task—the attraction of beings. As illuminated by the bodhisattva Āryapriyadarśana in the Āryādharmasaṃgītisūtra:

> "Thus, O Blessed One, the bodhisattva should practice so that merely by seeing him, beings generate faith. Why is that? For the bodhisattva, O Blessed One, there is no other task except the attraction of beings. The ripening of beings—this, O Blessed One, is the bodhisattva's Dharma-assembly."

---

## Part XII: The Danger of Displeasing Others

What is the fault if one does not act thus?

> *But one whose [instruction] is not accepted—the world, having disdained that seed of the Victor,*
> *like fire hidden by ash, is cooked in hells and such.* (Kārikā 11)

As previously indicated. And the cause of his disdain is this harm:

> *In the Ratnamegha the Victor stated the summary restraint:*
> *That by which beings become displeased—that one should carefully avoid.* (Kārikā 12)

As He said:¹²

> "And what are those bodhisattva behaviors? Here the bodhisattva does not dwell in an improper place, not at an improper time. He is not one who speaks at the wrong time, not one who does not know the time, not one who does not know the place. From whatever cause beings might become displeased toward him—he, for the sake of protecting all beings and for the sake of fulfilling his own accumulation of awakening, becomes one of accomplished deportment, soft-spoken, gentle-spoken, not associated with gatherings, oriented toward seclusion, with a pleasing face."

Hence in the Dharmasaṃgītisūtra it is taught:

> "One who protects beings protects morality."

By this slight [rule], protection of the world is accomplished regarding private sitting with young women, etc. Likewise, in water and land places for enjoyment, one should not void urine, feces, phlegm, pus, etc.—disgusting things—secretly or openly, for the sake of protecting the minds of gods and humans.

---

## Part XIII: Rules of Speech

In the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa too, avoidance of displeasing [behavior] is stated:

> "One should not chew a tooth-stick in front [of others]; one should not spit in front [of others]..."

This rule of respect and modesty should be applied everywhere, not only among fellow-practitioners. But in this sūtra, regarding fellow-practitioners, [it is specified] to show the fear of greater offense.

And as stated here:

> "One should not be loud-speaking..."

And this rule is not limited to one place.

Likewise in the Brahmaparipṛcchā it is also stated:

> "The bodhisattva should not be like an executioner."

And also from the Prātimokṣa, seeking out and avoiding what displeases the world. There:

> *One should not eat with mouth full, noisily, with extended face.*
> *One should not sit with dangling legs, nor rub the arms simultaneously.*

Thus, by one's own inference, seeing, and hearing, one should protect against displeasing the world.

---

## Part XIV: The Sāgaramati Precepts on Speech

Avoidance of displeasing speech is not easy, so it is shown for the purpose of awakening memory. As taught in the Āryasāgaramatisūtra:¹³

> "He is not of sunken speech. Not of scattered speech. Not of flowing speech. Not of blazing speech. Not of speech led by desire. Not of vulgar speech. Not of unguarded speech. Not of speech kindling hatred. Not of restless speech. Not of fickle speech. Not of actor-stage speech. He is not one who places false testimony on [another's] face."

---

## Part XV: The Tathāgataguhya Precepts on Speech

In the Āryatathāgataguhyasūtra it is also said:¹⁴

> "Indeed, O son of good family, the bodhisattva's speech is not desirous, not hateful, not deluded, not afflicted, not of crushed-answer, not speech exalting one's own side, not speech suppressing the other's side, not speech favoring one's own appearance, not speech opposing the other's appearance, not speech just for winning the debate, not speech of proud explanation."

---

## Part XVI: The Daśabhūmika Precepts on Speech

In the Āryadaśabhūmakasūtra too it is stated:¹⁵

> "That speech which is unpleasant, destroying one's own and others' continuum—having abandoned such speech, he utters speech which is affectionate, soft, pleasant, sweet, dear-making, mind-pleasing, beneficial, ear-pleasant, heart-going, love-producing, clear in sound, knowable, worth hearing, not dependent, desired by many, pleasing to many, mind-pleasing to many, praised by the wise, bringing welfare and happiness to all beings, uplifting the mind, gladdening the mind, delighting one's own and others' continuum, pacifying desire, hatred, delusion, and all afflictions—he utters such speech. He avoids even speech with legends and history, avoiding it."

---

## Part XVII: Protecting Beings by Examining One's Own Faults

In brief, protecting the disaffection of others is taught in the Āryasāgaramatisūtra:¹⁶

> "Another single dharma conduces to the Mahāyāna-synthesis: **by examining one's own faults, one protects all beings.**"

---

## Part XVIII: Summary Verse on Protecting One's Person

> *This is the protection of one's person—* (Kārikā 13a)

—how one is not destroyed by others, and how one does not destroy others. The condensed meaning of this extensive text should always be held in mind by the bodhisattva:

> *"Firmly stable, well-pleased, steady, with earnest respect,*
> *modest, with fear, peaceful, intent on pleasing others,*
> *always under control of self and beings in blameless matters,*
> *I hold this mind like a magical creation, without pride."*

---

## Part XIX: Protection Through Medicine, Clothing, Etc.

Is this the extent of protecting one's person? No. What then?

> *...with medicine, clothing, etc.* (Kārikā 13b)

Therein, medicine is of two kinds: constant medicine and illness-condition medicine.¹⁷

Regarding constant medicine, it is stated in the Āryaratnamegha:

> "Therefore, of the alms-food, one portion he sets aside for fellow practitioners. A second [portion] for the suffering. A third for the destitute. The fourth he himself partakes. Partaking, he partakes without desire, without attachment, without greed, without clinging—only for the sake of the body's maintenance, for its support.
>
> He partakes in such a way that he is neither too emaciated nor too heavy-bodied. Why is that? One who is too emaciated turns away from the wholesome side. One who is too heavy-bodied is overcome by torpor. Therefore, having partaken of that alms-food, one should be oriented toward the wholesome side..."

---

## Part XX: The Dharma-Armor for Alms-Gathering

In the Āryaratnarāśi it is also stated:¹⁸

> "By him, going to village, town, or hamlet for alms, the Dharma-armor should be donned. What is that Dharma-armor?
>
> Having seen unpleasant forms, one should not be repelled. Having seen pleasant [forms], one should not be attracted. Thus regarding pleasant and unpleasant sounds, smells, tastes, and touchables—one should not be attracted, not be repelled.
>
> With senses well-restrained, with eyes not upturned, looking only a plow-length ahead, with a trained thoroughbred mind, not abandoning the mental orientation to prior dharmas, not with a continuum cast toward baits—thus one should go for alms, going house-to-house.
>
> Wherever alms-food is obtained, there one should not generate attachment. Wherever not obtained, there one should not generate aversion. In ten houses' entry, if from the eleventh house alms-food is not obtained, even then one should not be distressed. And the thought should be generated: 'These householders and brahmins have many tasks. They are not obliged to give to me. It is already wonderful that they notice me—let alone that they will give alms.'
>
> Thus, not distressed, one should go for alms.
>
> And whatever beings come within the range of one's eyes—women, men, boys, girls, even animals—toward them the thought of loving-kindness and compassion should be generated: 'May I act so that those beings who come within range of my eyes, who will give me alms-food, I will cause to go to good destinations. Such a yoga I will pursue.'
>
> Then, having gathered the alms-food, coarse or refined, one should look about in the four directions: 'Who here in this village is a poor being to whom I will give a share of this alms-food?' If one sees a poor being, a share should be given from that alms-food.
>
> If one does not see any poor being, the thought should be generated: 'There are beings not in visible range who do not come within range of my eyes. To them I offer the first portion of this alms-food. Having taken it, may they partake.'
>
> Then, having taken that alms-food, ascending to that forest-hermitage, with washed hands, with fine conduct, endowed with the appearance of renunciant practice, sitting with legs crossed, that alms-food should be partaken...
>
> While partaking, this mental orientation should be generated: 'There are in this body eighty thousand families of worms. May they, by this very nourishment, dwell happy and comfortable. Now I will gather them with materiality; having attained awakening, I will gather them with Dharma.'
>
> If his alms-food is coarse, the thought should be generated: 'By coarse food, my body will become light, fit for exertion. My excretion will be little. Faith-offerings will be little. I will have lightness of body and lightness of mind. I will have little sickness and torpor.'
>
> When his alms-food is abundant, one should be an eater of measure, one whose nature is to relinquish. Then, descending onto some rock from that alms-food, the thought should be generated: 'Whatever flocks of deer and birds are interested in material food—may they, having taken it, partake.'"

---

## Part XXI: Avoidance of Meat

Thus, protection of one's person should be done with constant medicine. But not with fish and meat, since it is prohibited in the Laṅkāvatārasūtra:¹⁹

> "All meat is not to be eaten by a bodhisattva of compassionate nature—so I declare..."
>
> *Due to one's own birth, due to misconduct,*
> *due to arising from semen and blood,*
> *as horrifying to beings—*
> *the yogī should avoid meat.*
>
> *Meat, onions, various liquors,*
> *garlic, and leeks—*
> *the yogī should always avoid.*
>
> *One should avoid anointing with oil;*
> *one should not sleep among creatures pierced by thorns,*
> *nor in places of great danger for beings with hollows and non-hollows...*
>
> *For gain, life is killed; for meat, wealth is given.*
> *Both those evil-doers are cooked in Raurava and such...*
>
> *Whoever, transgressing the Sage's word, foolishly eats meat—*
> *for the destruction of both worlds, initiated in Śākya's teaching—*
>
> *They go to the supreme terrible hell;*
> *those evil-doers are cooked in fierce Raurava and such, the meat-eaters.*
>
> *There is no meat that is three-fold pure—*
> *not prepared, not wished for, not caused.*
> *Therefore, meat should not be eaten...*
>
> *By one dwelling in loving-kindness always, it is entirely censured by me.*
> *One would be together with lions, tigers, deer, etc.*
>
> *Therefore, one should not eat meat, which horrifies people.*
> *Being obstructed from liberation-dharma—this is the flag of the noble ones.*

Regarding what is recited in the Jñānavatīparivarta about eating meat—that is without fault because it accomplishes a great purpose.

---

## Part XXII: Illness-Condition Medicine

Constant medicine has been stated. Illness-condition medicine—that should certainly be used.²⁰

Even in the Śrāvaka-vinaya, for one's own sake, for the sake of the holy life, even selling the bowl and robe for the maintenance of the body is stated—how much more for the sake of saving limitless people, the bodhisattva's body. "Rare is the festival of obtaining such a moment-opportunity."

And for showing this, the Blessed One himself demonstrated the use of medicine there.

---

## Part XXIII: The Mind of a Servant

> *But from enjoying with self-craving, afflicted offense arises.* (Kārikā 13cd)

For everything has been relinquished by the bodhisattva to all beings. Therein, if forgetfully, with craving for self-maintenance, he partakes of another's property, he incurs afflicted offense.²¹

But if, free from craving, attached to another or remembering the task for beings, he partakes—he does not incur afflicted offense.

If perceiving it as another's property, he partakes for his own sake—he incurs the offense of theft. In the earlier rule, in the Prātimokṣa, this is a *pārājika* defeat.

But with possessions owned by beings, the person (*ātmabhāva*) owned by beings is itself protected—so there is no fault. For a servant, always occupied with the master's work, has no own-property by which he would live.

As stated in the Dharmasaṃgītisūtra:

> "By the bodhisattva there should be dwelling like a servant—causing the accomplishment of all beings' service."

---

*Thus ends the Sixth Chapter, Protection of One's Person, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*
