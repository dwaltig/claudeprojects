# Chapter 13: Foundations of Mindfulness (Smṛtyupasthāna)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

**Summary**: Building on the mind-training of Chapter 12, Chapter 13 details the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness** (*Smṛtyupasthāna*). Unlike the Śrāvaka version which focuses on impermanence, the Mahāyāna version presented here emphasizes **emptiness (*śūnyatā*)** and the **non-obtaining (*anupalabdhi*)** of any self-nature in the body, feelings, mind, or dharmas.

### 1. Mindfulness of Body (Kāyasmṛtyupasthāna)

The Bodhisattva establishes mindfulness in the body.
As stated in the *Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra*:¹

> "This body is a collection of feet, toes, shins, thighs... skull and head. It is accumulated by karma and housing a hundred thousand defilements.
> It contains various substances: hair, nails, teeth, bones, pus, blood, mucus, brain.
>
> Examining it, he thinks: 'What here is the body?'
> He realizes: **'This body is like space (*ākāśasama*).'**
> He establishes mindfulness in the body as space. Because of this full knowledge (*parijñāna*), his mindfulness does not scatter."

The *Vīradattaparipṛcchā* provides sixty-one metaphors for the body, including:
*   Like an anthill (housing serpents).
*   Like an ungrateful friend (*mitradrohin*).
*   Like a foam ball (*phenapiṇḍa*).
*   Like an empty village (*śūnyagrāma*).
*   Like a potter's vessel (fragile).

> "Just as a fool rubs a piece of coal thinking 'I will make it white,' but it only goes to destruction; so one who bathes and perfumes this body cannot make it pure. It goes to destruction, not purity."

### 2. Mindfulness of Feelings (Vedanāsmṛtyupasthāna)

The Bodhisattva establishes mindfulness in feelings.
As stated in the *Ārya-Ratnacūḍa Sūtra*:

> "When feeling a **pleasant feeling**, he generates great compassion for beings of **desire-nature**, and abandons his own tendency to attachment (*rāgānuśaya*). He knows it as **impermanent**.
>
> When feeling a **painful feeling**, he generates great compassion for beings of **hatred-nature**, and abandons his own tendency to aversion (*pratighānuśaya*). He knows it as a **thorn** (*śalya*).
>
> When feeling a **neutral feeling**, he generates compassion for beings of **delusion-nature**, and abandons his own tendency to ignorance (*avidyānuśaya*). He knows it as **peace/non-self** (*śānta/anātma*)."

The *Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra* adds the non-dual observation:
> "Feeling is experienced. But by what?
> **The feeler (*vedaka*) is not found separate from the feeling.**"

### 3. Mindfulness of Mind (Cittasmṛtyupasthāna)

The Bodhisattva searches for the mind.
As stated in the *Ārya-Ratnakūṭa (Kāśyapaparivarta)*:²

> "He searches for the mind. Which mind? Past, future, or present?
> Past mind is destroyed. Future mind has not arrived. Present mind has no stability (*sthiti*).
>
> Mind, O Kāśyapa, is not found inside, not outside, not in between.
> **Mind has not been seen by any Buddhas, is not seen, will not be seen.**
> What is not seen—what process (*pracāra*) can it have?"

The text provides metaphors for the illusion-like nature of mind:
*   Like a river current (unstable).
*   Like a lamp flame (dependent on conditions).
*   Like lightning (momentary).
*   Like a thief (stealing wholesome roots).

Also, mind cannot see itself:
> "Just as a sword-edge cannot cut itself, just as a fingertip cannot touch itself; so mind cannot see mind."

### 4. Mindfulness of Dharmas (Dharmasmṛtyupasthāna)

The Bodhisattva establishes mindfulness in dharmas (phenomena).
As stated in the *Ārya-Ratnacūḍa Sūtra*:

> "Observing dharmas, he does not see any dharma...
> He enters the samādhi called 'No Obstruction.'
> He perceives: 'These dharmas are unafflicted (*niḥkleśa*). By awakening to these very defilements, there is awakening.'
> **The own-nature of defilements is the own-nature of awakening.**"

The *Lalitavistara* provides verses on the dependent origination of dharmas, using the examples of:
*   **Seed and Sprout**: Not the same, not different.
*   **Seal and Impression**: Appearance without transference (*saṃkrānti*).
*   **Eye and Form**: Consciousness arises from their meeting, but form represents no essence.
*   **Fire from Sticks**: Arises from conditions, goes nowhere when ceased.
*   **The Lute**: Sound arises from wood, strings, and effort; but sound is not in the wood or the strings.

### 5. The Emptiness of Names

The chapter concludes with the *Lokanāthavyākaraṇa*:

> "Dharmas are empty, nameless.
> In the name, no name-nature is found.
> Name is only a designation (*prajñapti*).
> All dharmas are nameless, yet illuminated by names."

### Footnotes

1.  **Body as Space**: The Mahāyāna move here is to dissolve the solidity of the body not just into "parts" (as in Early Buddhism) but into "space" (*ākāśa*), emphasizing emptiness.
2.  **Unfindability of Mind**: This is a classic *Kāśyapaparivarta* passage, central to Zen and Mahāmudrā discussions on looking for the mind and not finding it.
