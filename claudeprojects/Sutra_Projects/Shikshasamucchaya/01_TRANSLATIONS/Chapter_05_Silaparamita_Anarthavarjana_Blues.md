# Chapter 5: The Vow (Śīlapāramitā Anarthavarjana)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig

---

*The fifth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on keeping your word—the thirteen promises you made, what breaks 'em, and how to keep your morals clean when everything around you wants to dirty you up.*

---


## What You Said You'd Do

So we talked about harm.¹ Now here's how you don't do it.

In the Adhyāśayasaṃcodana Sūtra,² beginner bodhisattvas—
scared when they heard about all those harms—
they stood up and made their vows:

> *"We, O Blessed One,*
> *from this day forward,*
> *make this undertaking*
> *before the Tathāgata:*

Listen to what they promised.
These are **The Thirteen Vows**.
Every one ends the same way:
**"...we deceive the Tathāgata."**

That means: if you break this vow,
you're lying to the Buddha's face.

---

### Vow 1: Don't Accuse

**If we accuse a bodhisattva-vehicle person**—
householder or renunciant—
**of an offense,**
whether the charge is true or false,

***we deceive the Tathāgata.***

---

### Vow 2: Don't Speak Ill

**If we disdain a bodhisattva-vehicle person**
**and speak ill of him,**

***we deceive the Tathāgata.***

---

### Vow 3: Don't Judge Their Pleasure

**If we see a bodhisattva-vehicle person**—
householder or renunciant—
**playing with the five pleasures,**
**enjoying himself,**
and we:
- Get disgusted
- Get vexed
- Lose respect
- Stop seeing him as a Teacher

***we deceive the Tathāgata.***

---

### Vow 4: Don't Compete for Patrons

**If we create bodily or mental trouble**
**for bodhisattva-vehicle people**
because we're competing over patron-families or alms-families,

***we deceive the Tathāgata.***

---

### Vow 5: Don't Say One Mean Word

**If we address a bodhisattva-vehicle person**
**with even ONE unpleasant word,**

***we deceive the Tathāgata.***

---

### Vow 6: Bow Six Times Daily

**If we don't bow**
**to a bodhisattva-vehicle person**
**three times at night**
**and three times during the day,**

***we deceive the Tathāgata.***

---

### Vow 7: Give Everything for This

**If we don't give up**
**kingdom, wealth,**
**or body and life**
**for this vow-undertaking,**

***we deceive the Tathāgata.***

---

### Vow 8: Don't Think You're Better

**If we disdain**
**Śrāvaka-vehicle or Pratyekabuddha-vehicle people**
thinking "we're better than them,"

***we deceive the Tathāgata.***

---

### Vow 9: Stay Low

**If we don't dwell**
**with lowly minds,**
**with minds like outcastes,**

***we deceive the Tathāgata.***

---

### Vow 10: Don't Brag, Don't Tear Down

**If we exalt ourselves**
**or tear down others,**

***we deceive the Tathāgata.***

---

### Vow 11: Run From Conflict

**If we don't flee**
**a yojana or a hundred yojanas**
**from fear of hatred and conflict,**
being driven,

***we deceive the Tathāgata.***

---

### Vow 12: Don't Show Off

**If we proclaim ourselves as moral,**
**or learned, or ascetic—**
**show off ANY quality at all—**

***we deceive the Tathāgata.***

---

### Vow 13: Hide Your Good, Show Your Bad

**If we don't dwell**
**with concealed good and revealed evil**—
humble about virtue,
transparent about faults—

***we deceive the Tathāgata.***

---

Then the Blessed One told Maitreya:

> *"Whoever wants to exhaust karma-obstruction*
> *should make these undertakings*
> *just as these good people did."*

**That's The Vow.**
Thirteen promises.
You break one? You're lying to the Buddha.

---


## Don't Search for Faults

The Sarvadharmāpravṛttinirdeśa³ lays it down:

> *"Three times at night,*
> *three times during the day,*
> *bow to bodhisattvas with your head.*
>
> ***Don't search for any fault in them.***
> *Let them practice as they wish.*
>
> *When you see one enjoying pleasures,*
> ***don't search for any fault.***

Why not?

> *With infinite qualities,*
> *that bodhisattva practice—*
> *even this one, in time, will touch it.*
>
> *By gradual reasoning, by gradual action,*
> ***you don't become a Buddha by one word.***
>
> *Many koṭis and niyutas of kalpas—*
> *one who's set out with armor don't become otherwise."*

Now listen to this:

> *"Those free from karma-obstruction*
> ***shouldn't find fault***
> *with any bodhisattva's conduct.*
>
> *All their actions should be released.*

Why? Because:

> *'I don't know another's mind.*
> *Beings' conduct is hard to know.'*

The Tathāgata himself says:

> *'A person shouldn't be measured by another person.*
> ***Either I would measure,***
> ***or one like me.'***

You hear that? Only the Buddha measures people.
Not you. Not me.

> *If you want to protect yourself,*
> ***don't discriminate anyone's conduct.***
>
> *Don't disparage:*
> *'This one is like this, that one is like that.'*
>
> *Be devoted to Buddha-dharma,*
> *day and night,*
> *with a Dharma-grasping mind."*

You understand what I'm saying?
You don't know what they know.
You can't see inside another's heart.
You can't read their mind.

Only the Buddha measures people.
Or one like the Buddha.
And you ain't there yet.

**Mind your own business.**
**Keep your vow.**

## The Kṣitigarbha Prayer

In the Kṣitigarbha Sūtra,⁴ learned beings made this prayer:

> *"For as long as we wander in saṃsāra—*
> *having obtained even a little patience—*
>
> *May we NOT become kings.*
> *May we NOT become ministers.*
> *May we NOT become town-elders.*
> *May we NOT become village-elders.*
> *May we NOT become regional-elders.*
> *May we NOT become chief-priests.*
> *May we NOT become generals...*
> *May we NOT become any kind of leader over beings—*
>
> ***UNTIL we have obtained patience.***
>
> *Because from such positions,*
> *we might create heinous karma*
> *that damages Buddha's teaching."*

You hear what they're saying?
Power without patience? Dangerous.
Authority without wisdom? Deadly.

They're praying: "Don't let me be in charge
till I know how to handle it."

**That's The Vow.**
Staying small till you're strong enough for big.

## The Moon-Lamp Verses

The Candrapradīpa Sūtra⁵ lays it out:

> *"In that evil time,*
> *there's no evil they won't do.*
> *Don't get intimate with them*
> *in the last age.*
>
> *If you speak with them,*
> *you might lose respect.*
> *But don't shrink from honoring—*
> *they haven't awakened yet.*
>
> *Ask about ordination seniority.*
> *Whoever is elder—*
> *bow at their feet with your head.*
>
> *Don't see any fault*
> *in those who behold the seat of awakening.*
> *Don't generate opposition;*
> *always be of loving mind.*
>
> *If you see a fault in them,*
> *don't announce it.*
> *Whatever karma one does,*
> *that fruit one gets.*
>
> *With a smiling moon-face,*
> *toward elders and newcomers,*
> *be the first to speak—*
> *pride destroyed, patient.*
>
> *With robes and alms-food, help them.*
> *Place your mind thus:*
> *'All will become Leaders.'"*

**Smiling moon-face.**
You be the first to speak.
You bow first.
You give first.

Because everyone's a future Buddha.
Everyone.

## Why You Bow to Bodhicitta

For those who can't generate reverence
for someone who's generated bodhicitta,
the Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra⁶ gives Maitreya's praise to Sudhana:

> *"He, seeing beings*
> *afflicted by old age and disease,*
> *assailed by hundreds of sufferings,*
> *tormented by birth-death fear and grief—*
> *for their sake he practices,*
> *with compassion-mind.*
>
> *Seeing the world tormented*
> *by suffering's machine*
> *in the wheel of five destinies,*
> *he seeks that knowledge-vajra*
> *to shatter the suffering-wheel.*
>
> *Seeing the field of beings*
> *with thorns, splinters, prickles*
> *of desire and hatred,*
> *entangled in dense undergrowth of views—*
> *seeking to purify that field,*
> *he seeks the plough of wisdom.*
>
> *The world, jungle of delusion-ignorance,*
> *wisdom-eye destroyed, without guide—*
> *he'll become a lord showing safety,*
> *a caravan-leader for the world.*
>
> *Wearing patience-armor,*
> *mounted on three liberations,*
> *with knowledge-sword*
> *vanquishing affliction-enemies,*
> *a hero, a giver of fearlessness—*
> *he'll become a guide for the world.*
>
> *He launches the Dharma-boat,*
> *trained in the knowledge-ocean path,*
> *a leader to peace-jewel island—*
> *he's the helmsman in triple ocean.*
>
> *With disk of knowledge-rays and aspiration,*
> *illuminating all being-worlds,*
> *rising from dharma-realm sky's ocean—*
> *he's proclaimed the Buddha-sun.*
>
> *Cool as loving-kindness sandalwood,*
> *equal-minded toward all beings,*
> *full-disk of white dharmas—*
> *he's proclaimed the Buddha-moon.*
>
> *Established on firm aspiration-ground,*
> *gradually risen in bodhisattva practice,*
> *a mine of all dharma-jewels—*
> *he'll become the supreme knowledge-ocean.*
>
> *Born from bodhicitta's nāga-king,*
> *risen in dharma-realm sky,*
> *raining Dharma-clouds simultaneously,*
> *increasing all white-fruit harvests.*
>
> *Faith-wick destroying three-stain darkness,*
> *firm vessel of loving-kindness oil and mindfulness,*
> *bright with stainless bodhicitta-fire—*
> *he'll light the Dharma-lamp.*
>
> *Bodhicitta is the embryonic mass,*
> *compassion the membrane,*
> *loving-kindness the flesh,*
> *aspiration immovable—*
> *limbs of awakening gradually arising—*
> *this Buddha-embryo increases.*
>
> *Such ones,*
> *armored with compassion and loving-kindness,*
> *minds intent on liberating beings—*
> *rare in the world with gods and humans—*
> *such a one with purified mind."*

You see why you reverence them?

They're carrying the **Buddha-embryo**.
They're lighting the **Dharma-lamp**.
They're wielding the **knowledge-vajra** that shatters suffering.

That person you're about to judge?
They might be carrying the next Buddha in their heart.

**Keep your vow.**
Bow. Don't judge.

## How to Walk Through Hell and Not Get Burned

You been meditating on that Buddha-embryo?
Thinking about how they're carrying the next Awakened One in their chest?

Good. That meditation makes it easy to avoid harm.⁷

Now the Book gives you **eight roads** out of trouble.
The Adhyāśayasaṃcodana Sūtra lays it plain:

> *"In the last five hundred years,*
> *when the true Dharma is dying—*
> *when everything's falling apart—*
> *you walk these eight roads,*
> *you'll get through unharmed.*

**First Four Roads: What You Don't Do**

1. **Examine your own dirt** - Look at your faults, not theirs
2. **Don't point fingers** - Don't accuse other bodhisattvas
3. **Don't compete for money** - Don't look at patron-families with jealous eyes
4. **Don't run your mouth** - Refrain from heedless speech

**Second Four Roads: Where You Don't Go**

1. **Stay away from fools** - Avoid beings of little learning
2. **Don't build yourself a following** - Don't gather crowds around you
3. **Go to the edge** - Dwell in border lodging-places, not the center
4. **Mind your own soul** - Be devoted to self-discipline and tranquility"

You hear what I'm saying?
Eight roads. Eight ways to stay clean.

First four: **What you don't do** (don't accuse, don't compete, don't talk reckless)
Second four: **Where you don't go** (don't hang with fools, don't gather crowds, go to the edge)

**That's The Vow.**
Walk those eight roads. Stay safe.

## What Gain and Honor Do to You

The same sūtra⁸ gives you the warning straight:

> *"A beginner bodhisattva with wisdom's power should:*
> *RUN from gain and honor, seeing the danger*
> *RUN from delight in gatherings, seeing the danger*
> *RUN from delight in talk, seeing the danger*
> *RUN from delight in sleep, seeing the danger*
> *RUN from delight in work, seeing the danger*
> *RUN from delight in elaboration, seeing the danger..."*

Now listen close. Here's what **gain and honor** do to your soul:

**The Twenty-Five Ways Fame Kills You:**

Fame **generates desire** - lights that fire in your belly
Fame **destroys mindfulness** - wipes your memory clean
Fame **causes rising and falling** - you a yo-yo on gain and loss
Fame **generates delusion** - puts fog in your head
Fame **makes you stingy** - you clutch those families tight
Fame **generates deceit** - you lie for advantage
Fame **destroys your nobility, makes you shameless**
Fame **gets you disapproved by all Buddhas**
Fame **generates pride and intoxication** - you drunk on yourself
Fame **makes you disdain teachers** - you don't listen no more
Fame **puts you on Māra's side** - you working for the devil now
Fame **is the root of heedlessness** - steals your merit
Fame **is like lightning, a wheel, a thunderbolt** - quick and deadly
Fame **pollutes you with obstacles** - depression sets in
Fame **confuses the intellect** - can't think straight
Fame **makes you a vessel for grief** - when it changes, you break
Fame **steals your mindfulness, weakens white dharmas**
Fame **kills your right exertions**
Fame **destroys your supernormal powers**
Fame **creates disrespect** where there was respect
Fame **makes you honor enemies, abandon friends** - backwards loyalty
Fame **makes you like a courtesan** - always seeking connection
Fame **keeps you from dhyānas and immeasurables**
Fame **casts you into hell, animal births, Yama's world**
Fame **makes you like Devadatta** - the betrayer

You hear what I'm saying?
Fame is poison with twenty-five symptoms.
It'll kill you twenty-five different ways.

## The Medicine: Want Less

> *"Such are the dangers in gain and honor.*
> *You seen 'em now.*
> *So what's the cure?*
> *Delight in few desires—don't be tormented.*
>
> *Why? Listen to what happens*
> *when you want less:*

**For the one of few desires:**

Such faults don't arise - the poison can't touch you
No obstructions to Buddha-dharmas - the road stays clear
Not disgusted with householders and renounciants - you love everybody
Protected by gods and humans - they got your back
Unafraid of bad destinies - hell don't scare you
Unshaken by threats - nobody can move you
Unmoved from Māra's domain - the devil can't budge you
Unassailable by calamities - disasters pass you by
Sought after by gods and humans - they come looking for you
Clear, having abandoned deceit - clean through and through
Unheedless, seeing pleasure's danger - eyes wide open
Practices as speaks - you walk your talk
Sought after by learned fellow-practitioners - the wise want your company

> *Knowing this,*
> *a wise bodhisattva delights in few desires.*
> *Cultivate wanting less*
> *to abandon all gain and honor."*

**Want less.**
That's the medicine for the poison.
That's the antidote for fame.
That's keeping The Vow.

---


## The Poison of Gatherings

Listen now:

> *"Having abandoned desire, having abandoned hatred—*
> *the yogī doesn't dwell among gatherings.*
> *You hang with the crowd?*
> *You bend that way. You lean that way.*
> *Don't delight in that fault.*

What happens in the crowd?

> *Excitement rises. Laughter comes.*
> *Thoughts multiply like weeds.*
> *You get mixed. You get unrestrained.*
> *Gatherings without essence do that.*
>
> *Fools delight in worldly gossip.*
> *Fools diminish in Dharma-talk.*
> *They increase hostility.*
> *They increase excessive thoughts.*
> *By this fault, you don't shine there.*
>
> *The monk don't increase in learning*
> *delighting in improper talk.*
> *Therefore, abandon improper talk.*
> *Find your delight in Dharma.*

Think about this:

> *I abandoned thousands of my own bones*
> *aspiring to awakening.*
> *I'm not satisfied hearing Dharma.*
> *But they? They get weary hearing Dharma.*

So what you gonna do?

> *Entirely avoid*
> *improper and undisciplined talk.*
> *Generate delight in excellent Dharma,*
> *hard to obtain in many hundred kalpas.*

And if you dwelling in the forest, seeking qualities?

> *Don't observe others' faults.*
> *Don't think: "I am distinguished, I alone am best."*
> *Don't take up that thought.*
>
> *That's pride, root of all heedlessness.*
> *Don't disdain inferior monks.*
> *This teaching is gradual.*
> *Nobody attains awakening in one birth."*

You hear what I'm saying?
Crowds make you laugh when you should be serious.
They make you gossip when you should be quiet.
They make you judge when you should be humble.

You get mixed up. Unrestrained. Bent out of shape.

**Stay alone.**
**Keep The Vow.**

## Eleven Ways Loving Your Own Voice Destroys You

Listen to what happens to the talker:

> *He becomes disrespectful,*
> *intoxicated with learning,*
> *dwelling in disputes.*
> *Stolen mindfulness, no clear comprehension—*
> ***that's the talker's ruin.***

> *Far from inner contemplation.*
> *Neither mind nor body peaceful.*
> *Many risings and fallings—*
> ***that's the talker's ruin.***

> *Destroyed in true Dharma-mind,*
> *the fool becomes harsh, unlubricated mind.*
> *Far from insight and calm—*
> ***that's the talker's ruin.***

> *Always disrespectful to teachers,*
> *delighting in polluted talk.*
> *Standing in what's without essence,*
> *wisdom destroyed—*
> ***that's the talker's ruin.***

> *Not honored by god-hosts.*
> *They don't aspire toward him.*
> *Deficient in analytical knowledge—*
> ***that's the talker's ruin.***

> *Criticized by wise men—*
> *whoever is an individual witness.*
> *His life becomes pointless—*
> ***that's the talker's ruin.***

> *He grieves when the fool does:*
> *"I'm without practice, what now?"*
> *Very miserable, without firm ground—*
> ***that's the talker's ruin.***

> *Unsteady like a straw stirred by wind.*
> *That one doubts.*
> *Never has firm understanding—*
> ***that's the talker's ruin.***

> *Like an actor on stage,*
> *speaking of other heroes' qualities,*
> *but himself without practice—*
> ***that's the talker's ruin.***

> *Deceitful, fickle, hopeless.*
> *Again and again resorts to dispute.*
> *Far from the noble Dharma—*
> ***that's the talker's ruin...***

> *Having delighted in talk for a long time,*
> *you don't find self-bliss here.*
> *Better is contemplation on a single quarter-verse,*
> *where you may find infinite bliss.*

Now here's the image:

> *There's nothing of essence in sugarcane's rind.*
> *In the middle is the essence, most delightful.*
> *You eat the rind?*
> *You can't obtain the superior juice.*
>
> *Just as the rind—so understand talk.*
> *Just as the juice—so is meaning-contemplation.*
> *Therefore, abandoning delight in talk,*
> *may you always contemplate meaning."*

**Eleven ways the talker gets ruined.**
You talk too much? You lose everything.

Like eating sugarcane rind instead of the juice inside.
All surface, no substance.
All bark, no bite.

**Shut up.**
**Contemplate meaning.**
**Keep The Vow.**

## When You Love Your Bed Too Much

Listen to what happens to the one who delights in sleep:

> *He increases a great net of delusion.*
> *Becomes doubtful, grasping views.*
> *Many views arise for him*
> ***who wrongly delights in torpor.***

> *His wisdom becomes very weak.*
> *Understanding diminishes.*
> *Always diminished in knowledge,*
> ***who wrongly delights in torpor.***

Now here's where it gets dangerous:

> *Lazy, unknowing, slothful, unwise—*
> ***non-human beings get access to him.***
> *They harass him in the forest,*
> ***who wrongly delights in torpor.***

That's right. Sleep too much? The demons walk right in.
The door's wide open when you're snoring.

> *Uninterested in wholesome mind.*
> *No desire for Dharma.*
> *More and more desirous of non-dharma,*
> ***who wrongly delights in torpor.***

> *Confused, bereft of Dharma-desire,*
> *the fool loses all qualities.*
> *His white virtue goes, he attains darkness,*
> ***who wrongly delights in torpor.***

> *Lacking skill, withdrawn mind.*
> *Never has constant joy.*
> *Overcome by sleep, slack limbs—*
> ***who wrongly delights in torpor.***

And here's the bitter twist:

> *Having known he's reached by laziness,*
> *he envies the vigorous.*
> *Speaks ill of those with vigor,*
> ***who wrongly delights in torpor.***

So what's the cure?

> *That which destroys all suffering and darkness,*
> *root for avoiding bad destinies,*
> *always praised by all Buddhas—*
> ***cultivate always that noble vigor.***"

Sleep too much?
Demons walk right in.
Wisdom dies.
White virtue leaves, darkness comes.
You lose everything.

**Stay awake.**
**Cultivate vigor.**
**Keep The Vow.**

## Why Service Ain't the Work

Listen to what busy-work does to you:

> *Hard to admonish when urged by teachers.*
> *Doesn't take instruction right.*
> *Quickly becomes one of failed morality—*
> ***faults of one delighting in work.***

> *Always anxious.*
> *Always thinking of householder-tasks.*
> *Nothing to do with dhyāna-abandonment—*
> ***faults of one delighting in work.***

> *Intense desire for tastes.*
> *Seized, infatuated.*
> *Not satisfied with this or that—*
> ***faults of one delighting in work.***

> *Pleased with a large assembly.*
> *Miserable when deprived of it.*
> ***Becomes mixed, like a donkey***—*
> ***faults of one delighting in work.***

That's right. Like a donkey. Always carrying, never free.

> *Day and night, mind on food and robes.*
> *Interested in self-aims with all qualities—*
> ***faults of one delighting in work.***

> *Asks about worldly tasks.*
> *Delights in improper talk.*
> *Doesn't find delight in proper talk—*
> ***faults of one delighting in work.***"

Then Maitreya stood up and said:

> *"Those bodhisattvas will have very little wisdom*
> *who, avoiding foremost dharmas,*
> *take up inferior works."*

And the Blessed One? He agreed. Listen close:

> *"So it is, Maitreya.*
> *I tell you straight:*
> ***Those aren't truly gone forth***
> *who have no yoga, no dhyāna, no abandonment,*
> *no study, no search for learning.*

Now here's the hard truth:

> *The Tathāgata's teaching*
> *is empowered by dhyāna and abandonment,*
> *constructed by knowledge—*
>
> ***NOT empowered by householder-work,***
> ***NOT empowered by service and drudgery.***
>
> *This is the work of those unyoked to yoga,*
> *who delight in saṃsāra.*
> ***The bodhisattva shouldn't aspire to it.***

And then the Buddha says something shocking:

> *If a service-delighting bodhisattva*
> *filled this three-thousand great thousand world-system*
> *with seven-jewel stūpas—*
> *towers of diamonds and gold,*
> *monuments to the sky—*
>
> ***I wouldn't be pleased by him.***

You hear that? Fill the universe with jewels—
the Buddha says "I'm not pleased."

Why? Listen:

> *Fill the whole earth with service-doing bodhisattvas—*
> *all of them should do service*
> *for ONE bodhisattva devoted to recitation and study.*
>
> *Fill the earth with study-bodhisattvas—*
> *all of them should do service*
> *for ONE reflection-bodhisattva.*

You see the hierarchy?
Service < Study < Reflection

> *Why? This is difficult work—*
> ***WISDOM-WORK***—*
> *superior, unsurpassed,*
> *above the whole triple world.*
>
> *Therefore, by a bodhisattva seeking yoga,*
> *wishing to undertake vigor,*
> ***wisdom should be engaged in.***"

You hear what the Buddha's saying?
He says it straight, no sugar:

Fill the universe with jewel stūpas—I wouldn't be pleased.
Why? Because **busy-work ain't the work.**
**Wisdom-work is the work.**

Service-bodhisattvas should serve study-bodhisattvas.
Study-bodhisattvas should serve reflection-bodhisattvas.

The higher you go, the quieter it gets.
The deeper you go, the stiller it gets.

**Stop doing. Start knowing.**
**Keep The Vow.**

## The Command: Flee Elaboration

Listen to what the Book says about elaboration and conflict:

> *The eight unfavorable states*
> *aren't far from him.*
> *The favorable-moment excellence*
> *isn't supreme.*
> *These harms arise always—*
> ***faults of one going about in elaboration.***

> *Having understood these faults,*
> *the wise one should avoid all elaborations.*
> *Harms are easy for one going about in elaboration.*
> ***Don't cohabit with elaboration.***

Now here's the command—listen close:

> ***Go 100 yojanas—that's better—***
> ***wherever there's elaboration or conflict.***

That's right. A hundred yojanas. Hundreds of miles.
Run. Flee. Get out.

> *Don't make a dwelling there.*
> *Not a residence.*
> *Not even for a moment*
> *where there's affliction.*

Think about it:

> *You gone forth?*
> *You ain't interested in wealth.*
> *You interested in qualities.*
> ***Don't create conflict.***
>
> *You have no field, no agriculture, no commerce.*
> *For whose sake are these elaborations?*
>
> *You have no son, no daughter, no wife.*
> *No friend, no relatives.*
> *No servants, no lordship.*
> ***Don't create conflict, having gone forth.***

Now remember what you wearing:

> *You taken the dyed robes with faith—*
> *they're worn by the peaceful.*
> ***Be peaceful and tranquil!***
> *Having avoided elaboration,*
> *generate patience.*

And here's the warning:

> *Guard against poisonous snakes.*
> *Guard against fierce minds, hells, animal realms, Yama's domain.*
> ***They're not far from one going about in elaboration.***
> *Therefore, generate vigor in patience.*

> *By this yoga one obtains purity,*
> *having exhausted karma-obstruction without remainder.*
> ***He opposes Māra with army and vehicle—***
> *whoever, the wise one, generates patience."*

**Go a hundred yojanas from conflict.**
That's hundreds of miles. That's running.

Run from drama.
Flee from elaboration.
Get out while you can.

You got no family. No field. No business.
What you fighting for?

Hell ain't far from the one who loves conflict.
The poisonous snakes ain't far.
The animal realms ain't far.

**Run.**
**Stay peaceful.**
**Keep The Vow.**

## What It All Comes Down To

Now we get to the heart of it.⁹
The root verse. The core teaching.
Listen:

> ***By what is this attained?***
> ***By avoidance of all fruitless activity.*** (Kārikā 7)

By what? By cutting out everything that doesn't serve others.

The **fruit** here is **for them**, not you.
Whatever doesn't help others—
being fruitless—
cut it out.

Now the Candrapradīpa Sūtra shows you what this looks like in the body:

> *"He is not one whose hands are restless.*
> *Not one whose feet are restless.*
> *Restrained in hands and feet."*

And the Daśadharmaka Sūtra spells it plain:

> *"Waving hands, waving feet,*
> *running, running about,*
> *jumping, leaping—*
> ***this is bodily agitation.***"*

You see what they're saying?
If it doesn't serve others, it's fruitless.
If it's fruitless, cut it.

**Be still.**
**Don't wave your hands around.**
**Don't run and jump for nothing.**
**Keep The Vow.**

## All Action for Beings' Sake

The Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra¹⁰ makes it crystal clear:

> *"Whatever bodily action of bodhisattvas—*
> *whatever verbal, whatever mental—*
>
> ***ALL proceeds with observation of beings.***
> *With great compassion as chief.*
> *With aim of establishing beings' welfare.*
> *Proceeding with intention of welfare and happiness*
> *for all beings.*

You hear that? Everything. Body, speech, mind.
All of it for them.

> *He, with benevolent intention, thinks:*
> *'That practice should be practiced by me*
> *which brings welfare and happiness*
> *to all beings.'*

How does he do it?

> *The practice is observation of sense-bases*
> *like an empty village.*
> *And he doesn't aspire to abandon sense-bases."*

Now the Gaganagañja Sūtra¹¹ gives you the final teaching.
Listen close:

> *"Just as wind enters through a crack,*
> *so from wherever there's a crack in the mind,*
> ***Māra obtains access.***

You understand?
Wind gets in through cracks.
The devil gets in through cracks.
Find the weak spot, walk right in.

So what you gonna do?

> *Therefore, the bodhisattva should always be*
> ***of CRACKLESS MIND.***
>
> *That cracklessness is fulfillment*
> *of the emptiness of all-aspect knowledge."*

**No cracks.**
No weak spots. No openings. No loose places.

Wind gets in through cracks.
Māra gets in through cracks.
You leave a crack? He's coming in.

**Seal it up.**
**Make your mind crackless.**
**Keep The Vow.**

# Theological Notes

### The Root Metaphor: "The Vow"

This chapter is about **keeping your word**. You made thirteen promises to the Buddha. Now you gotta live by them. The Blues tradition knows this—promises you can't break, deals you're bound to, oaths that hold you till you die.

Every one of the thirteen vows ends the same way: ***"...we deceive the Tathāgata."*** If you break the vow, you're lying to the Buddha's face. That's the weight.

### The Thirteen Vows Are Radical

They demand:
- Bow six times daily to bodhisattvas
- Flee conflict by a hundred yojanas (hundreds of miles)
- Speak NO unpleasant word (not even one)
- Never exalt yourself or tear down others
- Give up kingdom, wealth, body, and life for this vow

This is extreme humility as practice. This is "going down low" enacted as daily life.

### Power Without Patience Is Dangerous

The Kṣitigarbha prayer is striking: learned beings pray NOT to become kings, ministers, or leaders until they have patience. Why? Because **power without patience damages Buddha's teaching**.

This is the Blues wisdom of knowing your limits. Don't reach for authority till you're ready to handle it. Stay small till you're strong enough for big.

### The Maitreya Praise: Why You Bow to Bodhicitta

The Gaṇḍavyūha passage explains why we reverence bodhicitta-holders. They're:
- Carrying the **Buddha-embryo** in their hearts
- Lighting the **Dharma-lamp** in the darkness
- Wielding the **knowledge-vajra** that shatters suffering's wheel
- Launching the **Dharma-boat** to peace-jewel island

That person you're about to judge? They might be carrying the next Buddha. So bow. Don't search for faults.

### Six Delights to Avoid

| Delight | Sanskrit | What It Does | Antidote |
|:--------|:---------|:-------------|:---------|
| **Gain/Honor** | *lābhasatkāra* | 25 poisons, like Devadatta | Few desires |
| **Gatherings** | *saṃgaṇikārāma* | Excitement, gossip, hostility | Stay alone |
| **Talk** | *bhāṣyārāma* | 11 faults, like eating rind not juice | Shut up, contemplate meaning |
| **Sleep** | *nidrārāma* | Delusion-net, demons get in | Stay awake, cultivate vigor |
| **Work** | *karmārāma* | Anxiety, failed morality, like a donkey | Wisdom-work, not busy-work |
| **Elaboration** | *prapañcārāma* | Conflict, unfavorable states, hell nearby | Go 100 yojanas away |

### Wisdom-Work vs. Service-Work

The Buddha is blunt:

> *"If a service-delighting bodhisattva filled the universe with seven-jewel stūpas, I wouldn't be pleased."*

Why? Because **busy-work ain't the work. Wisdom-work is the work.**

Service-bodhisattvas should serve study-bodhisattvas.
Study-bodhisattvas should serve reflection-bodhisattvas.

The hierarchy is clear: reflection > study > service. The higher you go, the quieter it gets. Stop doing. Start knowing.

### The Root Verse (Kārikā 7): Avoid All Fruitless Activity

"By what is this attained? By avoidance of all fruitless activity."

**Fruit = benefit to others.**

If it doesn't serve others, it's fruitless. Cut it out.

Don't wave your hands around. Don't run and jump. Don't do bodily agitation. Be still. Be restrained.

### Crackless Mind

The Gaganagañja Sūtra's final image: **Wind enters through cracks. Māra enters through cracks.**

If there's a crack in your mind—a weakness, an opening, a loose spot—that's where the devil gets in.

**Seal it up.**
**Keep The Vow.**
**No cracks.**
