## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

*The fifth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on how to avoid harm within the context of moral perfection—through vows, reverence for bodhisattvas, avoidance of gain-seeking, and renunciation of fruitless activities.*

---

## Introduction

Harm has been stated in brief [in the previous chapter].¹ Its avoidance is as follows.

---

## Part I: The Vows of Harm-Avoidance

As stated in the Adhyāśayasaṃcodanasūtra:²

> "Beginner bodhisattvas, fearing the hearing of such harms, should do just as they have undertaken. For thus have they spoken:
>
> 'We, O Blessed One, from this day forward, make the following undertaking before the Tathāgata:
>
> **Vow 1:** If we, from this day forward, should accuse a bodhisattva-vehicle person—whether householder or renunciant—of an offense, whether truly or falsely, we would deceive the Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyaksaṃbuddha.
>
> **Vow 2:** If we, from this day forward, should disdain a bodhisattva-vehicle person and speak ill of him, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 3:** If we, seeing a bodhisattva-vehicle person—whether householder or renunciant—playing with, enjoying the five strands of sensual pleasure, should generate disaffection, or generate vexation of mind, or generate disrespect, or not generate the perception of Teacher toward him, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 4:** If we, from this day forward, due to patronage-families or alms-families, should create bodily or mental affliction for bodhisattva-vehicle persons, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 5:** If we, from this day forward, seeing a bodhisattva-vehicle person, should address him with even one unpleasant word, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 6:** If we, from this day forward, should not bow to a bodhisattva-vehicle person three times at night and three times during the day, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 7:** If we, from this day forward, should not give up kingdom, wealth, or body and life for the sake of this vow-undertaking, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 8:** If we, from this day forward, should disdain a Śrāvaka-vehicle or Pratyekabuddha-vehicle person [thinking] "we are more distinguished, not they," we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 9:** If we, O Blessed One, should not dwell with lowly minds, with minds like outcastes, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 10:** If we, from this day forward, should exalt ourselves or disparage others, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 11:** If we, from this day forward, should not flee a yojana or a hundred yojanas from fear of hatred and conflict, being driven, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 12:** If we, from this day forward, should proclaim ourselves as moral, or as learned, or as endowed with ascetic practices, or should display ourselves with one or another quality, we would deceive the Tathāgata.
>
> **Vow 13:** If we, from this day forward, should not dwell with concealed good and revealed evil, we would deceive the Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyaksaṃbuddha...'"
>
> There the Blessed One addressed Maitreya the bodhisattva mahāsattva: "By a son of good family or daughter of good family wishing to exhaust karma-obstruction, O Maitreya, such an undertaking should be made, just as it has been made by these sons of good family."

---

## Part II: Reverence for All Bodhisattvas

In the Sarvadharmāpravṛttinirdeśa it is also stated:³

> *Three times at night and three times during the day,*
> *he should bow to bodhisattvas with his head.*
>
> *He should not search for any fault of theirs;*
> *let them practice their conduct as they wish.*
>
> *When he sees [one] delighting in sensual pleasures,*
> *he should not search for any fault of his.*
>
> *With infinite qualities, that excellent bodhisattva practice—*
> *even this one, in time, will touch it.*
>
> *By gradual reasoning, by gradual action,*
> *one does not become a Victor by a single word.*
>
> *Many koṭis and niyutas of kalpas—*
> *he who has set out with armor does not become otherwise.*

And here it is also stated:

> "Those sons of good family who are free from such karma-obstruction should not find fault with any conduct of another bodhisattva. All his actions should be released. The thought should be generated thus: 'I do not know another's mind. The conduct of beings is hard to know.'
>
> And seeing this very point, the Tathāgata teaches this Dharma: 'A person should not be measured by [another] person. Either I would measure a person, or one who would be like me.'
>
> By one, O son of good family, wishing to protect himself, no one's conduct should be discriminated. No disparagement of others should be made: 'This one is like this, that one is like that.' One should be devoted to the Buddha-dharma, day and night, with a mind grasping the Dharma."

---

## Part III: The Kṣitigarbha Vows

In the Kṣitigarbhasūtra too it is stated:⁴

> Then at that very time, many hundreds of thousands of learned beings, rising from their seats, joining palms toward the Blessed One, spoke thus:
>
> "We, O Venerable Blessed One, make this aspiration before the Blessed One:
>
> 'For as long as we wander in saṃsāra—having obtained even a little patience—may we NOT obtain the station of a king, may we NOT obtain the station of a minister, may we NOT obtain the station of a town-elder, may we NOT obtain the station of a village-elder, may we NOT obtain the station of a regional-elder, may we NOT obtain the station of a chief-priest, may we NOT obtain the station of a general... may we NOT obtain any station as a leader over beings—until we have obtained patience.
>
> For from such [stations], we might create such extremely heinous karma as to damage the teaching of the Buddhas...'"

---

## Part IV: The Candrapradīpa Verses

In the Candrapradīpasūtra too, avoidance of harm is stated:⁵

> *"There is no evil that will not be done by them, O Kumāra, in the future evil time.*
> *Do not have intimacy with them, O Kāli, in the last [age].*
>
> *If you should speak or converse, you would create disrespect toward them.*
> *Unshrunken, you should honor [them], due to their not-yet-awakening.*
>
> *Having asked about the number of rains [ordination seniority], whoever is your elder—*
> *create respect there, bowing at his feet with your head.*
>
> *Do not see any fault in those who behold the seat of enlightenment.*
> *Do not generate opposition; always be of loving mind.*
>
> *If you see a fault in them, do not proclaim their faults.*
> *Whatever karma one does, such fruit one will obtain.*
>
> *With a smiling moon-face, toward elders and newcomers,*
> *be always the first to speak, with pride destroyed, patient.*
>
> *With robes and alms-food, make assistance for them.*
> *Thus place your mind: "All will become Leaders."'"

---

## Part V: Praise of Bodhicitta

For one in whom reverence and faith do not arise toward one who has generated bodhicitta, for the sake of protecting oneself from falling into bad destinies, for the sake of experiencing joy in seen and unseen [matters], for the sake of clarifying one's own murky mind, for the sake of obtaining pliancy and workability of mind—one should meditate on the qualities of one who has generated bodhicitta, as the noble Maitreya displayed to the noble Sudhana in the Āryagaṇḍavyūha:⁶

> *He, having seen beings afflicted by old age and disease,*
> *assailed by hundreds of sufferings,*
> *tormented by the fear and grief of birth and death—*
> *for their sake he practices, with a mind of compassion.*
>
> *Having seen the world tormented by the machine of suffering*
> *in the wheel-turn of the five destinies,*
> *he [seeks] that firm knowledge-vajra,*
> *the shattering of the machine-wheel of suffering.*
>
> *Having seen the field of beings with the thorns, splinters, and prickles of desire and hatred,*
> *entangled in the dense undergrowth of views and attachments,*
> *seeking to purify the field of beings,*
> *he firmly seeks the plough of wisdom.*
>
> *The world, with its jungle of delusion and ignorance,*
> *with wisdom-eye destroyed, without a guide—*
> *He will become a lord, a guide showing safety,*
> *a caravan-leader for the world.*
>
> *Wearing the armor of patience, mounted on the three liberations,*
> *with the sword of knowledge, vanquishing the enemy afflictions,*
> *having become a hero, a giver of fearlessness—*
> *he will become a guide for the world.*
>
> *He launches the Dharma-boat,*
> *well-trained in the path of the knowledge-ocean,*
> *a leader to the peace-jewel's excellent island—*
> *he is a helmsman in the triple ocean.*
>
> *He, with the disk of knowledge-rays and aspiration,*
> *illuminating all being-worlds,*
> *rising from the ocean of the dharma-realm sky—*
> *he is proclaimed as the Buddha-sun.*
>
> *Cool as sandalwood of loving-kindness,*
> *of equal, benevolent mind toward all beings,*
> *with the full disk of white dharmas—*
> *he is proclaimed as the Buddha-moon.*
>
> *Established on a firm foundation of aspiration,*
> *having gradually risen in bodhisattva practice,*
> *a mine of all dharma-jewels—*
> *he will become the supreme knowledge-ocean.*
>
> *Born from the nāga-king of bodhicitta,*
> *risen in the sky of the dharma-realm,*
> *raining Dharma-clouds simultaneously,*
> *increasing all white-fruit harvests.*
>
> *The lamp-wick of faith, destroying the darkness of the three stains,*
> *a firm vessel of loving-kindness, oil, and mindfulness,*
> *bright with the stainless fire of bodhicitta—*
> *he will light the Dharma-lamp.*
>
> *Bodhicitta is the embryonic mass, compassion is the membrane,*
> *loving-kindness is the flesh, [with] immovable, firm aspiration,*
> *limbs of awakening gradually arising—*
> *this Buddha-embryo increases.*
>
> *He will increase the womb of merit,*
> *he will purify the womb of wisdom,*
> *he is proclaimed as the womb of knowledge—*
> *one born from the womb of aspiration.*
>
> *Such ones, armored with compassion and loving-kindness,*
> *with minds intent on liberating beings, with benevolent intent—*
> *rare in the world with its gods and humans—*
> *such as this one, with purified mind.*
>
> *Established in such a root of aspiration,*
> *increased in such firm exertion,*
> *such a one, with light covering the three realms—*
> *the knowledge-tree bearing fruit is extremely rare.*
>
> *He, seeking the arising of all qualities,*
> *seeking to question all dharmas,*
> *seeking to split all doubts—*
> *he serves all friends, untiring.*
>
> *He is the subduer of Māra, the Kali-age [destroyer], and afflictions,*
> *he is the purifier of the stains of views and craving,*
> *he is the one intent on liberating the entire world—*
> *he is always your distinguished sage.*
>
> *He will purify the bad destinies,*
> *he will display the path to heaven,*
> *he will lead the world to the path of liberation—*
> *such a one, established in the path of qualities.*
>
> *He is the liberator from suffering in all destinies,*
> *he is the giver of happiness in all destinies,*
> *he is the cutter of the snares of all becomings—*
> *he will become the destroyer of the courses of becoming."*

## Part VI: Four Dharmas of Harm-Avoidance

By this meditation, avoidance of harm becomes easy to accomplish.⁷

In the Adhyāśayasaṃcodanasūtra too, avoidance of harm is stated:

> "By four dharmas, O Maitreya, a bodhisattva-vehicle person, in the last five hundred [years] when the true Dharma is being lost, will be liberated unharmed, uninjured, safely. By which four?
>
> 1. By examining one's own faults
> 2. By not accusing other bodhisattva-vehicle persons of offenses
> 3. By not looking at patronage-families and alms-families
> 4. By refraining from heedless speech
>
> By another four:
>
> 1. By avoiding beings of little learning
> 2. By not taking up assemblies [i.e., not building a following]
> 3. By dwelling in border lodging-places
> 4. By being devoted to the practice of self-discipline and tranquility"

---

## Part VII: Dangers of Gain and Honor

And here it is also stated:⁸

> "A beginner bodhisattva who has attained the power of wisdom, O Maitreya, should be one who has avoided gain and honor, seeing the danger in gain and honor.
>
> One should be free from delight in gatherings, seeing the danger in delight in gatherings.
>
> One should be free from delight in talk, seeing the danger in delight in talk.
>
> One should be free from delight in sleep, seeing the danger in delight in sleep.
>
> One should be free from delight in work, seeing the danger in delight in work.
>
> One should be free from delight in elaboration, seeing the danger in delight in elaboration...
>
> Here, O Maitreya, gain and honor should be examined by the bodhisattva mahāsattva as:
>
> - Generating desire (*rāgasaṃjanana*)
> - Destroying mindfulness (*smṛtividhvaṃsanakara*)
> - Causing rising and falling by gain and non-gain (*lābhālābhatayā unnāmāvanāmakara*)
> - Generating delusion (*mohotpādana*)
> - Resolving on stinginess toward families (*kulamātsaryādhyavasāna*)
> - Generating deceit for the sake of accomplishing one's own aims (*ātmārthaniṣpādanatayā śāṭhayotpādana*)
> - Avoiding the four noble lineages, generating shamelessness (*caturāryavaṃśaparivarjanatayā āhīkyānapatrāpyasaṃjanana*)
> - Not approved by all Buddhas (*sarvabuddhānanujñāna*)
> - Generating pride and intoxication (*mānamadotpādana*)
> - Disdaining teachers (*gurūṇāmavamānana*)
> - The side of Māra (*mārapakṣa*)
> - The sole root of heedlessness, stealing roots of virtue (*ekāntapramādamūlaḥ kuśalamūlāpaharaṇa*)
> - Like lightning, a wheel, a thunderbolt (*vidyucakrāśanisadṛśa*)
> - Polluted by many obstacles, looking at patronage-families and alms-families, generating depression (*daurmanasyasaṃjanana*)
> - Confusing the intellect (*buddhivibhrāmaṇa*)
> - Becoming a vessel for grief due to transformation of pleasant things (*priyavastupariṇāmanatayā śokabhājana*)
> - Stealing the four foundations of mindfulness, weakening white dharmas (*catuḥsmṛtyupasthānasaṃbhoṣaṇaḥ śukladharmadurbalīkaraṇa*)
> - Causing loss of the four right exertions (*catuḥsamyakprahāṇaparihāṇakaraṇa*)
> - Causing loss of supernormal powers and higher knowledges (*ṛddhyabhijñāparihāṇakaraṇa*)
> - Creating disrespect after prior respect (*pūrva satkārapaścādasatkārakaraṇa*)
> - Honoring enemies, abandoning friends (*amitrasatkaraṇamitraprahāṇa*)
> - Like a courtesan, through seeking connection with others (*parābhisaṃdhānatayā gaṇikāsadṛśa*)
> - Avoiding dhyānas and immeasurables (*dhyānāpramāṇaparivarjana*)
> - Casting into hell, animal births, and the world of Yama (*narakatiryagyoniyamalokaprapātana*)
> - Like the conduct of Devadatta and Udraka (*devadattodrakasamācāra*)"

## Part VIII: The Benefits of Few Desires

> "Such, O Maitreya, are the dangers in gain and honor that should be examined by the bodhisattva. Having examined them, one should delight in few desires (*alpecchatā*), not be tormented.
>
> Why is that? For one of few desires, O Maitreya, such faults do not arise, nor do obstructions to Buddha-dharmas arise.
>
> He is not disgusted with householders and renounciants.
> He is to be protected by gods and humans, established in pure intention.
> He is unafraid of falling into any bad destiny.
> He is unshaken, having transcended threats.
> He is unmoved, freed from the domain of Māra.
> He is unassailable by all calamities.
> He is sought after by gods and humans, established in the practice of dhyāna.
> He is clear, having abandoned deceit and guile.
> He is unheedless, seeing the danger in the five strands of sensual pleasure.
> He is one who practices as he speaks, established in the noble lineage.
> He is sought after by learned fellow-practitioners.
>
> Knowing such benefits, O Maitreya, a wise bodhisattva should delight in few desires with full intention. Few desires should be cultivated for the sake of abandoning all gain and honor."

## Part IX: Dangers of Delight in Gatherings

Regarding delight in gatherings:⁹

> *"Having abandoned desire, having abandoned hatred—the yogī does not dwell among gatherings.*
> *He becomes inclined in that direction, bending that way—by this fault one should not delight [in them].*
>
> *Excitement, laughter, and thoughts—all of these arise among gatherings.*
> *Of mixed behavior he becomes, unrestrained, who does gatherings that are without essence.*
>
> *Fools delight in worldly mantras [gossip]; fools diminish in foremost talk [Dharma].*
> *They increase hostility, thoughts of excess—by this fault one does not shine there.*
>
> *The monk does not increase in learning, having generated delight in improper mantras.*
> *Therefore, abandoning improper mantras, may you always find delight in Dharma.*
>
> *Thousands of my own bones have I abandoned, aspiring to enlightenment.*
> *I am not satisfied [even now] hearing the Dharma; they become weary hearing the Dharma.*
>
> *Entirely to be avoided are improper mantras and undisciplined mantras.*
> *Generate delight there in the excellent Dharma, which is hard to obtain in many hundreds of kalpas.*
>
> *For one dwelling in the forest, seeking qualities, the faults of others are not to be observed.*
> *"I am distinguished, I alone am best"—such a thought should not be taken up.*
>
> *This is pride, the root of all heedlessness; inferior monks are not to be disdained.*
> *This is gradual in this teaching; one does not attain enlightenment in a single birth."*

---

## Part X: Dangers of Delight in Talk

Regarding delight in talk:¹⁰

> *"He becomes disrespectful, intoxicated with learning, dwelling in disputatious mantras.*
> *With stolen mindfulness, without clear comprehension—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *He becomes far from inner contemplation; neither mind nor body are peaceful.*
> *He goes through many risings and fallings—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *Destroyed in the mind of true Dharma, the fool becomes very harsh, with unlubricated mind.*
> *Far from insight and calm—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *He becomes always disrespectful to teachers, generating delight in polluting mantras.*
> *Standing in what is without essence, with wisdom destroyed—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *He becomes not honored by hosts of gods, they do not generate aspiration for him.*
> *He becomes deficient in analytical knowledge—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *He is criticized by wise men—whoever is an individual witness.*
> *His life becomes pointless—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *He grieves when the fool does—"I am without practice, what should I do now?"*
> *He becomes very miserable, without obtaining firm ground—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *He becomes unsteady, like a straw stirred [by wind]; that one doubts, no great doubt.*
> *He never has firm understanding—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *Like an actor standing on stage, he speaks of the qualities of other heroes,*
> *but he himself is without practice—these are the faults of one delighting in talk.*
>
> *He becomes deceitful, fickle, hopeless; again and again he resorts to dispute.*
> *He becomes far from the noble Dharma—these are the faults of one delighting in talk...*
>
> *Having delighted in talk for a long time, one does not find the bliss of self-joy here.*
> *Better indeed is contemplation on a single quarter-verse, where one may obtain infinite bliss in [that] quarter-verse.*
>
> *There is nothing whatsoever of essence in the rind of sugarcane; in the middle is that essence, most delightful.*
> *Having eaten the rind, then one cannot here again obtain the superior sugarcane-juice.*
>
> *Just as the rind—so understand talk; just as the juice—so is contemplation on meaning here.*
> *Therefore, having abandoned delight in talk, may you always contemplate meaning, unheeding."*

---

## Part XI: Dangers of Delight in Sleep

Regarding delight in sleep:¹¹

> *"He increases a great net of delusion; he becomes doubtful, grasping views.*
> *Many views arise for him who does not proceed to delight in torpor [but wrongly]...*
>
> *His wisdom becomes very weak, his understanding diminishes and is not his.*
> *He is always diminished in knowledge, who does not proceed to delight in torpor...*
>
> *Lazy, unknowing, slothful, unwise—non-human beings obtain access to him.*
> *They harass him dwelling in the forest, who does not proceed to delight in torpor...*
>
> *Uninterested in wholesome mind always, he has no desire for Dharma.*
> *He becomes more and more desirous of non-dharma, who does not proceed to delight in torpor...*
>
> *Confused, bereft of desire for true Dharma, the fool is diminished in all qualities.*
> *His white [virtue] goes and he attains darkness, who does not proceed to delight in torpor...*
>
> *He becomes lacking in skill, with a withdrawn mind; he never has constant joy.*
> *Overcome by sleep, with slack limbs—who does not proceed to delight in torpor...*
>
> *Having known that the self is reached by laziness, he envies those endowed with the power of vigor.*
> *He speaks ill of those endowed with vigor, who does not proceed to delight in torpor...*
>
> *That which destroys all suffering and darkness, which is the root for avoiding bad destinies,*
> *always praised by all Buddhas—cultivate always that noble vigor."*

---

## Part XII: Dangers of Delight in Work

Regarding delight in work:¹²

> *"He becomes hard to admonish when urged by teachers, he does not take instruction right-handedly.*
> *He quickly becomes one of failed morality—these are the faults of one delighting in work.*
>
> *He is always anxious, always thinking of householder-tasks.*
> *He has nothing to do with dhyāna-abandonment—these are the faults of one delighting in work.*
>
> *Intense desire arises in him for tastes and non-tastes; seized, he is infatuated.*
> *He is not satisfied with one thing or another—these are the faults of one delighting in work.*
>
> *He is pleased with a large assembly; he becomes miserable when deprived of it.*
> *He becomes mixed, like a donkey here—these are the faults of one delighting in work...*
>
> *Day and night, with mind on nothing else, he is constantly [thinking] about food and robes.*
> *He is always interested in his own aims with all qualities—these are the faults of one delighting in work.*
>
> *He asks about worldly tasks and proceeds to delight in improper mantras.*
> *He does not find delight in proper mantras—these are the faults of one delighting in work..."*

Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya said to the Blessed One: "Those bodhisattvas, O Blessed One, will be of very little wisdom, of diminished wisdom, who, having avoided foremost dharmas, will take up inferior works."

Thus addressed, the Blessed One said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya: "So it is, Maitreya, so it is, as you say... But I tell you, Maitreya, I declare to you: Those bodhisattvas are not gone forth in the Tathāgata's teaching who have no yoga, no dhyāna, no abandonment, no study, no search for learning.

But, O Maitreya, the Tathāgata's teaching is empowered by dhyāna and abandonment, constructed by knowledge, established by knowledge, empowered by application—not empowered by householder-work, service, and drudgery...

This is the work of those unyoked to yoga, who delight in saṃsāra—namely, service, pollution by worldly tasks. The bodhisattva should not generate aspiration for that...

If, O Maitreya, a service-delighting bodhisattva should fill this three-thousand great thousand world-system with stūpas made of the seven jewels, I would not be pleased by him, not honored, not respected...

There, Jambudvīpa should be filled with service-doing bodhisattvas. All of them should do attendance and service for one bodhisattva devoted to recitation and study. And by Jambudvīpa-sized [numbers of] bodhisattvas devoted to recitation and study, attendance and service should be done for one bodhisattva devoted to reflection...

Why is that? This is difficult work—namely, wisdom-work, superior, unsurpassed, distinguished above the whole triple world, transcendent. Therefore, O Maitreya, by a bodhisattva seeking yoga, wishing to undertake vigor, wisdom should be engaged in."

---

## Part XIII: Dangers of Delight in Elaboration

Regarding delight in elaboration (*prapañcārāma*):¹³

> *"The eight unfavorable states (*akṣaṇa*) are not far from him; the excellence of favorable moment (*kṣaṇasaṃpad*) is not supreme for him.*
> *These harms arise for him always—these are the faults of one going about in elaboration...*
>
> *Having properly understood these faults, the wise one should avoid all elaborations.*
> *Harms are easy for one going about in elaboration; therefore, one should not cohabit with elaboration.*
>
> *Go a hundred yojanas—that is better—wherever there is elaboration or conflict.*
> *Do not make a dwelling there, not a residence, not even for a moment where there is affliction.*
>
> *Those who have gone forth are not interested in wealth, they are interested in qualities; do not create conflict with evil minds.*
> *You have no field, no agriculture, no commerce—for whose sake are these elaborations?*
>
> *You have no son, no daughter, no wife; no friend, no band of relatives.*
> *You have no female servants, no male servants, no lordship—do not create conflict, having gone forth.*
>
> *Having taken the dyed robes with faith—they are cultivated by the peaceful and very peaceful.*
> *Be peaceful and very peaceful, tranquil! Having avoided elaboration, generate patience.*
>
> *Guard against poisonous snakes with fierce minds, and hells and animal realms and Yama's domain—*
> *they are not far from one going about in elaboration; therefore, generate vigor in patience...*
>
> *By this yoga one obtains purity, having exhausted karma-obstruction without remainder.*
> *He opposes Māra with army and vehicle—whoever, the wise one, generates patience for that."*

## Part XIV: The Root Verse

In brief, avoidance of harm is stated thus:¹⁴

> **By what is this attained? By avoidance of all fruitless activity.** (Kārikā 7)

"By what is this attained?" By avoidance of all fruitless activity (*sarvaniṣphalaspandavarjana*). The fruit here is for the sake of others. Whatever activity does not conduce to that—being fruitless—is to be avoided.

As the Candrapradīpasūtra teaches regarding bodily restraint:

> "He is not one whose hands are restless, not one whose feet are restless; restrained in hands and feet..."

And in the Daśadharmakasūtra too it is taught:

> "Waving the hands, waving the feet, running, running about, jumping, leaping—this is called bodily agitation."

---

## Part XV: All Action for Beings' Sake

In the Āryādharmasaṃgītisūtra, how for bodhisattvas no action other than for others' sake is appropriate, is clearly illuminated:¹⁵

> "Whatever bodily action, O Blessed One, of bodhisattvas; whatever verbal action; whatever mental action—all of that proceeds with observation of beings, with great compassion as chief, with the aim of establishing beings' welfare, proceeding with the intention of welfare and happiness for all beings.
>
> He, with such benevolent intention, with such perception, [thinks]: 'That practice should be practiced by me which brings welfare and happiness to all beings...'
>
> The practice is observation of sense-bases like an empty village. And he does not aspire to abandonment of sense-bases."

In the Āryagaganagañjasūtra it is also stated:¹⁶

> "Just as wind enters through a crack, so from wherever there is a crack in the mind, from there Māra obtains access. Therefore, the bodhisattva should always be of crackless mind. That cracklessness of mind is the fulfillment of the emptiness of all-aspect knowledge."

---

*Thus ends the Fifth Chapter, Avoidance of Harm in the Perfection of Morality, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*
