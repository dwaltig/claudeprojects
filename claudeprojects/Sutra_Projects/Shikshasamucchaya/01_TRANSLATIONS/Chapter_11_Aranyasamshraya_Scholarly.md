# Chapter Eleven: The Exposition of Dwelling in the Wilderness (*Araṇyasaṃvarṇana*)

## [The Call to the Wilderness]

Now, it is established that one who has heard the Dharma, having contemplated the faults of household life according to the instruction given in the *Ugradattaparipṛcchā*, should resort to the forest in order to purify his mind.[^1] And thus it is stated in the *Candrapradīpasūtra*:

> "Never indeed, indulging in desires, having generated craving for sons and wives, and having dwelt in a house, which is despicable, will he attain the supreme enlightenment.
> Those who abandon desires like a pit of fire, having generated craving for sons and wives, and, terrified, depart from the house—for them this supreme enlightenment is not difficult to obtain.
> No Buddha existed in the past, nor will one arise in the future, who, remaining [at home], attained this supreme, highest enlightenment.
> Having abandoned a kingdom like a lump of phlegm, let him dwell in the forests, desiring seclusion (*viveka*). Having abandoned the defilements, having crushed pride, they awaken to the stainless, unconditioned enlightenment." ... [*peyālaṃ*]
> "The best of men, the Jinas, are not served with food, drink, robes, flowers, perfumes, and unguents as they are when, having gone forth, they practice the Dharma.
> And he who, longing for enlightenment, is wearied of the evil constructions [of the world] for the sake of beings, should take seven steps toward the forest; he then becomes distinguished by merit."

If, however, due to affection for beings of similar disposition, or due to desire for an assembly, or due to desire for gain, etc., he should delay in entering seclusion, for that purpose it is stated here:

> "The wise do not quarrel with fools; having honored fools, they avoid them.
> The wise do not serve fools, knowing the natural continuity of fools (*bālāna svabhāvasaṃtatim*).
> However long one may serve a fool, they again become like enemies.
> The wise do not trust fools here, knowing the natural continuity of fools.
> Fools are broken by nature (*svabhāvabhinnā*); where is there a friend for ordinary people?
> Spoken to with righteous words, they manifest anger, hatred, and disbelief; pure ones (*vijñā*) knowing this meaning, do not trust fools.
> Fools match with fools, just as impurity with impurity;
> But the wise match with the wise, just as ghee with the cream of ghee."

And thus it is said again here:

> "Happy always are those men in the world for whom there is no beloved or unloved anywhere.
> And those who do not delight in caves experience the great happiness of the ascetic life (*śrāmaṇakaṃ susukhaṃ*).
> For whom there is no 'mine' anywhere, for whom there is no possession at all,
> They wander the world like a rhinoceros (*khaṅgasamā*), just as the wind wanders in the sky.[^2]
> Happy indeed would be those men in the world whose mind does not stick to the world.
> Their mind is always like the wind, and no attachment to beloved or unloved is found.
> For those to whom living with the suffering is unpleasant, and separation from the suffering is pleasant—
> Abandoning these two extremes, happy are those men who delight in the Dharma."

Again it is said here:

> "He is constantly yoked to few duties (*alpakṛtyayogī*), having avoided all extensive qualities and faults.
> He never disputes, being yoked to the yoke (*yuktayogī*); these qualities become his in forest-dwelling.
> He is always weary of the conditioned (*saṃskṛta*); he has no desire anywhere in the world.
> And there is no increase of inflows (*āsravas*) for him; living in the forest, these are his benefits.
> No dispute (*adhikaraṇa*) ever arises for him; always delighting in peace, walking in seclusion.
> Restrained in speech, mind, and body, many qualities become his in forest-dwelling.
> And liberation (*mokṣa*) becomes favorable for him; he quickly penetrates the peaceful resolve (*adhimukti*).
> Cultivating the resolve of wandering in the forest, all these qualities become his, the forest-dweller."

He says again:

> "Resort to forest thickets (*vanaṣaṇḍa*), always secluded, having abandoned going to villages and towns.
> Be without a second, like a rhinoceros, always; before long you will obtain the supreme samādhi."

In the *Ārya-Rāṣṭrapālasūtra* it is also said:

> "Having abandoned the home, a thicket of endless faults, always regardless of anxiety,
> They obtain delight in the wilderness, virtuous, with peaceful senses, gentle.
> No enjoyment of women or men is found anywhere for them;
> They dwell alone (*ekākī*), like a rhinoceros, with pure intentions, stainless.
> They are not thrilled by gains, nor do they cower at lack of gain in their own mind;
> Of few desires, satisfied with whatever comes, free from deceit and hypocrisy."

In the *Ugradattaparipṛcchā* it is also said: "Association with beings is not to be done by me, for I should not generate the roots of virtue of a single being," etc.

If, however, a learned one (*śrutavān*), having obtained this perfection of the moment (*kṣaṇasaṃpad*), attached to gain and the like, should not purify his mind, he alone in the world with its gods would be deceived. For it is said in the *Ārya-Ratnakūṭa*:

> "Just as, Kāśyapa, a certain man, being carried away by a great flood of water, should die of thirst for water, just so, Kāśyapa, here some ascetics and brahmins, having grasped and mastered many Dharmas, do not dispel the thirst for passion, do not dispel the thirst for hatred, do not dispel the thirst for delusion. Being carried away by the great flood of Dharma, they die of the thirst for defilements and go to a bad destiny, a downfall."

Therefore, one must necessarily resort to the forest. And he should resort to such places where the alms-round is not too far and not too near, where waters are clear, pure, stainless, involving little trouble, and pleasant to use. And he should resort to such places that are endowed with trees, flowers, fruits, and leaves, free from dangerous beasts, endowed with caves and mountain slopes, pleasant to wander in, peaceful, and solitary (*advitīya*).

Dependent on those places, whatever he has previously recited, that he recites three times in the night and three times in the day—not with too high a voice, not too low, not with excited senses, not with a scattered mind—living on faith, supporting the text, grasping the signs, driving away torpor.

If a king, or a royal minister, or others—brahmins, kṣatriyas, citizens, or country folk—should approach the forest-dwelling monk, he should welcome them with respect. And he should speak to him thus: "Sit, O Great King, on the seat prepared." If he sits, he [the monk] should also sit. If he does not sit, neither should sit. If his senses are agitated, he should be calmed. "Those gains are well-gained by you, O Great King, in whose territory virtuous, qualified, learned ascetics and brahmins dwell, unmolested by thieves, soldiers, and the like."

If he is steady, disciplined, with peaceful senses, and capable of Dharma teaching, then a varied Dharma teaching should be offered to him. If he does not like the varied one, a Dharma teaching conducive to agitation (*saṃvega*) should be offered. If he does not like the one conducive to agitation, the lofty greatnesses of the Tathāgata should be taught. Suitable actions should also be offered to brahmins, kṣatriyas, citizens, and country folk who approach. Being thus learned, he becomes capable of propitiating the mind of the hearers of Dharma. And those beings obtain joy, faith, and gladness in his presence.

In the *Ugradattaparipṛcchā* it is also said: "Furthermore, O householder, a bodhisattva who has gone forth and dwells in the forest should examine thus: 'For what purpose do I dwell in the forest? One does not become an ascetic merely by forest-dwelling. Even many untamed, undisciplined, unyoked, unexerting ones dwell here—namely, herds of deer, monkeys, birds, thieves, and caṇḍālas dwell here. And they are not endowed with the qualities of an ascetic. But rather, that purpose for which I dwell in the forest, that purpose must be fulfilled by me—namely, the purpose of asceticism (*śrāmaṇyārtha*).'" ... [*peyālaṃ*]

"Furthermore, O householder, a bodhisattva who has gone forth and dwells in the forest should examine thus: 'For what purpose have I come to the forest?' He should investigate thus: 'I have come to the forest terrified by fear. Terrified by fear of what? Terrified by the fear of society (*saṃgaṇikā*). Terrified by the fear of association, by the fear of lust, hatred, and delusion... by the fear of pride, intoxication, and hypocrisy... by the fear of greed, jealousy, and miserliness... by the fear of form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Terrified by the fear of I-making and mine-making (*ahaṃkāramamakāra*)... by the fear of restlessness and doubt... by the fear of the Māra of the aggregates (*skandhamāra*)... the Māra of defilements (*kleśamāra*)... the Māra of death... the Māra of the sons of gods. Terrified by the fear of the perversion of permanence in the impermanent... self in the non-self... purity in the impure... happiness in suffering. Terrified by the fear of mind, thought, and consciousness... by the fear of hindrances, obstructions, and outbursts... by the fear of the view of the transitory collection (*satkāyadṛṣṭi*)... by the fear of bad friends... by the fear of gain and honor... by the fear of untimely counsel... by the fear of 'seen' in the unseen, 'heard' in the unheard, 'thought' in the unthought, 'known' in the unknown... by the fear of the intoxication of asceticism in the non-ascetic... by the fear of mutual hatred... by the fear of the desire realm, form realm, and formless realm... by the fear of rebirth in all states of existence... by the fear of the realms of hell, animals, and the world of the fathers. Simply put, terrified by the fear of all unwholesome mental engagements. Terrified by these fears and terrors of such a kind, I have resorted to forest-dwelling.'"

... [*peyālaṃ*] "Furthermore, O householder, a bodhisattva standing in forest-dwelling, terrified or frightened, should train thus: 'Whatever fears arise, all of them arise from grasping at a self (*ātmagrāha*).' ... [*peyālaṃ*] 'If, while dwelling in the forest, I should not abandon self-grasping, self-adherence, self-possession, self-cause, self-thirst, self-perception, self-view-appropriation, self-view, self-basis, self-imagination, self-protection—my forest-dwelling would be meaningless. But rather, O householder, there is no forest-dwelling for one who perceives a self, no forest-dwelling for one who perceives an other.' ... [*peyālaṃ*] 'Forest-dwelling, O householder, is called the dwelling of non-arising in all dharmas, the dwelling of non-attachment in all dharmas.' ...

Just as, O householder, in the forest, grass, shrubs, herbs, and trees dwelling there do not fear, are not terrified, do not tremble, do not fall into terror, just so, O householder, a bodhisattva who has gone forth and dwells in the forest should produce a body of perception similar to grass, shrubs, herbs, trees, sticks, and walls—similar to a reflection of oneself. He should produce a mind equal to an illusion (*māyā*). Who fears here? Who trembles in this? By him, terrified or frightened, the body should be examined wisely thus: 'There is no self, or being, or life, or soul, or person, or human in this body. This is a false imagination (*abhūtaparikalpa*), namely, fear. That false imagination should not be imagined by me.' By him, knowing that just as grass, shrubs, herbs, and trees dwell in the forest without 'mine', without possession, just so, without 'mine', without possession, the forest is just all dharmas—knowing this, having attained it, he should dwell. For what reason? Forest-dwelling is the cutting of conflict (*raṇaccheda*), without 'mine', without possession."

... [*peyālaṃ*] "Furthermore, O householder, knowing 'Forest-dwelling is permitted by the Buddha,' one should dwell in the forest. For here the fulfillment of pure dharmas occurs. Having supported the roots of virtue, afterwards, having descended to villages, towns, markets, kingdoms, and capitals, I will teach the Dharma." ... [*peyālaṃ*] "If, however, O householder, the bodhisattva who has gone forth descends to a group for the sake of recitation or study, he should be respectful there, with deference to teachers and preceptors, to elder, middle, and new monks, acting rightfully, not lazy, acting himself, not annoying others. And he should not be one who values attendance. And he should examine thus: 'Even the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, worshipped by the world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmas, by the generation with its ascetics and brahmins, worthy of gifts from all beings—even he does not accept attendance from anyone; how much less we, untrained, wishing to train? Rather, we ourselves will become attendants for all beings. We ourselves will perform attendance and service for others, and we will not accept attendance and service from anyone. For what reason? For, O householder, the monk who is burdened with attendance loses the beneficial influence of virtuous qualities. And for those whom he supports, they think thus: "For the sake of attendance, he supports us."'"

He further says here: "If, O householder, a forest-dwelling Bodhisattva, desirous of hearing the Dharma, or wishing to see a teacher or preceptor, or inquiring after the sick, should come to a dwelling on the outskirts of a village, he should produce the thought of returning in the evening and of setting out [early]. If, however, his recitation or study is dependent on another, then, dwelling in the monastery, he should have a mind inclined to the forest. This itself is his forest-dwelling: the perception of all things as the forest and insatiety in the search for Dharma."

In the *Ārya-Ratnarāśisūtra* [Note: Source likely *Ratnarātri-sūtra* per text, but *Ratnarāśi* is a known text on this topic] it is also said: "If, while he is dwelling in that forest abode, as an ordinary person who has not attained the fruit, poisonous beasts should come, he should not produce fear or terror there. And he should produce this thought: 'Formerly, I have already renounced body and life; I have approached forest-dwelling. I should not be afraid here, not terrified; rather, having produced loving-kindness, I will avoid fault, I will remove fear. Even if, having done so, those poisonous beasts should deprive me of life and eat me, then I should produce this thought: "My gains are easily obtained, by which the essence will be taken from this essence-less body. But I am not able to satisfy these poisonous beasts with flesh. Having eaten my flesh, they will dwell experiencing pleasant contact."'"

... [*peyālaṃ*] "But if, while dwelling in that forest retreat, non-humans should approach—whether fair or foul in appearance—he should neither be drawn in nor repulsed by them. If deities who have seen Buddhas of the past should approach a forest-dwelling monk and ask him questions, then that forest-dweller should, according to his ability, his strength, and his realization of the Dharma, teach the Dharma to those deities. But if they ask very profound questions which that forest-dwelling monk is unable to answer, he should speak after manifesting a created form (*nirmāṇa*); he should not be disparaged for being unlearned. [He should think:] 'I will strive, I will exert myself in the Buddha’s teaching. There will come a time, an occasion, when, having heard and mastered the Dharma, I will be able to answer all questions. Meanwhile, may the inspiration for listening to the Dharma arise in you.'"

"Furthermore, dwelling in that forest retreat, one should take as an object of contemplation (*nimittaṃ grahītavyam*) the grasses, shrubs, herbs, and trees. How do these come to be? Just as these beings, which are ownerless (*asvāmikānām*), without a ‘mine’ (*amamānām*), without appropriation (*aparigrahāṇām*), thus motionless (*niśceṣṭānāṃ*) and inactive (*nirvyāpārāṇāṃ*), have production and dissolution, and yet there is no one who produces them or stops them, so too this body is like an apparition of grass, sticks, and a wall—ownerless, without a ‘mine’, without appropriation, motionless, and inactive. It arises due to the assemblage of causes and conditions, and ceases due to the deficiency of causes and conditions. Yet ultimately, no dharma whatsoever arises or ceases (*na punaratra kaściddharmaḥ paramārthata utpadyate vā nirudhyate*)."

Furthermore, it is said: "Dwelling in that forest retreat, one should produce this thought: 'Although I have come to the forest alone, without a companion, I have no companion who would accuse me of good or bad deeds. Yet, indeed, there are for me deities, Nāgas, Yakṣas, and Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, who know the intent of my mind. They are my witnesses (*sākṣiṇaḥ*). So I, dwelling here in the forest retreat, go under the power of an unwholesome mind ($akuśalacitta*). If I, having come so far, alone, without a second, unsupported, without 'mine', without possession, should think a thought of desire, or should think a thought of malice or violence, or should think another unwholesome thought, I would be no different from those beings delighting in association and society. And those deities, Nāgas, and Yakṣas would be deceived by me, and the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, would be unpropitiated."

*Thus ends the eleventh chapter, named "The Description of the Forest," in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*

### Critical Notes
[^1]: **Ugradattaparipṛcchā**: This sūtra is central to the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s treatment of the lay vs. monastic bodhisattva vocation. Here it establishes the premise: the household is full of faults (*gṛhadoṣa*).
[^2]: **Khaṅgasamā**: This echoes the famous refrain of the *Pratyekabuddha* vehicle ("wander alone like a rhinoceros"), but here it is integrated into the Bodhisattva path as a necessary phase of intensification.
