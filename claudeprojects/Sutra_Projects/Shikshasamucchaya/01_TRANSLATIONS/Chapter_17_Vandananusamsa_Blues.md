## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig

*The seventeenth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on the benefits of worship—why dropping a single flower on a shrine or just feeling good about someone else's grace pays out more than a billion dollars.*

## One Good Moment

You did the work. You said the prayers.
Now, what's the payoff?
The *Avalokana Sūtra* tells you about the Lucky Break.

> *"You dodge the eight bad births.*
> *You don't get born in hell.*
> *You don't get born as a ghost.*
> *You don't get born in a place with no internet and no Dharma.*
>
> *You get the One Golden Moment (*Ekakṣaṇa*).*
> *You meet the Boss.*
>
> *You come out looking good.*
> *Strong. Rich. Cannot be bullied.*
> *Why?*
> *Because you lit a lamp for the Lamp of the World."*


## Keep It to the Right

> *"You can talk for a million years,*
> *And you still couldn't list all the good stuff*
> *That happens to the man who walks the circle around the Stūpa.*
>
> *He never goes blind.*
> *He never goes lame.*
> *Not for a billion years.*
>
> *He gets tough. High stamina. Deep courage.*
> *He gets the Skill.*
> *All because he walked the circle with a waking-up mind."*


## Small Change, Big Return

You think you need a lot? No.
You just need faith.

### 1. A Handful of Flowers
> *"You take a handful of flowers.*
> *You throw them up in the air.*
> *'For the Boss.'*
> *Bam.*
> *You're a human with merit.*
> *You're standing in the protection zone."*

### 2. The Garland
> *"You hang a garland on the shrine.*
> *Next thing you know, you're born in the Thirty-Three Heavens.*
> *You got a divine swimming pool.*
> *You become the King."*

### 3. The Incense (Just a Pinch)
> *"Even a pinch of incense.*
> *Smaller than a mustard seed.*
> *If you burn it for the Bhagavan:*
> *You walk free from disease.*
> *You walk firm.*
> *Everybody loves you."*

### 4. Lamps (The Light)
> *"You light one candle.*
> *Just one.*
> *And nobody can measure your glory.*
> *You get the Eye.*
> *You see the light in a dark world."*


## Taking Out the Trash

> *"You see some old, withered flowers on the shrine?*
> *Take 'em off. Clean it up.*
> *What happens?*
> *You clean the agitation out of your heart.*
> *You wipe away the hate.*
> *You wipe away the disease.*
> *Infinite comfort."*


## The Oil in the Wick

Now the *Ratnarāśi Sūtra* tells you the secret.
It ain't about the stuff. It's about the **Mind**.

> *"Imagine the billionaires building shrines as big as mountains.*
> *Mount Everest made of gold.*
> *That's nice.*
>
> *But imagine a Bodhisattva—broke, homeless.*
> *He takes a little wick. Soaks it in oil.*
> *And lights it.*
> *But he has the **Mind of All-Knowledge**.*
> *He's doing it to save everyone.*
>
> *That little wick?*
> *It blows the mountain of gold away.*
> *It ain't even close."*


## Unimaginable Interest

And here is the ultimate hack.
**Rejoicing (*Anumodanā*).**

The *Prajñāpāramitā* says:
> *"Subhūti, imagine a guy works hard for a billion eons.*
> *Meditating. Sweating.*
>
> *Now imagine you see him.*
> *And you say:*
> *'That is awesome! I am so happy for him!*
> *I rejoice in his goodness!*
> *May it save the world!'*
>
> *Guess what?*
> *Your pile of merit is bigger than his.*
> *Why?*
> *Because you are free from jealousy.*
> *You are riding his train to the destination."*

It's called **The Supreme Rejoicing**.
You don't have to lift the heavy weight.
You just have to love that the weight is being lifted.

**That's the Payoff.**
Infinite wealth. Zero cost.
Just an open heart.

## Bluesman's Notes

1.  **The Lucky Break**: The "Eight Akṣaṇas" are the "Bad Beats." Being born a hell-being, a dumb animal, or a long-lived god who sleeps through the sermon. The "One Moment" is being born human, smart, with a Buddha in town. Don't waste it.
2.  **The Small Pinch**: I love this. You don't need a kilo of incense. You need a pinch "smaller than a mustard seed." It proves it's not the chemical reaction making the merit; it's the intent.
3.  **The Cleanup**: Sometimes religion is just doing the dishes. Cleaning the withered flowers off the altar is a high practice. It clears the rot out of your own soul.
4.  **Rejoicing**: This is the best deal in town. If you get jealous of someone else's spiritual progress, you lose. If you rejoice, you get their merit plus interest. It's compound interest on the goodness of the universe.
