# Chapter 8: Purification of Evil (Pāpaśodhana)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

*The eighth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on how to purify evil through the four dharmas: confession, antidote practice, restraint-power, and refuge-power. Includes the famous Suvarṇaprabhāsottama confession verses and teachings on bodhicitta as the supreme purifier.*

---

## Introduction: Why Purification?

Protection of the three—person, enjoyments, and merit—has been stated.¹ Purification is now to be stated. For what purpose?

> **Of one whose person is purified, enjoyment will be wholesome,**
> **like food for embodied beings, rightly prepared, free from husk.** (Kārikā 17)

As stated in the Āryatathāgataguhyasūtra:²

> "And in great cities there are great charnel grounds, filled with hundreds of thousands of living beings. There too, the bodhisattva displays a great dead body of his own person. There, those beings born in animal wombs, having eaten their fill for a month, at the end of their lifespan, having died, are reborn among the gods of the happy destiny, the heavenly world. And he becomes the cause for them up to parinirvāṇa—namely, by the complete purity of that very bodhisattva's former aspiration. By him, for a long time, such an aspiration was made: 'Those who would eat my dead body for a month—may he become the cause for them for arising in heaven up to parinirvāṇa, for that morally disciplined one.' The prayer succeeds. The aspiration succeeds."

And again:

> "He, empowered by the Dharma-body, does benefit for beings even by being seen. He does benefit for beings by being heard, by being touched. Just as, O Śāntamati, the physician-king Jīvaka, having gathered all medicines, made a girl-form composed of medicine-trees—pleasing, beautiful, well-made, well-finished, well-adorned. She comes, goes, stands, sits, and lies down. Those who come—great beings, kings, ministers, merchants, householders, officers—that physician-king Jīvaka joins them with that medicine-girl. Having joined with her, all their diseases are calmed, and they become healthy, happy, without affliction.
>
> Just so, O Śāntamati, that bodhisattva empowered by the Dharma-body—whatever beings touch his body, women, men, boys, girls, afflicted by desire, hatred, and delusion, for them, having been touched, all afflictions are calmed, and they perceive the body as free from burning—namely, by the complete purity of that very bodhisattva's former aspiration."

For this purpose, one's person should be purified.

---

## Part I: The Danger of Not Purifying

And He states the fault of not purifying:

> **Just as grain covered by grass withers by diseases and does not thrive,**
> **so the Buddha-sprout, covered by afflictions, does not go to growth.** (Kārikā 18)

The intention is: for the purpose of growth, by dispelling the antidote.

---

## Part II: What Is Purification?

> **What is purification of person? Purification from evil and affliction.**
> **By the essence of the Perfectly Awakened One's statement; but without effort, one goes to bad destinies.** (Kārikā 19)

---

## Part III: The Four Dharmas for Overcoming Evil

Therein, purification of evil is taught in the Caturdharmasūtra:³

> "By four dharmas, O Maitreya, is a bodhisattva mahāsattva endowed who overcomes evil that has been done and accumulated. Which four?
>
> 1. **Condemnation-practice** (*vidūṣaṇāsamudācāra*)
> 2. **Antidote-practice** (*pratipakṣasamudācāra*)
> 3. **Restraint-power** (*pratyāpattibala*)
> 4. **Refuge-power** (*āśrayabala*)
>
> Therein, **condemnation-practice**: one who has done unwholesome karma becomes remorseful regarding it again and again.
>
> **Antidote-practice**: having done unwholesome karma, one engages intensely in wholesome karma.
>
> **Restraint-power**: from undertaking restraint, obtaining the restraint of non-doing.
>
> **Refuge-power**: going to refuge in Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, and not abandoning bodhicitta.
>
> With a strong support, one cannot be overcome by evil.
>
> By these four dharmas, O Maitreya, is a bodhisattva mahāsattva endowed who overcomes evil that has been done and accumulated."

---

## Part IV: The Suvarṇaprabhāsottama Confession

How should condemnation-practice be cultivated? As stated in the Suvarṇaprabhāsottamasūtra:⁴

> *May the Buddhas attend to me, with minds of compassion and care.*
> *May they accept my transgression, established in the ten directions.*
>
> *And those who stand in the ten directions of the world, supreme among two-footed beings—*
> *whatever evil karma I have done before, most terrible,*
> *all that I will confess, standing before those of ten powers.*
>
> *Not knowing parents, not knowing Buddhas,*
> *not knowing the wholesome—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *Drunk with the intoxication of lordship, with the intoxication of family and enjoyments,*
> *drunk with the intoxication of youth—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *By ill-thought, ill-spoken, and by ill-done action,*
> *not seeing danger—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *By the conduct of a fool's understanding, with mind covered by ignorance,*
> *by the power of evil companions, with mind disturbed by afflictions—*
>
> *By the power of play and delight, by the power of sorrow and disease,*
> *by the fault of unsatisfied wealth—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *By association with ignoble people, by the cause of envy and stinginess,*
> *by the fault of guile and poverty—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *In this time of adversity's approach, by the cause of fear of desires,*
> *even by one without mastery—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *By the power of an unsteady mind, by the power of desire and anger,*
> *even afflicted by hunger and thirst—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *For the sake of drink, for the sake of food, for the sake of clothes, for the cause of women,*
> *by various affliction-torments—whatever evil was done by me.*
>
> *The evil of body, speech, and mind, the threefold misconduct accumulated—*
> *whatever was done with such forms, all that I confess.*
>
> *Whatever disrespect may have been done toward Buddhas, toward Dharma, and toward Śrāvakas—*
> *all that I confess.*
>
> *Whatever disrespect may have been done toward Pratyekabuddhas, or toward Bodhisattvas—*
> *all that I confess.*
>
> *Whatever disrespect may have been done toward Dharma-preachers, or toward those of other virtues—*
> *all that I confess.*
>
> *If the True Dharma was rejected by me, always not knowing,*
> *disrespect toward parents—all that I confess.*
>
> *By foolishness, by childishness, covered by pride and arrogance,*
> *by desire, hatred, and delusion—all that I confess.*
>
> *May the Buddhas look upon me, with minds of attention.*
> *May they accept my transgression, with minds offered to compassion.*
>
> *Whatever evil was done before by me, in hundreds of kalpas,*
> *on account of that I am sorrowful-minded, pitiful, tormented by fear.*
>
> *I fear the evil karma, constantly with a despairing mind.*
> *Wherever I will go, there is no power for me anywhere.*
>
> *All Buddhas are compassionate, all are removers of fear in the world.*
> *May they accept my transgression and release me from fear.*
>
> *May the Tathāgatas wash away the fruit of affliction and karma for me.*
> *May the Buddhas bathe me with the waters of the river of compassion.*
>
> *All evil I confess, whatever was done before by me.*
> *Whatever evil is mine now—all that I confess.*
>
> *For the future, I undertake restraint from all evil actions.*
> *I do not hide that evil, whatever misconduct may have been mine.*
>
> *The threefold bodily karma, and the fourfold of speech,*
> *by three kinds from mind—all that I confess.*
>
> *Done by body, done by speech, and thought by mind,*
> *the tenfold karma done—all that I confess.*
>
> *Whatever evil karma of mine, giver of undesired fruit—*
> *all that I will confess, standing before the Buddhas.*

## Part V: The Upāli Teaching on Offenses

Especially, the confession of bodhisattva offenses, heavy and light, is stated in the Āryopāliparipṛcchā:⁵

> "What is the heavy root offense? Generally, it is stated there: 'If, O Upāli, a bodhisattva mahāsattva set out in the Mahāyāna should incur offenses connected with desire equal to the sands of the Ganges, and should incur a single offense connected with hatred, taking the bodhisattva-vehicle as authority... this [latter] is a heavier offense.
>
> Why is that? Hatred, O Upāli, conduces to the abandonment of beings. Desire conduces to the gathering of beings. And, O Upāli, with regard to the affliction that conduces to gathering beings—there the bodhisattva has no deception, no fear...'
>
> Therefore, O Upāli, whatever offenses are connected with desire—all those I call non-offenses."

What is the intention here? It is because one who gathers beings is preeminent. For this teaching is for one with sincere intention and compassion.

For immediately after, He says:

> "Therein, O Upāli, bodhisattvas who are unskillful in means fear offenses connected with desire. But bodhisattvas who are skillful in means fear offenses connected with hatred, not those connected with desire."

---

## Part VI: Who Is Skillful in Means?

Who are skillful in means? Those who are restrained from abandoning beings by wisdom and compassion.⁶ For abandonment of beings occurs in two ways: by wisdom alone, from understanding the emptiness of suffering; and by compassion alone. By the power of affliction, compassion is quickly lost.

As stated in the Upāyakauśalyasūtra:

> "Just as, O son of good family, a man skilled in mantra-lore, bound by the king with a five-fold binding, when he wishes to escape, by the power of a single mantra-lore cuts all bonds and escapes—just so, O son of good family, a bodhisattva skilled in means finds delight in the five strands of desire, and dwells surrounded by them. But when he wishes, by the power of wisdom-commitment and by one omniscience-mind, having enjoyed all strands of desire, he dies and is reborn in a Brahma-world."

---

## Part VII: The Story of Jyotirmāṇavaka

In the Upāyakauśalyasūtra, regarding the brahmin youth Jyotirmāṇavaka who practiced celibacy for forty-two thousand years:⁷

> "Standing at the seventh step, compassion arose [in him]. 'Even if I, having broken this vow, would be destined for hell—still I am able to experience hellish suffering. And may this woman be happy. May she not make an end [of herself].'
>
> Thus, O son of good family, the brahmin youth Jyotirmāṇavaka, turning back, taking that woman by the right hand, said thus: 'Rise, O beautiful one. I will do whatever you wish.'...
>
> And I, O son of good family, by a great-compassion-mind-arising, though urgent, connected with desire, turned back for ten thousand kalpas.
>
> See, O son of good family: what for others is karma conducing to hell, for the bodhisattva skillful in means is karma conducing to arising in a Brahma-world."

---

## Part VIII: The Ratnamegha Permission

Clearly in the Āryaratnamegha, permission is given for killing a man about to commit an immediate retribution [crime].⁸ Even in the Śrāvaka-vinaya, in the very situation of a root offense, non-offense is stated for releasing a deer, etc., out of compassion.

---

## Part IX: Antidote-Practice

Condemnation-practice has been stated. Antidote-practice is stated.⁹ Therein, by familiarity with profound sūtras, exhaustion of evil occurs.

As stated in the Vajracchedikā:

> "O Subhūti, whatever sons or daughters of good family will take up these sūtras of such a kind, up to mastery—they will become despised, greatly despised. Why is that? Whatever karma of those beings done in former births, conducing to bad destinies—by that state of being despised, in this very life they will exhaust it, and will attain Buddha-awakening."

---

## Part X: Purification by Emptiness-Intent

By intent on emptiness, too, purification of evil occurs. As stated in the Tathāgatakoṣasūtra:¹⁰

> "If, O Kāśyapa, a single being should be endowed with these ten unwholesome karma-paths, extremely serious:
>
> - This is the supreme taking of life: if his father were a Pratyekabuddha, and he killed him
> - This is the supreme taking what is not given: stealing the property of the Three Jewels
> - This is the supreme sexual misconduct: if the mother were an arhat-woman
> - This is the supreme false speech: slander of the Tathāgata
> - This is the supreme divisive speech: disparaging the Noble Saṅgha
> - This is the supreme harsh speech: reviling the Noble Ones
> - This is the supreme idle chatter: distracting those who desire the Dharma
> - This is the supreme ill-will: dragging [others] into immediate-retribution [crimes]
> - This is the supreme covetousness: mind of taking the gains of those rightly going
> - This is the supreme wrong view: the entangled-view
>
> These, O Kāśyapa, are the ten unwholesome karma-paths, extremely serious.
>
> If, O Kāśyapa, a single being endowed with these ten unwholesome karma-paths—he should enter the Tathāgata's Dharma-teaching connected with cause and condition: 'There is no self here, no being, no life, no person who acts or experiences. Thus, uncreated, uncompounded, dream-nature, non-affliction-nature, naturally luminous nature of all dharmas he enters; originally pure, all dharmas he trusts-in, believes-in—I do not say that being goes to bad destinies.'"

---

## Part XI: The Trisamayarāja Antidote

In the Trisamayarāja too, antidote-practice is stated:¹¹

> "Closing the eyes, with mind focused on Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, one should recite the hundred-syllable [mantra] eight thousand times. With eyes closed, one sees Buddhas and Bodhisattvas; one becomes free from evil.
>
> Or, circumambulating a caitya, one should recite eight thousand times. With a caitya-image or true Dharma-book as focus, this is the very procedure."

---

## Part XII: The Cundā Dhāraṇī

Or one should recite the Cundā Dhāraṇī until one sees the signs of evil's exhaustion in dreams:¹²

> "Namely: from weeping, shelter, eating yogurt, milk, etc., one becomes free from evil. Or from vomiting, or from seeing sun and moon, from traveling through space, from defeating blazing fire, black buffalo, black man; from seeing the assembly of monks and nuns; from ascending a milk-tree, mountain, lion-throne, palace, or ship; and from hearing the Dharma—exhaustion of evil should be discerned."

---

## Part XIII: The Bhaiṣajyaguru Teaching

In the Bhaiṣajyaguruvaidūryaprabharājasūtra too:¹³

> "Those who hold the five training-precepts, those who hold the ten training-precepts, those who hold the bodhisattva-vow of four hundred training-precepts, those renunciants who, as monks, hold two hundred fifty training-precepts, those nuns who hold five hundred training-precepts—and those who, having undertaken training-restraint, have fallen from some training-precept—if those, afraid of bad-destiny fear, should hold the name of that Blessed One, the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyaguru Vaidūryaprabharāja, and should worship according to their capacity, no going to bad destinies is to be expected for them ever again."

---

## Part XIV: Restraint-Power

Antidote-practice has been stated in summary. Restraint-power (*pratyāpattibala*) is now stated.¹⁴

As stated in the Āryakṣitigarbhasūtra:

> "A bodhisattva mahāsattva, having refrained from taking life, gives fearlessness to all beings—non-terror, non-disturbance, non-hair-raising.
>
> By that root of virtue, by that karma-ripening, whatever karma-obstruction, affliction-obstruction, dharma-obstruction was done or caused to be done or approved, by body, speech, and mind, by the cause of taking life, mounted on the five-destiny wheel since beginningless time, tossed in the river of saṃsāra—all that he crushes by the wheel of refraining from taking life, up to making it ripen without remainder.
>
> He becomes dear to gods and humans of similar class, without affliction, long-lived..."

And likewise for the remaining ten wholesome karma-paths, each crushing its opposite unwholesome [karma].

---

## Part XV: Refuge-Power and the Pig-Story

Restraint-power has been stated. Refuge-power (*āśrayabala*) is to be stated.¹⁵ Here the pig-story is to be cited:

> *Those who go to the Buddha for refuge do not go to bad destinies.*
> *Having abandoned human bodies, they obtain divine bodies.*

Thus, taking Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha as objects, evil is exhausted.

---

## Part XVI: Bodhicitta as Supreme Purifier

In the Āryamaitreyavimokṣa, purification of evil by bodhicitta is stated:¹⁶

> "Like a kalpa-end fire, by burning all misconduct.
> Like the netherworld, by consuming all unwholesome dharmas...
>
> Just as, O son of good family, there is a gold-substance called Hāṭakaprabhāsa. One pala of it makes a thousand iron palas into gold. And that pala cannot be consumed by those thousand iron palas, cannot be made into iron.
>
> Just so, a single omniscience-mind-arising substance, held by the knowledge of dedicating roots of virtue, consuming all karma-and-affliction-obstruction-iron, makes all dharmas into the color of omniscience. And the omniscience-mind-arising substance cannot be afflicted or consumed by all karma-affliction-iron.
>
> Just as, O son of good family, a single lamp, in whatever house or cave it is brought, having been brought in, even darkness accumulated for a thousand years it dispels, and makes light.
>
> Just so, a single omniscience-mind-arising-lamp, in whatever being's thicket of ignorance-darkness it is brought—having been brought in, it dispels even karma-affliction-obstruction-darkness accumulated for ineffable hundred thousand kalpas, and makes the light of knowledge.
>
> Just as, O son of good family, for great nāga-kings crowned with the wish-fulfilling-jewel-king-diadem, there is no fear of attack from others—just so, for bodhisattvas crowned with the bodhicitta-great-compassion-wish-fulfilling-jewel-king-diadem, there is no fear of attack from bad destinies."

---

## Part XVII: The Upāli Teaching on Bodhicitta Purification

In the Āryopāliparipṛcchā too:¹⁷

> "Here, O Upāli, a bodhisattva set out in the Mahāyāna—if he should incur an offense in the morning period, and in the midday period should dwell not separated from the omniscience-mind—the bodhisattva's morality-aggregate is boundless.
>
> If he should incur an offense in the midday period, and in the evening period should be not separated from the omniscience-mind—the bodhisattva's morality-aggregate is boundless.
>
> Thus, the procedure is stated for each watch.
>
> Thus, O Upāli, the training has a remedy for bodhisattvas set out in the Mahāyāna.
>
> There, the bodhisattva should not generate excessive remorse, should not be excessively regretful.
>
> But if a Śrāvaka-vehicle person should incur offense again and again—the morality-aggregate of that Śrāvaka person is to be known as destroyed."

---

*Thus ends the Eighth Chapter, Purification of Evil, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*
