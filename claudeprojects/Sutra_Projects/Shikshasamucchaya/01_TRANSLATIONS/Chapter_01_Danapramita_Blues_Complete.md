# Part I: The Call and the Rarity

## The Call to Listen (Kārikās 1-4)

### Come On In, Y'all

You been through it, ain't you?

Burning down in them low places,¹
torment after torment,
suffering that don't quit—
that's what happens when the mind won't settle.

So listen up now.
Listen *good*.
This teaching here? It's medicine for all that.²

You hear me? Really *hear* me?
The one who listens without that big-head pride—³
they drop that old evil like a bad habit,
burn off all that karma debt from way back when.

And what they get? Joy they never knew was possible.
And once you got it? You don't ever fall from that sweetness again.

---

### The Rare Jewel

That waking-up happiness?⁴ It don't run dry.
You get riches that can't be matched.

This Dharma-jewel? Near impossible to find.
But you got it. Today. Right now.
This moment you're standing in? It's gold.⁵

So be here. Be *still*. Listen with respect.

---

### Everybody's Invited

Come on in, all you beings!
Gods and serpent-folk,⁶
spirits of the air and waters,
hungry ghosts and heaven-lords—
everybody with a thirst to hear:

The Blessed One speaks for one reason only:
*the good of all three worlds.*⁷

Y'all are welcome at this table.

---

## The Author Speaks (Kārikās 5-8)

### Bowing Down

I bow to the Buddhas and their children,⁸
I bow to the Dharma-body that holds it all,
I bow to everyone worth bowing to.

Now I'm gonna tell you how to walk this path—
the discipline of the Awakened One's own family—
putting together words that carry weight.

---

### I Ain't Saying Nothing New

Look here, I ain't pretending to be clever.
Nothing I say here is new under the sun.
I can't even claim I got skill with words.

So this ain't really for *your* sake—
I'm just trying to train my own stubborn heart.⁹

But maybe through this work, my faith gets stronger.¹⁰
Maybe that momentum for doing good builds up.
And if somebody like me comes across this someday?
Then maybe it'll mean something to them too.

---

### This Chance Don't Come Twice

Listen: this moment right here?
The conditions you standing in?
They're *hard* to get.¹¹ Near impossible.

But you got 'em. You *got* what it takes
to do something meaningful with this human life.

So if you don't sit down and think about what's good—
if you let this slip by—
tell me: when's that chance coming around again?

It ain't.

---

## The Elders Testify: What's Rare (Gaṇḍavyūhasūtra)

Now the old sūtras speak up,¹² congregation-style:

> *Rare* is getting free of the eight bad places.¹³
> *Rare* is getting born human at all.
> *Rare* is getting all the good conditions.
> *Rare* is a Buddha showing up in your world.
> *Rare* is having your senses working right.
> *Rare* is hearing the Dharma at all.
> *Rare* is meeting good folks who walk the path.
>
> *Rare* is finding true spiritual friends.
> *Rare* is getting taught the real way.
> *Rare* is making an honest living.
> *Rare*—so *rare*—is putting real effort into the truth
> here in this human world.

You hear that? Everything lined up for you right now?
That's the rare stuff. Don't waste it.

---

# Part II: Faith and the Waking-Up Mind

## The Choice That Changes Everything

When you've really *seen* the suffering of this world—
seen it from the inside and the outside both—
and you start wanting something better,
something that brings *peace*...

That's when something stirs in you.¹⁴
That's when you start asking the real question:

> *If I don't want fear and pain for myself,*
> *and others don't want it either—*
> *then what makes me so special*
> *that I only look out for number one?*¹⁵

You see what I'm saying? We're all in this together.

---

## The Root of Everything: Faith

So what's the first step? *Faith.*¹⁶

Not blind belief—real trust. Trust grounded in the road you've already walked. The old Ratnolkā teaching puts it this way:

> *By faith you follow the Victorious Ones.*
> *By faith you trust their teaching.*
> *By faith in how the bodhisattvas live—*
> *that's how the waking-up mind is born in great souls.*

---

### What Faith Does

Faith goes before you like a mother,¹⁷ like a guide.
It protects everything good in you. Makes it grow.

Faith dispels all your doubts,
carries you across the flood,¹⁸
shows you the way,
teaches you how to be patient.

Faith is *clear-minded*—no muddiness, no pride.
It's the root of real respect.

Faith is a treasure-chest of wealth,
the chief of good conduct—
like a hand that gathers up all your virtue.

---

### The Chain of Faith

*Now listen—this is how it builds:*¹⁹

Those who have faith and respect for the Buddha?
They don't throw away their discipline or training.

Those who keep their discipline?
They're praised among the virtuous.

Those with faith in the Dharma?
They *can't get enough* of the teaching—they keep listening.

Those who keep listening?
They start believing in the inconceivable.

Those with faith in the Sangha?
They become unshakeable, devoted to the community.

Those who are unshakeable?
Their faculties get sharp and bright.

Those with sharp faculties?
They drop the bad company.

Those who drop bad company?
They embrace *dharmic friends*²⁰—spiritual kinfolk.

Those with good friends?
They pile up vast merit.

Those with vast merit?
They become great souls, full of the power of causes.

Great souls with that power?
They have noble conviction, distinguished and deep.

Those with noble conviction?
All the Buddhas bless them constantly.

Those blessed by the Buddhas?
In *them* the waking-up mind arises.

Those with the waking-up mind?
They're devoted to the qualities of the great sages.

Those devoted to the sages?
They're *born into the Buddha-family*, well-born.

Those born into the Buddha-family?
They're freed from false connection.

Those who are freed?
Their hearts are purified with clarity.

Those with purified hearts?
Their higher disposition is supreme.

Those with supreme disposition?
They *always* practice the perfections.

Those who practice the perfections?
They've entered the Great Vehicle.

Those in the Great Vehicle?
They worship the Buddhas through practice.

Those who worship through practice?
Recollection of Buddha is pure in them.

Those with pure recollection?
They always see and contemplate the Buddhas.

Those who see the Buddhas?
The Buddha *never* stands apart from them.

Those from whom Buddha never stands apart?
The Dharma never departs from them.

Those from whom Dharma never departs?
They are *ever blessed* by all the Victorious Ones.

---

### The Rarity of Faith

And the old scripture concludes:

> *Rare among ordinary folks are those who have faith in teachings like these.*
> *But those who've accumulated goodness, who've made merit—*
> *they have faith through the power of causes.*
>
> *Say you served beings as numerous as the dust of ten buddha-fields*
> *for a whole eon, with every happiness—*
> *even that merit ain't as great*
> *as the merit of one who simply has faith in this teaching.*²¹

You hear that? *Faith itself* is the great offering.

---

## The Waking-Up Mind: Bodhicitta

So you got faith. Now what?

Now you strengthen that *waking-up mind*—that bodhicitta.²²
Because that's what holds all your merit together.

Prince Lion asked the Buddha:²³
> *"By what action does one gather all good things?*
> *How do you become dear to beings wherever you're born?"*

The Blessed One said:
> *"Bend your mind toward awakening*
> *for the liberation of all beings.*
> *That's how you gather all things good.*
> *That's how you become beloved."*

---

### What Bodhicitta Is

The Gaṇḍavyūha—that great Flower Ornament teaching—puts it this way:²⁴

> *Bodhicitta is the **seed** of all Buddha-qualities.*
> *It's the **field** where all white dharmas grow.*
> *It's the **ground** where all the world takes refuge.*
> *It's like a **father** protecting all bodhisattvas.*
>
> *It's like Vaiśravaṇa,²⁵ cutting off all poverty.*
> *It's like the wish-fulfilling gem, accomplishing all purposes.*
> *It's like the auspicious pot, fulfilling all intentions.*
>
> *It's like a **spear** conquering the enemy of afflictions.*
> *It's like a **sword** severing the head of the defilements.*
> *It's like an **axe** cutting down the tree of suffering.*
> *It's like a **weapon** protecting from all dangers.*
> *It's like a **hook** drawing beings out of the waters of saṃsāra.*
>
> *It's like a **whirlwind** scattering all hindrances like grass.*
> *It's like a **summary** gathering all the bodhisattva vows.*
> *It's like a **shrine** for gods, humans, and all the rest.*

So bodhicitta ain't just a nice feeling.
It's a *seed*, a *sword*, a *hook*, a *shrine*—
everything you need to walk this road.

# Part III: The Vows, the Tree, and the Heart of Giving

## Mañjuśrī's Testimony

Now listen to how the great Mañjuśrī—back when he was just starting out—made his vows in front of the Lord.²⁶ This is the testimony we follow:

---

### The Endless Road

> *"For as long as saṃsāra keeps rolling*
> *without end—ten million eons and more—*
> *that's how long I'll walk this road*
> *for the good of every being."*

That's the first word: *I'm in this for the long haul.*

---

### The Invitation

> *"I raise up the waking-up mind*
> *right here, in front of the Protector.*
> *I'm inviting the whole world:*
> *I'm gonna set you free from poverty."*²⁷

That's the promise: *Everybody's invited to this liberation.*

---

### The Vow of Purity

> *"Ill-will, a hardened heart,*
> *jealousy, stinginess—*
> *from today on, I won't make them,*
> *not till I reach awakening.*
> *I'll walk the holy life.*
> *I'll let go of evil desires."*

That's the discipline: *I'm cleaning up my act.*

---

### The Patient Road

> *"I'll train after the Buddhas*
> *in the restraint of good conduct.*
> *I ain't in a hurry to get enlightened—*
> *I'm willing to wait."*²⁸

That's humility: *This ain't about me getting mine quick.*

---

### For Even One

> *"I'll stand here till the end of time*
> *for the sake of even one being.*
> *I'll purify my buddha-field—*
> *immeasurable, inconceivable."*

That's commitment: *Even one soul is worth everything.*

---

### The Famous Name

> *"I'll make my name known*
> *in all ten directions.*
> *I'll purify my body-action completely.*
> *I'll purify my speech-action.*
> *I'll purify my mind-action.*
> *I won't do evil deeds."*

That's integrity: *Inside and out, I'm getting right.*

---

## The Heart of It All: Kārikās 3 and 4

Now here's the thing, church—Śāntideva says the full training is so vast it can't be told in infinite eons. But if you want the *essence*, the *vital points* that keep you clean, here it is:²⁹

### The Summary (Kārikā 4)

> **Give yourself away.**
> **Give your enjoyments away.**
> **Give your merit away—past, present, and future.**
> **Give it all to every being.**
> **Then protect that gift. Purify it. Make it grow.**

That's it. That's the whole bodhisattva vow in four lines.³⁰

---

## What's Given vs. What's Kept

The old Ugradatta teaching lays it out like this:³¹

| What's Given | What's Kept |
|:------------|:------------|
| Don't need to protect it | Got to guard it |
| Exhausts craving | Feeds craving |
| No grasping | Full of grasping |
| No fear | Full of fear |
| Supports the path | Supports Māra |
| Never perishes | Rots away |
| Brings happiness | Brings suffering |
| Drops afflictions | Grows afflictions |
| Deed of the good | Deed of the foolish |
| Praised by all Buddhas | Praised by fools |

You see the pattern? Everything you hold onto holds you back. Everything you give breaks you free.

---

## The Medicine Tree

Now here's the most powerful teaching in the whole chapter.³²

The Nārāyaṇa scripture says the bodhisattva should think like this:

> *"This body of mine? It's already given away.*
> *It belongs to all beings—how much more my stuff!"*

And then—this is the hard part—

> *"To those who need a hand, I give my hand.*
> *To those who need a foot, I give my foot.*
> *To those who need an eye, I give my eye.*
> *Flesh to those who need flesh.*
> *Blood to those who need blood.*
> *Marrow. Limbs. Even my head."*

---

### The Tree That Heals

The teaching goes on:

> *"Think of a medicine tree.³³*
> *When people come and take from it—*
> *root, trunk, branch, bark, leaf, flower, fruit, sap—*
> *the tree don't complain. It don't discriminate.*
> *It just heals whoever comes.*
> *Low, middling, or high—all get healed.*
>
> *That's what the bodhisattva body is:*
> *medicine for the world.*
> *Whoever needs whatever—take it.*
> *Hand, foot, eye, flesh, blood, bone—*
> *it's all here for you."*

That's radical generosity. Not "what can I spare?" but "take what you need from me."

---

## The Five Immediacies

Mañjuśrī also taught the **five things that lead straight to awakening**:³⁴

1. **Hold the waking-up mind** and don't slip back to just saving yourself.
2. **Give everything away** and don't let stinginess creep back in.
3. **Commit to protecting all beings** and don't get tired and sit down.
4. **See all things as unarisen and unceasing** and don't fall into wrong views.
5. **Aim for one-moment wisdom** and don't stop or quit until you reach omniscience.

Those who keep these five? They wake up *quick*.

---

## The Great Exchange

Now here's the thing about giving:

The scriptures say that even one thought of bodhicitta—aimed at rescuing all beings, liberating all beings, consoling all beings, bringing all beings to nirvāṇa—produces *immeasurable, incalculable* merit.

How much more when you actually *live* it?

And here's the paradox:³⁵ By giving away everything—even your own body—you become like a hook with bait, drawing beings to liberation. You don't even get to enjoy what you give. You just... *give*.

And in that giving, you *are* liberated.

---

## The Final Word

The Ratnamegha puts it plain:³⁶

> **"For the bodhisattva, giving IS awakening."**

Not "giving leads to awakening." Not "giving prepares you for awakening."

*Giving IS awakening.*

The act of opening your hand, your heart, your whole self—that's it. That's the path and the goal in one.

---

*Thus ends the First Chapter: The Road of Generosity.*

# Endnotes

## Part I Notes

¹ **"Burning down in them low places"**: The Sanskrit text speaks of *naraka* (hell realms) and *mahāpratāpa* (great burning torment). In Blues tradition, "low places" evokes both spiritual darkness and the valleys of suffering we travel through.

² **"Medicine for all that"**: The Dharma is often called the "medicine" (bhaiṣajya) for the disease of suffering.

³ **"without that big-head pride"**: Sanskrit *anuddhatātmā*—one whose self is not arrogant. The Blues ethic: you gotta be low to get lifted.

⁴ **"That waking-up happiness"**: *saṃbodhisattvasukham*—the happiness of complete awakening. Not just feeling good, but being *fully awake*.

⁵ **"This moment you're standing in"**: *kṣaṇasaṃpad*—the endowment of the opportune moment, the precious human birth with all its conditions.

⁶ **"Gods and serpent-folk"**: *suranāgasattvāḥ*—devas (gods) and nāgas (serpent beings). The teaching is for *all* beings, not just humans.

⁷ **"all three worlds"**: *tribhuvana*—the realms of desire, form, and formlessness. The whole cosmos.

⁸ **"the Buddhas and their children"**: The bodhisattvas are called *sugatātmaja*—"offspring of the Well-Gone Ones."

⁹ **"train my own stubborn heart"**: Śāntideva's famous humility, echoing Bodhicaryāvatāra 1.2. He doesn't claim to teach others—just to work on himself.

¹⁰ **"my faith gets stronger"**: *prasādavega*—the momentum or impetus of faith (prasāda = clarity, serene confidence).

¹¹ **"hard to get"**: *sudurlabhā*—extremely difficult to obtain. The 18 favorable conditions for practice are precious.

¹² **"the old sūtras speak up"**: The *Āryagaṇḍavyūhasūtra* (Flower Ornament Sūtra) is being quoted here—testimony from the ancient teachers.

¹³ **"the eight bad places"**: *aṣṭākṣaṇa*—the eight unfavorable conditions: hell, hungry ghost realm, animal realm, long-lived gods, barbarian lands, wrong views, Buddha-less eras, defective senses.

## Part II Notes

¹⁴ **"something stirs in you"**: The arising of bodhicitta through the Buddha-gotra (Buddha-nature)—the innate capacity for awakening present in all beings.

¹⁵ **"what makes me so special"**: This is Bodhicaryāvatāra 8.120—the logic of equal concern for self and other. If we both don't want suffering, why protect only myself?

¹⁶ **"Faith"**: Sanskrit *śraddhā*. Not belief without evidence, but trust grounded in what you've come to know through practice.

¹⁷ **"like a mother"**: The Ratnolkā compares faith to a mother (*mātṛ*)—nurturing, protective, guiding.

¹⁸ **"the flood"**: Sanskrit *ogha*—the flood of saṃsāra, traditionally the four floods of desire, existence, views, and ignorance.

¹⁹ **"this is how it builds"**: The Ratnolkā presents faith as a chain reaction—each quality leads to the next, building toward full awakening. This is classic Blues epistemology: one step at a time, each step earned.

²⁰ **"dharmic friends"**: *Kalyāṇamitra* / *dhārmikamitra*—spiritual friends who support your practice. In Blues tradition: your people, your congregation, the ones who keep you honest.

²¹ **"faith itself is the great offering"**: The merit of having faith in the teaching exceeds even vast material offerings. Faith is the *root* from which all else grows.

²² **"bodhicitta"**: The awakening mind; the aspiration for Buddhahood for the sake of all beings. Blues equivalent: "that waking-up heart."

²³ **"Prince Lion"**: The Siṃhaparipṛcchā—"Questions of Lion"—a sūtra where a prince asks the Buddha about generating bodhicitta.

²⁴ **"Flower Ornament teaching"**: The Gaṇḍavyūha, part of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra. One of the most elaborate Mahāyāna scriptures.

²⁵ **"Vaiśravaṇa"**: The god of wealth (Kubera); one of the four great kings who protect the world.

## Part III Notes

²⁶ **Mañjuśrī's vows**: These are quoted from the *Mañjuśrībudddhakṣetraguṇavyūhālaṃkārasūtra*, Mañjuśrī's original bodhisattva commitment.

²⁷ **"set you free from poverty"**: Sanskrit *dāridrya*—not just material poverty, but the poverty of saṃsāra, the lack of awakening.

²⁸ **"I ain't in a hurry"**: Mañjuśrī vows to train forever, not rushing to personal liberation while beings suffer.

²⁹ **"the vital points"**: Sanskrit *marmasthāna*—the essential summary. Kārikā 3 asks for this; kārikā 4 provides it.

³⁰ **Kārikā 4**: This is the heart of the Śikṣāsamuccaya—the three-fold giving (self, enjoyments, merit) plus the three-fold cultivation (protect, purify, increase).

³¹ **Ugradatta teaching**: The *Ugradattaparipṛcchā* provides this classic contrast between giving and keeping.

³² **"the most powerful teaching"**: The body-offering passages from the *Nārāyaṇaparipṛcchā* represent the radical extreme of dānapāramitā.

³³ **"medicine tree"**: Sanskrit *bhaiṣajyavṛkṣa*—the image of the bodhisattva as a tree that heals all without discrimination is one of Buddhist literature's most striking metaphors.

³⁴ **Five immediacies**: Sanskrit *ānantarya*—usually this term refers to the five evil acts leading to immediate hell. Here Mañjuśrī inverts it: five commitments that lead *immediately* to awakening.

³⁵ **"the paradox"**: The bodhisattva gives everything away—even the merit of giving—and thereby becomes free. Not by getting, but by releasing.

³⁶ **"giving IS awakening"**: *dānaṃ hi bodhisattvasya bodhiḥ*—this is the summary of Chapter 1.

# Theological Notes

## The Rarity of This Moment
Śāntideva opens by emphasizing how *hard* it is to get the conditions for practice. This is pure Blues epistemology—you only know what you got when you've been without it.

## Humility of the Teacher
Kārikā 6 shows Śāntideva's characteristic stance: "I ain't special, I'm just working on myself." This is not false modesty—it's the bodhisattva recognizing that the Dharma is bigger than any teacher.

## Congregational Testimony
The Gaṇḍavyūha quotation functions like a congregation testifying—voice after voice saying "Rare! Rare! Rare!" This litany of rarities is meant to wake us up to what we have.

## Faith as African-American Testimony
The Ratnolkā's "chain of faith" mirrors Black church tradition—each testimony building on the last, creating a web of witness.

## Bodhicitta as Practical Power
The metaphors for bodhicitta (seed, sword, axe, hook) make clear this isn't passive sentiment. It's *active*, *militant*, *transformative*—the heart of a warrior who loves.

## The Logic of Compassion
The opening verse shows the logical foundation: if we equally dislike suffering, there's no rational ground for prioritizing self over other. This is Blues ethics: we're all in this together.

## Radical Self-Offering
The body-offering passages are not metaphor—they describe the bodhisattva ideal literally. This is the extreme edge of generosity, giving what we most cling to.

## The Medicine Tree as Blues Ancestor
In African-American spirituality, the church itself is a "medicine tree"—the congregation gives of itself to heal whoever comes. The bodhisattva operates the same way.

## Giving as Identity
The final statement—"giving IS awakening"—collapses the means/end distinction. For the bodhisattva, the practice is the goal. Walking the road IS arriving.

## Blues Economics
"What's given vs. what's kept" is pure Blues wisdom. The blues tradition knows: what you hold onto owns you. Let it go and you're free.
