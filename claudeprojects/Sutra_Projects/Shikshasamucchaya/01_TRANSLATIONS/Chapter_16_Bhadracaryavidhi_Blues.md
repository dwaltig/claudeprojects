## Why You Need More

You got purity. Good. You got a clean house.
But is it enough?
No.

> *"There's a lot of hungry mouths out there.*
> *If your pot is small, what's the use?*
> *It don't bring the Deep Satisfaction (*atitṛpti*).*
> *You gotta make it bigger.*
> *You gotta increase it."*

Clean ain't enough. You need **POWER**.

## Increasing the Person (Strength & Vigor)

How do you make your "Person" bigger?
Two ways: **Strength** (*bala*) and **Non-Laziness** (*anālasya*).

The *Ratnamegha Sūtra* says:
> *"There ain't nobody in the universe*
> *who can crush the bodhisattva's strength."*

How do you get muscles like that? The *Tathāgataguhya Sūtra* gives you the workout plan.
Ten reps:

1.  **Give your life**, but keep the Truth.
2.  **Bow down low**, but don't puff up.
3.  **Take the hit** from weak people (don't hit back).
4.  **Feed the hungry** the best stuff.
5.  **Heal the sick.** Be the doctor.
6.  **Fill the pockets** of the poor.
7.  **Paint the church.** (Plaster the shrine).
8.  **Talk joy.** Speak words that make people smile.
9.  **Share your stuff.**
10. **Carry the load.** When they're tired, you pick it up.

And **Vigor**:
Thinking about it ain't doing it.
The *Sāgaramati Sūtra* says:
> *"Lazy man got no enlightenment.*
> *Lazy man got no giving.*
> *Lazy man got no wisdom.*
> *Lazy man got nothing."*

You grow like a lotus in the water. Keep pushing up.

## Firm Up Your Stance

Before you start The Big Prayer, you gotta get your stance right.
The Root of all Increase is **Merit**.

> *"First, lock in your Effort and Intention.*
> *Make 'em hard as rock.*
> *Then put Compassion in the front.*
> *Now you're ready to grow."*

### 1. Effort (*Vyavasāya*)
Like Sudhana going to Maitreya. You don't stop.
You look at the past—all that wasted time chasing dreams—and you say: *"Never again."*
You look at the future—Buddhahood—and you say: *"I'm coming."*

### 2. Intention (*Āśaya*)
The *Dharmasaṃgīti* says:
> *"Intention is the fuel.*
> *No fuel? No fire.*
> *Good fuel? The Dharma blazes up."*

Keep it honest. Keep it straight. No curves.

### 3. Compassion (*Karuṇā*)
> *"You don't need a thousand rules.*
> *You need ONE thing.*
> *Great Compassion.*
>
> *When the King's wheel rolls, the army follows.*
> *When Compassion rolls, the whole Dharma follows."*

How do you feel it?
Look at the world.
See them drowning in the river of thirst.
See them locking themselves in the prison of "Me."
See them blind, scared, alone.
And say: *"I got you. I'm carrying this."*

## The Daily Grind

Now you do the work. The *Bhadracaryā*—The Good Conduct.
Three times in the day. Three times in the night.
The **Three Piles** (*Triskandha*):

1.  **Confession**: "I messed up. I own it. I drop it."
2.  **Rejoicing**: "You did good? Awesome. I love it."
3.  **Requesting**: "Please, Teachers, don't leave. Teach us. Turn the wheel."

## The Offering
You ain't got money? No problem.
The *Ratnamegha Sūtra* says:
> *"All the flowers in the wild.*
> *All the fruit on the unclaimed trees.*
> *All the jewels deep in the ocean.*
> *All the clear water in the rivers.*
> *Nobody owns them.*
>
> *Take 'em with your mind.*
> *Offer 'em up.*
> *'I give this to the Buddhas.'*
> *It counts."*

## The Daśabhūmaka Manifesto

This is it. The promise. The Vow.
(From the *Daśabhūmaka Sūtra*)

1.  **I worship every Buddha.** None left out.
2.  **I hold the Truth.** I guard the Dharma-eye.
3.  **I show up.** Wherever a Buddha is born, walks, or dies—I'm there.
4.  **I practice.** I walk the walk. The whole vast conduct.
5.  **I ripen the people.** I get them ready. All of them.
6.  **I enter the worlds.** I go into every universe.
7.  **I clean the place up.** I make every land a Pure Land.
8.  **I roll with the crew.** I stick with the bodhisattvas who have the same heart.
9.  **I don't miss.** My actions are *Amogha*—unfailing. Fruitful. If you see me, you get blessed.
10. **I wake up.** I show the supreme awakening in every world.

## The King of Prayers

Finally, you seal it. You dedicate the merit.
You sing the song that Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra accept.
The *Bhadracaryā*.

> *"Just like Mañjuśrī the Hero knows,*
> *And Samantabhadra too—*
> *Just like them,*
> *I follow their lead.*
> *I dedicate all this good stuff.*
>
> *Whatever dedication the Victors of the past, present, and future*
> *Say is the best—*
> *Whatever is the Supreme Dedication—*
> *That's what I do.*
>
> *I dedicate all this merit*
> *To the Good Conduct.*
> *To the Bhadracaryā.*
> *To the Freedom of All Beings."*

*Thus ends the Sixteenth Chapter: The Big Prayer.*

## Bluesman's Notes

1.  **Supreme Satisfaction**: The text says "a little merit causes satisfaction." But we want *Atitṛpti*—**Supreme Satisfaction**. We ain't snacking; we're feasting. We want Buddhahood for everyone.
2.  **The Three Piles**: This is the daily hygiene. Confess the dirt. Rejoice in the clean. Ask for the light. Do it three times a day, three times a night. Keep the engine running.
3.  **The Offering**: I love this part. You can offer "unowned" things. The wild flowers, the stars, the ocean. You don't need a wallet to be a great patron. You just need a big mind.
4.  **The Anthem**: The *Bhadracaryā* gives me chills. "Just like Mañjuśrī knows." It's not about "my" little prayer. It's about joining the Great Current. Plugging into the cosmic grid.
