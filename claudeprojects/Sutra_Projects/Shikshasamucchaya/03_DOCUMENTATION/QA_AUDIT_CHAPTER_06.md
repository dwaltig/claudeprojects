## Recommendations

### For Scholarly Version
- ✓ No mandatory corrections. Exemplary precision.
- Consider: Slight clarification that *tīvrādarāt* means "from intense earnestness" as instrumental cause.

### For Blues Version (Minor Suggestions)
1. **Optional:** Restore brief mention of protective mantras as appendix or note
2. **Optional:** Add inline Sanskrit for *cittaparikarma* on first use
3. Current treatment of trikoṭi meat exception is accurate—no correction needed

---

## Overall Assessment

**Scholarly Version:** Reference-quality translation. Suitable for academic study.

**Blues Version:** Highly effective vernacular rendering. Key doctrines preserved, including:
- 12 mindfulnesses
- City of the mind
- Gatekeeper metaphor
- Meat prohibition with trikoṭi rejection
- Servant's mind

The Blues version successfully bridges the gap between 8th-century Buddhist Sanskrit and contemporary accessible English.

**Verdict:** Both versions approved. No critical corrections required.
