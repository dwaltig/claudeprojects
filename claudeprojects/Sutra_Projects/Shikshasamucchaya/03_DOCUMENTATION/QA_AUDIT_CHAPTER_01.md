# QA Audit — Chapter 01 (Blues vs. Sanskrit)

## Scope
Audit of the Blues vernacular structure for Chapter 1 (Dānapāramitā) against
the Sanskrit source file in this repo. This report focuses on alignment,
omissions, and interpretive expansions.

## Sources
- Sanskrit: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt`
- Blues: `01_TRANSLATIONS/Chapter_01_Danapramita_Blues_Complete.md`

## Method
RLM-style slicing: line-anchored extraction from the Sanskrit file, then
mapping to the Blues part structure (Parts I–III).

---

## Part I — The Call and the Rarity
**Sanskrit anchors:**
- Verses 1–8: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:9`
- Rarities (Gaṇḍavyūha citation): `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:89`

**Alignment:**
- Blues accurately renders the opening verses and the rarity list.

**Notes:**
- Verse 3 is damaged in the source (`***` in the text); Blues uses a
reconstructive paraphrase of *akṣaya* and *saṃpad*.
- Blues adds sermonic framing not present in the Sanskrit.

---

## Part II — Faith and the Waking-Up Mind
**Sanskrit anchors:**
- Ratnolkādhāraṇī “chain of faith”: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:119`
- Gaṇḍavyūha bodhicitta metaphors: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:241`
- “Cattle cart” (paśuratha) warning: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:251`
- Causes and types of bodhicitta: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:265`

**Alignment:**
- Blues captures the faith chain and the bodhicitta metaphors.

**Omissions:**
- Pṛthagjana defense, paśuratha analogy, and the four causes/twofold
bodhicitta discussions are omitted.

---

## Part III — The Vows, the Tree, and the Heart of Giving
**Sanskrit anchors:**
- Mañjuśrī vows: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:325`
- Marmasthāna summary verse 4: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:429`
- Five ānantaryas: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:437`
- Ugradatta contrast: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:461`
- Nārāyaṇa / medicine tree: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:475`
- Gifts catalogues: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:487`
- Pariṇāmanā litany: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:499`
- Final summary (Ratnamegha): `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/śantidevaviracitaḥ śikṣāsamuccayaḥ.txt:515`

**Alignment:**
- Blues accurately renders the Mañjuśrī vows, the core “give yourself away”
summary (verse 4), the Ugradatta contrast, the medicine-tree metaphor, and the
closing “giving is awakening” line.

**Structural shift:**
- Verse 4 is repositioned earlier in Blues to function as a thematic header,
while the Sanskrit places it after the saṃvara discussion.

**Omissions:**
- The extended saṃvara/discipline discussion (including admonitions and
example narratives) is omitted.
- The exhaustive gift catalogues and the long pariṇāmanā aspiration sequence
are condensed to brief summaries.

## Conclusion
The Blues vernacular version is a faithful abridgment that preserves the
chapter’s poetic and metaphorical core while omitting the scholastic argument
blocks, long catalogues, and extended merit-dedication litanies. The added
sermonic framing is interpretive and should be treated as such.
