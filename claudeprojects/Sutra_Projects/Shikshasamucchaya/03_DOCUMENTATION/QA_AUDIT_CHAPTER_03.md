## Detailed Findings

### 1. KĀRIKĀ ACCURACY

#### Kārikā 7: *tatrātmabhāve kā rakṣā yadanarthavivarjanam*

| Criterion | Scholarly | Blues |
|:----------|:----------|:------|
| *ātmabhāve* | "one's person" ✓ | "yourself" ⚠️ |
| *rakṣā* | "protection" ✓ | "protecting" ✓ |
| *anarthavivarjanam* | "avoidance of harm" ✓ | "avoiding what's gonna hurt you" ✓ |
| **Score** | **10/10** | **8/10** |

**Finding:** Blues version slightly simplifies *ātmabhāva* ("one's person/self/being") to just "yourself." The technical Buddhist meaning of *ātmabhāva* as the psychophysical basis for practice is somewhat diluted.

**Recommendation:** Consider: "What's protecting your own person? It's avoiding what harms you."

### 2. QUOTATION FIDELITY

| Source Text | Scholarly | Blues |
|:------------|:----------|:------|
| Gaganagañja vow verses | Complete, verse format ✓ | Narrative adaptation ✓ |
| Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (Lotus) | Full list of persons to avoid ✓ | Complete list ✓ |
| Sāgaramatisūtra (10 hooks) | Enumerated 7, 10, 11 ✓ | Hooks 7, 10, 11 clearly marked ✓ |
| Ratnamegha on vigor | Complete ✓ | Complete ✓ |
| Saṃgharakṣita narrative | Full story ✓ | Full story with vivid detail ✓ |

**Score:** Scholarly 10/10, Blues 9/10

**Note:** Blues narrative adaptation ("They gonna curse us? We'll take it...") maintains meaning while enhancing oral accessibility.

### 3. DOCTRINAL PRECISION

| Key Concept | Sanskrit | Scholarly | Blues |
|:------------|:---------|:----------|:------|
| Māra's works | *mārakarma* | "work of Māra" | "Māra's work" / "Devil's work" |
| Māra-hooks | *mārāṅkuśa* | "Māra-hooks" | "Māra-hooks" / "ten snares" |
| Bodhicitta confusion | *bodhicittasaṃpramoṣa* | "confusion of bodhicitta" | "losing the awakening-mind" |
| Discouragement | *avasāda* | "discouragement" | "discouragement" |
| Stumbling | *skhalita* | "stumbling" | "stumbling" |

**Score:** Scholarly 10/10, Blues 9/10

**Note on "Devil's work":** The Blues translation's use of "Devil's work" for *mārakarma* is doctrinally defensible because:
1. The theological notes explicitly clarify Māra's nature
2. The African-American spiritual tradition's "Devil" parallels the Buddhist tempter/obstructor
3. The term "Māra" is also used throughout, establishing the context

---

### 4. VERNACULAR INTEGRITY (Blues Only)

| Criterion | Assessment |
|:----------|:-----------|
| Blues idiom authentic? | ✓ Strong ("They gonna curse us?", "Hook #7", "The lesson is harsh but clear") |
| Theological depth preserved? | ✓ Six theological notes provide essential bridges |
| Accessible to non-specialists? | ✓ Clear formatting, narrative flow |
| Doctrinal accuracy beneath vernacular? | ✓ All key concepts present |

**Score:** 9/10

|:--------|:--------|:---------|
| Scholarly | No over-translation | None |
| Blues | Rhetorical framing ("The lesson is harsh but clear") | Minimal (stylistic) |
| Blues | "The Devil's work" | Acceptable with note |

---
