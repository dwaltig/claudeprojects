# QA Audit — Chapter 02 (Blues vs. Sanskrit, Line-Anchored)

## Scope
Audit of the Blues vernacular structure for Chapter 2 (Saddharmaparigraha)
against the repo Sanskrit source file. Focus is on alignment, omissions, and
interpretive expansions.

## Sources
- Sanskrit: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt`
- Blues: `01_TRANSLATIONS/Chapter_02_Saddharmaparigraha_Blues.md`

## Method
RLM-style slicing: line-anchored extraction from the Sanskrit file, then
mapping to the Blues part structure (Parts I–IV).

## Part I — Why Protection Matters
**Sanskrit anchors:**
- Kārikā 5: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt:7`
- Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa and corroborating citations: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt:15`

**Alignment:**
- Blues renders the core logic of Kārikā 5 and the “protect yourself to protect
others” teaching.

**Notes:**
- Blues adds “merit” to the protected items (“body, goods, merit”). The Sanskrit
only has *ātmabhāvādi* (“body and the rest”), without explicit *puṇya*.

---

## Part II — Your People (Kalyāṇamitra)
**Sanskrit anchors:**
- Kalyāṇamitra section and similes: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt:23`
- Acalopāsikāvimokṣa outcomes and Sudhana devotion: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt:23`

**Alignment:**
- Blues follows the kalyāṇamitra primacy, the approach similes, the “doctor /
medicine” and “warrior / weapons” frames, and the Sudhana devotion sequence.

**Omissions:**
- None material; long simile lists are preserved in condensed vernacular form.

---

## Part III — The Story of Ever-Weeping (Sadāprarudita)
**Sanskrit anchors:**
- Sadāprarudita narrative: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt:35`
- Blood-offering and Māra no-opening: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt:47`

**Alignment:**
- Blues preserves the main narrative beats (sale attempt, Māra’s interference,
Śakra’s test, merchant’s daughter, seven-year waiting, blood-offering).

**Omissions:**
- Minor compression of repeated narrative details; no doctrinal losses detected.

---

## Part IV — The Summary Teaching
**Sanskrit anchors:**
- Caturdharmaka reminder: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt:51`
- Kārikā 6: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt:57`
- “Saddharmaparigraha” definition (Sāgaramati): `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt:69`
- “One Great Vow” (Śrīmālā): `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt:77`
- “Blow to Māra”: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt:81`
- “Higher than Sumeru”: `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt:85`
- Benefits in song (Sāgaramati verses): `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS/saddharmaparigraho dvitīyaḥ paricchedaḥ.txt:89`

**Alignment:**
- Blues accurately maps the core definition of saddharmaparigraha, the one-vow
summary, the Māra/Sumeru comparisons, and the benefits hymn.

**Notes:**
- Blues repeats “merit” in the Kārikā 6 rendering; Sanskrit does not specify
*puṇya* here.

---

## Conclusion
The Blues vernacular Chapter 2 closely follows the Sanskrit structure and
preserves the central doctrinal moves. The primary expansion is the addition
of “merit” in the Kārikā 5/6 protection lines; otherwise, changes are stylistic
and compressive rather than doctrinal.
