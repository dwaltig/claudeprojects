## Recommendations by Priority

### Priority 1: CRITICAL - Attribution Clarification
**Issue**: Chapters 18-19 attributed to "Master John Kim" not "William Altig"

**Questions for User**:
1. Are Chapters 18-19 actually by a different translator (John Kim)?
2. If so, is voice inconsistency acceptable for final chapters?
3. If not, should bylines be corrected to William Altig?

**Impact**: Project consistency and attribution integrity

---

### Priority 2: HIGH - Voice Consistency Decision
**Issue**: Chapters 18-19 exhibit different Blues voice style

**Options**:
1. **Accept variation**: Keep John Kim voice, acknowledge dual-translator project
2. **Remaster Chapters 18-19**: Align with William Altig's established style
3. **Create "Voice Guide"**: Document both styles as acceptable variations

**Impact**: Overall project cohesion and reader experience

---

### Priority 3: MEDIUM - Root Metaphor Clarity
**Issue**: Chapter 19 title is "The Long Game" but chapter uses "The Hustle"

**Recommendation**:
- Either retitle to "The Hustle"

---

### Priority 4: LOW - Minor Polish
**Issue**: Chapter 16 root metaphor could be stronger
