## Detailed Findings

### 1. KĀRIKĀ ACCURACY

#### Kārikā 5: *paribhogāya sattvānāmātmabhāvādi dīyate...*

| Criterion | Scholarly | Blues |
|:----------|:----------|:------|
| *ātmabhāva* | "One's person" ✓ | "your body" ✓ |
| *paribhogāya* | "for the enjoyment" ✓ | "for beings to use" ✓ |
| *arakṣite kuto bhogaḥ* | "if unprotected, how can there be enjoyment?" ✓ | "if you don't protect the gift, how they gonna enjoy it?" ✓ |
| **Score** | **10/10** | **9/10** |

**Note:** Both preserve the core logic. Blues adds rhetorical flourish ("What kind of gift is it if nobody gets fed?") which enhances rather than distorts meaning.

#### Kārikā 6: *kalyāṇamitrānutsargāt ātmabhāvādīnāṃ rakṣādikaṃ kāryam...*

| Criterion | Scholarly | Blues |
|:----------|:----------|:------|
| *kalyāṇamitrānutsargāt* | "through not abandoning spiritual friends" ✓ | "Don't abandon your spiritual friends" ✓ |
| *sūtrāṇāṃ ca sadekṣaṇāt* | "constant examination of the sūtras" ✓ | "Keep your eye on the scriptures" ✓ |
| *ātmabhāvādīnāṃ rakṣādikaṃ* | "protection...of one's person and the rest" ✓ | "protect yourself, your goods, **your merit**" ⚠️ |
| **Score** | **10/10** | **7/10** |

**Finding:** The Blues version adds "your merit" which expands beyond *ātmabhāvādīnāṃ* ("one's person and the rest"). While *śubha* (merit) is discussed in Chapter 1, it is not explicitly named in Kārikā 6.

**Recommendation:** Revise to "That's how you protect yourself, your goods—all of it."

### 2. QUOTATION FIDELITY

| Source Text | Scholarly | Blues |
|:------------|:----------|:------|
| Gaṇḍavyūha (Śrīsaṃbhava) | Full with all similes ✓ | Condensed but complete ✓ |
| Sadāprarudita story | Complete narrative ✓ | Fuller narrative with drama ✓ |
| Śrīmālāsiṃhanādasūtra | "one great vow" preserved ✓ | "ONE great vow: Holding on to what's real" ✓ |

**Score:** Scholarly 9/10, Blues 9/10

**Note:** Both preserve the essential quotations. The Blues version's "Holding on to what's real" for *saddharmaparigraha* is an acceptable vernacular rendering.

---

### 3. DOCTRINAL PRECISION

| Key Concept | Scholarly | Blues |
|:------------|:----------|:------|
| *Saddharmaparigraha* | "Embracing the true Dharma" | "Holding On to What's Real" |
| *Kalyāṇamitra* | "spiritual friends" | "your people" / "spiritual friends" |
| *Sadāprarudita* | "Ever-Weeping" | "Ever-Weeping" |
| *Māra avatāra* | "opening" for Māra | "Māra found no opening" |

**Score:** Scholarly 10/10, Blues 9/10

**Note:** Blues terminology ("your people") is culturally resonant and doctrinally sound. The theological notes clarify the equivalences.

---

### 4. VERNACULAR INTEGRITY (Blues Only)

The Blues version successfully maps Buddhist concepts to African-American spiritual idiom:

- **"Your people"** = *kalyāṇamitra* (spiritual friends/congregation)
- **"Holding on to what's real"** = *saddharmaparigraha*
- **Blood-offering** = resonance with "washed in the blood" spirituality
- **Feminine presence** (merchant's daughter) highlighted appropriately

The five theological notes provide essential bridges between traditions.

**Score:** 9/10

### 5. GHOST CHARACTERS (Omitted Content)

**None detected.** Both versions include:
- Kārikās 5 and 6
- Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa teaching
- Vīradattaparipṛcchā, Akṣayamatisūtra
- Gaṇḍavyūha quotations (Śrīsaṃbhava, Acalā, Sudhana)
- Full Sadāprarudita story
- Śrīmālāsiṃhanādasūtra (one great vow, blow to Māra, Mount Sumeru)
- Sāgaramatisūtra verses

---

### 6. OVER-TRANSLATION (Added Content)

| Version | Finding | Severity |
|:--------|:--------|:---------|
| Scholarly | No significant over-translation | None |
| Blues | Addition of "your merit" in Kārikā 6 | **Moderate** |
| Blues | Rhetorical flourishes ("gonna," "fed") | Minor (stylistic) |

---

## Recommendations

### For Scholarly Version
- ✓ No changes required. Exemplary fidelity.

### For Blues Version
- **Critical:** Revise Kārikā 6 rendering:
  - **Current:** "That's how you protect yourself, your goods, your merit—everything."
  - **Revised:** "That's how you protect yourself, your goods—all of it."
- **Minor:** Consider adding translator's note clarifying "Holding on to what's real" = *saddharmaparigraha*

---

## Overall Assessment

**Scholarly Version:** Exemplary academic translation. Preserves all doctrinal content with appropriate scholarly apparatus.

**Blues Version:** Strong vernacular translation demonstrating *upāya-kauśalya* (skillful means). The one over-translation issue is minor and easily corrected. The theological notes successfully bridge Buddhist and African-American spiritual traditions.

**Verdict:** Both versions approved for publication pending the noted correction.
