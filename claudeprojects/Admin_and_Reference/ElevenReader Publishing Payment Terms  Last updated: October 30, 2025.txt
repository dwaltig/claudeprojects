ElevenReader Publishing Payment Terms

Last updated: October 30, 2025

These ElevenReader Publishing Program Payment Terms (“ElevenReader Publishing Program Payment Terms”) supplement your agreement with ElevenLabs (“Underlying ElevenLabs Agreement”) or, if no separate agreement exists, the ElevenLabs Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) and ElevenReader Publishing Program Terms of Service (“ElevenReader Publishing Program Terms of Service”, together with these ElevenReader Publishing Program Payment Terms and the Terms of Service or Underlying ElevenLabs Agreement, the “Terms”) to the extent you are eligible for, and have elected to participate in, the Program. Capitalized terms used but not defined in these ElevenReader Publishing Program Payment Terms will have the meaning set forth in the ElevenReader Publishing Program Terms of Service. We may amend the Terms or suspend or cancel the Program at our discretion, effective immediately upon notice to you. 

By participating in the Program, you agree to be bound by the Terms, as may be amended from time to time. If you do not accept these Terms, you are not authorized to participate in the Program and must immediately withdraw your User Content from distribution and cease all participation in the Program. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company or entity, the individual accepting these Terms on its behalf represents and warrants that they are an authorized representative with the authority to bind that entity to these Terms. 

To the extent there is any irreconcilable conflict between these ElevenReader Publishing Program Payment Terms and the Underlying ElevenLabs Agreement, Terms of Service, or ElevenReader Publishing Program Terms of Service, these ElevenReader Publishing Program Payment Terms shall prevail solely to the extent of any conflict and with respect to the subject matter expressly addressed herein. 

THESE ELEVENREADER PUBLISHING PROGRAM PAYMENT TERMS CONTAIN VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY IN SECTION 5.

1. List Price and Credits.

a. List Price. You may set the retail price for each Title you offer through the Program (“List Price”) (e.g., $9.99). The List Price is the base price available to End Users purchasing your Title through ElevenReader. For clarity, ElevenLabs shall comply with tax-inclusive display rules and will include applicable Indirect Taxes in displayed List Prices where required by law; where not required or permitted, Indirect Taxes may be shown and added at checkout. We may localize your List Price across currencies by applying standard foreign exchange and regional tiering required by platform providers; localized prices may be rounded to the nearest permitted tier. Where Indirect Taxes are included in the displayed List Price, Net Revenue will be calculated after backing out such taxes that are remitted or withheld. Where Indirect Taxes are excluded, such taxes will be added at checkout and deducted before Net Revenue is computed. We may reject or adjust List Prices that would result in negative Net Revenue after mandatory deductions or that violate platform pricing rules or applicable law. For in-purchases fulfilled by an App Store, price presentation, currency tiering, checkout flows, and any required tax collection and remittance are implemented by the applicable platform (which may act as merchant of record); the platform’s terms and policies govern those transactions, and ElevenLabs does not assume responsibility for the platform’s compliance with price-display, tax-disclosure, or billing requirements.

b. Promotions and Discounts. Subject to platform rules and applicable law:

    We may run price promotions, markdowns, coupons, or Credits-based offers for your Titles. Unless you opt out of a given promotion (where an opt-out is offered) or a promotion is specifically “author-funded,” ElevenLabs will fund the discount and your Payout will be calculated from Net Revenue determined using the discounted end-user price actually received.
    You may designate promotional List Prices (including limited-time sales) through the dashboard. Promotional List Prices you set apply prospectively and remain subject to platform tiering/foreign exchange rules. 

c. Credits. We may offer End Users the ability to purchase or redeem Credits for Titles. We reserve the right to determine the applicable conversion rates between Credits and List Prices, which may vary by region, currency, or promotional offer. Your Payouts are calculated based on the List Price you set, regardless of whether End Users pay with Credits or cash, less applicable deductions defined in Net Revenue.

2. Net Revenue and Payout Rate.

a. Net Revenue. “Net Revenue” means the gross amount actually received by ElevenLabs from the sale of your Titles to End Users, less any applicable (i) platform or marketplace fees (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store) and distribution costs, (ii) payment processing fees (e.g., Stripe), (iii) refunds, reversals, or chargebacks, and (iv) Indirect Taxes (as defined below) collected or withheld on sales (including Indirect Taxes included in the displayed List Price where tax-inclusive pricing is required) and any other mandatory withholdings or levies required by law or platform policy. ElevenLabs will not intentionally set effective end-user pricing or effect discounts that would result in negative Net Revenue for a transaction. ElevenLabs may reject or adjust List Prices that would result in negative Net Revenue after applicable deductions.

b. Payout Rate. Your Payout will be sixty percent (60%) of Net Revenue, unless otherwise agreed in writing. For example, if your Title is listed at $9.99 and purchased via an App Store that deducts a thirty percent (30%) platform fee, you would receive sixty percent (60%) of the resulting Net Revenue after the platform fee and any applicable Indirect Taxes are deducted. 

c. In-App and Website Purchases. Your Payout is calculated consistently regardless of whether a purchase occurs through an in-app purchase (subject to App Store fees) or direct purchase through our Website purchased via Stripe (subject to standard payment processing fees).

3. Payouts and Payment Terms.

a. Payout Eligibility. To receive Payouts, you must maintain an active, compliant Stripe Connect account and provide all information and documentation we reasonably request, including tax and identity verification. Participation is not available where prohibited by export-control laws, sanctions, or restricted-country lists. If Stripe or applicable payment infrastructure is unavailable in your jurisdiction, we may not be able to disburse Payouts until availability is restored; eligibility is determined at disbursement, not accrual.

b. Payout Threshold. Payouts will only be made once your accrued earnings reach a minimum of ten dollars ($10 USD) (“Payout Threshold”). Amounts under the Payout Threshold will roll over to the next payout cycle. Any accrued amounts below the Payment Threshold will be paid out once per calendar year. Payouts will be made to you in United States Dollars (USD) (“Payable Currency”). Bank fees, foreign exchange charges, or intermediary fees assessed by your financial institution are your responsibility and may reduce the amount you receive

c. Payout Timing. We will use reasonable efforts to process eligible Payouts on a monthly cadence, typically within sixty (60) days after the end of the calendar month during which they accrue, subject to (i) successful receipt of corresponding funds from the applicable platform providers (e.g., Apple, Google, or Stripe), and (ii) our standard compliance reviews. Stripe’s processing times may add an additional three (3) to five (5) business days for bank transfers. You are responsible for maintaining accurate payout information with Stripe. Payouts may be delayed for investigations of suspected fraud, abuse, or compliance issues.

d. Reporting. We may make available to you certain metrics and reports in our sole discretion, such metrics shall be accessible under the “Reports” tab on your account dashboard (the “Report”). Reports are provided for your convenience and may be updated or corrected. Where applicable, ElevenLabs’ server-side telemetry and logs are the authoritative source for measurements affecting Payouts. You must notify us in writing of any good-faith dispute regarding a Report within sixty (60) days after the Report is made available; otherwise, the Report will be deemed final for payout purposes. 

e. In-App and Website Purchases. Your Payouts are calculated consistently regardless of whether the End User purchases a Title via an in-app purchase (subject to App Store fees) or via the Website (subject to payment processing fees). Timing and reconciliation may differ by channel. 

f. Refunds and Adjustments. In the event of a refund, reversal, chargeback, or adjustment related to a purchase of your Title, ElevenLabs may deduct corresponding amounts from your future Payouts or adjust your earnings accordingly. Refund activity may not be immediately reflected in your dashboard.

g. Offsets. Without limiting anything in the Underlying ElevenLabs Agreement or ElevenReader Publishing Program Terms of Service, we may withhold, offset, or deduct from any Payouts due to you any amounts you own to ElevenLabs under these Terms, including amounts arising from refunds, chargebacks, indemnification obligations, or payment arising from your breach of the Terms or any invalid activity detected by us, including but not limited to artificial activity using any bot, script or other automated or manual means. Your payment may be delayed while we are investigating invalid activity. If our investigation ascertains that there is no breach, then we will resume payment. We shall only withhold payment to the extent of any such abuse.

h. Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, payments under these Terms are exclusive of any value-added tax (“VAT”), goods and services tax (“GST”), harmonized sales tax (“HST”), sales taxes, or similar taxes, duties, charges, or assessments (“Indirect Taxes”). You are responsible for determining and remitting any Indirect Taxes that you are legally obligated to pay. If ElevenLabs is required to remit Indirect Taxes on your behalf, ElevenLabs will deduct such taxes before payment to you and remit them to the appropriate tax authority. You agree to provide any necessary documentation (e.g., exemption certificates, VAT registration numbers) to assist ElevenLabs in complying with local tax laws, where applicable. ElevenLabs reserves the right to withhold taxes on Payouts if required by law and deposit the amounts with the relevant tax authority (e.g., the IRS). Specifically, ElevenLabs may withhold income taxes from payments to U.S. or non-U.S. persons if appropriate tax documentation (e.g., IRS Form W-9 or Form W-8BEN) is not provided prior to payment. Failure to provide valid tax documentation may result in increased withholding, as required by law. If VAT or GST applies under a reverse charge mechanism for cross-border transactions, you agree to self-assess and remit such taxes directly to the appropriate authority. In jurisdictions where VAT/GST is collected and remitted by the payer, ElevenLabs will comply with its obligations as required by local legislation. ElevenLabs will comply with all applicable tax reporting requirements, including filing information returns (e.g., Forms 1099-NEC, 1099-MISC, or 1042-S) and providing a copy of such returns to the payment recipient, as required by law. Both parties agree to maintain relevant documentation necessary to comply with the applicable tax laws or respond to tax audits or inquiries.

4. Content Standards and Enforcement.

a. Compliance. You must comply with all applicable laws, the ElevenReader Publishing Content Guidelines, and the Terms to receive Payouts. ElevenLabs reserves the right to suspend or terminate your participation in the Program, withhold Payouts, or remove your Titles if you violate any applicable policy or guideline.

b. Account Suspension and Forfeiture. If your account is suspended or terminated for a violation of ElevenLabs’ guidelines or policies, any unpaid Payouts may be withheld or forfeited at ElevenLabs’ discretion.

5. General. 

a. Reservation of Rights. ElevenLabs reserves the right, at any time and in its sole discretion, to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Program or any part thereof without liability to you.

b. Modifications. We may modify these ElevenReader Publishing Program Payment Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated to you at least thirty (30) days in advance. Your continued participation in the Program following notice of any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated ElevenReader Publishing Program Payment Terms. We may, however, implement changes sooner where necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulatory requirements.

c. Territorial Controls. You may elect to make your Titles available in specific geographic regions. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your Titles comply with all local laws, regulations, and restrictions in each region where you distribute them. Payout and monetization features may not be available in all territories, and ElevenLabs reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine which territories are eligible for Payouts and to modify such eligibility from time to time for compliance, operational, or risk management reasons.

d. No Responsibility for Local Compliance. ElevenLabs does not assume responsibility for your compliance obligations in any particular territory. You must manage territorial availability settings through your ElevenReader account.

e. Limitation of Liability. To the fullest extent permitted by law, ElevenLabs shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, arising from your participation in the Program.

f. No Guarantee of Earnings. Participation in the Program does not guarantee any particular level of revenue or engagement. Earnings may vary based on market factors, user behavior, or changes to ElevenLabs’ pricing, credit, or promotional models. ElevenLabs does not guarantee the availability of Payout functionality in any particular country or territory, and such availability may be determined, suspended, or modified by ElevenLabs in its sole discretion.

g. No Agency or Employment. Participation in the Program does not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or fiduciary relationship between you and ElevenLabs. You acknowledge and agree that you are acting independently and not on behalf of ElevenLabs.
