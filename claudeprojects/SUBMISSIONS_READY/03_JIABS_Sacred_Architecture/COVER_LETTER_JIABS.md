**Re:** Manuscript Submission — "The Sacred Architecture of Twenty-Eight"

---

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit "The Sacred Architecture of Twenty-Eight: Numerological Totality in Buddhist Canonical Literature" for consideration by the *Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies*.

This article advances a novel hypothesis regarding the structural history of Buddhist canonical literature. Drawing on John Brough's analysis of the *Gāndhārī Dharmapada* (1962), K.R. Norman's *Pāli Literature* (1983), and comparative textual criticism across the *Lotus Sūtra*, *Buddhavaṃsa*, and Abhidhamma, the paper proposes that the number twenty-eight functions as a deliberate architectonic principle across both Theravāda and Mahāyāna traditions.

The paper's central contribution is the "Ideal Canon Hypothesis": that an original twenty-eight-chapter *Dhammapada* may have existed, with evidence of structural merger preserved in the anomalously long twenty-sixth chapter (*Brāhmaṇavagga*, 41 verses). This hypothesis is presented with explicit defeat conditions (Section 7.5), ensuring testability and inviting scholarly critique.
