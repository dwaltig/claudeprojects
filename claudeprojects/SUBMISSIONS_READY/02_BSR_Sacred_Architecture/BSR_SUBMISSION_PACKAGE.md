**To:** The Editors, *Buddhist Studies Review*

**Subject:** Manuscript Submission — "The Sacred Architecture of Twenty-Eight: Numerological Totality in Buddhist Canonical Literature"

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit the attached manuscript, "The Sacred Architecture of Twenty-Eight: Numerological Totality in Buddhist Canonical Literature," for consideration in *Buddhist Studies Review*.

This article examines a previously unanalyzed phenomenon in Buddhist canonical literature: the recurring use of the number twenty-eight as a deliberate structural principle across both Theravāda and Mahāyāna traditions. By synthesizing evidence from the *Lotus Sūtra* (28 chapters), the *Buddhavaṃsa* (28 Buddhas), the *Buddhacarita* (28 cantos), and the Abhidhamma classification of 28 *rūpas*, I argue that twenty-eight functions as a symbol of cosmological totality rooted in the ancient Indian *nakṣatra* (lunar mansion) system.

The paper also advances a novel hypothesis: that the Pāli *Dhammapada* may originally have comprised twenty-eight chapters rather than its current twenty-six. Evidence includes the anomalous length of the final chapter (*Brāhmaṇavagga*, 41 verses), the absence of a dedicated *Nibbānavagga*, and comparative analysis with John Brough's work on the Gāndhārī Dharmapada and the Sanskrit *Udānavarga*.

This cross-traditional, philologically grounded study aligns well with BSR's commitment to rigorous textual scholarship in Buddhist Studies.
