Subject: REVISED MANUSCRIPT: "The Ten Suchnesses and IIT" (Submission Correction)

Dear Graham,

I submitted a manuscript titled "The Ten Suchnesses and Integrated Information Theory: Structural Parallels Between Tiantai Buddhism and Consciousness Science" yesterday (December 29, 2025).

On final review, I decided to remove a section ("Section 6: Non-Local Phenomenology") that I felt was too speculative and detracted from the paper's core structural argument.

Please accept the attached file ("JCS_SUBMISSION_REVISED_DEC30.docx") as the definitive version for peer review. It focuses strictly on the structural isomorphism between the Ten Suchnesses and IIT's axioms, without the additional phenomenological speculation.

Thank you for your patience with this update.

Sincerely,
