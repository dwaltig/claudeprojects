## Module 3: Novelty Delta Assessment

### Article 1: Voice, Persona, Sacred Text (DHQ)
**Core Thesis:** First documented TTS methodology for multi-speaker Buddhist sacred texts.

**The "William Altig" Delta:**

- ✅ **Personal context:** "While translating the Lotus Sutra" — practitioner/translator perspective
- ✅ **Calibrated confidence:** 60% confidence explicitly stated
- ✅ **Original readings:** Dragon Girl as phase transition, Wonderful Sound as boundary dissolution

**Status:** ✅ PASS — Unique interdisciplinary contribution
