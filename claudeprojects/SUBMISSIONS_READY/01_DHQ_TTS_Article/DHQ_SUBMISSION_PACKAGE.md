## Cover Letter

**To:** Editorial Board, Digital Humanities Quarterly  
**Email:** submissions@digitalhumanities.org  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Article Title:** Voice, Persona, and Sacred Text: TTS Rendering of Buddhist Sutras

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit "Voice, Persona, and Sacred Text: TTS Rendering of Buddhist Sutras" for consideration by Digital Humanities Quarterly for the January 15, 2025 quarterly review.

This article presents the first documented methodology for text-to-speech audio production of multi-speaker Buddhist sacred texts, addressing a gap at the intersection of digital humanities, multimodal textual studies, and accessible sacred text preservation.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Answers Patrik's 2007 Call**: Linda Patrik's DHQ article "Encoding for Endangered Tibetan Texts" called for multimodal preservation linking audio to transcriptions. This article provides the methodology.

2. **Three Methodological Innovations**:
   - Character-to-voice mapping (15 voices, 532 tags, narrative function-based assignment)
   - Verse optimization (20.6% average token reduction)
   - Quality control procedures (git version control, UTF-8 verification)

3. **Cost Democratization**: $300-1,000 production cost (93-99.5% reduction vs. professional narration), making sutra audio feasible for small Buddhist organizations.

4. **Replicable Framework**: Transferable to other character-driven sacred texts (Qur'an, Bhagavad Gita, Torah, Homeric epics).

The article includes explicit falsification conditions and acknowledges limitations (n=5 listener sample, prosodic trade-offs, platform dependency).

**Word count:** ~7,200 words  
**Figures:** 2 (embedded in manuscript)

I confirm this work is original scholarship not under review elsewhere. I have secured permissions for all images (original figures).

Sincerely,

William Altig
