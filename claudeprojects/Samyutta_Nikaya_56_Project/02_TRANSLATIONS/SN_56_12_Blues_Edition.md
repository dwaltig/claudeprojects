# SN 56.12: Tathāgata Sutta — Blues Edition
## The One Who Saw It First

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

## The Source Text

**Saṁyutta Nikāya 56.12 — Tathāgatasutta**

This sutta is a condensed meditation on what makes a Buddha a Buddha: he *saw* the Four Noble Truths when no one else could. For each truth, the text repeats three phases:
1. **Sacca-ñāṇa** — "This is the truth" (recognition)
2. **Kicca-ñāṇa** — "This is what must be done" (task)
3. **Kata-ñāṇa** — "This has been done" (completion)

**Key Pali phrase (repeated 12 times):**
> *"cakkhuṁ udapādi, ñāṇaṁ udapādi, paññā udapādi, vijjā udapādi, āloko udapādi"*
> "The eye arose, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, true understanding arose, light arose."

## Review of the Scholarly Text

**Strengths**: The sutta is highly repetitive and formulaic — clearly designed for memorization and chanting. Each Noble Truth gets the same three-phase treatment.

**Additional Nuances**: The power here is in the *repetition itself*. This isn't narrative — it's a mantra. The Bluesman version should honor that repetitive, hypnotic quality. It's about the LIGHT arising — five times per truth, twelve times total.

## The Blues Truth

### The Teaching

Listen, brothers and sisters.

What makes a Tathāgata — a "Thus-Gone-One," a Buddha — different from you and me?

He saw it first.

When nobody else could see it — when the whole world was blind — the eye opened. Knowledge rose up. Wisdom came through. True understanding landed. And light... light broke through the darkness.

**The Blues Truth:**

> "This is the path to the end of suffering" — and the eye opened.
> Knowledge rose up in me.

### Closing

That's what happened, brothers and sisters.

Twelve times the eye opened.
Twelve times the light broke through.

In things never heard before.
In territory no one had walked.

That's why he's the Tathāgata.
He saw it first.
And now we can see it too.

## Blues Notes

- **Tathāgata** (तथागत): "Thus-Gone-One" or "Thus-Come-One" — a title for the Buddha meaning one who has "arrived at truth" or "gone to truth."

- **The Twelve Knowledges**: The sutta describes four truths × three phases = twelve distinct moments of awakening. This is called the "twelvefold turning of the wheel."

- **Repetitive Structure**: The Pali is highly formulaic — designed for chanting. The Blues version honors this with a refrain that repeats. In Blues tradition, repetition builds power.

- **"pubbe ananussutesu dhammesu"** — "in things never heard before." The Buddha discovered this without a teacher. That's the radical claim.
