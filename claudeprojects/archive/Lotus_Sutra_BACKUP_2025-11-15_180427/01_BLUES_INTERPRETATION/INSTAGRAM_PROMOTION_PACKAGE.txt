INSTAGRAM POST #2: THE STORY (MORE PERSONAL)
================================================================================

CAPTION:
Why Blues + Buddha?

The blues and the Lotus Sutra come from the same place.

Both speak to suffering and transformation.
Both celebrate human dignity.
Both offer freedom through community, music, and dharma.

For 40+ years, I've been exploring this connection. Translating. Practicing.
Listening.

Now the complete audiobook brings these two traditions together.

28 chapters of wisdom. Blues vernacular. Gospel soul. Buddhist dharma.

Coming Soon 🎵🌸

This is what 40+ years of practice looks like.

The Lotus Sutra is one of Buddhism's most revolutionary texts. It says that
enlightenment is available to ALL beings—no exceptions.

I've been translating it into the spiritual language of African American blues
and gospel tradition because I believe these two wisdom traditions need to speak
to each other.

Now the complete audiobook brings them together.

28 chapters. 200,000+ words. One lifetime of dharma.

================================================================================
HASHTAG RESEARCH TIPS
================================================================================

Check hashtag performance:
1. Search a hashtag on Instagram
2. Look at "Top Posts" and "Recent Posts"
3. See how many posts use it
4. If 100K-1M posts: Use it (good reach)
5. If 10K-100K posts: Excellent niche match
6. If under 10K: Very niche (followers will see you)

Your hashtags should mix:
- 5-10 large hashtags (500K+ posts)
- 10-15 medium hashtags (100K-500K posts)
- 5-10 small hashtags (10K-100K posts)

This balances reach and relevance!

================================================================================

✓ Impressions: How many times your post was seen
✓ Reach: How many unique people saw it
✓ Engagement: Likes, comments, saves, shares
✓ Saves: People saving your post (high value!)
✓ Profile visits: Click-throughs to your profile
✓ Follower growth: New followers per week
