This chapter is all about **being seen and being named**—one of the most powerful acts in any tradition. The Buddha is saying: "I see you. I know who you are. And I'm gonna tell you who you're going to become."

**Key Metaphors and Choices:**

1. **"The Naming" as the chapter title** - In blues and gospel traditions, naming carries profound power. To be named is to be called into existence, to have your destiny spoken aloud. The Buddha isn't just predicting; he's recognizing and affirming who these disciples already are and will be.

2. **"I see him clear, I see where he's going by and by"** - The blues has always been about seeing clearly, about truth-telling. The Buddha's vision isn't mystical abstraction; it's recognition, the way a master bluesman sees the music in a young player.

3. **The disciples' request: "Like a hungry man needs to feast"** - They use this metaphor themselves in the Chinese text. The hunger for recognition, for validation, for being seen—this is human hunger at its deepest. They're saying: "We heard you say it, but we're still scared to believe it. We need you to say our names."

4. **Each prophecy's details matter** - The specifics aren't filler. Each Buddha-name, each world-name, each measurement tells these disciples: "This is real. This is particular. This is YOUR future, not just anybody's." That's why I kept the details—the twelve ages, the twenty ages, the crystal ground, the jeweled towers. Particularity is how love speaks.

5. **"In his very last body"** - This phrase recurs like a refrain, like the turn in a blues verse. It marks the culmination, the arrival, the moment when all that walking finally gets you home.

6. **The Buddha's epithets** - I kept the full tenfold list for each Buddha-to-be because in oral tradition, repetition isn't redundancy—it's respect, it's rhythm, it's the way you mark something sacred.

The emotional arc is everything here: The disciples are trembling, palms together, unable to look away. They're hungry. They're scared to hope. And then the Buddha calls each name, one by one, and tells them exactly who they're going to be. That's the blues truth: Sometimes you need someone who can see to tell you who you are, so you can walk into who you're gonna be.
