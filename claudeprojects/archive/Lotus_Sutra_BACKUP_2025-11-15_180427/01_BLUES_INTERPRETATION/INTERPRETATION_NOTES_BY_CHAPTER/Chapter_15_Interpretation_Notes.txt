This is the chapter where everything the assembly thought they knew gets turned upside down. They thought Śākyamuni Buddha was a man who lived 80 years ago, who attained enlightenment 40 years back under a tree. But now he's revealing students—vast numbers of students, accomplished students, ancient students—who've been practicing for countless ages.

The math don't work. The timeline don't work. It's impossible.

Unless... unless the Buddha is something other than what they thought. Unless his life is deeper than one lifetime. Unless time itself works different when it comes to the Dharma-body of a Buddha.

That's what Chapter 16 gonna reveal: the Buddha's eternal life, his ancient original enlightenment. But here in Chapter 15, we sitting in the shock of it—in Maitreya's bewildered question, in the image of the 25-year-old father with hundred-year-old sons.

The four great leaders got names that tell you what practice looks like when it's been going on for ages:
- Superior Practice: Not just practicing, but practicing at the highest level
- Boundless Practice: Practice without edges, without limits
- Pure Practice: Practice that ain't corrupted, ain't compromised
- Well-Established Practice: Practice that's rooted deep, that can't be shaken

They burst from the earth—from underneath, from below, from the hidden places. They been there all along, preparing, waiting, practicing in the dark, in the quiet, in the deep.

That's the power of this chapter: the revelation that the real work been happening out of sight, beneath the surface, in the underground. And when the time comes, when the call goes out, that hidden strength rises up—a vast army, a golden flood, a force that fills all space.

The church been praying in the basement all this time. And now it's time to come upstairs.
