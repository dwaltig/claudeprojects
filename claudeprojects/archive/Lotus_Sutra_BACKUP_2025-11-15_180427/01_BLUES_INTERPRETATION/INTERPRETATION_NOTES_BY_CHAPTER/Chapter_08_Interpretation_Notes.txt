This chapter is the heart of the Lotus Sutra's democratic revelation - the moment when the "ordinary" disciples discover they've been carrying Buddha-nature all along without knowing it. The central parable of the jewel sewn into the robe is one of the most powerful images in Buddhist literature, and it speaks directly to the blues tradition's understanding of hidden dignity, forgotten promise, and the shocking grace of recognition.

**Key metaphorical choices:**

1. **"Full Son" for Pūrṇa** - His name literally means "full" (pūrṇa), and "Maitrāyaṇīputra" means "son of Maitrāyaṇī," so "Full Son" captures both elements in vernacular English that sounds natural when spoken aloud.

2. **"Preacher man"** - Pūrṇa's designation as foremost in teaching the Dharma translates naturally to the African American religious tradition's "preacher," a figure of respect and power.

3. **"Getting drunk and passing out"** - The original Chinese "醉酒而臥" is frank about intoxication. The blues tradition doesn't sanitize human weakness - it names it directly while holding space for redemption.

4. **"Scraping for food and clothes"** - The original describes arduous struggle for basic survival ("為衣食故，勤力求索，甚大艱難"). This directly parallels the blues tradition's unflinching acknowledgment of poverty and hard times.

5. **"Man! Brother! Why you out here struggling like this?"** - The original "咄哉、丈夫" is an exclamation of shock and dismay. The blues vernacular "Man! Brother!" captures that emotional directness.

6. **"I sewed a priceless jewel into the lining of your robe"** - This image is preserved exactly because it's already perfect - concrete, specific, shocking. The hidden wealth sewn into the garment of someone who doesn't know they're carrying it speaks across centuries and cultures.

7. **Rhythm and repetition** - The verse sections employ call-and-response patterns, internal rhyme, and rhythmic repetition that would work when sung or chanted. "One by one," "day by day," "that's right," "you see" - these create musical flow.

8. **Direct address** - The translation consistently uses "you" and "we," speaking person-to-person rather than lecturer-to-student, maintaining the oral tradition's intimacy.

The spiritual truth here is universal: we've been wandering in poverty thinking we're far from home, when all along we've been carrying everything we need. We settled for small blessings when infinite blessing was sewn into our very garments. The Buddha (like the true friend) doesn't give us something new - he reveals what we've had all along but forgot. This is the blues revelation: you been somebody all along, child. You just forgot. Now remember.
