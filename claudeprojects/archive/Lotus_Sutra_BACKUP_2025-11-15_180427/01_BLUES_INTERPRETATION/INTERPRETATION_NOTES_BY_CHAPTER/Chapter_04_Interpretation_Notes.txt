This blues vernacular rendering of the Prodigal Son parable preserves the emotional architecture of Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese while translating it into the idiom of the blues tradition - a tradition that knows intimately about leaving home, hard times, shame, fear, fathers who wait, and unexpected inheritance.

Key metaphorical choices:
- "One day's wages" for nirvāṇa - the limited payment that seemed like everything
- "Dung-shoveling" as the humble spiritual work the disciples thought was all they were fit for
- The father's patient skillful means shown through concrete gestures: changing clothes, picking up the shovel, working alongside
- The son's "low-down feeling" and "poverty consciousness" as psychological realism
- The inheritance "coming naturally" without seeking - grace, not achievement

The parable tracks the journey from:
- Self-imposed limitation → recognition of true identity
- Day laborer → heir
- Poverty consciousness → knowing the wealth was always yours
- Shame and fear → joy and homecoming

This is the blues truth: sometimes what's keeping us poor ain't the world - it's what we think about ourselves. And sometimes there's a father who's been waiting all along, ready to give us everything, soon as we ready to receive it.
