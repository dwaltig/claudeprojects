This chapter is about the mathematics of grace—the impossible calculation that one moment of faith outweighs eons of effort. It's the scandal at the heart of the Dharma: you can work for billions of lifetimes doing everything right, or you can simply believe for one instant what the Buddha revealed in Chapter 16 (his eternal life), and that one instant of faith generates more merit.

The blues/gospel tradition knows this paradox well—salvation by grace, not by works; the last made first; the thief on the cross entering paradise that very day. The structure of this chapter—the counting, the comparison, the shock, the celebration—mirrors revival meeting testimonies where people try to count up what God has done and the numbers just keep climbing until words fail.

Key metaphors preserved:
- **Dust particles**: The traditional Buddhist way of counting the uncountable, here rendered plainly to let the accumulation itself create wonder
- **The invisible monastery**: What faith builds spiritually is more real than what hands build physically—a pure blues theology move
- **The stupa wherever they stand**: Sacred ground is made by sacred presence, not by construction projects
- **One thought-moment of faith**: The instant of belief that changes everything—conversion experience, moment of grace

The tone shifts between astonishment (the opening counting), celebration (heaven's response), instruction (Buddha's explanation), and prophetic recognition (you're already there, you just don't know it yet). All of these are familiar movements in blues/gospel expression, which regularly moves from testimony to praise to teaching to vision within a single song or sermon.

The repetition of "as many as dust particles" functions like the repetitive counting in spirituals and gospel songs—"ten thousand angels," "million years," "all God's children"—where the piling up of large numbers creates a sense of abundance beyond grasping, grace beyond measuring.
