This translation renders Chapter 5 (藥草喻品) into blues vernacular, maintaining the core teaching while making it accessible through everyday language and imagery familiar to the African American oral tradition.

**Key Metaphors:**

THE RAIN = The Buddha's teaching, falling equally on everyone
THE PLANTS = Living beings with different capacities (small herbs, medium herbs, large herbs, small trees, great trees)
ONE FLAVOR = The single truth of liberation taught in many ways
THE GROWTH = Each being's progress according to their nature and capacity

**The Five Types of Plants:**

1. **Small medicinal herbs** (小藥草) = Humans, gods, worldly kings - those seeking worldly happiness
2. **Medium medicinal herbs** (中藥草) = Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas seeking personal liberation
3. **Superior medicinal herbs** (上藥草) = Beginning bodhisattvas aspiring to buddhahood
4. **Small trees** (小樹) = Established bodhisattvas certain of their future buddhahood
5. **Great trees** (大樹) = Advanced bodhisattvas with spiritual powers saving countless beings

**Core Teaching:**

This parable addresses the paradox at the heart of the Lotus Sutra: How can there be "one vehicle" when beings seem to attain different results? The answer: The teaching is one (like one rain), but beings receive it according to their capacity (like different plants). The rain doesn't discriminate - the plants take what they can hold. Similarly, the Buddha teaches the one Dharma of liberation, but beings understand and practice at different levels.

The blues vernacular makes this democratic vision concrete: like rain falling on rich and poor alike, like grace that doesn't pick favorites, the Buddha's teaching is available to everyone. What you receive depends on what you can hold, what you're ready for - but the offering is universal and impartial.

The final revelation (lines 1697-1699) is crucial: Even the śrāvakas who think they've reached final nirvāṇa are actually on the bodhisattva path - they just don't know it yet. They're still growing. The rain is still falling. The journey continues.

**Why Blues Language?**

The blues tradition understands:
- Universal suffering and universal grace
- The democracy of hardship and hope
- One truth received differently by different people
- The patience of gradual growth
- The impartiality of what falls from heaven (rain, grace, teaching)

This parable, in the blues telling, becomes a song about how wisdom comes to everyone but each person takes what they can hold - and that's not failure, that's nature. The rain keeps falling. You keep growing. And one day, that little herb might become a mighty tree.
