    <h1>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN: THE BEAUTIFUL KING AND HIS GOOD FRIENDS</h1>
    <h2>(A Story About Love That Won't Let You Stay Lost)</h2>

    <p>Listen now, the Buddha stood before that great crowd and he told them straight:</p>
    <p>"Way back, so far back you can't count it—more lifetimes ago than there are grains of sand in all the rivers that ever run—there was a Buddha named Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened One. His land was called Light-Bright-Adorned, and that age, that time, they called it the Age of Joy-Seeing.</p>
    <p>"Now in that Buddha's teaching, there was a king. They called him Beautiful King. And his queen, she went by the name Pure Virtue. They had two boys—one named Pure Storehouse, the other called Pure Eye. And listen here, these two boys, they weren't no ordinary children. No sir. They had great spiritual power. They had merit and wisdom built up deep. They'd been walking that Bodhisattva road for a long, long time, you understand? They knew all about giving and virtue and patience and effort and meditation and wisdom. They knew about skillful means. They understood compassion and joy and equanimity—all thirty-seven paths that help you along the way, they had those down cold. They could enter all kinds of deep meditation states—the Pure Samadhi, the Sun-Star-Dwelling Samadhi, the Pure Light Samadhi, the Pure Color Samadhi, the Pure Illuminating Samadhi, the Long-Adorning Samadhi, the Great-Mighty-Virtue-Treasury Samadhi. All these deep stillnesses, they knew them through and through.</p>
    <p>"Now that Buddha, Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom, he wanted to guide that Beautiful King onto the right path. He had compassion for all living beings, you see. So he preached this Lotus Sutra, this very teaching right here.</p>
    <p>"And when he did, those two boys—Pure Storehouse and Pure Eye—they went to their mama. They put their palms together, fingers all joined up respectful-like, and they said: 'Mama, we wish you would go see that Buddha, Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom. We want to go with you, serve him, honor him, bow down before him. You know why? Because this Buddha, he's teaching this Lotus Sutra right now to all the heavenly beings and all the human folks. We need to hear it. We got to receive it.'</p>
    <p>"Their mama, she looked at them boys and said: 'Your daddy, he believes in outside teachings. He's deep into that Brahmin religion, got it in his bones. Y'all need to go talk to your father, see if he'll come along with us.'</p>
    <p>"Pure Storehouse and Pure Eye, they put their hands together again and said to their mama: 'Mama, we are sons of the Dharma King. But we been born into this house of wrong views.'</p>
    <p>"Their mother said: 'You boys need to think about your father. You need to show him some supernatural signs, some wonders. If he can see something that shakes him, his heart might get clear. His mind might get pure. Then maybe he'll let us go to where that Buddha is.'</p>

    <p>"So those two sons, thinking about their daddy, they rose up into the air. They went up high—seven palm-tree heights into the sky. And then they started showing all kinds of miraculous transformations. Up there in space, they walked and they stood and they sat and they lay down. Water poured out the top of their bodies while fire blazed from their feet. Then water poured from their feet while fire blazed from their heads. One minute they got huge, filling up the whole sky. Next minute they got tiny as a mustard seed. Then huge again. Then small. They disappeared in the air and suddenly showed up on the ground. They walked into earth like it was water. They walked on water like it was solid ground. They showed all manner of supernatural wonders like this, trying to make their father's heart clean, trying to make his mind believe.</p>
    <p>"When that father-king saw what his sons could do, his heart filled up with joy—great joy he'd never felt before. He put his palms together toward his boys and said: 'Who is your teacher? Whose disciples are you?'</p>
    <p>"The two sons answered: 'Great King, that Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom—right now he's sitting under the seven-jeweled enlightenment tree on the Dharma seat, and he's teaching this Lotus Sutra to all the gods and humans gathered there. He is our teacher. We are his students.'</p>
    <p>"The father said to his sons: 'I want to see your teacher too. Let's all go together.'</p>
    <p>"So those two boys came down from the sky and went to their mother. They put their palms together and said: 'Mama, Daddy's heart is open now. He's ready to awaken to supreme perfect enlightenment. We've done the Buddha's work for our father. Now please, Mama, let us leave home and practice the way under that Buddha.'</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>Mama, please let us go,<br>
        Let us leave this home, become monks on the road,<br>
        Buddhas are hard to find, Mama, harder than you know,<br>
        We gonna follow this Buddha wherever he goes.</p>
        <p>Like that udumbara flower—you might wait forever,<br>
        Meeting a Buddha is rarer than rare, now or never,<br>
        Getting free from suffering, that's hard too,<br>
        Mama, please let us go, let us walk this path through.</p>
    </div>

    <p>"Their mother said right away: 'I'll let you leave home. You know why? Because Buddhas are hard to meet, that's why.'</p>
    <p>"Then the two boys spoke to both their parents: 'Good! Good, Father! Good, Mother! Please, let's go right now to see Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom Buddha. Let's get close to him, serve him, honor him. You know why we're saying this? Because a Buddha is hard to meet—rare as the udumbara flower that blooms once in forever. Rare as a one-eyed turtle swimming in the ocean who happens to stick his head up through the hole in a floating log. But we got deep blessings from past lives, and we been born in a time when Buddha-teaching is alive. So Father, Mother, you got to let us leave home. Why? Because Buddhas are hard to meet, and the time when they're here don't come around often.'</p>

    <p>"Now at that time, Beautiful King had eighty-four thousand women in his palace, and every single one of them was ready to receive and hold this Lotus Sutra. Pure Eye Bodhisattva had long been deep in the Lotus Samadhi. Pure Storehouse Bodhisattva had, for countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of lifetimes, been deep in the Samadhi of Leaving All Evil Destinies—he wanted to help all beings escape suffering, you see. And the king's wife, Pure Virtue, she had the Samadhi Where All Buddhas Gather. She could know the secret treasuries of all the Buddhas.</p>
    <p>"So those two sons used skillful means. They taught their father well. They made his heart believe. They made him love the Buddha's way.</p>
    <p>"Then Beautiful King, along with all his ministers and attendants, and Pure Virtue the queen, along with all the palace women, and the king's two sons, along with forty-two thousand people—all of them together, at the same time, went to where the Buddha was. When they got there, they bowed their heads to his feet, walked around him three times to the right, then stood to one side.</p>

    <p>"That Buddha preached the Dharma to the king. He showed him, taught him, benefited him, gladdened him. The king's heart filled up with joy.</p>
    <p>"Then Beautiful King and his wife took off the pearl necklaces from around their necks—worth a hundred thousand in value—and scattered them over the Buddha. Up there in space, those necklaces turned into a four-pillared jeweled pavilion. Inside that pavilion was a great jeweled bed covered with hundreds of thousands of millions of heavenly cloths. On top of that bed sat a Buddha in full lotus position, shining great light.</p>
    <p>"Beautiful King thought to himself: 'The Buddha's body—it's so rare, so dignified, so special. It's accomplished the most subtle and wonderful form there is.'</p>
    <p>"Then Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom Buddha said to the four assemblies: 'Y'all see this Beautiful King standing here before me with his palms together? This king is gonna practice as a monk in my teaching. He's gonna work hard, gonna help the Buddha way. And he's gonna become a Buddha called Sal-Tree King. His land will be called Great Light, and that age will be called Great High King. That Sal-Tree King Buddha will have countless Bodhisattvas and countless disciples. His land will be level and straight. His merit will be like this.'</p>
    <p>"Right then and there, the king handed his kingdom over to his younger brother. Then he and his wife and his two sons and all his relatives left home in the Buddha's teaching to practice the way.</p>
    <p>"After the king left home, for eighty-four thousand years he kept at it, steady and hard, practicing this Wonderful Lotus Sutra. After that time passed, he gained the Samadhi of All Pure Merit Adornment. He rose up into space, seven palm-tree heights high, and said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, these two sons of mine have done the Buddha's work. Through supernatural transformations, they turned my wrong-headed mind around. They helped me settle down safe in the Buddha's teaching. They helped me see the World-Honored One. These two sons are my good spiritual friends. They wanted to wake up the good roots I'd planted in past lives. They wanted to benefit me. So they came and were born into my house.'</p>

    <p>"Then Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom Buddha said to Beautiful King: 'That's right. That's exactly right. Just like you said. When good men and good women plant good roots, life after life they meet good spiritual friends. And those good spiritual friends do the Buddha's work—they show, they teach, they benefit, they gladden, they help folks enter supreme perfect enlightenment. Great King, you need to know: good spiritual friends are the great cause, the great condition. They guide you, they help you see a Buddha, they help you awaken the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment.</p>
    <p>"'Great King, you see these two sons of yours? These two sons have already served and honored sixty-five hundred thousand million billion nayuta Ganges-sands of Buddhas. They've been close to all those Buddhas, respectful to all those Buddhas. In all those Buddha-places, they've received and held this Lotus Sutra. They have compassion for beings trapped in wrong views. They want to help people dwell in right seeing.'</p>
    <p>"Beautiful King came down from space and said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the Tathāgata is so rare. Because of your merit and wisdom, the flesh-bump on top of your head shines bright. Your eyes are long and wide and deep blue. The mark between your eyebrows is white like the bright moon. Your teeth are white and even and always shining. Your lips are red and beautiful like the bimba fruit.'</p>
    <p>"Then Beautiful King praised the Buddha's countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of virtues like this. Standing before the Tathāgata, with his palms joined together as one, he said again: 'World-Honored One, this has never happened before. The Tathāgata's teaching is complete, accomplished with inconceivable subtle and wonderful merit. The precepts and training you give—they're safe, they're peaceful, they're good. From this day forward, I will not follow my own mind's desires. I will not give birth to wrong views, arrogance, anger, or any evil thoughts.'</p>
    <p>"When he finished saying this, he bowed to the Buddha and left.</p>

    <p>The Buddha told the great assembly:</p>
    <p>"What do y'all think? Was Beautiful King some other person? No. He is now Flower Virtue Bodhisattva right here. And Pure Virtue, his wife—she is now the Bodhisattva Light-Shining-Adornment-Mark who's here before this Buddha. Out of compassion for Beautiful King and all his relatives, she was born into that world then.</p>
    <p>"And those two sons? They are now Medicine King Bodhisattva and Medicine Superior Bodhisattva. These two Bodhisattvas—Medicine King and Medicine Superior—have accomplished great merit like this. They have planted roots of virtue under countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas. They have accomplished inconceivable good merits.</p>
    <p>"If anyone knows the names of these two Bodhisattvas, all the gods and humans in all the worlds should bow down to them in respect."</p>
    <p>When the Buddha finished speaking this chapter about the past deeds of Beautiful King, eighty-four thousand people brushed off the dust, left the dirt behind, and gained the pure Dharma eye in all teachings.</p>
    <h3>END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN: THE BEAUTIFUL KING AND HIS GOOD FRIENDS</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This chapter's teaching that "good spiritual friends are the great cause" is pure blues theology. We don't wake up alone. We wake up because somebody loved us enough to not let us sleep through our lives. The teaching comes from the most intimate place possible—from family. The two sons, who are revealed to be Medicine King and Medicine Superior, are willing to be born into a household of "wrong views" to save their father.</p>
        <p>The supernatural displays are not about intimidation; they are about breaking the king's frame of what he thinks is possible, to make him receptive to the Dharma. The story teaches that love is persistent, and that grace can show up in the form of your own children, your spouse, or your friends, working patiently to guide you home.</p>
        <p>The final revelation—that these figures from the past are bodhisattvas present in the assembly now—reinforces the Lotus Sutra's theme that the help you need is already here, and that compassion operates across countless lifetimes.</p>
