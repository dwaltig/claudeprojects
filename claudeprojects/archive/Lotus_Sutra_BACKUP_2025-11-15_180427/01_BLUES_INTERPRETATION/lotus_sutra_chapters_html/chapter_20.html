    <h1>CHAPTER TWENTY: THE BODHISATTVA WHO NEVER LOOKED DOWN</h1>
    <h2>(常不輕菩薩品第二十)</h2>
    <h3>A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese</h3>

    <h4>THE BUDDHA'S WORD TO GREAT POWER</h4>
    <p>Now the Buddha, he turned to that Bodhisattva Great Power - you know that Great Power, that Mahāsattva - and the Buddha said:</p>
    <p>"Listen here now, you got to know this thing: When a monk or a nun, when a brother or a sister who holds fast to this Lotus teaching, when somebody come at them with a evil mouth, cursing them out, talking bad about them, slandering their name - oh, that somebody gonna reap a terrible harvest, like I done told you before. But the one who holds this teaching? They gonna gain merit, like I said - they gonna get them eyes cleaned up, ears purified, nose, tongue, body, mind all made clear and clean.</p>
    <p>"Now Great Power, I'm gonna tell you about the ancient days. I'm talking way back, past counting, past measuring, past thinking about - we talking inconceivable, immeasurable ages ago, ages beyond ages. Back then there was a Buddha, and his name was King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory, the Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the One of Perfect Knowledge, Perfect in Understanding and Walking, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed Teacher, Tamer of Strong Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.</p>
    <p>"That age was called the Age-Without-Decline. That country was called the Land of Great Achievement.</p>
    <p>"That Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory, he taught the Dharma in that world to the gods and humans and the fighting demons. For them that was seeking to be disciples, he taught the Four Noble Truths - you know, about birth and old age and sickness and death, and how to cross over to final nirvāṇa. For them seeking to be solitary realizers, he taught the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising. For them Bodhisattvas seeking that supreme perfect enlightenment - that anuttara-samyak-sambodhi - he taught the Six Ways of Going to the Other Shore, the Six Perfections, so they could reach the Buddha's wisdom complete.</p>
    <p>"Now Great Power, that Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory, he lived for four hundred thousand million billion nayutas of Ganges River sands of ages. And the True Dharma stood in that world for ages like the dust particles in one Jambudvipa world. And the Imitation Dharma stood for ages like the dust particles in all four continents put together.</p>
    <p>"After that Buddha had done good for all living beings, he passed into extinction. And after both the True Dharma and the Imitation Dharma had done passed away, in that same country another Buddha appeared, and his name was King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory too - the Tathāgata, Worthy One, One of Perfect Knowledge, Perfect in Understanding and Walking, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed Teacher, Tamer of Strong Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.</p>
    <p>"And like this, one after another, there came twenty thousand million Buddhas, all with that same name."</p>

    <h4>THE STORY OF NEVER LOOKED DOWN</h4>
    <p>"Now after that first Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory had passed into extinction, after the True Dharma had done gone, in the time of the Imitation Dharma, there was monks full up with arrogance and pride, and they had great power in that world.</p>
    <p>"And in that time there was one Bodhisattva monk, and his name was Never Looked Down.</p>
    <p>"Now Great Power, you might be wondering: Why they call him Never Looked Down? Well, I'm gonna tell you. This monk, every single person he seen - whether it was a monk or a nun, whether it was a brother or a sister - he would bow down low to every one of them, bow down deep and praise them, and he would say these words:</p>
    <p>"'I respect you deeply. I wouldn't dare look down on you. Why? Because all of you are walking the Bodhisattva way. Every one of you is gonna become a Buddha.'</p>
    <p>"Now this monk, he didn't spend his time studying scriptures and chanting texts. All he did was bow down and praise folks. Even when he seen the four kinds of people way off in the distance, he would go out of his way to get to them, bow down deep, praise them, and say:</p>
    <p>"'I wouldn't dare look down on you. All of you are gonna become Buddhas.'</p>
    <p>"But among them four kinds of people, there was some who had angry hearts, hearts that wasn't clean. They would curse him out with evil mouths, saying: 'This ignorant monk! Where he come from? Going around saying he don't look down on us, giving us prophecies that we gonna become Buddhas! We don't need no false prophecies like that! We don't want nothing to do with your empty predictions!'</p>
    <p>"This went on for many years. He was constantly being cursed at and abused. But he never got angry. He just kept saying: 'You gonna become a Buddha.'</p>
    <p>"And when he would say these words, sometimes folks would take up sticks and clubs, tiles and stones, and throw them at him, beat on him. He would run away and stand at a distance. But even then, he would lift up his voice high and call out loud:</p>
    <p>"'I wouldn't dare look down on you! All of you are gonna become Buddhas!'</p>
    <p>"Because he kept on saying these words all the time, them arrogant monks and nuns and brothers and sisters, they gave him the name Never Looked Down."</p>

    <h4>DEATH AND RESURRECTION THROUGH THE WORD</h4>
    <p>"Now when this monk was about to die, right there in the sky, in the empty air, he heard all twenty thousand myriads of millions of verses of the Lotus Sutra that Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory had taught before. He was able to receive and hold every verse. Right then and there, he got them purified eye-roots like I described before - his ears purified, nose, tongue, body, and mind-roots all purified.</p>
    <p>"After he got them six roots cleaned up like that, his life was extended - extended by two hundred million billion nayutas of years. And he went everywhere teaching this Lotus Sutra to the people.</p>
    <p>"Now them four kinds of arrogant folks - them monks and nuns and brothers and sisters who had looked down on him, who had given him that name Never Looked Down - when they seen that he had obtained great supernatural powers, great eloquence in teaching, great power of good stillness, when they heard what he was saying, every one of them came to believe, came to submit, came to follow him.</p>
    <p>"And this Bodhisattva went on to convert thousands of myriads of millions of living beings, causing them to dwell in that supreme perfect enlightenment, that anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.</p>
    <p>"After his life ended, he met two thousand million Buddhas, all named Sun-Moon-Lamp-Light. In their Dharma, he taught this Lotus Sutra. Because of this cause and condition, he met another two thousand million Buddhas, all named Cloud-Sovereign-Lamp-King. In all these Buddhas' Dharma, he received, held, recited, and taught this sutra to the four kinds of people. And because of this, he got them constantly purified eyes, purified ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind-roots. When he taught the Dharma among them four kinds of people, his heart had no fear at all."</p>

    <h4>THE REVELATION - THAT WAS ME</h4>
    <p>"Great Power, this Bodhisattva Never Looked Down, he made offerings to so many Buddhas like this - respecting them, honoring them, praising them, planting all kinds of good roots. And after that, he met thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas. And in all them Buddhas' Dharma, he taught this sutra. His merit was accomplished, and he became a Buddha.</p>
    <p>"Now Great Power, what do you think? That Bodhisattva Never Looked Down back in them days - you think he was somebody else? That was me. That was my own self.</p>
    <p>"If I hadn't received, held, recited, and taught this sutra to others in them past lives, I wouldn't have been able to quickly attain this supreme perfect enlightenment, this anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Because I received, held, recited, and taught this sutra to people in the presence of them former Buddhas, I was able to quickly attain this supreme perfect enlightenment.</p>
    <p>"Now Great Power, them four kinds of people back then - them monks and nuns and brothers and sisters who despised me with angry hearts, who looked down on me - because of that, for two hundred million ages they never met a Buddha, never heard the Dharma, never seen the Sangha. For a thousand ages they suffered great torment in the Avīci Hell, the Hell of No Interruption.</p>
    <p>"But when that punishment was done, they met up with that Bodhisattva Never Looked Down again, and he taught them toward that supreme perfect enlightenment.</p>
    <p>"Now Great Power, what do you think? Them four kinds of people who constantly looked down on that Bodhisattva back then - you think they was somebody else? Right here in this assembly now, there's five hundred Bodhisattvas like Bhadrapāla and others, five hundred monks like Lion-Moon and others, five hundred lay brothers like Thought-of-Buddha and others - all of them who will never turn back from supreme perfect enlightenment - that's who they are.</p>
    <p>"Great Power, you got to know: This Lotus Sutra brings great benefit to all them Bodhisattvas and Mahāsattvas. It can cause them to reach that supreme perfect enlightenment. That's why, after the Tathāgata has passed into extinction, all them Bodhisattvas and Mahāsattvas should constantly receive, hold, recite, explain, and copy out this sutra."</p>

    <h4>THE BUDDHA SINGS IT IN VERSE</h4>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>In the ancient days there was a Buddha,<br>
        Name of King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory,<br>
        His spirit-wisdom was beyond all measure,<br>
        He guided everything that lives -<br>
        Gods and humans, dragons and spirits,<br>
        All of them made offerings to him.</p>
        <p>After that Buddha passed into extinction,<br>
        When the Dharma was about to end,<br>
        There was one Bodhisattva<br>
        Whose name was Never Looked Down.</p>
        <p>Now at that time them four kinds of people,<br>
        They was holding on tight to doctrines,<br>
        Clinging to their understanding of the law.</p>
        <p>Never Looked Down Bodhisattva,<br>
        He went right up to where they was,<br>
        And he spoke these words to them:<br>
        "I wouldn't dare look down on you -<br>
        All of you are walking the way,<br>
        Every one of you gonna become a Buddha."</p>
        <p>When the people heard this,<br>
        They looked down on him, they cursed him out,<br>
        They talked bad about him, reviled his name.</p>
        <p>But Never Looked Down Bodhisattva,<br>
        He was able to bear it, able to endure.</p>
        <p>When his punishment was finished,<br>
        When his life was about to end,<br>
        He heard this sutra,<br>
        And his six roots was purified.</p>
        <p>Because of his supernatural powers,<br>
        His life was extended and increased.<br>
        He taught this sutra again<br>
        To all them people far and wide.</p>
        <p>All them people who was clinging to doctrines,<br>
        Every one of them received teaching<br>
        From this Bodhisattva,<br>
        Was brought to accomplishment,<br>
        Was caused to dwell in the Buddha-way.</p>
        <p>When Never Looked Down's life ended,<br>
        He met countless Buddhas.<br>
        Because he taught this sutra,<br>
        He gained immeasurable blessings,<br>
        Gradually perfected his merit,<br>
        And quickly accomplished the Buddha-way.</p>
        <p>That Never Looked Down back then -<br>
        That was my own self.</p>
        <p>Them four kinds of people at that time,<br>
        The ones who was clinging to doctrines,<br>
        Who heard Never Looked Down say<br>
        "You gonna become a Buddha" -<br>
        Because of that cause and condition,<br>
        They met countless Buddhas.</p>
        <p>These Bodhisattvas in this assembly,<br>
        Five hundred of them,<br>
        And also them four kinds -<br>
        Monks and nuns, believing laymen and laywomen,<br>
        The ones now standing before me<br>
        Listening to the Dharma - that's who they are.</p>
        <p>In my former lives,<br>
        I urged all these people<br>
        To listen and receive this sutra,<br>
        This foremost teaching among teachings.</p>
        <p>I opened it up and showed them,<br>
        I taught them the way,<br>
        I caused them to dwell in nirvāṇa.</p>
        <p>Life after life they received and held<br>
        A sutra like this one.</p>
        <p>For billions and billions of myriads of ages,<br>
        So many you can't even think about it,<br>
        Only then do you get to hear<br>
        This Lotus Sutra.</p>
        <p>For billions and billions of myriads of ages,<br>
        So many you can't even think about it,<br>
        The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones,<br>
        Only once in a while teach this sutra.</p>
        <p>Therefore, you practitioners,<br>
        After the Buddha has passed into extinction,<br>
        When you hear a sutra like this,<br>
        Don't let doubt arise in your hearts.</p>
        <p>You should with single mind<br>
        Teach this sutra far and wide.</p>
        <p>Life after life you'll meet Buddhas,<br>
        And quickly accomplish the Buddha-way.</p>

    <h3>END OF CHAPTER TWENTY: THE BODHISATTVA WHO NEVER LOOKED DOWN</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This chapter is pure blues architecture. The Never Looked Down Bodhisattva is the archetypal blues hero - maintaining dignity, faith, and prophetic voice in the face of relentless persecution. The repetitive structure mirrors both the repetition in blues music and the call-and-response tradition.</p>
        <p>The translation uses vernacular English to convey deep theological concepts. For example, "You gonna become a Buddha" is not just a prediction but a prophetic declaration of an ontological truth that exists independent of current appearances. This resonates with the African American prophetic tradition where "gonna" is used to declare certain futures against present evidence.</p>
        <p>The story of Never Looked Down teaches that you can remove yourself from immediate danger (running from the stones) while still maintaining your prophetic witness (shouting from a distance). It's a survival strategy and spiritual practice combined.</p>
        <p>The ultimate revelation is that the persecutors, after suffering the consequences of their actions, are met again by Never Looked Down and finally receive the teaching. This is not revenge, but transformation—the ultimate blues vision of justice where even the oppressor is liberated.</p>
