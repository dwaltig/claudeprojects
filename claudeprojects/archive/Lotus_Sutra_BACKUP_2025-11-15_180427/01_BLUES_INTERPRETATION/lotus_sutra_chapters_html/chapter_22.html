    <h1>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO: THE PASSING ON</h1>
    <h2>(Entrustment - 囑累品第二十二)</h2>

    <h3>THE LAYING ON OF HANDS</h3>
    <p>Now you got to see this right—<br>
    The Buddha, Śākyamuni himself,<br>
    He rise up from that teaching seat,<br>
    And he show forth great spiritual power.</p>
    <p>He reach out with his right hand,<br>
    And he touch the heads<br>
    Of them countless Bodhisattvas,<br>
    Every blessed one,<br>
    And when his hand come down on them,<br>
    He speak these words:</p>
    <p>"I been working at this<br>
    For more ages than you can count—<br>
    Hundred thousand million billion<br>
    Uncountable ages—<br>
    Working and struggling<br>
    To get this hard-to-get thing,<br>
    This supreme perfect enlightenment.</p>
    <p>Now I'm putting it in your hands.<br>
    I'm entrusting it to you.<br>
    You got to take this teaching,<br>
    Spread it out with one mind,<br>
    Make it grow far and wide."</p>

    <h3>THE SECOND TIME</h3>
    <p>And he do it again—<br>
    Three times he touch them heads,<br>
    Three times he lay his hand down,<br>
    Three times he speak the word:</p>
    <p>"I been working at this<br>
    For more ages than you can count—<br>
    Hundred thousand million billion<br>
    Uncountable ages—<br>
    Working and struggling<br>
    To get this hard-to-get thing,<br>
    This supreme perfect enlightenment.</p>
    <p>Now I'm putting it in your hands.<br>
    I'm entrusting it to you.</p>
    <p>You got to receive it,<br>
    Hold it,<br>
    Read it,<br>
    Recite it,<br>
    Spread it abroad,<br>
    Make sure all living beings<br>
    Everywhere hear it and know it.</p>
    <p>Why I'm telling you this?<br>
    Because the Tathāgata got great compassion—<br>
    He ain't stingy,<br>
    He ain't holding back,<br>
    He ain't afraid.</p>
    <p>He give to living beings<br>
    The Buddha's wisdom,<br>
    The Tathāgata's wisdom,<br>
    The natural wisdom that come by itself.</p>
    <p>The Tathāgata—<br>
    He the great gift-giver<br>
    To all living beings.</p>

    <h3>YOUR CALLING</h3>
    <p>Now you got to follow his example,<br>
    Learn the Tathāgata's way,<br>
    Don't be holding back,<br>
    Don't be stingy with what you got.</p>
    <p>In the world that's coming,<br>
    If there be good men and good women<br>
    Who believe in the Tathāgata's wisdom,<br>
    You got to preach this Lotus Teaching to them,<br>
    Make sure they hear it and know it,<br>
    So they can get the Buddha's wisdom.</p>
    <p>But if there be living beings<br>
    Who don't believe it,<br>
    Who can't receive it—<br>
    Then you show them some other deep teaching<br>
    That the Tathāgata left,<br>
    Teach them,<br>
    Guide them,<br>
    Benefit them,<br>
    Make them glad.</p>
    <p>You do this,<br>
    You be repaying<br>
    What all the Buddhas done for you.<br>
    You be answering grace with grace."</p>

    <h3>THE TRIPLE AFFIRMATION</h3>
    <p>Now when them Bodhisattvas<br>
    Heard the Buddha say all this,<br>
    Great joy fill them up,<br>
    Joy running all through their bodies.</p>
    <p>They bow down even deeper,<br>
    They bend low,<br>
    They drop their heads,<br>
    They put their palms together,<br>
    And they lift up their voice as one:</p>
    <p>"As the World-Honored One command,<br>
    We will do it all—<br>
    Every bit of it.<br>
    Yes, World-Honored One!<br>
    Don't you worry none."</p>
    <p>And them Bodhisattvas,<br>
    That great assembly,<br>
    They do it three times—<br>
    Three times they lift up their voice as one:</p>
    <p>"As the World-Honored One command,<br>
    We will do it all—<br>
    Every bit of it.<br>
    Yes, World-Honored One!<br>
    Don't you worry none."</p>

    <h3>THE SENDING HOME</h3>
    <p>Then Śākyamuni Buddha,<br>
    He tell all them Buddhas<br>
    Who come from the ten directions,<br>
    All them manifestation bodies:</p>
    <p>"Go on back now,<br>
    Go to your own lands,<br>
    Go where you belong.</p>
    <p>And the Stupa of Many Treasures—<br>
    Let it be as it was before."</p>
    <p>And when he speak these words,<br>
    All them countless Buddhas<br>
    From the ten directions,<br>
    Sitting under them jewel trees<br>
    On them lion seats—</p>
    <p>And the Many Treasures Buddha,</p>
    <p>And Superior Conduct<br>
    And all them countless Bodhisattvas,</p>
    <p>And Śāriputra<br>
    And all them voice-hearers,<br>
    The fourfold assembly—</p>
    <p>And all the worlds,<br>
    The heavens,<br>
    The humans,<br>
    The asuras,<br>
    All them beings—</p>
    <p>They hear what the Buddha said,<br>
    And great joy fill them up,<br>
    Every blessed one.</p>
    <h3>END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO: THE PASSING ON</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This chapter contains the most physically intimate moment in the entire Lotus Sutra. After twenty-one chapters of cosmic visions, parables, prophecies, and supernatural displays, we arrive at a simple human gesture: the Buddha rises from his seat and puts his hand on people's heads. Three times.</p>
        <p>This is transmission through touch. Not through doctrine, not through vision, but through the laying on of hands—a gesture that runs deep in both Buddhist and Christian ritual practice. When the Buddha's hand comes down on those Bodhisattvas' heads, something passes. Not just information, but authorization. Not just teaching, but succession. Not just wisdom, but responsibility.</p>
        <p>The threefold repetition is crucial. In both Buddhist and gospel traditions, three is the number of confirmation. When the Buddha lays his hand on their heads three times and speaks the commission three times, he's making it stick. He's sealing it in the body, in the memory, in the muscle.</p>
        <p>The practical wisdom in this chapter is beautiful: "If they believe, teach them the Lotus. If they don't believe, teach them something else from the Buddha's deep teachings that they can receive." This is the opposite of rigidity. The point is liberation, not orthodoxy.</p>
        <p>The chapter ends with a quiet dismissal. The cosmic drama is over. The work of transmission has been done. Now it's time to go home and get to work. The joy at the end is the joy of knowing what you're supposed to do.</p>
