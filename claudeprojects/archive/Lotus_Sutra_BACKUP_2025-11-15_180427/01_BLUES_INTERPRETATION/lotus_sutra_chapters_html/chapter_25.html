    <h1>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE: THE ONE WHO HEARS THE WORLD CRYING</h1>
    <h2>Avalokiteśvara's Universal Door</h2>
    <h3>觀世音菩薩普門品第二十五</h3>

    <h4>THE QUESTION</h4>
    <p>Right then, the Bodhisattva named Inexhaustible Intention - he rose up from his seat, bared his right shoulder in that ancient way of showing respect, pressed his palms together before the Buddha, and said:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, I got to ask you something. This Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara - Observer of the World's Sounds - why she called that? What's the reason, what's the cause behind that name?"</p>
    <p>And the Buddha told Inexhaustible Intention:</p>
    <p>"Good friend, listen now. If countless suffering beings - we talking hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of people hurting - if they hear about this Bodhisattva called Observer of Sounds, and they call her name with a whole heart, with their one true mind, she gonna HEAR them. She gonna observe the very sound of their crying. And every single one gonna find liberation, gonna get free.</p>

    <h4>THE LITANY OF DELIVERANCE</h4>
    <p>"Listen to what I'm telling you:</p>
    <p>If someone holding onto her name falls into great fire -<br>
    The fire can't burn them.<br>
    That's her mighty spiritual power working.</p>
    <p>If the great waters come to drown you and you call her name -<br>
    You gonna reach shallow ground.<br>
    You gonna find your footing.</p>
    <p>If hundreds of thousands of millions of beings go out seeking treasure -<br>
    Seeking gold and silver and lapis lazuli,<br>
    Seeking agate and coral and amber and pearls,<br>
    And they sailing the great sea,<br>
    And the black wind comes howling,<br>
    And it blows their ship off course into the demon lands,<br>
    Into the country of the flesh-eating rakshasas -<br>
    If even just ONE person on that ship calls her name,<br>
    Every person there gonna be delivered.<br>
    Every soul gonna be saved from the demon danger.<br>
    THAT'S why she called Observer of Sounds.</p>
    <p>"If someone about to be killed, about to be murdered,<br>
    And they call on Avalokiteśvara,<br>
    The knife gonna break.<br>
    The weapon gonna shatter into pieces.<br>
    They gonna walk free.</p>
    <p>"If the whole three-thousand-great-thousand world system was FILLED with demons -<br>
    Filled with yakshas and rakshasas wanting to hurt people -<br>
    Soon as they hear someone calling her name,<br>
    Those evil spirits can't even LOOK at that person with hate in their eyes,<br>
    Let alone do them harm.</p>
    <p>"If someone bound in chains - guilty or innocent, don't matter -<br>
    Locked in shackles, cangue and fetters binding their body,<br>
    Soon as they call on Avalokiteśvara,<br>
    Every chain gonna break.<br>
    Every lock gonna snap.<br>
    They walking out free.</p>
    <p>"If the whole world filled with bandits and thieves,<br>
    And a merchant leader taking his people down a dangerous road,<br>
    Carrying precious goods through dangerous country,<br>
    And one person says:<br>
    'Good people, don't be afraid!<br>
    You need to call with one mind on Avalokiteśvara.<br>
    This Bodhisattva gives the gift of fearlessness to all beings.<br>
    If you call her name, you gonna be delivered from these bandits.'</p>
    <p>"When all those merchants hear this, they cry out together:<br>
    'NAMO AVALOKITESHVARA!'<br>
    Homage to the Observer of Sounds!</p>
    <p>"And because they called her name, they delivered right there.</p>

    <h4>FREEDOM FROM WHAT BINDS YOU</h4>
    <p>"Inexhaustible Intention, this Great Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara -<br>
    Her spiritual power is mighty, mighty like this:</p>
    <p>If beings got too much lust pulling at them,<br>
    But they constantly remember her with reverence,<br>
    They gonna get free from desire.</p>
    <p>If they got too much anger burning in them,<br>
    But they constantly remember her with reverence,<br>
    They gonna get free from rage.</p>
    <p>If they got too much ignorance clouding their minds,<br>
    But they constantly remember her with reverence,<br>
    They gonna get free from delusion.</p>
    <p>"Inexhaustible Intention, Observer of Sounds got this kind of great spiritual power.<br>
    She benefits so many beings.<br>
    That's why all beings should keep her in their hearts always.</p>

    <h4>THE PROMISE TO WOMEN</h4>
    <p>"If a woman wants a son,<br>
    And she honors and makes offerings to Avalokiteśvara,<br>
    She gonna give birth to a son full of virtue and wisdom.</p>
    <p>If she wants a daughter,<br>
    She gonna give birth to a daughter beautiful and well-formed,<br>
    Who planted good roots in past lives,<br>
    Who everyone loves and respects.</p>
    <p>"Inexhaustible Intention, Observer of Sounds got power like this.<br>
    If beings honor and bow to her with reverence,<br>
    Their blessings ain't wasted.<br>
    Not one bit goes for nothing.<br>
    That's why all beings should uphold the name of Avalokiteśvara.</p>

    <h4>THE COMPARISON</h4>
    <p>"Inexhaustible Intention, suppose someone upholds the names of sixty-two billion Bodhisattvas -<br>
    That's as many as the sands of sixty-two billion Ganges Rivers -<br>
    And they spend their whole life making offerings:<br>
    Food and drink, clothing, bedding, medicine.<br>
    What you think? That person's merit - is it great or not?"</p>
    <p>Inexhaustible Intention said: "Very great, World-Honored One."</p>
    <p>The Buddha said: "But if someone else just upholds the name of Avalokiteśvara,<br>
    Even just bows and makes offerings one single time,<br>
    These two people's blessings are EXACTLY EQUAL.<br>
    No different at all.<br>
    And that merit can't be exhausted in hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of eons.</p>
    <p>"Inexhaustible Intention, upholding the name of Observer of Sounds -<br>
    You receive blessings and benefits immeasurable, without boundaries."</p>

    <h4>SHE COMES IN WHATEVER FORM YOU NEED</h4>
    <p>Inexhaustible Intention asked the Buddha:<br>
    "World-Honored One, how does Avalokiteśvara travel through this suffering world?<br>
    How does she teach the Dharma to beings?<br>
    How does her skillful power work?"</p>
    <p>The Buddha told Inexhaustible Intention:</p>
    <p>"Good brother, listen now to how she manifests:</p>
    <p>If beings in some land need a Buddha to free them,<br>
    She appears as a Buddha and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need a solitary realizer to free them,<br>
    She appears as a solitary realizer and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need a disciple of the voice to free them,<br>
    She appears in that body and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need the god Brahma to free them,<br>
    She appears as Brahma and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need the god Indra,<br>
    She appears as Indra and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need a heavenly general,<br>
    She appears as a heavenly general and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need a guardian king,<br>
    She appears as a guardian king and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need an elder,<br>
    She appears as an elder and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need a householder,<br>
    She appears as a householder and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need a government official,<br>
    She appears as an official and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need a brahmin priest,<br>
    She appears as a priest and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman,<br>
    She appears in those bodies and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need the wife of an elder, householder, official, or brahmin,<br>
    She appears as a woman and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need a young boy or girl,<br>
    She appears as a child and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need a god, dragon, yaksha, gandharva, asura, garuda, kinnara, mahoraga,<br>
    Human or non-human being,<br>
    She appears in all those forms and teaches.</p>
    <p>If they need a vajra-wielding guardian spirit,<br>
    She appears as that and teaches.</p>
    <p>"Inexhaustible Intention, this Observer of Sounds accomplished merit like this.<br>
    She travels through all lands in various forms,<br>
    Liberating beings everywhere.</p>
    <p>"That's why you all should wholeheartedly honor and make offerings to Avalokiteśvara.</p>
    <p>"This Great Bodhisattva Observer of Sounds -<br>
    In times of fear and danger and emergency,<br>
    She gives the gift of fearlessness.</p>
    <p>"That's why in this suffering world,<br>
    Everyone calls her the Giver of Fearlessness."</p>

    <h4>THE GIFT REFUSED, THE GIFT ACCEPTED</h4>
    <p>Inexhaustible Intention said to the Buddha:<br>
    "World-Honored One, I want to make an offering to Avalokiteśvara right now."</p>
    <p>He took off the precious jeweled necklace from around his neck -<br>
    Worth hundreds of thousands of ounces of gold -<br>
    And offered it to her, saying:<br>
    "Compassionate one, receive this Dharma gift, this precious necklace."</p>
    <p>But Observer of Sounds wouldn't take it.</p>
    <p>So Inexhaustible Intention said again:<br>
    "Compassionate one, out of pity for us, receive this necklace."</p>
    <p>Then the Buddha told Avalokiteśvara:<br>
    "You should have compassion for this Inexhaustible Intention,<br>
    And for the four assemblies,<br>
    And for the gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas,<br>
    For humans and non-humans.<br>
    For their sake, receive this necklace."</p>
    <p>Right then, out of compassion for all those beings,<br>
    Avalokiteśvara received the necklace.<br>
    She divided it into two parts:<br>
    One part she offered to Śākyamuni Buddha,<br>
    One part she offered to the stupa of Many Treasures Buddha.</p>
    <p>"Inexhaustible Intention, Observer of Sounds has sovereign spiritual power like this.<br>
    This is how she travels through the suffering world."</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>World-Honored One of wonderful marks complete,<br>
        I ask you now again about this one:<br>
        Why is this child of Buddha<br>
        Called Observer of the World's Sounds?</p>
        <p>The Honored One of wonderful marks complete<br>
        Answered Inexhaustible Intention in verse:</p>
        <p>Listen now to how Observer of Sounds acts,<br>
        How well she responds in every direction.<br>
        Her vow is deep as the ocean,<br>
        Through countless eons beyond thought,<br>
        Serving thousands of billions of Buddhas,<br>
        She made great pure vows.</p>
        <p>Let me tell you briefly:<br>
        Hearing her name, seeing her body,<br>
        Holding her in mind - it don't go to waste.<br>
        She can destroy the sufferings of all existence.</p>
        <p>Suppose someone means to harm you,<br>
        Push you in a pit of fire -<br>
        Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:<br>
        The fire pit turns into a pool.</p>
        <p>Or you drifting in the vast ocean,<br>
        Dangers of dragons, fish, and demons -<br>
        Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:<br>
        The waves cannot drown you.</p>
        <p>Or you on Mount Sumeru's peak,<br>
        Someone pushes you off to fall -<br>
        Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:<br>
        You stay suspended like the sun in space.</p>
        <p>Or wicked people chase you,<br>
        Push you off Diamond Mountain -<br>
        Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:<br>
        Can't harm a single hair on your head.</p>
        <p>Or bandits surround you,<br>
        Each one holding a knife to hurt you -<br>
        Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:<br>
        They all immediately feel compassion rising.</p>
        <p>Or you suffering under royal punishment,<br>
        At the execution ground, life about to end -<br>
        Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:<br>
        The sword breaks into pieces right there.</p>
        <p>Or you imprisoned in chains and stocks,<br>
        Hands and feet in shackles -<br>
        Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:<br>
        You set free right then and there.</p>
        <p>Or someone curses you with poison spells,<br>
        Wanting to harm your body -<br>
        Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:<br>
        It returns to the one who sent it.</p>
        <p>Or you meet evil rakshasas,<br>
        Poison dragons and various demons -<br>
        Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:<br>
        None of them dare harm you.</p>
        <p>Or evil beasts surround you,<br>
        Sharp teeth and claws, fearsome -<br>
        Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:<br>
        They run away to the boundless distance.</p>
        <p>Serpents, vipers, and scorpions,<br>
        Their poisonous breath blazing like fire -<br>
        Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:<br>
        At the sound they turn back and leave.</p>
        <p>Thunder clouds drumming, lightning flashing,<br>
        Hail falling, great rain pouring -<br>
        Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:<br>
        Right away it scatters and clears.</p>
        <p>When beings pressed by calamity,<br>
        Immeasurable suffering crushing them -<br>
        Observer of Sounds' wonderful wisdom power<br>
        Can save the world's suffering.</p>
        <p>Perfect in spiritual powers,<br>
        Widely cultivating wisdom and skillful means,<br>
        Throughout the lands in ten directions,<br>
        No realm where she don't appear.</p>
        <p>All the various evil destinies -<br>
        Hells, hungry ghosts, animals -<br>
        The sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, death -<br>
        Gradually she causes them all to be destroyed.</p>
        <p>True observation, pure observation,<br>
        Vast great wisdom observation,<br>
        Compassion observation, loving-kindness observation -<br>
        Constantly wish for them, constantly look up to them!</p>
        <p>Undefiled, pure light,<br>
        Wisdom sun breaking through all darkness,<br>
        She can subdue disaster's wind and fire,<br>
        Universally illuminating the world with brightness.</p>
        <p>Her compassion's essence shakes like thunder in precepts,<br>
        Her loving mind's wonder spreads like a great cloud,<br>
        Pouring down sweet-dew Dharma rain,<br>
        Extinguishing the flames of affliction.</p>
        <p>In the courts where lawsuits rage,<br>
        In battle formations full of fear -<br>
        Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:<br>
        All enemies scatter and retreat.</p>
        <p>Wonderful Sound! Observer of the World's Sounds!<br>
        Brahma Sound! Ocean Tide Sound!<br>
        Superior to all worldly sounds -<br>
        That's why you must constantly remember her.<br>
        Remember moment after moment, don't doubt.</p>
        <p>Observer of the World's Sounds - pure and holy one,<br>
        In suffering and anguish, in danger and death,<br>
        She can be your refuge and support.</p>
        <p>Perfect in every merit,<br>
        With compassionate eyes beholding all beings,<br>
        Her ocean of blessings immeasurable -<br>
        That's why you should bow down before her.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>THE TESTIMONY</h4>
    <p>Right then, Earth-Holding Bodhisattva stood up from his seat,<br>
    Came forward and said to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, if beings hear this chapter about Avalokiteśvara -<br>
    About her sovereign works,<br>
    About her universal door manifesting spiritual powers -<br>
    Know that such a person's merit ain't small."</p>
    <p>When the Buddha taught this Universal Door chapter,<br>
    Eighty-four thousand beings in the assembly<br>
    All raised the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment -<br>
    The anuttara-samyak-sambodhi heart.</p>
    <h3>END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE: THE ONE WHO HEARS THE WORLD CRYING</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>For sixteen hundred years, this chapter has been the most beloved, most memorized, most chanted part of the entire Lotus Sutra across East Asia. This ain't abstract philosophy - this is practical theology for people who are drowning, people in chains, people facing the fire.</p>
        <p>The structure is pure call-and-response. The litany of dangers and deliverances builds a rhythm of faith. The core teaching is that Avalokiteśvara, the Observer of the World's Sounds, doesn't have one fixed form. She appears as whatever you need: a Buddha, a priest, a woman, a child, even a demon-king. This is the Incarnation principle taken universal. The Word becomes flesh—not just once, but everywhere, all the time, in whatever flesh is needed.</p>
        <p>The chapter's power lies in its promise of immediate response. She doesn't judge; she HEARS and RESPONDS. In blues terms: she hears the blue note in your voice, the bent note that means pain, and she answers it. This is the gospel promise of a God who HEARS and ANSWERS. Not a distant philosophical principle, but an intimate responding presence.</p>
