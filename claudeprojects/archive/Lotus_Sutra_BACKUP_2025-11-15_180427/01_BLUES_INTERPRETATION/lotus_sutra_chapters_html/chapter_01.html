    <h1>CHAPTER ONE: THE OPENING</h1>
    <h2>A Blues Translation from the Classical Chinese</h2>

    <h3>THE GATHERING</h3>
    <p>Listen now, this is what I heard with my own ears.</p>
    <p>One time—and ain't it always one time when truth comes calling—the Buddha was staying up on Vulture Peak Mountain, right outside the city called King's House (Rajagriha). And he wasn't alone, no sir. He had twelve thousand monks with him, every last one of them a brother who'd made it through to the other side.</p>
    <p>These weren't no beginners, you understand. These were folks who'd walked the long hard road and come out clean. They'd dried up all the leaking wounds of craving. They'd burned out every last bit of that fever we call desire. They'd gotten what they came for, broke every chain that binds a person to this wheel of suffering, and their minds were finally free—free like a bird that's been caged all its life and somebody finally opens the door.</p>
    <p>Let me tell you their names, 'cause names matter when you talking about the ones who made it through:</p>
    <p>There was Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya, the first one to understand what the Buddha was laying down. There was Mahākāśyapa, that stern old man who knew how to live with nothing. There was Uruvilvā-Kāśyapa and his brothers Gayā-Kāśyapa and Nadī-Kāśyapa—three brothers who all found the way. There was Śāriputra, sharp as a razor, and Mahā-Maudgalyāyana, who could work wonders. There was Mahā-Kātyāyana, who could preach, and Aniruddha, who could see what others couldn't. There was Kapphina and Gavāmpati and Revata and Pilindavatsa and Bakkula and Mahā-Kauṣṭhila and Nanda and Sundarananda and Pūrṇa-Maitrāyaṇīputra, the one who could really teach, and Subhūti, who understood emptiness like breathing, and Ānanda, who remembered everything the Buddha ever said, and Rāhula, the Buddha's own son.</p>
    <p>These were the famous ones, the ones everybody knew about, the ones who'd gone all the way.</p>
    <p>And there were two thousand more—some still learning, some already done with learning—all walking that path.</p>
    <p>And Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, the nun who raised the Buddha when his mama died, she was there with six thousand sisters following her. And Yaśodharā, the one who used to be the Buddha's wife before he left to find the truth, she was there too with her own followers.</p>
    <p>But that ain't all. No sir, that ain't even half of it.</p>
    <p>There were eighty thousand bodhisattvas—and when I say bodhisattva, I'm talking about the ones who've set their hearts on the highest freedom, not just for themselves but for everybody. They weren't gonna turn back, no matter what. They'd gotten hold of something called dhāraṇī—that's like a power to hold onto the truth no matter how hard the wind blows. They could speak smooth and clear about the deepest things, and they kept the wheel of teaching rolling forward, never backing up.</p>
    <p>They'd served countless Buddhas—I'm talking about hundreds, thousands, millions of enlightened teachers. They'd planted good seeds in all those Buddha-fields, and every Buddha they ever met spoke their names with respect. They'd trained their hearts in loving-kindness until kindness was just who they were. They'd gotten inside the Buddha's wisdom like you get inside your own house. They'd crossed over to the far shore of understanding, and their names rang out through countless worlds. They could guide countless beings through the darkness.</p>
    <p>Let me tell you some of their names:</p>
    <p>There was Mañjuśrī, who carries the sword of wisdom. There was Avalokiteśvara, who hears every cry of suffering in this world. There was Mahāsthāmaprāpta, the one with great power. There was Always Striving, who never lets up. There was Never Resting, who don't know how to quit. There was Jewel Palm and Medicine King and Brave Giving and Jewel Moon and Moon Light and Full Moon. There was Great Strength and Limitless Strength and Beyond the Triple World. There was Bhadrapāla and Maitreya—that's the one who's gonna be the next Buddha when this age runs out. There was Jewel Accumulation and Guide—eighty thousand of these great-hearted teachers, all gathered there.</p>
    <p>And the heavenly beings showed up too, you better believe it.</p>
    <p>Śakra, the king of the thirty-three heavens, he came down with twenty thousand divine children. And there was Moon Prince and Universal Fragrance and Jewel Light and the Four Great Kings, each one bringing ten thousand children of heaven. And Freedom King and Great Freedom King, they brought thirty thousand. And Brahmā Sahāmpati, the lord of this whole world-system, and Śikhin Brahma and Bright Brahma, they came with twelve thousand divine children.</p>
    <p>And eight dragon kings came swimming up from the deep waters: Nanda and Upananda and Sāgara and Vāsukin and Takṣaka and Anavatapta and Manasvin and Utpalaka—each one with hundreds of thousands following behind.</p>
    <p>And four kings of the kinnaras came—those are the singers, the ones who make music for the gods. There was Dharma Kinnara King and Wonderful Dharma Kinnara King and Great Dharma Kinnara King and Dharma-Holding Kinnara King, all with their companies.</p>
    <p>And four kings of the gandharvas—those are the heavenly musicians. There was Joy and Joyful Sound and Beautiful and Beautiful Sound, all with their followers.</p>
    <p>And four kings of the asuras came too—those are the jealous spirits, always fighting with the gods: Bālin and Kharaskandha and Vemacitrin and Rāhu, each one leading hundreds of thousands.</p>
    <p>And four kings of the garuḍas—those giant birds—came flying down: Great Virtue and Great Body and Great Fullness and As-You-Wish, each one with their flocks.</p>
    <p>And King Ajātaśatru, son of Queen Vaidehi, he came with hundreds of thousands of people from the city.</p>
    <p>Every single one of them bowed down at the Buddha's feet—and when I say feet, I mean they got low, they showed respect—and then they sat down off to the side.</p>

    <h3>THE TEACHING BEFORE THE SILENCE</h3>
    <p>Right then, the Buddha was surrounded on all four sides—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen—all of them offering him respect, honoring him, praising him. And he started teaching them a scripture of the Great Vehicle, a text called "The Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings"—a teaching for those bodhisattvas, a teaching that the Buddha himself protects and keeps in mind.</p>
    <p>When he finished teaching that sutra, he crossed his legs up under him—you know that sitting position, like a locked-up lotus—and he entered into a deep, deep meditation on infinite meanings. His body went still. His mind went still. He wasn't moving at all.</p>
    <p>And right then, heaven started raining flowers—mandarava flowers and great mandarava flowers, manjusaka flowers and great manjusaka flowers—pouring down on the Buddha and all that great assembly. And the whole Buddha-world shook six different ways—you know that shaking when the earth can't hold still 'cause something holy is happening.</p>
    <p>And everybody in that gathering—the monks and nuns, the laymen and laywomen, the dragons and the night-wandering spirits, the gandharvas and asuras and garudas and kinnaras and mahoragas, the humans and non-humans, all the little kings and the wheel-turning holy kings—every last one of them got something they never had before. Joy rose up in them. They put their palms together and they looked at the Buddha with one mind, all together, not turning away.</p>

    <h3>THE LIGHT FROM BETWEEN THE EYEBROWS</h3>
    <p>And then the Buddha sent out a beam of light from between his eyebrows—right from that white hair-mark there—and it lit up eighteen thousand worlds to the east, every last corner of them, down to the deepest hell called Avīci where suffering don't quit, all the way up to Akaniṣṭha Heaven where the highest gods dwell.</p>
    <p>And from this world here, you could see into all those other lands. You could see beings in all six paths of existence—beings in hell, hungry ghosts, animals, humans, jealous spirits, gods—you could see them all. And you could see the Buddhas in those worlds, teaching right now, hear the words they were saying. And you could see monks and nuns and laymen and laywomen, people walking the path and getting somewhere. You could see bodhisattvas with all kinds of causes and conditions, all kinds of faith and understanding, all kinds of appearances, walking the bodhisattva road. You could see Buddhas entering that final peace beyond peace, that nirvāṇa. And you could see, after those Buddhas passed on, stupas made of seven kinds of jewels, rising up to hold their relics.</p>

    <h3>MAITREYA ASKS, MAÑJUŚRĪ REMEMBERS</h3>
    <p>Right then, Maitreya Bodhisattva—the one who's coming next—he thought to himself: "Now what's going on here? The World-Honored One is showing us signs and wonders. What's the cause of all this? The Buddha's gone into a meditation so deep you can't think your way into it, and he's showing us things we never seen before. Who should I ask about this? Who could answer?"</p>
    <p>And then he thought: "This Mañjuśrī, he's the Dharma-prince, the king's son. He's served countless Buddhas in the past, no telling how many. He must've seen signs like this before. I'm gonna ask him."</p>
    <p>And right then all the monks and nuns and layfolk and all the gods and dragons and spirits, they all thought the same thing: "This light the Buddha's shining, this supernatural sign—who can we ask about it?"</p>
    <p>So Maitreya Bodhisattva, wanting to clear up his own doubt and seeing what everybody else was wondering, he turned to Mañjuśrī and said: "What's the cause and condition for all this? Why's he sending out this great light, lighting up eighteen thousand lands to the east, showing us all those Buddha-lands decorated so fine?"</p>
    <p>And then Maitreya, wanting to say it again in another way, he spoke in verse. And let me tell you, these verses had rhythm:</p>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>Mañjuśrī, tell me why—<br>
        Why the Teacher's shining bright<br>
        From that white hair between his eyes,<br>
        Pouring out that great big light?</p>
        <p>Mandarava flowers raining down,<br>
        Manjusaka falling all around,<br>
        Sandalwood wind blowing sweet,<br>
        Making everybody's heart feel sound.</p>
        <p>That's why the ground's all pure and clean,<br>
        This whole world shaking six ways round,<br>
        The four assemblies filled with joy,<br>
        Body and mind feeling glory-bound.</p>
        <p>Light from between his eyebrows bright,<br>
        Shining east across the land,<br>
        Eighteen thousand worlds lit up,<br>
        Every one of them turning gold like sand.</p>
        <p>From Avīci Hell below<br>
        All the way to highest height,<br>
        In all those worlds we're seeing now<br>
        Beings walking in six paths of life.</p>
        <p>We see where birth and death will lead them,<br>
        See the good and bad they've sown,<br>
        See the pretty and the ugly fruit they're getting—<br>
        Everything's being shown.</p>
        <p>And we see the Buddhas too,<br>
        Those holy lion-teachers standing tall,<br>
        Teaching scriptures wonderful and subtle—<br>
        The finest teachings of them all.</p>
        <p>Their voices pure and clear,<br>
        Speaking soft words, smooth and true,<br>
        Teaching countless bodhisattvas—<br>
        Millions, billions, more than you can count, it's true.</p>
        <p>That Brahma-voice so deep and wonderful,<br>
        Making people want to hear,<br>
        Each one in their own world<br>
        Teaching Dharma true and clear.</p>
        <p>Using all kinds of causes and conditions,<br>
        Countless metaphors and signs,<br>
        Lighting up the Buddha-Dharma,<br>
        Opening up people's minds.</p>
        <p>If someone's suffering hard,<br>
        Sick and tired of getting old and dying sick,<br>
        They'll teach nirvāṇa to them—<br>
        That'll end suffering quick.</p>
        <p>If someone's got good fortune,<br>
        Served Buddhas way back when,<br>
        Looking for the highest teaching,<br>
        They'll teach the solitary path to them.</p>
        <p>If there's Buddha's children there<br>
        Walking many different roads,<br>
        Seeking wisdom highest of all,<br>
        They'll teach the pure path to unfold.</p>
        <p>Mañjuśrī, sitting here,<br>
        I'm seeing and I'm hearing all of this,<br>
        A thousand billion different things—<br>
        More than I can tell you, more than I can list.</p>
        <p>I'm seeing countless bodhisattvas,<br>
        Sands-of-the-Ganges many, seeking Buddha's way,<br>
        Some of them practicing giving—<br>
        Gold and silver, coral fine,<br>
        Pearls and magic jewels,<br>
        Conch shells, agate, diamonds that shine,<br>
        Servants, carriages, everything they own,<br>
        Precious decorated sedan chairs—<br>
        Giving it all with happy hearts,<br>
        Dedicating it to Buddha's care,<br>
        Hoping for that supreme vehicle,<br>
        The one all Buddhas praise everywhere.</p>
        <p>Some bodhisattvas giving four-horse jeweled carts,<br>
        Railings and flower canopies decorated so nice.<br>
        And I see bodhisattvas giving their own flesh and limbs,<br>
        Even wives and children—that's the ultimate sacrifice,<br>
        Seeking that road to wisdom supreme.</p>
        <p>I see bodhisattvas giving heads and eyes and bodies,<br>
        Happy to offer them all up,<br>
        Seeking Buddha-wisdom—<br>
        Filling that wisdom-cup.</p>
        <p>Mañjuśrī, I see kings<br>
        Going to where Buddha stays,<br>
        Asking about the highest path,<br>
        Then giving up their pleasant kingdoms, palaces and all,<br>
        Shaving off their hair,<br>
        Putting on the Dharma robes—<br>
        Answering that highest call.</p>
        <p>I see bodhisattvas becoming monks,<br>
        Living alone in quiet places,<br>
        Happy to chant the scriptures day and night,<br>
        Peace all over their faces.</p>
        <p>I see bodhisattvas brave and vigorous,<br>
        Going into deep mountains where the world can't follow,<br>
        Thinking about the Buddha's path,<br>
        Where the truth ain't hollow.</p>
        <p>I see ones who've left desire behind,<br>
        Always staying in empty space,<br>
        Going deep into meditation,<br>
        Getting five spiritual powers by grace.</p>
        <p>I see bodhisattvas sitting quiet in meditation, palms together,<br>
        Praising the Dharma-kings<br>
        With thousands and millions of verses—<br>
        Singing those wisdom-things.</p>
        <p>I see bodhisattvas with wisdom deep and will firm,<br>
        Able to question all the Buddhas,<br>
        Hearing everything and holding onto it—<br>
        Not letting go of nothing, never.</p>
        <p>I see Buddha-children<br>
        With meditation and wisdom both complete,<br>
        Using countless metaphors<br>
        To teach the assembly, making wisdom sweet,<br>
        Happy to be teaching Dharma,<br>
        Transforming bodhisattvas all around,<br>
        Breaking the demon armies,<br>
        Beating that Dharma drum sound!</p>
        <p>I see bodhisattvas silent and peaceful,<br>
        Gods and dragons respecting them all the way—<br>
        But they don't get happy about it,<br>
        Don't let it make their day.</p>
        <p>I see bodhisattvas in forests sending out light,<br>
        Relieving the suffering of hell,<br>
        Causing beings to enter Buddha's path—<br>
        Doing it well.</p>
        <p>I see Buddha-children who never sleep,<br>
        Walking meditation through the forest night and day,<br>
        Seeking Buddha's path with all they got—<br>
        Working hard that way.</p>
        <p>I see ones holding precepts perfect,<br>
        Dignity and deportment without a single crack,<br>
        Pure as a jewel,<br>
        Nothing that they lack,<br>
        Seeking Buddha's path like that.</p>
        <p>I see Buddha-children living in the power of patience,<br>
        When arrogant people curse and beat them down,<br>
        They able to endure it all,<br>
        Don't let it turn them around—<br>
        Seeking Buddha's path without a frown.</p>
        <p>I see bodhisattvas leaving behind jokes and foolishness,<br>
        Leaving behind ignorant companions too,<br>
        Getting close to wise people instead,<br>
        Single-mindedly removing confusion—that's what they do.<br>
        Collecting their thoughts in mountain forests,<br>
        For billions and millions of years, it's true,<br>
        Seeking Buddha's path all the way through.</p>
        <p>Some bodhisattvas I see<br>
        Offering fine food and drink,<br>
        Hundred kinds of medicinal soups,<br>
        To Buddha and the sangha—don't even blink.<br>
        Fine clothes worth millions,<br>
        Or priceless robes beyond counting,<br>
        Offering to Buddha and sangha—<br>
        Benefits mounting.</p>
        <p>Thousands of millions of kinds<br>
        Of sandalwood treasure halls,<br>
        Wonderful beds and bedding,<br>
        Offering to Buddha and sangha—<br>
        Answering that call.</p>
        <p>Pure gardens and forests,<br>
        Flowers and fruit growing thick,<br>
        Flowing springs and bathing pools,<br>
        Offering to Buddha and sangha—<br>
        That's the trick.</p>
        <p>All these different kinds of giving,<br>
        Offerings wonderful and profound,<br>
        Doing it with joy and no weariness,<br>
        Seeking that highest path around.</p>
        <p>Some bodhisattvas teaching the Dharma of peace and stillness,<br>
        Using all kinds of instructions to guide,<br>
        Teaching countless living beings—<br>
        Walking by their side.</p>
        <p>Some bodhisattvas contemplating the nature of all things,<br>
        Seeing there ain't no duality there,<br>
        Like empty space—<br>
        Nothing to compare.</p>
        <p>And I see Buddha-children<br>
        With minds that don't cling to nothing at all,<br>
        Using this wonderful wisdom<br>
        To seek the highest path—standing tall.</p>
        <p>Mañjuśrī, I see more bodhisattvas<br>
        After Buddha's gone into extinction,<br>
        Making offerings to relics—<br>
        That's their mission.</p>
        <p>I see Buddha-children<br>
        Building stupas and shrines,<br>
        Countless as Ganges sands,<br>
        Decorating all the lands with designs.</p>
        <p>Jeweled stupas tall and wonderful—<br>
        Five thousand yojanas high,<br>
        Two thousand yojanas wide and deep—<br>
        Reaching toward the sky.</p>
        <p>Every single stupa there<br>
        With a thousand banners and flags,<br>
        Jeweled bells ringing in harmony,<br>
        Pearl netting hanging from the crags.</p>
        <p>Gods and dragons and spirits,<br>
        Humans and non-humans all around,<br>
        Always making offerings there<br>
        With incense, flowers, and music-sound.</p>
        <p>Mañjuśrī, these Buddha-children,<br>
        Making offerings to relics this way,<br>
        Their countries naturally become<br>
        Specially wonderful and beautiful—you could say<br>
        Like the king of heavenly trees<br>
        When its flowers open up and bloom.</p>
        <p>The Buddha let out just one light—<br>
        One light clearing all the gloom—<br>
        And me and this whole assembly<br>
        Seeing all those lands so fine,<br>
        All those Buddha-powers<br>
        And wisdom-signs.</p>
        <p>One pure light<br>
        Lighting up countless lands—<br>
        We seeing all this,<br>
        Never seen nothing like it—understand?</p>
        <p>Buddha-son Mañjuśrī,<br>
        Please decide everybody's doubt,<br>
        The four assemblies looking up hopeful<br>
        At you and me—what's this all about?<br>
        Why's the World-Honored One<br>
        Letting this light shine out?</p>
        <p>Buddha-son, answer now,<br>
        Decide this doubt and make us glad.<br>
        What benefit's coming<br>
        From this light—this holy light we've had?</p>
        <p>Is Buddha sitting in the place of enlightenment<br>
        About to teach that wonderful Dharma he's got?<br>
        Or is he about to give predictions of awakening?<br>
        Is that what this means or not?</p>
        <p>He's showing us Buddha-lands<br>
        Decorated with countless jewels so clean,<br>
        And we seeing all these Buddhas—<br>
        This ain't no small scene.</p>
        <p>Mañjuśrī, you know—<br>
        Four assemblies, dragons, gods—<br>
        They all looking at you, waiting to hear:<br>
        What are you gonna say about these signs we see here?</p>
    </div>

    <h3>MAÑJUŚRĪ REMEMBERS THE ANCIENT PATTERN</h3>
    <p>Right then, Mañjuśrī spoke to Maitreya Bodhisattva and all those great beings and good men, saying:</p>
    <p>"The way I figure it, the World-Honored One right now is about to teach a great Dharma, about to rain down a great Dharma-rain, about to blow the great Dharma-conch, about to beat the great Dharma-drum, about to explain the great Dharma-meaning.</p>
    <p>"Good men, in the past, with other Buddhas, I've seen signs like this. After they let out this kind of light, they taught the great Dharma. So you should know: the Buddha's showing this light now for the same reason. He wants to help all living beings hear and know this Dharma that's hard for the whole world to believe. That's why he's showing these signs."</p>
    <p>And Mañjuśrī started telling a story—a story from so long ago you can't count the years:</p>
    <p>"Good men, way back in the past—I'm talking about countless, boundless, inconceivable, uncountable eons ago—there was a Buddha called Moon-Sun-Lamp Thus Come One, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.</p>
    <p>"He taught the true Dharma—good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end. His meaning was deep and far-reaching. His words were skillful and wonderful. Pure and unmixed, complete and perfect, he laid out what the holy life looks like.</p>
    <p>"For people seeking to be hearers, he taught the Dharma of the Four Noble Truths—how to cross over birth and old age and sickness and death, how to reach the final peace of nirvāṇa.</p>
    <p>"For people seeking to be solitary realizers, he taught the Dharma of the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination.</p>
    <p>"For the bodhisattvas, he taught the Six Perfections—how to attain that highest perfect awakening, how to accomplish all-knowing wisdom."</p>
    <p>And then Mañjuśrī said something that'll make you sit up:</p>
    <p>"And then there was another Buddha, also called Moon-Sun-Lamp. And then another Buddha, also called Moon-Sun-Lamp. Like this, twenty thousand Buddhas, all with the same name—Moon-Sun-Lamp. And they all had the same family name too: Bharadvāja.</p>
    <p>"Maitreya, you should know: from the first Buddha to the last Buddha, they all had the same name, Moon-Sun-Lamp, complete with all ten titles. And the Dharma they taught was good in the beginning, middle, and end.</p>
    <p>"Now that last Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha, before he left home to seek the way, he had eight sons. Their names were: Having Intent, Good Intent, Infinite Intent, Jewel Intent, Increasing Intent, Doubt-Removing Intent, Toward Intent, and Dharma Intent.</p>
    <p>"These eight princes had power and dignity and freedom. Each one ruled over four continents. When these princes heard that their father had left home and attained the highest perfect awakening, every one of them gave up their kingdoms and followed him into homelessness. They raised their minds to the Great Vehicle, always practiced the holy life, and all became Dharma-teachers. They'd already planted roots of goodness with thousands and millions of Buddhas.</p>
    <p>"Now when that Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha taught the scripture of the Great Vehicle called 'Sutra of Infinite Meanings'—a teaching for bodhisattvas, a teaching that Buddha protects and keeps in mind—after he finished teaching it, right there in the great assembly, he crossed his legs up into meditation and entered that concentration on infinite meanings. His body and mind stopped moving.</p>
    <p>"And right then, heaven rained down mandarava flowers, great mandarava flowers, manjusaka flowers, great manjusaka flowers, scattering them on the Buddha and the great assembly. And the whole Buddha-world shook six ways.</p>
    <p>"And then everybody in the assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, dragons, night-wanderers, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans, all the little kings and wheel-turning holy kings—all of them got something they never had before. Joy! They put their palms together and looked at the Buddha with one mind."</p>
    <p>Mañjuśrī kept going with his story:</p>
    <p>"And then that Thus Come One let out a beam of light from between his eyebrows, lighting up eighteen thousand Buddha-lands to the east, reaching everywhere, just like the lands we're seeing right now.</p>
    <p>"Maitreya, you should know: in that assembly back then, there were two billion bodhisattvas who wanted to hear the Dharma. When these bodhisattvas saw that light shining all over those Buddha-lands, they got something they never had before, and they wanted to know what that light was about.</p>
    <p>"There was a bodhisattva there named Wonderful Light, and he had eight hundred disciples.</p>
    <p>"Right then, Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha came out of his meditation and, turning to Wonderful Light Bodhisattva, he taught the scripture of the Great Vehicle called 'The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma'—a teaching for bodhisattvas, a teaching that Buddha protects and keeps in mind.</p>
    <p>"He taught that sutra for sixty short eons, never getting up from his seat. And everybody listening sat there in one place for sixty short eons, their bodies and minds not moving, hearing what the Buddha said, and it felt like just the time it takes to eat a meal. During all that time, there wasn't a single person whose body or mind got tired or restless.</p>
    <p>"After Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha finished teaching that sutra for sixty short eons, he made this announcement to the assembly of Brahmas and Maras and ascetics and brahmins and gods and humans and asuras:</p>
    <p>"'Tonight at midnight, the Thus Come One will enter the nirvāṇa without remainder.'</p>
    <p>"There was a bodhisattva there named Virtue Storehouse. Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha gave him a prediction right then and there. He told all the monks: 'This Virtue Storehouse Bodhisattva will be the next Buddha. His name will be Pure Body, Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened.'</p>
    <p>"After giving this prediction, at midnight, Buddha entered the nirvāṇa without remainder.</p>
    <p>"After the Buddha passed on, Wonderful Light Bodhisattva held onto that Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma and taught it to people for eighty short eons.</p>
    <p>"Now those eight sons of Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha all became students of Wonderful Light. Wonderful Light taught and transformed them, made them firm in their resolve for the highest perfect awakening. After they'd made offerings to countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas, they all attained Buddhahood. The last one to become a Buddha was named Burning Lamp.</p>
    <p>"Among those eight hundred disciples, there was one person called Seeker of Fame. He was greedy for gain and offerings. Even though he'd study and recite all kinds of scriptures, he didn't really get them—he'd forget most of what he learned. That's why they called him Seeker of Fame.</p>
    <p>"But even he, through planting various roots of goodness, got to meet countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas, make offerings to them, honor them, respect them, praise them."</p>
    <p>And then Mañjuśrī brought it all home:</p>
    <p>"Maitreya, you should know: that Wonderful Light Bodhisattva back then—you think he was somebody else? He was me. I'm that person.</p>
    <p>"And that Seeker of Fame Bodhisattva? That was you. You're that person.</p>
    <p>"Now I'm seeing these signs, and they're no different from what I saw before. That's why I figure: today the Thus Come One is about to teach that scripture of the Great Vehicle called 'The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma,' a teaching for bodhisattvas, a teaching that Buddha protects and keeps in mind."</p>

    <h3>MAÑJUŚRĪ SPEAKS IN VERSE</h3>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>I'm remembering the past—<br>
        Countless, numberless eons back—<br>
        There was a Buddha, honored among humans,<br>
        Named Moon-Sun-Lamp, that's a fact.</p>
        <p>The World-Honored One taught Dharma,<br>
        Saved countless living beings,<br>
        Numberless billions of bodhisattvas,<br>
        Brought them into Buddha-wisdom's meanings.</p>
        <p>Before Buddha left home,<br>
        He had eight royal sons.<br>
        When they saw the great holy one leave home,<br>
        They followed him—every single one.</p>
        <p>Then Buddha taught the Great Vehicle,<br>
        A scripture called Infinite Meanings,<br>
        Among that great assembly there,<br>
        He explained its teachings with all their leanings.</p>
        <p>After Buddha finished teaching that sutra,<br>
        Right there on his Dharma-seat,<br>
        He sat cross-legged in concentration—<br>
        Infinite Meanings made complete.</p>
        <p>Heaven rained mandarava flowers,<br>
        Heavenly drums sounded on their own,<br>
        Gods and dragons and spirits and all<br>
        Offered to the human-honored one.</p>
        <p>All the Buddha-lands right then<br>
        Shook powerfully and strong.<br>
        Buddha let light out from between his eyebrows—<br>
        Rare signs coming along.</p>
        <p>That light shone east<br>
        Over eighteen thousand Buddha-lands,<br>
        Showing all living beings<br>
        The places where birth-death and karma stands.</p>
        <p>Some saw Buddha-lands<br>
        Decorated with countless jewels,<br>
        Lapis and crystal colors—<br>
        Lit by Buddha-light like swimming pools.</p>
        <p>And saw gods and humans,<br>
        Dragons, spirits, night-walking crowds,<br>
        Gandharvas and kinnaras—<br>
        Each one making offerings, humble and proud.</p>
        <p>And saw the Thus Come Ones<br>
        Naturally attaining Buddha's way,<br>
        Bodies colored like golden mountains,<br>
        Dignified and subtle in every way.</p>
        <p>Like in pure lapis lazuli<br>
        A true golden image shines inside—<br>
        World-Honored Ones among great assemblies,<br>
        Explaining deep Dharma far and wide.</p>
        <p>In every single Buddha-land,<br>
        Countless hearer-disciples there,<br>
        Because of Buddha's light shining,<br>
        We could see those great assemblies everywhere.</p>
        <p>Some monks were there<br>
        In mountain forests dwelling,<br>
        Vigorously holding pure precepts<br>
        Like they were guarding a jewel—protecting, not selling.</p>
        <p>And saw countless bodhisattvas<br>
        Practicing giving and patience and more,<br>
        Numerous as Ganges sands—<br>
        All lit by Buddha-light at the door.</p>
        <p>And saw bodhisattvas<br>
        Deep in various meditations,<br>
        Bodies and minds silent and unmoving,<br>
        Seeking the highest way—their destination.</p>
        <p>And saw bodhisattvas<br>
        Knowing the still and quiet character of Dharma,<br>
        Each one in their own land<br>
        Teaching Dharma, seeking Buddha—no drama.</p>
        <p>Right then the four assemblies<br>
        Saw Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha's great spiritual powers,<br>
        Their hearts all filled with joy—<br>
        That was their finest hour.</p>
        <p>Each one asking each other:<br>
        "What's the cause of all this we're seeing?"<br>
        The one honored by gods and humans<br>
        Just came out of meditation—freed and freeing.</p>
        <p>He praised Wonderful Light Bodhisattva:<br>
        "You are the world's eye,<br>
        The one everyone trusts and believes in,<br>
        Able to hold the Dharma-treasury high.</p>
        <p>The Dharma I have taught—<br>
        Only you can truly know it."<br>
        The World-Honored One, after praising him that way,<br>
        Made Wonderful Light rejoice and glow with it.</p>
        <p>Then he taught this Lotus Sutra of the Dharma,<br>
        For sixty short eons sitting there,<br>
        Not getting up from that seat once—<br>
        Staying in one place with care.</p>
        <p>The wonderful supreme Dharma he spoke—<br>
        Wonderful Light Dharma-teacher held it all,<br>
        Every bit of it, didn't lose a word—<br>
        Didn't let one syllable fall.</p>
        <p>After Buddha finished teaching that Lotus Sutra of the Dharma,<br>
        Making everyone joyful and glad,</p>

    <h3>END OF CHAPTER ONE: THE OPENING</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This translation takes Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese text and pours it through the blues tradition—that great river of African American spiritual and musical expression that's always known how to carry deep wisdom in everyday language.</p>
        <p>What I kept:<br>
        - The famous names like Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Śāriputra, Maitreya<br>
        - The sequence and structure of the original<br>
        - The depth of meaning—blues ain't shallow, and neither is this sutra</p>
        <p>What I changed:<br>
        - Technical terms became lived experience: "阿羅漢" became people who "made it through to the other side," who "dried up all the leaking wounds of craving"<br>
        - Descriptive names got translated: "日月燈明如來" became "Moon-Sun-Lamp Thus Come One"<br>
        - The eight princes: 有意 became "Having Intent," 善意 became "Good Intent," and so on<br>
        - Abstract Buddhist terms became concrete images: nirvāṇa is "that final peace beyond peace," meditation is going so deep "you can't think your way into it," dhāraṇī is "a power to hold onto the truth no matter how hard the wind blows"</p>
        <p>The verses especially got the blues treatment—repetition, rhythm, call-and-response feeling, direct address ("Listen now," "you hear me?"), the music of the language itself.</p>
        <p>This Chapter One tells the story of the great gathering on Vulture Peak, the Buddha's mysterious entry into meditation, the light from between his eyebrows showing countless worlds, Maitreya's question, and Mañjuśrī's memory of ancient Buddhas doing the same thing before teaching the Lotus Sutra. It's the opening act, the gathering storm before the great teaching comes.</p>
        <p>The blues has always carried sacred truth in the language of the people. This translation tries to honor both traditions—the ancient Buddhist teaching and the deep American wisdom-stream that knows how to make the high come low, the distant come near, and the abstract become as real as your own heartbeat.</p>
