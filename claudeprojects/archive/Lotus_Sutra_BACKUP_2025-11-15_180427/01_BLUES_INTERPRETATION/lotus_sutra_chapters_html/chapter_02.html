    <h1>CHAPTER TWO: THE LOVING TRICKS</h1>
    <h2>Blues Translation from Classical Chinese by Kumārajīva</h2>

    <h3>THE BUDDHA SPEAKS OF DEEP WISDOM</h3>
    <p>Now at that time, you see, the World-Honored One—he rose up from his meditation, rose up calm and peaceful-like, and he turned to Śāriputra and said:</p>
    <p>"Listen here, Śāriputra. The wisdom of the Buddhas—it goes down deep, deeper than any well you ever tried to draw from. It's measureless, you hear me? Can't nobody measure how deep it goes. The door to that wisdom, now—it's hard to understand, hard to get through. All them disciples and solitary-walkers, all them learned folks who think they got it figured—they can't know this thing.</p>
    <p>"And why's that? I'm gonna tell you why. The Buddha, he walked alongside a hundred thousand million billion Buddhas, ain't no way to count them all. He practiced every single path those Buddhas taught, every last one. Brave and fierce, he walked them roads. His name got known everywhere, you understand? He accomplished things so deep, things never done before. And when he teaches, he speaks according to what folks need, but what he's really getting at—that's hard to understand.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, ever since I became a Buddha, I been using all kinds of causes, all kinds of stories, all kinds of comparisons, pouring out teachings like water. Countless loving tricks, that's what I been using, leading people, guiding them away from all their clinging and holding on. And why can I do this? Because the Tathāgata, he's perfected all them skillful means, all that perfect knowing and seeing.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata's knowing and seeing—it's vast and deep and far-reaching. It's without measure, without any walls or boundaries. He got the powers, he got the fearlessness, he got the meditations and the liberations and the deep states—he's gone into them without any bottom to hit. He's accomplished everything that ain't never been accomplished before.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata, he can break things down every which way, explain the teachings with skill, and his words—they soft, they gentle, they please every heart.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, let me put it to you straight: all them measureless, boundless, never-been-done things—the Buddha's accomplished them all."</p>
    <p>Then the Buddha said: "Stop, Śāriputra. Don't need to say no more. And why's that? What the Buddha's accomplished—it's the rarest, hardest-to-understand thing there is. Only a Buddha together with a Buddha can exhaust the true reality of all things. That means: the suchness of their appearance, the suchness of their nature, the suchness of their substance, the suchness of their power, the suchness of their function, the suchness of their causes, the suchness of their conditions, the suchness of their effects, the suchness of their results, and the suchness of their beginning and end being ultimately equal."</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>The Hero of the World—can't measure him,<br>
        All them heavenly beings and worldly folk,<br>
        Every kind of living creature there is—<br>
        Ain't nobody can know the Buddha's truth.</p>
        <p>The Buddha's powers and his fearlessness,<br>
        His liberations and his deep meditations,<br>
        And all them other Buddha-things he got—<br>
        Ain't nobody can measure what he knows.</p>
        <p>From countless Buddhas he learned his way,<br>
        Walked every single road there was to walk,<br>
        The dharma deep and subtle, hard to see,<br>
        So difficult to understand and know.</p>
        <p>For measureless millions upon millions of ages,<br>
        He walked all them roads till he walked them through,<br>
        Reached the place of awakening, got the fruit—<br>
        I done seen it all, I know it all.</p>
        <p>A fruit as great as this one here,<br>
        All its different natures, meanings, marks—<br>
        Only me and all them Buddhas in ten directions,<br>
        Only we can know this thing.</p>
        <p>This dharma—can't be shown by pointing,<br>
        Words fall silent when you try to speak it,<br>
        All them other kinds of living beings—<br>
        Ain't nobody among them understands,</p>
        <p>Except for the bodhisattvas,<br>
        Them whose faith-power stands strong and firm.<br>
        The Buddha's disciples, you understand,<br>
        Who done served and honored countless Buddhas,</p>
        <p>Who done exhausted all their outflows,<br>
        Who standing in their final body now—<br>
        Even folks like this here,<br>
        They ain't got the strength to bear this teaching.</p>
        <p>Even if you filled the whole world up<br>
        With people smart as Śāriputra,<br>
        And they put their heads together trying to measure—<br>
        They couldn't measure the Buddha's wisdom.</p>
        <p>Even if you filled up all ten directions,<br>
        Filled them full of folks like Śāriputra,<br>
        And all the other disciples too,<br>
        Filled up every Buddha-land there is,</p>
        <p>Put their heads together trying to measure—<br>
        Still couldn't know this thing at all.<br>
        Them solitary-walkers with their sharp intelligence,<br>
        Without outflows, in their final body,</p>
        <p>They fill up all ten directions too,<br>
        Numerous as bamboo in a bamboo forest,<br>
        And they all of one mind, you hear me?<br>
        For billions and billions of countless ages,</p>
        <p>They wanting to think about the Buddha's real wisdom—<br>
        Couldn't know even the smallest little bit of it.<br>
        Them newly inspired bodhisattvas,<br>
        Who served and honored countless Buddhas,</p>
        <p>Who understand all kinds of meanings,<br>
        Who can preach the dharma skillfully,<br>
        Numerous as rice plants and hemp and bamboo and reeds,<br>
        Filling up all the lands in ten directions,</p>
        <p>With one mind using their wonderful wisdom,<br>
        For ages numerous as Ganges River sands,<br>
        All of them thinking about it together—<br>
        Still couldn't know the Buddha's wisdom.</p>
        <p>Them non-backsliding bodhisattvas,<br>
        Numerous as Ganges River sands,<br>
        With one mind seeking together—<br>
        Still couldn't know this thing neither.</p>
        <p>I'm telling you again, Śāriputra:<br>
        The dharma without outflow, inconceivable,<br>
        So deep and subtle, so wonderful—<br>
        I done fully obtained it now.</p>
        <p>Only I know its true reality,<br>
        And all them Buddhas in ten directions too.<br>
        Śāriputra, you ought to know this:<br>
        The words of the Buddhas don't differ none.</p>
        <p>Concerning the dharma that the Buddha speaks,<br>
        You got to generate great faith-power.<br>
        After the World-Honored One taught a long time,<br>
        He finally got to speak the real truth.</p>
        <p>I'm telling all you disciples,<br>
        And them seeking the solitary-walker vehicle—<br>
        I freed you from the bonds of suffering,<br>
        Let you reach nirvāṇa, that's what I did.</p>
        <p>But the Buddha used his skillful power,<br>
        Showed you three different vehicles of teaching.<br>
        Living beings get attached all over the place—<br>
        I led them so they could get themselves free.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>THE ASSEMBLY'S DOUBT AND ŚĀRIPUTRA'S REQUEST</h3>
    <p>At that time, in the great assembly, there was disciples—them with no more outflows, them arhats—Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya and the rest, twelve hundred of them. And there was others too, monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, who done set their mind on the disciple vehicle or the solitary-walker vehicle. Every one of them thought to themselves:</p>
    <p>"Right now, why's the World-Honored One going on so earnestly, praising and exalting skillful means like this? He says the dharma the Buddha obtained is so deep and hard to understand. What he speaks about got a meaning that's difficult to know. All them disciples and solitary-walkers can't reach it. The Buddha explained one liberation doctrine—we obtained that dharma too, reached nirvāṇa with it. But now we don't know where this teaching is heading."</p>
    <p>At that time, Śāriputra, he knew the four groups in the assembly was doubting, and he himself didn't understand it neither. So he addressed the Buddha, saying:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, for what cause, for what reason are you so earnestly praising the Buddhas' foremost skillful means, this deep, subtle, difficult-to-understand dharma? From way back till now, I ain't never heard you speak like this before. Right now, all four groups got doubts. I only wish the World-Honored One would explain this matter. World-Honored One, why are you so earnestly praising this deep, subtle, difficult-to-understand dharma?"</p>
    <p>Then Śāriputra, wanting to speak this meaning again, he said it in verse:</p>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>Sun of Wisdom, Great Holy Honored One,<br>
        After such a long time you speaking this dharma now.<br>
        You say you obtained these kind of things—<br>
        Powers, fearlessness, meditations,</p>
        <p>Concentration, liberation, all the rest,<br>
        Inconceivable dharmas like these.<br>
        The dharma you got at the place of awakening—<br>
        Ain't nobody can raise a question about it.</p>
        <p>My mind's so hard to fathom out,<br>
        And ain't nobody can ask about it neither.<br>
        Without nobody asking, you just speak on your own,<br>
        Praising the road you walked yourself.</p>
        <p>Your wisdom so subtle and wonderful,<br>
        The very thing all Buddhas obtained.<br>
        Them arhats without outflow,<br>
        And them seeking nirvāṇa too—</p>
        <p>Now they all done fell into a net of doubt,<br>
        Wondering why the Buddha speaking this.<br>
        Them seeking to be solitary-walkers,<br>
        Monks and nuns alike,</p>
        <p>Heavenly beings, dragons, spirits, gods,<br>
        And gandharvas and such—<br>
        They looking at each other, full of wondering,<br>
        Gazing up at the Honored One of Two Feet.</p>
        <p>What is this matter all about?<br>
        We hoping the Buddha will explain it clear.<br>
        Among all them disciple folks,<br>
        The Buddha says I'm number one.</p>
        <p>But right now, concerning my own wisdom,<br>
        I'm doubting, confused, can't understand—<br>
        Is this the ultimate dharma here,<br>
        Or is it just the road we walk?</p>
        <p>We who was born from the Buddha's mouth,<br>
        We standing with palms pressed together, gazing up and waiting,<br>
        Hoping you'll send forth your subtle, wonderful voice,<br>
        Speak to us at this time just like it really is.</p>
        <p>Them heavenly beings, dragons, spirits, and gods,<br>
        Numerous as Ganges River sands,<br>
        Them bodhisattvas seeking to be Buddhas,<br>
        Eighty thousand in their great number,</p>
        <p>And from millions and billions of lands,<br>
        Wheel-turning holy kings done arrived,<br>
        Palms pressed together with reverent minds—<br>
        They wanting to hear about the complete road.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>THE BUDDHA'S THREE REFUSALS</h3>
    <p>At that time, the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Stop, stop. Don't need to say no more. If I speak about this matter, all them beings in all the worlds—the heavenly folk and the human folk—they all gonna be shocked and full of doubt."</p>
    <p>Śāriputra addressed the Buddha again, saying: "World-Honored One, I only wish you would speak about it, only wish you would speak! And why's that? In this assembly here, there's countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of innumerable living beings who done seen Buddhas before. Their faculties are sharp and fierce, their wisdom bright and clear. When they hear what the Buddha speaks, they gonna be able to respect it and believe it."</p>
    <p>At that time, Śāriputra, wanting to speak this meaning again, he said it in verse:</p>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>Dharma King, Most High Honored One,<br>
        Just speak it out, don't you worry none.<br>
        In this assembly of measureless folks,<br>
        There's some who can respect and believe.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The Buddha again stopped Śāriputra: "If I speak about this matter, all them beings in all the worlds—heavenly folk, human folk, asuras—they all gonna be shocked and full of doubt. And them arrogant monks, they gonna fall into the great pit."</p>
    <p>At that time, the World-Honored One spoke again in verse, saying:</p>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>Stop, stop, don't need to speak about it.<br>
        My dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive.<br>
        Them arrogant ones full of themselves—<br>
        If they hear it, they surely won't respect or believe.</p>
    </div>
    <p>At that time, Śāriputra addressed the Buddha again: "World-Honored One, I only wish you would speak about it, only wish you would speak! Right now in this assembly here, folks like me and more—hundreds of thousands of millions of billions—world after world we been receiving the Buddha's transforming teaching. Folks like this, they surely can respect and believe. They gonna have long-night peace and safety, gonna gain much benefit."</p>
    <p>At that time, Śāriputra, wanting to speak this meaning again, he said it in verse:</p>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>Most High Honored One of Two Feet,<br>
        I wish you'd speak the foremost dharma.<br>
        I'm the Buddha's eldest son—<br>
        I only beg you to explain it clear and distinct.</p>
        <p>This assembly of measureless folks,<br>
        They able to respect and believe this dharma.<br>
        The Buddha already, world after world,<br>
        Done taught and transformed folks like these.</p>
        <p>They all with one mind, palms pressed together,<br>
        Wanting to listen and receive the Buddha's words.<br>
        We twelve hundred here,<br>
        And others seeking to be Buddhas—</p>
        <p>We wish, for the sake of this whole assembly,<br>
        You'd just explain it clear and distinct.<br>
        When these folks hear this dharma,<br>
        They gonna be born with great rejoicing.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>FIVE THOUSAND LEAVE THE ASSEMBLY</h3>
    <p>At that time, the World-Honored One told Śāriputra: "You done earnestly asked three times now. How can I not speak? Now you listen carefully, think about it well, remember it good. I'm gonna break it down for you clear and distinct."</p>
    <p>When he spoke these words, right there in the assembly there was monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen—five thousand of them—they got up from their seats, bowed to the Buddha, and walked on out. And why was that? This bunch here, their roots of wrongdoing was deep and heavy, and they was full of arrogance. They thought they'd obtained what they hadn't obtained, thought they'd realized what they hadn't realized. They had faults like these, and that's why they didn't stay. The World-Honored One just stayed silent, didn't try to stop them none.</p>
    <p>At that time, the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Now this assembly of mine, it ain't got no more dead branches and dead leaves. It's got only the genuine, truthful, real ones. Śāriputra, them arrogant folks leaving—that's a good thing. Now you listen well. I'm gonna speak it for you."</p>
    <p>Śāriputra said: "Yes, indeed, World-Honored One. I'm joyful, wanting to hear."</p>

    <h3>THE ONE GREAT MATTER—THE ONE VEHICLE</h3>
    <p>The Buddha told Śāriputra:</p>
    <p>"A wonderful dharma like this—the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, they only speak it from time to time. Just like the udumbara flower—it only appears once in a great while. Śāriputra, you and the rest ought to believe what the Buddha speaks. His words ain't false or empty.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, when the Buddhas speak the dharma according to what's fitting, the meaning's hard to understand. And why's that? I use countless skillful means—all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions—to explain the dharmas. This dharma here, it ain't something thinking and discriminating can understand. Only the Buddhas can know it.</p>
    <p>"And why's that? The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, they only appear in the world for one great matter, one great cause and condition. Śāriputra, what do I mean when I say the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, only appear in the world for one great matter, one great cause and condition?</p>
    <p>"The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world because they want to open up the Buddha's knowing and seeing for living beings, make it pure—that's why they appear. They want to show living beings the Buddha's knowing and seeing—that's why they appear. They want to awaken living beings to the Buddha's knowing and seeing—that's why they appear. They want to cause living beings to enter into the path of the Buddha's knowing and seeing—that's why they appear.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, this is why the Buddhas appear in the world for one great matter, one great cause and condition."</p>
    <p>The Buddha told Śāriputra: "The Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, they only teach and transform bodhisattvas. Everything they do, it's always for this one matter. They only use the Buddha's knowing and seeing to show and awaken living beings.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata, he only teaches dharma to living beings using the One Buddha Vehicle. There ain't no other vehicles—not two, not three.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, the dharma of all the Buddhas in all ten directions—it's like this too."</p>

    <h3>THE THREE TIMES—PAST, FUTURE, PRESENT</h3>
    <p>"Śāriputra, them Buddhas of the past, they used countless, numberless skillful means—all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions—to teach dharma for living beings. All them dharmas was for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All them living beings who heard the dharma from the Buddhas—in the end, they all obtained the wisdom of all modes.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, them Buddhas of the future, when they gonna appear in the world, they also gonna use countless, numberless skillful means—all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions—to teach dharma for living beings. All them dharmas gonna be for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All them living beings who hear the dharma from the Buddhas—in the end, they all gonna obtain the wisdom of all modes.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, right now, in the countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddha-lands throughout the ten directions, them Buddhas, them World-Honored Ones, they benefiting and bringing peace to living beings in so many ways. These Buddhas too, they using countless, numberless skillful means—all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions—to teach dharma for living beings. All them dharmas is for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All them living beings who hear the dharma from the Buddhas—in the end, they all gonna obtain the wisdom of all modes.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, these Buddhas, they only teach and transform bodhisattvas. They want to show living beings the Buddha's knowing and seeing. They want to awaken living beings to the Buddha's knowing and seeing. They want to cause living beings to enter the Buddha's knowing and seeing.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, I'm the same way right now too. I know living beings got all kinds of desires. Deep in their minds, they attached to things. Following their original natures, using all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions, the power of skillful means—I speak the dharma for them.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, all this—it's all for the sake of obtaining the One Buddha Vehicle and the wisdom of all modes."</p>

    <h3>ONLY ONE VEHICLE—THE BUDDHA VEHICLE</h3>
    <p>"Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions, there ain't even two vehicles, much less three.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, when the Buddhas appear in a world of five kinds of defilement—the defilement of the age, the defilement of afflictions, the defilement of living beings, the defilement of views, the defilement of lifespan—when it's like that, Śāriputra, when the age is all disturbed and chaotic, living beings heavy with filth, stingy and jealous, accomplishing roots of unwholesomeness, the Buddhas use the power of skillful means. Within the One Buddha Vehicle, they make distinctions and speak of three.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, if my disciples call themselves arhats or solitary-walkers, but they don't hear, don't know that the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, only teach and transform bodhisattvas—these ain't disciples of the Buddha. They ain't arhats. They ain't solitary-walkers.</p>
    <p>"Furthermore, Śāriputra, them monks and nuns who say they already obtained arhatship, say they in their final body, say they reached ultimate nirvāṇa—and then they don't keep seeking anuttara-samyak-sambodhi no more—you ought to know that folks like this, they all arrogant people.</p>
    <p>"And why's that? If there's a monk who truly obtained arhatship, and he don't believe this dharma—that situation don't exist. Except after the Buddha's extinction, when there ain't no Buddha present in the world. And why's that? After the Buddha's extinction, sutras like this—folks who can accept and uphold them, read and recite them, understand their meaning—them kind of people is hard to find. If they meet another Buddha later on, concerning this dharma, they gonna obtain complete understanding.</p>
    <p>"Śāriputra, all of you ought to single-mindedly believe, understand, accept and uphold the Buddha's words. The words of the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas—they ain't false. There ain't no other vehicle. There's only the One Buddha Vehicle."</p>

    <h3>VERSES ON THE FIVE THOUSAND AND THE ONE VEHICLE</h3>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>Monks and nuns<br>

        This assembly now ain't got no branches and leaves,<br>
        It's only got them genuine and real.</p>
        <p>Śāriputra, listen well now:<br>
        The dharma that the Buddhas obtained—<br>
        Using measureless skillful power,<br>
        They speak it out for living beings.</p>
        <p>The minds of living beings and what they thinking,<br>
        The various roads they walking,<br>
        All their different desire-natures,<br>
        Their good and bad karma from previous lives—</p>
        <p>The Buddha knows all this completely.<br>
        Using causes and comparisons,<br>
        Expressions and the power of skillful means,<br>
        He makes everybody rejoice.</p>
        <p>Sometimes he speaks sutras,<br>
        Gathas and past events,<br>
        Birth stories and unprecedented things.<br>
        He also speaks about causes and conditions,</p>
        <p>Comparisons and geyas too,<br>
        And the upadesa sutras.<br>
        Them dull-rooted folks who love the small dharma,<br>
        Greedy and attached to birth and death,</p>
        <p>Concerning all them countless Buddhas,<br>
        They don't walk the deep and wonderful road.<br>
        Disturbed and troubled by all kinds of suffering,<br>
        For them I speak about nirvāṇa.</p>
        <p>I set up these skillful means<br>
        To lead them into the Buddha's wisdom.<br>
        I never said to any of you<br>
        That you gonna accomplish the Buddha-road.</p>
        <p>The reason I never said it—<br>
        The time to say it hadn't arrived yet.<br>
        But now is exactly the right time<br>
        To decisively speak the Great Vehicle.</p>
        <p>These nine divisions of my dharma,<br>
        I speak them according to what living beings need.<br>
        They leading into the Great Vehicle—that's the fundamental reason—<br>
        And that's why I speak this sutra.</p>
        <p>There's Buddha-children with pure minds,<br>
        Gentle and also sharp-rooted,<br>
        Who at the place of countless Buddhas<br>
        Done walked the deep and wonderful road.</p>
        <p>For these Buddha-children here,<br>
        I speak this Great Vehicle sutra.<br>
        I predict that folks like these,<br>
        In lives to come, gonna accomplish the Buddha-road.</p>
        <p>Because with deep minds they remember the Buddha,<br>
        Practice and uphold the pure precepts.<br>
        When these folks hear they gonna become Buddhas,<br>
        Great joy fills up their whole body.</p>
        <p>The Buddha knows the way their minds moving,<br>
        And so for them he speaks the Great Vehicle.<br>
        When disciples or bodhisattvas<br>
        Hear the dharma that I speak,</p>
        <p>Even just a single verse—<br>
        They all gonna become Buddhas, no doubt about it.<br>
        In all them Buddha-lands of the ten directions,<br>
        There's only the dharma of one vehicle,</p>
        <p>Not two and not three neither.<br>
        Except when the Buddha uses skillful means—<br>
        Just using temporary, provisional names and words<br>
        To lead and guide living beings,</p>
        <p>Speaking about the Buddha's wisdom.<br>
        When Buddhas appear in the world,<br>
        It's only for this one true matter—<br>
        Them other two ain't real.</p>
        <p>The Buddha will never use the Small Vehicle<br>
        To ferry living beings across.<br>
        The Buddha himself dwells in the Great Vehicle,<br>
        And according to the dharma he obtained—</p>
        <p>Concentration and wisdom for his adornment—<br>
        With this he ferries living beings across.<br>
        Having himself realized the unsurpassed road,<br>
        The Great Vehicle dharma, equal for all—</p>
        <p>If I was to use the Small Vehicle<br>
        To teach even one single person,<br>
        I'd be falling into stinginess and greed—<br>
        This matter would be impossible.</p>
        <p>If a person has faith and takes refuge in the Buddha,<br>
        The Tathāgata don't deceive or cheat,<br>
        Don't have no greedy or jealous intention,<br>
        Cut off all evil among the dharmas.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the Buddha in the ten directions—<br>
        He alone is without any fear.<br>
        I use these marks to adorn my body,<br>
        My light shines throughout the world.</p>
        <p>Honored by measureless multitudes,<br>
        I speak the seal of true reality.<br>
        Śāriputra, you ought to know—<br>
        Originally I made this vow:</p>
        <p>Wanting to cause all living beings<br>
        To be equal to me, no different.<br>
        Like the vow I made long ago,<br>
        Now it's already completely fulfilled.</p>
        <p>I'm transforming all living beings,<br>
        Causing them all to enter the Buddha-road.<br>
        If I meet living beings<br>
        And teach them all about the Buddha-road—</p>
        <p>Them without wisdom would get confused and lost,<br>
        Deluded, they wouldn't receive the teaching.<br>
        I know these living beings here,<br>
        They never cultivated wholesome roots before.</p>
        <p>They firmly attached to the five desires,<br>
        Through ignorance and craving they born troubled.<br>
        Through all their desire causes and conditions,<br>
        They fall down into the three evil paths,</p>
        <p>Revolving through the six destinies,<br>
        Fully receiving every kind of suffering and poison.<br>
        The tiny form when they conceived,<br>
        World after world it keeps on growing.</p>
        <p>People with thin virtue and little merit,<br>
        Oppressed and forced by all kinds of suffering,<br>
        They enter into a dense forest of wrong views—<br>
        Either existence or non-existence and such like.</p>
        <p>Depending on these various views,<br>
        Complete with sixty-two of them,<br>
        Deeply attached to false and empty dharmas,<br>
        Firmly grasping them, can't let them go.</p>
        <p>Arrogant, bragging on themselves,<br>
        Crooked and flattering, their minds not real.<br>
        For thousands of millions of billions of ages<br>
        They don't even hear the Buddha's name,</p>
        <p>Don't hear the proper dharma neither—<br>
        Folks like this is hard to ferry across.<br>
        That's why, Śāriputra,<br>
        I set up skillful means for them,</p>
        <p>Speaking about all them roads that end suffering,<br>
        Showing them nirvāṇa.<br>
        Even though I speak nirvāṇa,<br>
        This also ain't true extinction.</p>
        <p>All the dharmas from the very beginning,<br>
        They always had the mark of still extinction.<br>
        When Buddha-children finish walking the road,<br>
        In lives to come they gonna become Buddhas.</p>
        <p>I got this skillful power,<br>
        I open up and show the dharma of three vehicles.<br>
        All them World-Honored Ones,<br>
        They all speak the road of one vehicle.</p>
        <p>Now this whole great assembly here,<br>
        All ought to get rid of their doubt and wondering.<br>
        The Buddhas' words don't differ none—<br>
        There's only one, not two vehicles.</p>
        <p>In the past, countless ages back,<br>
        Measureless extinct Buddhas,<br>
        Hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of kinds,<br>
        Their number beyond all measuring—</p>
        <p>World-Honored Ones like these,<br>
        Using various causes and comparisons,<br>
        Countless powers of skillful means,<br>
        They taught and explained the marks of the dharmas.</p>
        <p>All these World-Honored Ones,<br>
        They all spoke the dharma of one vehicle,<br>
        Transformed measureless living beings,<br>
        Caused them to enter the Buddha-road.</p>
        <p>Also, them Great Holy Lords,<br>
        Knowing the entire world—<br>
        Heavenly beings, human beings, every kind of living creature—<br>
        The deep desires of their minds—</p>
        <p>They used different skillful means<br>
        To help reveal the foremost meaning.<br>
        If there was living creatures<br>
        Who met them Buddhas of the past,</p>
        <p>Whether they heard dharma or gave gifts,<br>
        Or upheld precepts, practiced patience,<br>
        Vigor, meditation, wisdom, and such—<br>
        Cultivating merit and wisdom in various ways—</p>
        <p>Folks like these,<br>
        They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.<br>
        After the Buddhas became extinct,<br>
        If people had good, gentle hearts,</p>
        <p>Living beings like these,<br>
        They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.<br>
        After the Buddhas became extinct,<br>
        Those who made offerings to the relics—</p>
        <p>Raised up millions and billions of kinds of stupas,<br>
        Made from gold and silver and crystal,<br>
        Mother-of-pearl and agate,<br>
        Rose quartz and lapis lazuli pearls,</p>
        <p>Purifying them with extensive adornments,<br>
        Decorating all them stupas.<br>
        Or some raised up stone temples,<br>
        Sandalwood and agarwood,</p>
        <p>Honey-tree wood and other timber,<br>
        Brick and tile, clay and earth.<br>
        If in some wilderness place<br>
        They heaped up dirt to make a Buddha-shrine,</p>
        <p>Or even children playing,<br>
        Piling up sand to make a Buddha-stupa—<br>
        Folks like these,<br>
        They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.</p>
        <p>If people for the Buddha's sake<br>
        Established all kinds of images,<br>
        Carved and sculpted with every kind of mark—<br>
        They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.</p>
        <p>Whether made from seven jewels,<br>
        Bronze or red and white copper,<br>
        White pewter, lead and tin,<br>
        Iron, wood, or even clay,</p>
        <p>Or using glue and lacquer and cloth<br>
        To adorn and make Buddha-images—<br>
        Folks like these,<br>
        They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.</p>
        <p>Painting and drawing Buddha-images,<br>
        Complete with a hundred merits adorning the marks,<br>
        Whether they did it themselves or had others do it—<br>
        They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.</p>
        <p>Even children playing,<br>
        Using grass or wood or a brush,<br>
        Or maybe even fingernails<br>
        To scratch and draw a Buddha-image—</p>
        <p>Folks like these,<br>
        Gradually accumulating merit and virtue,<br>
        Completely fulfilling great compassion-mind—<br>
        They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.</p>
        <p>They only teaching and transforming bodhisattvas,<br>
        Ferrying across measureless multitudes.<br>
        If people at stupas and temples,<br>
        At jeweled images or painted images,</p>
        <p>With flowers, incense, banners, canopies,<br>
        Made offerings with reverent minds—<br>
        If they had people make music,<br>
        Beating drums, blowing horns and conches,</p>
        <p>Flutes, pipes, zithers and harps,<br>
        Lutes, cymbals and gongs,<br>
        All these wonderful sounds,<br>
        Playing them all as offerings—</p>
        <p>Or with joyful minds<br>
        Singing and chanting the Buddha's virtue,<br>
        Even just one small sound—<br>
        They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.</p>
        <p>If people with distracted minds,<br>
        Even just with a single flower,<br>
        Made an offering to a painted image—<br>
        Gradually they gonna see countless Buddhas.</p>
        <p>Or some people bowed in respect,<br>
        Or maybe just pressed their palms together,<br>
        Or even just raised one hand,<br>
        Or maybe just lowered their head a little—</p>
        <p>By making offerings to images like this,<br>
        Gradually they gonna see measureless Buddhas.<br>
        They gonna accomplish the unsurpassed road themselves,<br>
        Extensively ferry across numberless multitudes,</p>
        <p>Enter nirvāṇa without remainder,<br>
        Like firewood exhausted, fire gone out.<br>
        If people with distracted minds<br>
        Enter into a stupa or temple,</p>
        <p>One time call out 'Homage to the Buddha!'—<br>
        They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.<br>
        Concerning all them Buddhas of the past,<br>
        Whether while they was in the world or after they extinct—</p>
        <p>If there's folks who heard this dharma,<br>
        They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.<br>
        All them World-Honored Ones of the future,<br>
        Their number without any measure—</p>
        <p>All these Tathāgatas<br>
        Gonna use skillful means to speak the dharma.<br>
        All the Tathāgatas,<br>
        Using measureless skillful means,</p>
        <p>Gonna ferry living beings across,<br>
        Cause them to enter the Buddha's wisdom without outflow.<br>
        If there's folks who hear the dharma,<br>
        Not a single one won't become a Buddha.</p>
        <p>The Buddhas' original vow and wish was:<br>
        'The Buddha-road that I'm walking—<br>
        I want to cause living beings universally<br>
        To obtain this same road too.'</p>
        <p>The Buddhas of the future world,<br>
        Even though they gonna speak hundreds of thousands of billions,<br>
        Countless doors into the dharma,<br>
        Actually it's for the one vehicle.</p>
        <p>The Buddhas, Honored Ones of Two Feet,<br>
        They know the dharma constantly has no nature—<br>
        Buddha-seed arises from conditions—<br>
        That's why they speak the one vehicle.</p>
        <p>This dharma dwells in the dharma-position,<br>
        The worldly marks constantly abide.<br>
        Having known this at the place of awakening,<br>
        The Guide uses skillful means to speak.</p>
        <p>The heavenly beings and humans who make offerings,<br>
        The present Buddhas of the ten directions,<br>
        Numerous as Ganges River sands,<br>
        Appearing in the world—</p>
        <p>For the sake of bringing peace to living beings,<br>
        They also speak dharma like this.<br>
        Knowing the foremost still extinction,<br>
        Using the power of skillful means,</p>
        <p>Although they showing various roads,<br>
        Actually it's for the Buddha Vehicle.<br>
        Knowing the practices of living beings,<br>
        What's thought deep in their minds,</p>
        <p>Their karma practiced in the past,<br>
        Their desire-natures, vigor-power,<br>
        And whether their faculties sharp or dull—<br>
        Using various causes and conditions,</p>
        <p>Comparisons and also expressions,<br>
        They speak with appropriate skillful means.<br>
        Now I'm the same way too—<br>
        For the sake of bringing peace to living beings,</p>
        <p>Using various dharma-doors,<br>
        I'm proclaiming and showing the Buddha-road.<br>
        With my power of wisdom,<br>
        I know living beings' natures and desires.</p>
        <p>Using skillful means, speaking all the dharmas,<br>
        I'm causing them all to gain joy.<br>
        Śāriputra, you ought to know—<br>
        With my Buddha-eye I'm looking,</p>
        <p>Seeing living beings of the six paths,<br>
        Poor and without merit or wisdom,<br>
        Entering the dangerous road of birth and death,<br>
        Suffering continuing on without break,</p>
        <p>Deeply attached to the five desires,<br>
        Like a yak loving its tail—<br>
        With greed and craving they damaging themselves,<br>
        Blind in the darkness, can't see nothing.</p>
        <p>They don't seek the Buddha with his great might,<br>
        Don't seek the dharma that cuts off suffering neither.<br>
        Deep into all kinds of wrong views they go,<br>
        Trying to use suffering to get rid of suffering.</p>
        <p>For the sake of living beings like these,<br>
        I arise with a great compassion-mind.<br>
        When I first sat at the place of awakening,<br>
        Gazing at the tree and also walking,</p>
        <p>For three times seven days<br>
        I thought about matters like this:<br>
        'The wisdom I obtained—<br>
        It's subtle, wonderful, most foremost.</p>
        <p>Living beings got dull faculties,<br>
        Attached to pleasure, blinded by ignorance.<br>
        Folks like these here—<br>
        How can they possibly be ferried across?'</p>
        <p>At that time, all them Brahma kings<br>
        And all them Lord Shakras too,<br>
        The Four Heavenly Kings protecting the world,<br>
        And the Great Freedom Heaven god,</p>
        <p>Along with other hosts of heavenly beings,<br>
        Retinues of hundreds of thousands of millions,<br>
        Respectfully with palms pressed together, bowing,<br>
        They begged me to turn the dharma-wheel.</p>
        <p>I immediately thought to myself:<br>
        'If I only praise the Buddha Vehicle,<br>
        Living beings sunk down in suffering,<br>
        They won't be able to believe this dharma.</p>
        <p>Because they break the dharma and don't believe,<br>
        They gonna fall into the three evil paths.<br>
        I'd rather not speak the dharma at all,<br>
        Just quickly enter into nirvāṇa.'</p>
        <p>Then I remembered them Buddhas of the past,<br>
        The power of skillful means they practiced.<br>
        'The road I obtained right now,<br>
        I also ought to speak three vehicles.'</p>
        <p>While I was thinking like this,<br>
        Buddhas from the ten directions all appeared.<br>
        With their Brahma voices they comforted and instructed me:<br>
        'Excellent! Śākyamuni!</p>
        <p>Foremost of Guides,<br>
        You obtained this unsurpassed dharma.<br>
        Following all the Buddhas everywhere,<br>
        You gonna use the power of skillful means.</p>
        <p>We too all obtained<br>
        The most wonderful, foremost dharma.<br>
        For the sake of all kinds of living creatures,<br>
        We make distinctions and speak three vehicles.</p>
        <p>Folks with little wisdom who love the small dharma,<br>
        Who don't believe they can become Buddhas themselves—<br>
        That's why, using skillful means,<br>
        We make distinctions and speak about various fruits.</p>
        <p>Even though we speak three vehicles,<br>
        It's only for teaching bodhisattvas.'<br>
        Śāriputra, you ought to know—<br>
        I heard them holy lion-roars,</p>
        <p>Their deep, pure, subtle, wonderful sounds,<br>
        Joyfully calling 'Homage to the Buddha!'<br>
        Then I thought like this:<br>
        'I came out into this defiled, evil world.</p>
        <p>Just like all them Buddhas spoke,<br>
        I also ought to follow and practice accordingly.'<br>
        After I thought about this matter,<br>
        I immediately went to Varanasi.</p>
        <p>The marks of the dharmas—still extinction—<br>
        Can't be proclaimed in words.<br>
        Using the power of skillful means,<br>
        For five monks I spoke it.</p>
        <p>This is called turning the dharma-wheel.<br>
        Then there was the sound of nirvāṇa,<br>
        And also 'arhat,'<br>
        And 'dharma' and 'sangha'—these distinguishing names.</p>
        <p>From ages long ago till now,<br>
        I been praising the dharma of nirvāṇa—<br>
        The suffering of birth and death forever exhausted—<br>
        I always speak like this.</p>
        <p>Śāriputra, you ought to know:<br>
        I see them Buddha-children,<br>
        Ones aspiring and seeking the Buddha-road,<br>
        Countless thousands of millions of billions.</p>
        <p>All with reverent minds,<br>
        They come to where the Buddha is.<br>
        They done heard from all them Buddhas before<br>
        Dharma spoken with skillful means.</p>
        <p>I immediately thought like this:<br>
        'The reason why the Tathāgata appears<br>
        Is for the sake of speaking the Buddha-wisdom.<br>
        Now is exactly the right time.'</p>
        <p>Śāriputra, you ought to know:<br>
        Folks with dull roots and little wisdom,<br>
        Who attached to marks and full of arrogant pride—<br>
        They can't believe this dharma.</p>
        <p>Now I'm joyful and without fear.<br>
        Among all the bodhisattvas here,<br>
        I'm straightforwardly casting off skillful means,<br>
        Only speaking the unsurpassed road.</p>
        <p>When bodhisattvas hear this dharma,<br>
        All their nets of doubt already got removed.<br>
        Twelve hundred arhats—<br>
        They also, every one, gonna become Buddhas.</p>
        <p>Like all them Buddhas of the three times,<br>
        The pattern and style of speaking dharma—<br>
        I'm doing the same thing now too,<br>
        Speaking the dharma without distinctions.</p>
        <p>When Buddhas arise and appear in the world,<br>
        It's a far-off thing, hard to encounter.<br>
        Even when they do appear in the world,<br>
        Speaking this dharma is hard too.</p>
        <p>Through measureless, countless ages,<br>
        Hearing this dharma is hard too.<br>
        And people able to listen to this dharma—<br>
        Folks like that is hard to find too.</p>
        <p>Like the udumbara flower—<br>
        Everybody loves it and delights in it,<br>
        Heavenly beings and humans hold it rare—<br>
        It only appears from time to time.</p>
        <p>When you hear the dharma, rejoice and praise it,<br>
        Even just speaking out one word—<br>
        That's already making an offering<br>
        To all the Buddhas of the three times.</p>
        <p>A person like this is extremely rare,<br>
        Rarer than the udumbara flower.<br>
        All of you, don't have no doubts—<br>
        I'm the King of the Dharmas.</p>
        <p>I'm announcing to the whole great assembly:<br>
        Only using the road of one vehicle,<br>
        I'm teaching and transforming bodhisattvas.<br>
        There ain't no disciples in the disciple-vehicle.</p>
        <p>All of you, Śāriputra,<br>
        Disciples and bodhisattvas too—<br>
        You ought to know this wonderful dharma<br>
        Is the secret essential of all the Buddhas.</p>
        <p>In this defiled, evil world of five kinds,<br>
        Folks only take pleasure in being attached to desires.<br>
        Living beings like these here—<br>
        They'll never seek the Buddha-road.</p>
        <p>Evil people in the future world,<br>
        When they hear the Buddha speak one vehicle,<br>
        They gonna be confused, deluded, won't believe or accept it,<br>
        Gonna break the dharma and fall into evil paths.</p>
        <p>But if there's folks with humility and purity,<br>
        Who aspire and seek the Buddha-road—<br>
        For folks like these,<br>
        I'm gonna extensively praise the road of one vehicle.</p>
        <p>Śāriputra, you ought to know—<br>
        The dharma of all the Buddhas is like this:<br>
        Using ten thousand billions of skillful means,<br>
        According to what's fitting, they speak the dharma.</p>
        <p>Them who don't study and learn it—<br>
        They ain't able to understand this clearly.<br>
        Since all of you already know<br>
        The Buddhas, teachers of the world,</p>
        <p>Their appropriate skillful means and matters—<br>
        Don't have no more doubts and wondering.<br>
        Let your minds be born with great rejoicing—<br>
        Know that you yourselves gonna become Buddhas!</p>

        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This blues vernacular translation transforms Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese into the rhythmic, direct language of the blues tradition. Key metaphorical choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>方便 (skillful means) → "loving tricks" / "skillful means" - capturing both the strategic and compassionate aspects</li>
            <li>諸佛智慧，甚深無量 → "deeper than any well you ever tried to draw from" - making abstract depth concrete</li>
            <li>一大事因緣 → "one great matter, one great cause and condition" / "the one great reason" - preserving both formality and accessibility</li>
            <li>五千人退席 → The five thousand leaving rendered as dramatic narrative moment</li>
            <li>Repetitive verse structure → Blues-style repetition with variation</li>
            <li>Technical terms (Tathāgata, Buddha, nirvāṇa) → Kept for their essential meaning, but surrounded by vernacular explanation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The translation maintains the complete narrative arc from the Classical Chinese, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Buddha's emergence from meditation and initial teaching</li>
            <li>Śāriputra's three requests and the Buddha's three refusals</li>
            <li>The departure of the five thousand arrogant ones</li>
            <li>The revelation of the One Vehicle teaching</li>
            <li>All extensive verse sections</li>
            <li>The teaching on the three times (past, present, future Buddhas)</li>
            <li>The varieties of offerings that lead to Buddhahood</li>
            <li>The Buddha's post-enlightenment hesitation and Brahma kings' request</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The blues vernacular approach makes this profound Mahayana teaching accessible while preserving its depth—using everyday metaphors (wells, roads, doors, fires, seeds) and direct address ("you hear me?", "you understand?") to create immediacy and connection with the reader.</p>
