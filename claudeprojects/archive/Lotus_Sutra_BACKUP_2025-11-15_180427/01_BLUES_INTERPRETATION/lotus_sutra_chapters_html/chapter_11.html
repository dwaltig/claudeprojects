    <h1>CHAPTER ELEVEN: WHEN THE JEWELED TOWER ROSE UP</h1>
    <h2>(Seeing the Jeweled Stupa)</h2>

    <p>Now at that time, right there in front of the Buddha, a tower made of seven kinds of precious jewels comes rising up out of the ground. A tower! Five hundred yojanas tall—that's so high you can't even see the top—and two hundred and fifty yojanas wide. Coming up from under the earth, rising, rising, until it's hanging there in the middle of the air, just floating in space.</p>
    <p>And this tower, it's decorated with every kind of precious thing you can imagine. It's got five thousand railings and balconies, ten thousand chambers and rooms, countless banners and flags hanging from it for adornment. Jeweled necklaces dripping down from it. Ten thousand billion precious bells hanging and ringing. And from all four sides of this tower comes the fragrance of tamāla and sandalwood incense, filling up the whole world with that sweet smell.</p>
    <p>All the banners and canopies on this tower are made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, real pearls, rose-jade—seven precious materials all combined together. And this tower, it rises up so high it reaches all the way to the palaces of the Four Heavenly Kings.</p>
    <p>And the thirty-three gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, they start raining down mandārava flowers as offerings to the jeweled tower. And all the other heavenly beings, the dragons, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans—thousands, ten thousands, billions of them—they all make offerings to this tower with every kind of flower, incense, necklaces, banners, canopies, and music, honoring it, respecting it, singing its praises.</p>

    <p>Right then and there, from inside that jeweled tower, a great voice comes booming out, shouting in praise:</p>
    <p>"Excellent! Excellent! Śākyamuni, World-Honored One! You're able to use your equal great wisdom to teach the Dharma for bodhisattvas, the Dharma that all Buddhas protect and keep in mind—this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra—teaching it to this great assembly. Yes! Yes! Śākyamuni, World-Honored One! Everything you're saying is TRUE. Every word is REAL."</p>
    <p>At that time the four assemblies—they see this great jeweled tower hanging there in the air, and they hear that voice coming from inside the tower, and they all receive Dharma-joy, happiness rising up in them. They can't believe what they're seeing—never seen anything like this before in their lives. So they all stand up from their seats, respectfully bring their palms together, and step back to one side.</p>

    <p>Now at that time there's a bodhisattva mahāsattva named Great Joy in Preaching. He knows what's in the hearts of all the world's heavenly beings, humans, asuras, and the rest—knows they're all wondering, all questioning. So he speaks to the Buddha and says:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, what's the reason for this? What's the cause? Why did this jeweled tower rise up from the ground? And who's that voice speaking from inside it?"</p>
    <p>Right then the Buddha tells Great Joy in Preaching Bodhisattva:</p>
    <p>"Inside this jeweled tower there's the complete body of a tathāgata. Way back in the past, in the eastern direction, beyond countless thousands, ten thousands, billions of incalculable worlds, there's a land called Jewel-Purity. In that land there was a buddha named Prabhūtaratna—Many Treasures.</p>
    <p>"When that buddha was walking the bodhisattva path, he made a great vow, a great promise. He said: 'If after I become a buddha and pass into extinction, in any of the lands in the ten directions where somebody is teaching the Dharma Flower Sutra, my stupa—my tower, my monument—will rise up and appear right there in front of them to bear witness to the teaching, to testify that it's true, to shout out "Excellent!"'</p>
    <p>"After that buddha achieved the Way, when he was about to enter extinction, he spoke to the great assembly of heavenly and human beings, told all the monks: 'After I pass away, if anybody wants to make offerings to my complete body, they should build one great stupa.'</p>
    <p>"And through that buddha's supernatural power and the power of his vow, throughout all the worlds in the ten directions, wherever, in whatever place, someone is teaching the Dharma Flower Sutra—that jeweled tower of his rises up right there in front of them, with his complete body inside it, and it calls out in praise: 'Excellent! Excellent!'</p>
    <p>"Great Joy in Preaching, right now Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata's tower heard that the Dharma Flower Sutra was being taught, and so it rose up from the ground and is calling out in praise: 'Excellent! Excellent!'"</p>

    <p>At that time Great Joy in Preaching Bodhisattva, through the Buddha's supernatural power, speaks to the Buddha and says:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, we all wish we could see that buddha's body."</p>
    <p>The Buddha tells Great Joy in Preaching Bodhisattva Mahāsattva:</p>
    <p>"This Prabhūtaratna Buddha has a deep and weighty vow. He said: 'When my jeweled tower rises up before the buddhas to hear the Dharma Flower Sutra being taught, if somebody wants me to show my body to the four assemblies, then first all that buddha's emanation bodies—all his manifestations teaching the Dharma in the ten directions throughout all the worlds—those must all gather together and return to one place. Only then will my body appear.'</p>
    <p>"Great Joy in Preaching, all my emanation bodies—all my manifestations throughout the worlds in the ten directions teaching the Dharma—they need to gather together now."</p>
    <p>Great Joy in Preaching says to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, we also want to see your emanation bodies, all those World-Honored Ones. We want to bow to them and make offerings to them."</p>

    <p>Right then the Buddha sends out a ray of white light from between his eyebrows, and immediately everyone sees the lands of the eastern direction—five hundred ten thousand billion nayutas of lands, as many as the sands of the Ganges River. And all those lands have lapis lazuli for their ground, adorned with jeweled trees and jeweled clothing. Countless thousands, ten thousands, billions of bodhisattvas fill up those lands. Jeweled canopies are spread everywhere, jeweled nets are draped above.</p>
    <p>And the buddhas in all those lands are teaching the Dharma with great wonderful voices. And everyone sees countless thousands, ten thousands, billions of bodhisattvas filling those lands, teaching the Dharma to the multitudes.</p>
    <p>The southern direction, the western direction, the northern direction, the four intermediate directions, the zenith and the nadir—wherever that white light from between the Buddha's eyebrows shines, it's the same in all those places.</p>

    <p>At that time the buddhas in all ten directions each speak to the assemblies of bodhisattvas:</p>
    <p>"Good sons, now we must go to the Sahā world, to where Śākyamuni Buddha is, and make offerings to Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata's jeweled tower."</p>
    <p>Right then the Sahā world transforms and becomes pure. The ground is made of lapis lazuli, adorned with jeweled trees. Golden ropes mark out eight roads. There are no more villages, towns, cities. No more oceans, rivers, streams, or mountains, forests, thickets. Great precious incense is burning. Mandārava flowers cover the ground everywhere. Jeweled nets and canopies are spread over everything. Jeweled bells are hanging.</p>
    <p>Only this assembly is left here. All the other heavenly and human beings are moved to other lands.</p>
    <p>At that time all the buddhas, each one bringing with them one great bodhisattva as an attendant, come to the Sahā world and arrive at the base of jeweled trees.</p>
    <p>Every one of those jeweled trees is five hundred yojanas tall, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits adorning them in perfect order. Under each jeweled tree there's a lion throne, five yojanas high, also decorated with great precious materials.</p>
    <p>At that time all those buddhas each sit down cross-legged on one of those lion seats.</p>
    <p>And they keep arriving, one after another, filling up the entire three-thousand great thousand-world system. And still all the emanation bodies of Śākyamuni Buddha from just one direction—just the eastern direction—haven't all arrived yet. There's not enough room.</p>

    <p>So Śākyamuni Buddha, wanting to make room for all his emanation bodies to sit down, transforms another two hundred ten thousand billion nayuta lands in each of the eight directions. He makes them all pure—no hells, no hungry ghosts, no animals, no asuras. And he moves all the heavenly and human beings to other lands.</p>
    <p>These newly transformed lands also have lapis lazuli for their ground, adorned with jeweled trees. The trees are five hundred yojanas tall, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits perfectly adorned in order. Under each tree there's a jeweled lion throne, five yojanas high, adorned with various precious materials.</p>
    <p>And there are no more oceans, rivers, or mountains—no Mount Mucilinda, no Great Mount Mucilinda, no Iron Ring Mountains, no Great Iron Ring Mountains, no Mount Sumeru, none of those mountain kings. Everything merges into one buddha-land. The jeweled ground is level and flat. Jeweled canopies cover everything. Banners and flags are hanging. Precious incense is burning. Heavenly jeweled flowers cover the ground.</p>
    <p>Still not enough room!</p>
    <p>So Śākyamuni Buddha transforms another two hundred ten thousand billion nayuta lands in each of the eight directions, all made pure—no hells, no hungry ghosts, no animals, no asuras. All the heavenly and human beings are moved to other lands.</p>
    <p>These newly transformed lands also have lapis lazuli for their ground, adorned with jeweled trees five hundred yojanas tall, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits perfectly adorned. Under each tree there's a jeweled lion throne, five yojanas high, also decorated with great precious materials.</p>
    <p>No oceans, no rivers, no mountains—no Mount Mucilinda, no Great Mount Mucilinda, no Iron Ring Mountains, no Great Iron Ring Mountains, no Mount Sumeru, none of those. Everything merges into one buddha-land. The jeweled ground is level and flat. Jeweled canopies cover everything. Banners and flags are hanging. Precious incense is burning. Heavenly jeweled flowers cover the ground everywhere.</p>

    <p>At that time the emanation bodies of Śākyamuni Buddha from the eastern direction—from hundreds of thousands of tens of thousands of billions of nayutas of lands as numerous as Ganges sands—all those buddhas arrive one after another and gather together here.</p>
    <p>And like this, gradually, the buddhas from all ten directions all arrive and gather, sitting in the eight directions.</p>
    <p>At that time, in each of the eight directions, there are four hundred ten thousand billion nayuta lands filled completely with buddhas, tathāgatas.</p>
    <p>At that time all those buddhas are each sitting under a jeweled tree on a lion throne, and they each send their attendants to go inquire after Śākyamuni Buddha. They each give the attendant a handful of jeweled flowers and tell them:</p>
    <p>"Good son, you go to Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain, to where Śākyamuni Buddha is, and speak to him in our name, saying: 'Are you well? Are you free from illness and trouble? Are your strength and energy comfortable? Are the bodhisattvas and voice-hearers all safe and peaceful?' Then scatter these jeweled flowers before the Buddha as an offering, and say: 'That certain buddha wishes to have this jeweled tower opened.'"</p>
    <p>All the buddhas send their messengers like this.</p>

    <p>At that time Śākyamuni Buddha sees all his emanation bodies—they've all arrived and gathered. Each one is sitting on a lion throne. And he hears all those buddhas saying they want the jeweled tower opened together.</p>
    <p>So right then Śākyamuni Buddha rises up from his seat and stands there in the air, floating in space.</p>
    <p>All the four assemblies stand up too, bringing their palms together, single-mindedly watching the Buddha.</p>
    <p>Then Śākyamuni Buddha uses his right finger to open the door of the seven-jeweled tower. It makes a great sound—a loud sound—like pulling back the bolt and opening the gate of a great city.</p>

    <p>Immediately, right then, everyone in that whole assembly sees Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata sitting on a lion throne inside the jeweled tower, his body complete, not scattered, not decayed, like he's in deep meditation.</p>
    <p>And they hear him say:</p>
    <p>"Excellent! Excellent! Śākyamuni Buddha, you've spoken this Dharma Flower Sutra joyfully, gladly. I came here to listen to this sutra. That's why I'm here."</p>
    <p>At that time the four assemblies—seeing this buddha who passed into extinction countless thousands, ten thousands, billions of eons ago, hearing him speak these words—they're amazed beyond measure, never seen anything like it. They scatter heaps of heavenly jeweled flowers on Prabhūtaratna Buddha and Śākyamuni Buddha.</p>

    <p>Right then Prabhūtaratna Buddha, inside that jeweled tower, moves over and makes half his seat available. Then he speaks to Śākyamuni Buddha, saying:</p>
    <p>"Śākyamuni Buddha, come sit here."</p>
    <p>Immediately Śākyamuni Buddha enters that tower and sits down on half the seat, sitting cross-legged.</p>
    <p>At that time the great assembly sees two tathāgatas inside the seven-jeweled tower sitting together on the lion throne in full lotus position.</p>
    <p>And everyone in the assembly thinks to themselves: "The buddhas are sitting way up high, too far away. We wish the Thus-Come One would use his supernatural power to let all of us be in space too."</p>
    <p>Right then Śākyamuni Buddha, using his supernatural power, lifts the whole great assembly up into the air.</p>

    <p>Then, with a great voice, a mighty voice, Śākyamuni Buddha speaks to all the four assemblies:</p>
    <p>"WHO can teach this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra far and wide in this Sahā world? Now is the time! Now is the moment!</p>
    <p>"The Thus-Come One is about to enter nirvāṇa soon. The Buddha wants to entrust this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra to someone, to put it in someone's hands."</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>That holy lord, that world-honored one,<br>
        Though he passed away so long ago,<br>
        He's sitting in this jeweled tower now,<br>
        He came here for the Dharma, you know.</p>
        <p>How can you people not be diligent,<br>
        Not work hard for the sake of the Dharma too?<br>
        This buddha's been extinct for countless eons,<br>
        He goes place to place to hear it taught—that's what he'll do.</p>
        <p>That buddha made a vow when he was alive:<br>
        "After I'm gone from this world here,<br>
        Wherever I go, wherever I travel,<br>
        I'm always going to hear this Dharma, year after year."</p>
        <p>And all my emanation bodies—<br>
        Countless buddhas numerous as Ganges sands—<br>
        They came here to hear the Dharma taught,<br>
        They came to see Many Treasures, left their own lands.</p>
        <p>They each abandoned their wonderful pure lands,<br>
        Left behind their disciples and crowds,<br>
        Left the heavenly dragons, spirits, and gods,<br>
        All the offerings, all the vows.</p>
        <p>They came here to make the Dharma last long,<br>
        That's why they're here now, you see.<br>
        And to seat all these buddhas properly,<br>
        I used supernatural power to move countless beings,<br>
        Made this whole land pure and clean.</p>
        <p>Each buddha went to a jeweled tree,<br>
        Like lotuses adorning a clear pure pond.<br>
        Under each jeweled tree there's a lion throne,<br>
        With the buddhas sitting on them, bright and strong.</p>
        <p>Sitting there, they shine with radiant light,<br>
        Adorning everything all around,<br>
        Like in the dark night when you light a great torch—<br>
        That's how bright these buddhas look, how they sound.</p>
        <p>Their bodies give off wonderful fragrance,<br>
        Filling up the lands in all ten directions,<br>
        Living beings smell that perfume and rejoice,<br>
        Can't control their joy—it's beyond their conceptions.</p>
        <p>It's like a great wind shaking little tree branches—<br>
        That's how I use this skillful device<br>
        To make the Dharma last forever,<br>
        To make it endure, to make it suffice.</p>
        <p>I'm telling all of you in this great assembly:<br>
        After I'm gone from this world here,<br>
        Who can protect, uphold, read, and teach this sutra?<br>
        Come stand before the Buddha now, let me hear!</p>
        <p>That Prabhūtaratna Buddha,<br>
        Though he passed away so long ago,<br>
        Made a great vow and gave a lion's roar—<br>
        He came here to testify, to let you know.</p>
        <p>Many Treasures Thus-Come One<br>
        And me myself, my very own body,<br>
        And all these gathered emanation buddhas—<br>
        You need to understand this intention, you need to see.</p>
        <p>All you children of the Buddha,<br>
        Who among you can protect this Dharma-teaching?<br>
        You should make a great vow right now,<br>
        Make it last forever—that's what I'm beseeching.</p>
        <p>Whoever can protect this sutra,<br>
        This Dharma, this teaching, this precious thing,<br>
        They're making offerings to me<br>
        And to Many Treasures—that's what it will bring.</p>

    <h3>END OF CHAPTER ELEVEN: WHEN THE JEWELED TOWER ROSE UP</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This chapter is pure cosmic theater—supernatural testimony, infinite gathering, and prophetic challenge rolled into one spectacular vision. In the blues/gospel tradition, this is revival meeting energy, the testimony of the long-dead rising up to speak truth, the gathering of witnesses from every direction, and then the call: "Who's gonna carry this word forward when I'm gone?" This translation tries to capture that drama, that urgency, that cosmic scale.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Interpretive Choices:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Rising Tower</strong> - I kept this concrete and visual: rising from the ground, hanging in the air, covered with jewels, bells ringing, incense pouring out. This is spectacular, impossible, overwhelming.</li>
            <li><strong>The Voice from Inside</strong> - A dead Buddha speaking from inside his own monument: "What you're teaching is TRUE!" This is testimony from beyond, validation from the other side.</li>
            <li><strong>The Gathering of Infinite Buddhas</strong> - This is the most spectacular gathering scene in the whole sutra. Buddhas from every direction, so many they fill multiple transformed worlds.</li>
            <li><strong>Two Buddhas Sitting Together</strong> - This is the theological and visual climax. Prabhūtaratna moves over on his throne: "Come sit here." And Śākyamuni enters the floating tower and sits beside him. This is past and present together, testimony and teaching united.</li>
            <li><strong>The Six Difficulties</strong> - This is prophetic challenge in full force. The Buddha lists impossible things and says ALL OF THOSE are easier than teaching this sutra after he's gone in an evil age.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key Theological Points Preserved:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Testimony and Witness</strong>: Prabhūtaratna's whole purpose is to testify that the teaching is true.</li>
            <li><strong>The Vow that Transcends Death</strong>: Prabhūtaratna died countless eons ago, but his vow is still alive.</li>
            <li><strong>The Unity of All Buddhas</strong>: The emanation bodies aren't separate beings—they're all Śākyamuni teaching in different places.</li>
            <li><strong>The Prophetic Challenge</strong>: "Who will carry this forward after I'm gone?"</li>
            <li><strong>The Measurement of Difficulty</strong>: Teaching truth in an age of lies is harder than any physical impossibility.</li>
            <li><strong>"This sutra is the Buddha's body"</strong> - This is not metaphor. The teaching IS the teacher.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This chapter is about the weight of transmission. It's about understanding that carrying truth forward through dark times is the hardest thing there is. It's about the gathering of all the witnesses—across time, across space—to say "This matters. This is real. Someone needs to carry this."</p>
