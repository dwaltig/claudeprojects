    <h1>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX: THE PROTECTION SONGS</h1>
    <h2>(陀羅尼品第二十六)</h2>

    <h3>WHEN MEDICINE KING STEPS UP</h3>
    <p>Now right then, Medicine King Bodhisattva—you remember him, the one who burned his own body to show his devotion—he stood up from his seat, put his robe over one shoulder the way you do when you're about to say something serious, pressed his palms together, and spoke to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, listen now. If there's a good man or a good woman—I'm talking about anybody who's got the heart—if they can hold on to this Lotus teaching, if they can read it and speak it and know it through and through, if they can write it down with their own hand, tell me: How much blessing does that soul receive?"</p>
    <p>And the Buddha said to Medicine King: "Let me ask you something first. If there was a good man or a good woman, and they made offerings to eight hundred myriads of millions of nayutas of Buddhas—as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River—what you think? Would their blessing be great, or would it be small?"</p>
    <p>"It would be great, World-Honored One. Lord, it would be mighty great."</p>
    <p>The Buddha said: "Now let me tell you something. If a good man or a good woman can hold on to even one four-line verse of this teaching—just four lines!—if they can read it and speak it and understand what it means, if they can practice what it says, their merit is GREATER THAN THAT. You hear what I'm saying? Greater than all that other merit combined."</p>
    <p>Right then Medicine King said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I'm about to give a protection song—a dhāraṇī—to those who teach this Dharma. I'm gonna stand guard over them."</p>
    <p>And he spoke the powerful words:</p>
    <p>ANYE MANYE MANE MAMANE CHITE CHARITE<br>
    SHAME SHAMITARE SHANTE MUKTE MUKTAME<br>
    SAME AVISAME SAMASAME JAYE KSHAYE<br>
    AKSHINE SHANTE SHAME DHĀRAṆĪ<br>
    ALOKABHASHA PRATYAVEKSHANI NIDHIRU<br>
    ABHYANTARANIVISHTE ABHYANTARA PARI SHUDHI<br>
    UKKULE MUKKULE ARADE PARADE SUKAKSHI<br>
    ASAMASAME BUDDHAVILOKITE DHARMAPARIKSHITE<br>
    SANGHANIRGHOSHANI BHASHYA BHASHYA SHUHDI<br>
    MANTRA MANTRAAKSHAYATE RUTE RUTA KAUSHALYA<br>
    AKSHARA AKSHARA TYAYANTE ABHYAVAKARA AVALOKANI</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One," Medicine King said, "this protection song, this powerful dhāraṇī, has been spoken by six hundred and twenty million Buddhas—as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges. Listen here: If anybody harms a teacher of this Dharma, they have harmed ALL THOSE BUDDHAS. You understand what I'm saying? You touch one of ours, you touch the whole family."</p>

    <h3>THE BUDDHA SAYS AMEN</h3>
    <p>Then Śākyamuni Buddha praised Medicine King, saying: "Good, good! Medicine King, you done right. Because you have compassion for these Dharma teachers, because you want to protect them, you spoke this dhāraṇī. And it's gonna bring great benefit to all living beings. Great benefit indeed."</p>

    <h3>WHEN BRAVE GIVER ADDS HIS VOICE</h3>
    <p>Right then, Brave Giver Bodhisattva spoke up to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I'm gonna add my protection too. I'm gonna give a dhāraṇī to guard those who read and recite and hold on to the Lotus teaching. If a Dharma teacher has this protection song, then listen:</p>
    <p>"If a yaksha comes looking for trouble—can't touch 'em.<br>
    If a rakshasa demon comes sniffing around—can't touch 'em.<br>
    If a putana spirit comes hunting—can't touch 'em.<br>
    If a krtya curse comes creeping—can't touch 'em.<br>
    If a kumbhanda goblin comes prowling—can't touch 'em.<br>
    If a hungry ghost comes seeking—can't touch 'em.</p>
    <p>"They'll be looking for a weak spot, but they won't find one. No sir, they won't find one."</p>
    <p>And right there before the Buddha, he spoke the powerful words:</p>
    <p>JVALE MAHAJVALE UKKE MUKKE ADE<br>
    ADAVATI NRTYE NRTYAVATI ITTINI<br>
    VITTINI CHITTINI NRTYANI NRTYAVATI</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī protection song has been spoken by as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. And all of them rejoiced in it. Listen here: If anybody harms a teacher of this Dharma, they have harmed ALL THOSE BUDDHAS. You hear what I'm saying?"</p>

    <h3>WHEN THE DEMON KINGS START PROTECTING</h3>
    <p>Right then, Vaishravana—that's the Heavenly King, the Guardian of the North, the Protector of the World—he spoke to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, I too have compassion for living beings. I too want to protect these Dharma teachers. So I'm gonna speak this dhāraṇī."</p>
    <p>And he spoke the powerful words:</p>
    <p>ATYE NATYE VANATYE ANADA NADI KUNADI</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, with this powerful protection song I'm gonna guard these Dharma teachers. I myself will protect those who hold this teaching. For a hundred yojanas around them—that's a mighty long distance—there will be NO TROUBLE. No sickness, no disaster, no harm. I'm watching."</p>

    <h3>WHEN THE GUARDIAN OF THE EAST JOINS IN</h3>
    <p>Right then, Dhrtarashtra—that's the Heavenly King who Guards the East—he was in that assembly with ten thousand million nayutas of gandharva musicians all around him, showing respect. He came forward to where the Buddha was, pressed his palms together, and said:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, I too will protect those who hold the Lotus teaching with a dhāraṇī protection song."</p>
    <p>And he spoke the powerful words:</p>
    <p>AGANE GANE GAURI GANDHARA CHANDALI<br>
    MATANGI JANGULE VRUSE PUKKASI BHARYE</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī protection song has been spoken by four hundred and twenty million Buddhas. If anybody harms a teacher of this Dharma, they have harmed ALL THOSE BUDDHAS. That's what I'm telling you."</p>

    <h3>WHEN THE YAKSHA GODDESSES SWEAR THEIR OATH</h3>
    <p>Right then there were ten yaksha goddesses—now these are fierce female spirits, you understand—and their names were:</p>
    <p>Lambā (That means "Hanging Down")<br>
    Vilambā (That means "Hanging Way Down")<br>
    Crooked Teeth<br>
    Flower Teeth<br>
    Black Teeth<br>
    Many Locks<br>
    Never Satisfied<br>
    Wearing Necklaces<br>
    Kuntī<br>
    And the one called Stealer of the Life Force of All Living Beings</p>
    <p>These ten yaksha goddesses came together with Hariti—that's the Mother of Demons herself, the one who used to eat children until the Buddha converted her—and they brought her children and all her attendants. They all came to where the Buddha was, and together, in one voice, they said:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, we too want to protect those who read and recite and hold on to the Lotus teaching. We want to remove their troubles. If anyone is looking for a way to harm a Dharma teacher, they won't find it. We won't let them find it."</p>
    <p>And right there before the Buddha, they spoke the powerful words:</p>
    <p>ITTI MINI ITTI VINI ITTI VAINI CHITI VAINI NIVRI<br>
    NIVRI NIVRI NIVRI NIVRI<br>
    RUHE RUHE RUHE RUHE<br>
    TAHE TAHE TAHE<br>
    TUHE STUHE</p>
    <p>And then they said—listen to this oath now, this is serious:</p>
    <p>"Better they should walk on our heads—that's right, trample us down—than that they should trouble a Dharma teacher.</p>
    <p>"If a yaksha comes—we're watching.<br>
    If a rakshasa comes—we're watching.<br>
    If a hungry ghost comes—we're watching.<br>
    If a putana comes—we're watching.<br>
    If a krtya comes—we're watching.<br>
    If a vetala corpse-demon comes—we're watching.<br>
    If a skandha child-demon comes—we're watching.<br>
    If an unmada madness-demon comes—we're watching.<br>
    If an apasmara epilepsy-demon comes—we're watching.<br>
    If a yaksha-krtya comes—we're watching.<br>
    If a human-krtya comes—we're watching.<br>
    If a fever comes—whether it's a one-day fever, or a two-day fever, or a three-day fever, or a four-day fever, all the way up to a seven-day fever, or even a constant fever—we're watching.<br>
    Whether the demon takes a man's form, or a woman's form, or a boy's form, or a girl's form—even in dreams, we say DON'T YOU TROUBLE THEM."</p>
    <p>And right there before the Buddha, they spoke a verse:</p>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>If you don't respect our protection song,<br>
        If you trouble those who teach the Dharma,<br>
        Your head will split into seven pieces<br>
        Like branches breaking off the Arjaka tree.</p>
        <p>Like the sin of killing your father and mother,<br>
        Like the disaster of pressing out oil with false measures,<br>
        Like cheating people with crooked scales,<br>
        Like Devadatta breaking up the Sangha—</p>
        <p>That's the kind of disaster you'll bring on yourself<br>
        If you harm a teacher of this Dharma.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>THE YAKSHA GODDESSES MAKE THEIR PROMISE</h3>
    <p>When those yaksha goddesses had spoken this verse, they said to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, we ourselves will personally protect those who hold and read and recite and practice this teaching. We'll give them peace and security. We'll keep all troubles away. We'll neutralize all poisons."</p>
    <p>And the Buddha said to those yaksha goddesses: "Good, good! Listen now: If you all can protect even someone who just holds on to the NAME of the Lotus teaching—just the name!—your merit is beyond measure. How much more if you protect someone who fully holds on to this teaching, who makes offerings to these written scrolls with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, with banners and canopies, with music, with all kinds of lamps—butter lamps, oil lamps, fragrant oil lamps, jasmine oil lamps, champaka flower oil lamps, varshika flower oil lamps, utpala water lily oil lamps—with these hundred thousand kinds of offerings!</p>
    <p>"Kuntī, you and all your attendants should protect such teachers of the Dharma. You hear what I'm saying? Protect them."</p>

    <h3>WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY HEARD THIS</h3>
    <p>When this Protection Songs chapter was spoken, sixty-eight thousand people—that's right, sixty-eight thousand souls—attained the patience of non-arising. That means they reached the place where they knew: Nothing is born, nothing dies, it all just keeps flowing. They got free right then, just from hearing about this protection.</p>
    <h3>END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX: THE PROTECTION SONGS</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This chapter reveals the other face of compassion: FIERCE PROTECTION. This is the love that says, "You will not harm my children." The dhāraṇī, or protection songs, are not translated because they are sounds of power, meant to be uttered, not intellectually understood. Their power is in the sound itself.</p>
        <p>The key principle is cosmic justice: "If you harm a teacher of this Dharma, you have harmed all those Buddhas." It's a declaration that those who speak truth are BACKED UP by the entire cosmos. Even former demons like the yaksha goddesses and Hariti become protectors, showing that the Dharma is so universal it can transform even the wildest forces to serve the good.</p>
        <p>The oaths and curses sworn by the yaksha goddesses are not petty threats but a form of sacred covenant, demonstrating the profound seriousness of protecting the Dharma. This chapter is permission to stand up and speak truth without fear, knowing that the universe itself stands guard.</p>
