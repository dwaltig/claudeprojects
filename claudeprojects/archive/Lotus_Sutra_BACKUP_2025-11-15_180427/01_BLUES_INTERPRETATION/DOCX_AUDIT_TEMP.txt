Heading 2: PREFACE
Heading 3: How This Teaching Made It to Us
Normal: Told by Dao Xuan, monk of Mount Zhongnan, Tang Dynasty
Normal: Now let me tell you how this teaching got here.
Normal: This Lotus Sutra - this teaching of the Wonderful Dharma - it's the reason why the Buddhas even bother coming down here in the first place. It's the heart of the matter, the real deal, the thing they came to say. This teaching was kept safe over there in India - that great land where wisdom grows - kept there for more than a thousand years before anybody ever thought to bring it east.
Normal: Three hundred some years ago, it crossed the mountains and came to China. And I'm gonna tell you how that happened, 'cause it's a story worth knowing.
Normal: First time anybody tried to put this sutra into Chinese, it was back in the Western Jin Dynasty, during Emperor Hui's Yongkang years. There was this teacher - they called him a Bodhisattva - name of Dharmarakṣa, come from Dunhuang way out west where the desert meets the mountains. He was living by the Azure Gate in Chang'an - that's the old capital, you know - and he sat down with these ancient Sanskrit texts and did his best to turn 'em into Chinese. Called his version "The Sutra of the Correct Dharma Lotus." That was the first.
Normal: Then come the Eastern Jin Dynasty, Emperor An's Longan years, over in the Later Qin kingdom during what they called the Hongshi era. There was this monk from Kucha - that's way out there on the Silk Road - name of Kumārajīva. Now Kumārajīva, he was something special. He took that same sutra and translated it fresh, and he called it "The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma." That's the one you got in your hands right now. That's the one we been reading all these years.
Normal: Later on, in the Sui Dynasty during the Renshou years, there was a third teacher - Jñānagupta from Northern India, living at the Great Xingshan Monastery. He made another translation, called it "The Wonderful Dharma" too.
Normal: So now we got three versions, three different ways of saying the same thing. They overlap here and there, they put things different ways, but they all trying to get at that same truth. And you know what? The one folks took to heart, the one that really caught on, was Kumārajīva's version - that Qin dynasty translation. That's the one we been studying, the one we been living with. (There's other pieces floating around too - chapters here, verses there - but we ain't talking about those today. That's for the history books.)
Normal: Now let me tell you why this teaching matters.
Normal: When the Holy Mountain showed its signs, when the sacred peaks started manifesting wonders, it took the Great Sage himself to open up that teaching, to crack it wide for people to see. And even then, even when he started teaching, it could only reach the folks who had the connection from way back - folks who'd known him before, in other lives, other times. That's just how karma works.
Normal: So first, at the Deer Park, when the Buddha started teaching, he had to divide things up. Some folks were ready for the small vehicle, some were ready for the great. Some needed the simple teachings to start with, some could handle the deep stuff right away. That's why there's different levels to this thing.
Normal: Then later, at the Golden River when he was about to leave this world, he had to make it clear again: some teachings are partial, some teachings are complete. Some give you a piece of the truth, some give you the whole picture. And here's the thing - it ain't about one assembly being better than another. The teaching meets people where they're at. It comes at the right time, in the right way, for the right folks.
Normal: You remember when five thousand people got up and walked out of the assembly? Folks think they was just arrogant, just full of themselves. But maybe they was supposed to leave. Maybe they needed to go deal with that pride before they could hear what was coming next. That's what I'm saying - everything happens for a reason.
Normal: And those five hundred who got their prophecies, who got told they gonna be Buddhas one day? They was all part of the secret teaching, the hidden work that's been going on all along.
Normal: That's why the Buddha put on that light show at the beginning - emitting that ray from between his eyebrows, lighting up all them worlds to the east. He was opening up the teaching, giving folks a reason to ask questions. He came out of that meditation and started talking about Buddha-wisdom, that big understanding that sees it all.
Normal: He told 'em about the burning house - how you gotta get out before the flames take you down, how you need that Great Vehicle to carry you to safety.
Normal: He told 'em about that phantom city - how sometimes you need a place to rest on the long journey, even if it ain't the final destination. How those old connections, those friendships from way back, they don't just disappear. They keep you moving forward.
Normal: He told 'em about the jewel sewn in the robe - how you been carrying the treasure all along, even when you was drunk and didn't know it. How your true nature been right there the whole time, just waiting for you to remember.
Normal: He told 'em about boring for water - how there's a hundred ways to get to that underground stream, how you can't give up just 'cause the dirt looks dry. You gotta keep digging, keep searching, 'cause the water's down there somewhere.
Normal: All these words, all these stories - they clear as day when you look at 'em, but they pointing to something far off, something you gotta travel toward. And if it wasn't for the Great Compassion - that Buddha's heart that can't stand to see folks drowning in their confusion, sinking in their suffering - none of this teaching would've come forth. If it wasn't for that ultimate compassionate heart, wanting to save folks who done lost their way, who done forgot who they really are - we wouldn't have none of this.
Normal: Now I'm gonna tell you something that'll make you sit up and pay attention.
Normal: From the Han Dynasty all the way through to right now, here in the Tang Dynasty, that's more than six hundred years. In all that time, they done translated over four thousand scrolls of Buddhist scriptures - four thousand! - brought 'em all the way from India, turned 'em all into Chinese. Libraries full of wisdom, stacks and stacks of teachings.
Normal: But you know which one folks hold onto most? You know which one they read and chant and study more than any other? This one. This Lotus Sutra right here.
Normal: Why you think that is?
Normal: Maybe it's 'cause this teaching speaks to something in folks, touches some old memory from way back. They say we was all there at the teaching of Buddha Wisdom Victory, eons and eons ago. Maybe this sutra waking up something that's been sleeping all this time.
Normal: Maybe everybody who hears this teaching and feels that deep respect, that reverence rising up in their heart - maybe they all got merit left over from King Awesome Sound of the World, from when he was teaching the Dharma long ago. Maybe they earning interest on an investment they don't even remember making.
Normal: That's why I wrote this preface right here at the start of the sutra. I'm hoping - and I'm praying - that we can get our six senses cleaned up, purified, so we can look up and see that wonderful gathering with the Compassionate Honored One. I'm hoping we can perfect them four virtues quick, so we can head on toward that Pure Land, that place where everything's clear and bright.
Normal: The praise for this teaching, it don't run out. It goes on and on, like a river that don't stop flowing. And I'm writing it down here so it can keep going, so it can be passed on to all the people who coming after us, all the generations yet to be born.
Normal: May they receive it. May they understand it. May they live it.
Normal: That's all I got to say.
Heading 2: INTRODUCTION
Heading 3: WHAT IS THIS TRANSLATION?
Normal: This is a blues and gospel-inflected English translation of the Lotus Sutra (Saddharma-puṇḍarīka-sūtra), one of the most revolutionary and influential Buddhist texts. Rather than offering a literal or scholarly translation, this version channels the wisdom of the Lotus Sutra through the spiritual, rhythmic, and deeply human language of African American blues and gospel tradition.

The source text is Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese version (406 CE), a translation that itself was revolutionary in making Buddhist teachings accessible to common people. This blues version continues that democratizing tradition—bringing the Dharma into living, breathing language that speaks to the soul.
Heading 3: WHY BLUES?
Normal: The blues and the Lotus Sutra share a profound spiritual sensibility:

• Both speak to suffering and its transformation.
• Both celebrate human dignity in the face of adversity.
• Both offer a way out: through music/Dharma, through community, through trust.
• Both are rooted in African American/Buddhist wisdom traditions that center on justice, compassion, and the liberation of ALL beings.

The blues doesn't shy away from pain. Neither does the Lotus Sutra. But both offer redemption, not escape. Both say: your suffering matters, your journey matters, and you are worthy of enlightenment/freedom.
Heading 3: GENDER-INCLUSIVE APPROACH
Normal: This translation is fully gender-inclusive while maintaining theological depth. The original Lotus Sutra was revolutionary for its time in affirming that women could achieve Buddhahood. This version amplifies that revolutionary message by:

• Using inclusive language ("brothers and sisters") in universal teachings.
• Maintaining male narrative where it provides contrast for women's paradigm-shifting appearances (especially the dragon princess in Chapter 12).
• Centering women bodhisattvas (Avalokiteśvara, Mahāprajāpatī, the queen) as agents of compassion and power.
• Honoring the text's original radical stance: women are not obstacles to enlightenment—they are its agents.
Heading 3: THE 28 CHAPTERS
Normal: The Lotus Sutra contains 28 chapters, each exploring a different dimension of enlightenment. Early chapters establish the Buddha's core teaching (Chapters 1-7). Middle chapters extend enlightenment to all beings (Chapters 8-11). Later chapters detail the work of Bodhisattvas in liberating all beings (Chapters 12-28).

Read sequentially, these chapters build a powerful argument: enlightenment is not reserved for monks, not limited by gender, not dependent on when you were born. It is available to all beings, everywhere, always.
Heading 3: HOW TO READ THIS VERSION
Normal: This blues translation is designed to be:

• SPOKEN ALOUD (the rhythm and vernacular shine in performance).
• STUDIED CAREFULLY (the Buddhist teachings are doctrinally accurate).
• SAVORED FOR BEAUTY (blues poetry at its finest).
• EXPERIENCED COMMUNALLY (share it, discuss it, sing it).

The verse sections use blues rhythm, call-and-response patterns, and the spiritual depth of African American preaching traditions. The prose sections use accessible vernacular English while maintaining the elevated and reverent tone appropriate to sacred scripture.
Heading 3: ABOUT THE SOURCE TEXT
Normal: Kumārajīva (343-413 CE) was a Buddhist missionary who translated over 100 Buddhist texts into Classical Chinese. His version of the Lotus Sutra became the standard text throughout East Asia. He was known for making texts accessible without sacrificing accuracy—the same goal of this blues version.

The text's 28 chapters were compiled from earlier Sanskrit versions and represent centuries of Buddhist reflection on enlightenment, compassion, and the radical possibility of universal salvation.
Heading 3: KEY FIGURES IN THIS TEXT
Normal: • ŚĀKYAMUNI BUDDHA: The historical Buddha who teaches throughout.
• ŚĀRIPUTRA: Chief disciple, represents intellectual understanding.
• MAÑJUŚRĪ: Bodhisattva of Wisdom.
• AVALOKITEŚVARA: Bodhisattva of Compassion (appears in many forms).
• THE DRAGON PRINCESS: A revolutionary figure whose Buddhahood shatters expectations about gender and enlightenment.
• THE SIXTEEN PRINCES: Future Buddhas who point toward universal salvation.
Heading 3: ESSENTIAL BUDDHIST TERMS USED
Normal: Bodhisattva (BO-dee-SAT-vuh): A being dedicated to liberating all others.

Buddha-nature: The capacity for Buddhahood present in all beings.

Dharma: The teaching; the way things are; the law of cause and effect.

Tathāgata (tah-TAH-guh-tuh): "One who has thus gone"; epithet for the Buddha.

Heading 3: READING GUIDE
Normal: Each chapter includes:

• CHAPTER HEADING with number and title.
• PROSE SECTIONS: Buddhist teachings in accessible blues-inflected vernacular.
• VERSE SECTIONS: The same teachings in blues poetry and song form.
• TRANSLATION NOTES: Context and deeper meaning.

The repetition of teachings (prose then verse) is intentional. This is how the Sutra was transmitted orally for centuries—each repetition deepens the understanding. Don't skip the verses as "just repetition." They are transformation.

Heading 1: CHAPTER ONE: THE OPENING
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE GATHERING
Normal: Listen now, this is what I heard with my own ears.
Normal: One time—and ain't it always one time when truth comes calling—the Buddha was staying up on Vulture Peak Mountain, right outside the city called King's House (Rajagriha). And he wasn't alone, no sir. He had twelve thousand monks with him, every last one of them a brother who'd made it through to the other side.
Normal: These weren't no beginners, you understand. These were folks who'd walked the long hard road and come out clean. They'd dried up all the leaking wounds of craving. They'd burned out every last bit of that fever we call desire. They'd gotten what they came for, broke every chain that binds a person to this wheel of suffering, and their minds were finally free—free like a bird that's been caged all its life and somebody finally opens the door.
Normal: Let me tell you their names, 'cause names matter when you talking about the ones who made it through:
Normal: There was Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya, the first one to understand what the Buddha was laying down. There was Mahākāśyapa, that stern old man who knew how to live with nothing. There was Uruvilvā-Kāśyapa and his brothers Gayā-Kāśyapa and Nadī-Kāśyapa—three brothers who all found the way. There was Śāriputra, sharp as a razor, and Mahā-Maudgalyāyana, who could work wonders. There was Mahā-Kātyāyana, who could preach, and Aniruddha, who could see what others couldn't. There was Kapphina and Gavāmpati and Revata and Pilindavatsa and Bakkula and Mahā-Kauṣṭhila and Nanda and Sundarananda and Pūrṇa-Maitrāyaṇīputra, the one who could really teach, and Subhūti, who understood emptiness like breathing, and Ānanda, who remembered everything the Buddha ever said, and Rāhula, the Buddha's own son.
Normal: These were the famous ones, the ones everybody knew about, the ones who'd gone all the way.
Normal: And there were two thousand more—some still learning, some already done with learning—all walking that path.
Normal: And Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, the nun who raised the Buddha when his mama died, she was there with six thousand sisters following her. And Yaśodharā, the one who used to be the Buddha's wife before he left to find the truth, she was there too with her own followers.
Normal: But that ain't all. No sir, that ain't even half of it.
Normal: There were eighty thousand bodhisattvas—and when I say bodhisattva, I'm talking about the ones who've set their hearts on the highest freedom, not just for themselves but for everybody. They weren't gonna turn back, no matter what. They'd gotten hold of something called dhāraṇī—that's like a power to hold onto the truth no matter how hard the wind blows. They could speak smooth and clear about the deepest things, and they kept the wheel of teaching rolling forward, never backing up.
Normal: They'd served countless Buddhas—I'm talking about hundreds, thousands, millions of enlightened teachers. They'd planted good seeds in all those Buddha-fields, and every Buddha they ever met spoke their names with respect. They'd trained their hearts in loving-kindness until kindness was just who they were. They'd gotten inside the Buddha's wisdom like you get inside your own house. They'd crossed over to the far shore of understanding, and their names rang out through countless worlds. They could guide countless beings through the darkness.
Normal: Let me tell you some of their names:
Normal: There was Mañjuśrī, who carries the sword of wisdom. There was Avalokiteśvara, who hears every cry of suffering in this world. There was Mahāsthāmaprāpta, the one with great power. There was Always Striving, who never lets up. There was Never Resting, who don't know how to quit. There was Jewel Palm and Medicine King and Brave Giving and Jewel Moon and Moon Light and Full Moon. There was Great Strength and Limitless Strength and Beyond the Triple World. There was Bhadrapāla and Maitreya—that's the one who's gonna be the next Buddha when this age runs out. There was Jewel Accumulation and Guide—eighty thousand of these great-hearted teachers, all gathered there.
Normal: And the heavenly beings showed up too, you better believe it.
Normal: Śakra, the king of the thirty-three heavens, he came down with twenty thousand divine children. And there was Moon Prince and Universal Fragrance and Jewel Light and the Four Great Kings, each one bringing ten thousand children of heaven. And Freedom King and Great Freedom King, they brought thirty thousand. And Brahmā Sahāmpati, the lord of this whole world-system, and Śikhin Brahma and Bright Brahma, they came with twelve thousand divine children.
Normal: And eight dragon kings came swimming up from the deep waters: Nanda and Upananda and Sāgara and Vāsukin and Takṣaka and Anavatapta and Manasvin and Utpalaka—each one with hundreds of thousands following behind.
Normal: And four kings of the kinnaras came—those are the singers, the ones who make music for the gods. There was Dharma Kinnara King and Wonderful Dharma Kinnara King and Great Dharma Kinnara King and Dharma-Holding Kinnara King, all with their companies.
Normal: And four kings of the gandharvas—those are the heavenly musicians. There was Joy and Joyful Sound and Beautiful and Beautiful Sound, all with their followers.
Normal: And four kings of the asuras came too—those are the jealous spirits, always fighting with the gods: Bālin and Kharaskandha and Vemacitrin and Rāhu, each one leading hundreds of thousands.
Normal: And four kings of the garuḍas—those giant birds—came flying down: Great Virtue and Great Body and Great Fullness and As-You-Wish, each one with their flocks.
Normal: And King Ajātaśatru, son of Queen Vaidehi, he came with hundreds of thousands of people from the city.
Normal: Every single one of them bowed down at the Buddha's feet—and when I say feet, I mean they got low, they showed respect—and then they sat down off to the side.
Heading 2: THE TEACHING BEFORE THE SILENCE
Normal: Right then, the Buddha was surrounded on all four sides—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen—all of them offering him respect, honoring him, praising him. And he started teaching them a scripture of the Great Vehicle, a text called "The Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings"—a teaching for those bodhisattvas, a teaching that the Buddha himself protects and keeps in mind.
Normal: When he finished teaching that sutra, he crossed his legs up under him—you know that sitting position, like a locked-up lotus—and he entered into a deep, deep meditation on infinite meanings. His body went still. His mind went still. He wasn't moving at all.
Normal: And right then, heaven started raining flowers—mandarava flowers and great mandarava flowers, manjusaka flowers and great manjusaka flowers—pouring down on the Buddha and all that great assembly. And the whole Buddha-world shook six different ways—you know that shaking when the earth can't hold still 'cause something holy is happening.
Normal: And everybody in that gathering—the monks and nuns, the laymen and laywomen, the dragons and the night-wandering spirits, the gandharvas and asuras and garudas and kinnaras and mahoragas, the humans and non-humans, all the little kings and the wheel-turning holy kings—every last one of them got something they never had before. Joy rose up in them. They put their palms together and they looked at the Buddha with one mind, all together, not turning away.
Heading 2: THE LIGHT FROM BETWEEN THE EYEBROWS
Normal: And then the Buddha sent out a beam of light from between his eyebrows—right from that white hair-mark there—and it lit up eighteen thousand worlds to the east, every last corner of them, down to the deepest hell called Avīci where suffering don't quit, all the way up to Akaniṣṭha Heaven where the highest gods dwell.
Normal: And from this world here, you could see into all those other lands. You could see beings in all six paths of existence—beings in hell, hungry ghosts, animals, humans, jealous spirits, gods—you could see them all. And you could see the Buddhas in those worlds, teaching right now, hear the words they were saying. And you could see monks and nuns and laymen and laywomen, people walking the path and getting somewhere. You could see bodhisattvas with all kinds of causes and conditions, all kinds of faith and understanding, all kinds of appearances, walking the bodhisattva road. You could see Buddhas entering that final peace beyond peace, that nirvāṇa. And you could see, after those Buddhas passed on, stupas made of seven kinds of jewels, rising up to hold their relics.
Heading 2: MAITREYA ASKS, MAÑJUŚRĪ REMEMBERS
Normal: Right then, Maitreya Bodhisattva—the one who's coming next—he thought to himself: "Now what's going on here? The World-Honored One is showing us signs and wonders. What's the cause of all this? The Buddha's gone into a meditation so deep you can't think your way into it, and he's showing us things we never seen before. Who should I ask about this? Who could answer?"
Normal: And then he thought: "This Mañjuśrī, he's the Dharma-prince, the king's son. He's served countless Buddhas in the past, no telling how many. He must've seen signs like this before. I'm gonna ask him."
Normal: And right then all the monks and nuns and layfolk and all the gods and dragons and spirits, they all thought the same thing: "This light the Buddha's shining, this supernatural sign—who can we ask about it?"
Normal: So Maitreya Bodhisattva, wanting to clear up his own doubt and seeing what everybody else was wondering, he turned to Mañjuśrī and said: "What's the cause and condition for all this? Why's he sending out this great light, lighting up eighteen thousand lands to the east, showing us all those Buddha-lands decorated so fine?"
Normal: And then Maitreya, wanting to say it again in another way, he spoke in verse. And let me tell you, these verses had rhythm:
Normal: Mañjuśrī, tell me why—
Normal: Why the Teacher's shining bright
Normal: From that white hair between his eyes,

Normal: Offering fine food and drink,
Normal: Hundred kinds of medicinal soups,
Normal: To Buddha and the sangha—don't even blink.
Normal: Fine clothes worth millions,
Normal: Or priceless robes beyond counting,
Normal: Offering to Buddha and sangha—
Normal: Benefits mounting.
Normal: Thousands of millions of kinds
Normal: Of sandalwood treasure halls,
Normal: Wonderful beds and bedding,
Normal: Offering to Buddha and sangha—
Normal: Answering that call.
Normal: Pure gardens and forests,
Normal: Flowers and fruit growing thick,
Normal: Flowing springs and bathing pools,
Normal: Offering to Buddha and sangha—
Normal: That's the trick.
Normal: All these different kinds of giving,
Normal: Offerings wonderful and profound,
Normal: Doing it with joy and no weariness,
Normal: Seeking that highest path around.
Normal: Some bodhisattvas teaching the Dharma of peace and stillness,
Normal: Using all kinds of instructions to guide,
Normal: Teaching countless living beings—
Normal: Walking by their side.
Normal: Some bodhisattvas contemplating the nature of all things,
Normal: Seeing there ain't no duality there,
Normal: Like empty space—
Normal: Nothing to compare.
Normal: And I see Buddha-children
Normal: With minds that don't cling to nothing at all,
Normal: Using this wonderful wisdom
Normal: To seek the highest path—standing tall.
Normal: Mañjuśrī, I see more bodhisattvas
Normal: After Buddha's gone into extinction,
Normal: Making offerings to relics—
Normal: That's their mission.
Normal: I see Buddha-children
Normal: Building stupas and shrines,
Normal: Countless as Ganges sands,
Normal: Decorating all the lands with designs.
Normal: Jeweled stupas tall and wonderful—
Normal: Five thousand yojanas high,
Normal: Two thousand yojanas wide and deep—
Normal: Reaching toward the sky.
Normal: Every single stupa there
Normal: With a thousand banners and flags,
Normal: Jeweled bells ringing in harmony,
Normal: Pearl netting hanging from the crags.
Normal: Gods and dragons and spirits,
Normal: Humans and non-humans all around,
Normal: Always making offerings there
Normal: With incense, flowers, and music-sound.
Normal: Mañjuśrī, these Buddha-children,
Normal: Making offerings to relics this way,
Normal: Their countries naturally become
Normal: Specially wonderful and beautiful—you could say
Normal: Like the king of heavenly trees
Normal: When its flowers open up and bloom.
Normal: The Buddha let out just one light—
Normal: One light clearing all the gloom—
Normal: And me and this whole assembly
Normal: Seeing all those lands so fine,
Normal: All those Buddha-powers
Normal: And wisdom-signs.
Normal: One pure light
Normal: Lighting up countless lands—
Normal: We seeing all this,
Normal: Never seen nothing like it—understand?
Normal: Buddha-son Mañjuśrī,
Normal: Please decide everybody's doubt,
Normal: The four assemblies looking up hopeful
Normal: At you and me—what's this all about?
Normal: Why's the World-Honored One
Normal: Letting this light shine out?
Normal: Buddha-son, answer now,
Normal: Decide this doubt and make us glad.
Normal: What benefit's coming
Normal: From this light—this holy light we've had?
Normal: Is Buddha sitting in the place of enlightenment
Normal: About to teach that wonderful Dharma he's got?
Normal: Or is he about to give predictions of awakening?
Normal: Is that what this means or not?
Normal: He's showing us Buddha-lands
Normal: Decorated with countless jewels so clean,
Normal: And we seeing all these Buddhas—
Normal: This ain't no small scene.
Normal: Mañjuśrī, you know—
Normal: Four assemblies, dragons, gods—
Normal: They all looking at you, waiting to hear:
Normal: What are you gonna say about these signs we see here?
Heading 2: MAÑJUŚRĪ REMEMBERS THE ANCIENT PATTERN
Normal: Right then, Mañjuśrī spoke to Maitreya Bodhisattva and all those great beings and good men, saying:
Normal: "The way I figure it, the World-Honored One right now is about to teach a great Dharma, about to rain down a great Dharma-rain, about to blow the great Dharma-conch, about to beat the great Dharma-drum, about to explain the great Dharma-meaning.
Normal: "Good men, in the past, with other Buddhas, I've seen signs like this. After they let out this kind of light, they taught the great Dharma. So you should know: the Buddha's showing this light now for the same reason. He wants to help all living beings hear and know this Dharma that's hard for the whole world to believe. That's why he's showing these signs."
Normal: And Mañjuśrī started telling a story—a story from so long ago you can't count the years:
Normal: "Good men, way back in the past—I'm talking about countless, boundless, inconceivable, uncountable eons ago—there was a Buddha called Moon-Sun-Lamp Thus Come One, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.
Normal: "He taught the true Dharma—good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end. His meaning was deep and far-reaching. His words were skillful and wonderful. Pure and unmixed, complete and perfect, he laid out what the holy life looks like.
Normal: "For people seeking to be hearers, he taught the Dharma of the Four Noble Truths—how to cross over birth and old age and sickness and death, how to reach the final peace of nirvāṇa.
Normal: "For people seeking to be solitary realizers, he taught the Dharma of the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination.
Normal: "For the bodhisattvas, he taught the Six Perfections—how to attain that highest perfect awakening, how to accomplish all-knowing wisdom."
Normal: And then Mañjuśrī said something that'll make you sit up:
Normal: "And then there was another Buddha, also called Moon-Sun-Lamp. And then another Buddha, also called Moon-Sun-Lamp. Like this, twenty thousand Buddhas, all with the same name—Moon-Sun-Lamp. And they all had the same family name too: Bharadvāja.
Normal: "Maitreya, you should know: from the first Buddha to the last Buddha, they all had the same name, Moon-Sun-Lamp, complete with all ten titles. And the Dharma they taught was good in the beginning, middle, and end.
Normal: "Now that last Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha, before he left home to seek the way, he had eight sons. Their names were: Having Intent, Good Intent, Infinite Intent, Jewel Intent, Increasing Intent, Doubt-Removing Intent, Toward Intent, and Dharma Intent.
Normal: "These eight princes had power and dignity and freedom. Each one ruled over four continents. When these princes heard that their father had left home and attained the highest perfect awakening, every one of them gave up their kingdoms and followed him into homelessness. They raised their minds to the Great Vehicle, always practiced the holy life, and all became Dharma-teachers. They'd already planted roots of goodness with thousands and millions of Buddhas.
Normal: "Now when that Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha taught the scripture of the Great Vehicle called 'Sutra of Infinite Meanings'—a teaching for bodhisattvas, a teaching that Buddha protects and keeps in mind—after he finished teaching it, right there in the great assembly, he crossed his legs up into meditation and entered that concentration on infinite meanings. His body and mind stopped moving.
Normal: "And right then, heaven rained down mandarava flowers, great mandarava flowers, manjusaka flowers, great manjusaka flowers, scattering them on the Buddha and the great assembly. And the whole Buddha-world shook six ways.
Normal: "And then everybody in the assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, dragons, night-wanderers, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans, all the little kings and wheel-turning holy kings—all of them got something they never had before. Joy! They put their palms together and looked at the Buddha with one mind."
Normal: Mañjuśrī kept going with his story:
Normal: "And then that Thus Come One let out a beam of light from between his eyebrows, lighting up eighteen thousand Buddha-lands to the east, reaching everywhere, just like the lands we're seeing right now.
Normal: "Maitreya, you should know: in that assembly back then, there were two billion bodhisattvas who wanted to hear the Dharma. When these bodhisattvas saw that light shining all over those Buddha-lands, they got something they never had before, and they wanted to know what that light was about.
Normal: "There was a bodhisattva there named Wonderful Light, and he had eight hundred disciples.
Normal: "Right then, Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha came out of his meditation and, turning to Wonderful Light Bodhisattva, he taught the scripture of the Great Vehicle called 'The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma'—a teaching for bodhisattvas, a teaching that Buddha protects and keeps in mind.
Normal: "He taught that sutra for sixty short eons, never getting up from his seat. And everybody listening sat there in one place for sixty short eons, their bodies and minds not moving, hearing what the Buddha said, and it felt like just the time it takes to eat a meal. During all that time, there wasn't a single person whose body or mind got tired or restless.
Normal: "After Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha finished teaching that sutra for sixty short eons, he made this announcement to the assembly of Brahmas and Maras and ascetics and brahmins and gods and humans and asuras:
Normal: "'Tonight at midnight, the Thus Come One will enter the nirvāṇa without remainder.'
Normal: "There was a bodhisattva there named Virtue Storehouse. Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha gave him a prediction right then and there. He told all the monks: 'This Virtue Storehouse Bodhisattva will be the next Buddha. His name will be Pure Body, Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened.'
Normal: "After giving this prediction, at midnight, Buddha entered the nirvāṇa without remainder.
Normal: "After the Buddha passed on, Wonderful Light Bodhisattva held onto that Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma and taught it to people for eighty short eons.
Normal: "Now those eight sons of Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha all became students of Wonderful Light. Wonderful Light taught and transformed them, made them firm in their resolve for the highest perfect awakening. After they'd made offerings to countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas, they all attained Buddhahood. The last one to become a Buddha was named Burning Lamp.
Normal: "Among those eight hundred disciples, there was one person called Seeker of Fame. He was greedy for gain and offerings. Even though he'd study and recite all kinds of scriptures, he didn't really get them—he'd forget most of what he learned. That's why they called him Seeker of Fame.
Normal: "But even he, through planting various roots of goodness, got to meet countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas, make offerings to them, honor them, respect them, praise them."
Normal: And then Mañjuśrī brought it all home:
Normal: "Maitreya, you should know: that Wonderful Light Bodhisattva back then—you think he was somebody else? He was me. I'm that person.
Normal: "And that Seeker of Fame Bodhisattva? That was you. You're that person.
Normal: "Now I'm seeing these signs, and they're no different from what I saw before. That's why I figure: today the Thus Come One is about to teach that scripture of the Great Vehicle called 'The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma,' a teaching for bodhisattvas, a teaching that Buddha protects and keeps in mind."
Heading 2: MAÑJUŚRĪ SPEAKS IN VERSE
Normal: I'm remembering the past—
Normal: Countless, numberless eons back—
Normal: There was a Buddha, honored among humans,
Normal: Named Moon-Sun-Lamp, that's a fact.
Normal: The World-Honored One taught Dharma,
Normal: Saved countless living beings,

Normal: Before Buddha left home,
Normal: He had eight royal sons.
Normal: When they saw the great holy one leave home,
Normal: They followed him—every single one.
Normal: Then Buddha taught the Great Vehicle,
Normal: A scripture called Infinite Meanings,
Normal: Among that great assembly there,
Normal: He explained its teachings with all their leanings.
Normal: After Buddha finished teaching that sutra,
Normal: Right there on his Dharma-seat,
Normal: He sat cross-legged in concentration—
Normal: Infinite Meanings made complete.
Normal: Heaven rained mandarava flowers,
Normal: Heavenly drums sounded on their own,
Normal: Gods and dragons and spirits and all
Normal: Offered to the human-honored one.
Normal: All the Buddha-lands right then

Normal: And saw the Thus Come Ones
Normal: Naturally attaining Buddha's way,

Normal: Like in pure lapis lazuli
Normal: A true golden image shines inside—
Normal: World-Honored Ones among great assemblies,
Normal: Explaining deep Dharma far and wide.
Normal: In every single Buddha-land,
Normal: Countless hearer-disciples there,
Normal: Because of Buddha's light shining,
Normal: We could see those great assemblies everywhere.
Normal: Some monks were there
Normal: In mountain forests dwelling,
Normal: Vigorously holding pure precepts
Normal: Like they were guarding a jewel—protecting, not selling.
Normal: And saw countless bodhisattvas
Normal: Practicing giving and patience and more,
Normal: Numerous as Ganges sands—
Normal: All lit by Buddha-light at the door.
Normal: And saw bodhisattvas
Normal: Deep in various meditations,
Normal: Bodies and minds silent and unmoving,
Normal: Seeking the highest way—their destination.
Normal: And saw bodhisattvas
Normal: Knowing the still and quiet character of Dharma,
Normal: Each one in their own land
Normal: Teaching Dharma, seeking Buddha—no drama.
Normal: Right then the four assemblies
Normal: Saw Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha's great spiritual powers,
Normal: Their hearts all filled with joy—
Normal: That was their finest hour.
Normal: Each one asking each other:
Normal: "What's the cause of all this we're seeing?"
Normal: The one honored by gods and humans
Normal: Just came out of meditation—freed and freeing.
Normal: He praised Wonderful Light Bodhisattva:
Normal: "You are the world's eye,
Normal: The one everyone trusts and believes in,
Normal: Able to hold the Dharma-treasury high.
Normal: The Dharma I have taught—
Normal: Only you can truly know it."
Normal: The World-Honored One, after praising him that way,
Normal: Made Wonderful Light rejoice and glow with it.
Normal: Then he taught this Lotus Sutra of the Dharma,
Normal: For sixty short eons sitting there,
Normal: Not getting up from that seat once—
Normal: Staying in one place with care.
Normal: The wonderful supreme Dharma he spoke—
Normal: Wonderful Light Dharma-teacher held it all,
Normal: Every bit of it, didn't lose a word—
Normal: Didn't let one syllable fall.
Normal: After Buddha finished teaching that Lotus Sutra of the Dharma,
Normal: Making everyone joyful and glad,
Normal: END OF CHAPTER ONE: THE OPENING
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This interpretation takes Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese text and pours it through the blues tradition—that great river of African American spiritual and musical expression that's always known how to carry deep wisdom in everyday language.
Normal: What I kept:
Normal: - The famous names like Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Śāriputra, Maitreya
Normal: - The sequence and structure of the original
Normal: - The depth of meaning—blues ain't shallow, and neither is this sutra
Normal: What I changed:
Normal: - Technical terms became lived experience: "阿羅漢" became people who "made it through to the other side," who "dried up all the leaking wounds of craving"
Normal: - Descriptive names got translated: "日月燈明如來" became "Moon-Sun-Lamp Thus Come One"
Normal: - The eight princes: 有意 became "Having Intent," 善意 became "Good Intent," and so on
Normal: - Abstract Buddhist terms became concrete images: nirvāṇa is "that final peace beyond peace," meditation is going so deep "you can't think your way into it," dhāraṇī is "a power to hold onto the truth no matter how hard the wind blows"
Normal: The verses especially got the blues treatment—repetition, rhythm, call-and-response feeling, direct address ("Listen now," "you hear me?"), the music of the language itself.
Normal: This Chapter One tells the story of the great gathering on Vulture Peak, the Buddha's mysterious entry into meditation, the light from between his eyebrows showing countless worlds, Maitreya's question, and Mañjuśrī's memory of ancient Buddhas doing the same thing before teaching the Lotus Sutra. It's the opening act, the gathering storm before the great teaching comes.
Normal: The blues has always carried sacred truth in the language of the people. This interpretation tries to honor both traditions—the ancient Buddhist teaching and the deep American wisdom-stream that knows how to make the high come low, the distant come near, and the abstract become as real as your own heartbeat.
Heading 1: CHAPTER TWO: THE LOVING TRICKS
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA SPEAKS OF DEEP WISDOM
Normal: Now at that time, you see, the World-Honored One—he rose up from his meditation, rose up calm and peaceful-like, and he turned to Śāriputra and said:
Normal: "Listen here, Śāriputra. The wisdom of the Buddhas—it goes down deep, deeper than any well you ever tried to draw from. It's measureless, you hear me? Can't nobody measure how deep it goes. The door to that wisdom, now—it's hard to understand, hard to get through. All them disciples and solitary-walkers, all them learned folks who think they got it figured—they can't know this thing.
Normal: "And why's that? I'm gonna tell you why. The Buddha, he walked alongside a hundred thousand million billion Buddhas, ain't no way to count them all. He practiced every single path those Buddhas taught, every last one. Brave and fierce, he walked them roads. His name got known everywhere, you understand? He accomplished things so deep, things never done before. And when he teaches, he speaks according to what folks need, but what he's really getting at—that's hard to understand.
Normal: "Śāriputra, ever since I became a Buddha, I been using all kinds of causes, all kinds of stories, all kinds of comparisons, pouring out teachings like water. Countless loving tricks, that's what I been using, leading people, guiding them away from all their clinging and holding on. And why can I do this? Because the Tathāgata, he's perfected all them skillful means, all that perfect knowing and seeing.
Normal: "Śāriputra, the Tathāgata's knowing and seeing—it's vast and deep and far-reaching. It's without measure, without any walls or boundaries. He got the powers, he got the fearlessness, he got the meditations and the liberations and the deep states—he's gone into them without any bottom to hit. He's accomplished everything that ain't never been accomplished before.
Normal: "Śāriputra, the Tathāgata, he can break things down every which way, explain the teachings with skill, and his words—they soft, they gentle, they please every heart.
Normal: "Śāriputra, let me put it to you straight: all them measureless, boundless, never-been-done things—the Buddha's accomplished them all."
Normal: Then the Buddha said: "Stop, Śāriputra. Don't need to say no more. And why's that? What the Buddha's accomplished—it's the rarest, hardest-to-understand thing there is. Only a Buddha together with a Buddha can exhaust the true reality of all things. That means: the suchness of their appearance, the suchness of their nature, the suchness of their substance, the suchness of their power, the suchness of their function, the suchness of their causes, the suchness of their conditions, the suchness of their effects, the suchness of their results, and the suchness of their beginning and end being ultimately equal."
Normal: The Hero of the World—can't measure him,
Normal: All them heavenly beings and worldly folk,
Normal: Every kind of living creature there is—
Normal: Ain't nobody can know the Buddha's truth.
Normal: The Buddha's powers and his fearlessness,
Normal: His liberations and his deep meditations,
Normal: And all them other Buddha-things he got—
Normal: Ain't nobody can measure what he knows.
Normal: From countless Buddhas he learned his way,
Normal: Walked every single road there was to walk,
Normal: The dharma deep and subtle, hard to see,
Normal: So difficult to understand and know.
Normal: For measureless millions upon millions of ages,
Normal: He walked all them roads till he walked them through,
Normal: Reached the place of awakening, got the fruit—
Normal: I done seen it all, I know it all.
Normal: A fruit as great as this one here,
Normal: All its different natures, meanings, marks—
Normal: Only me and all them Buddhas in ten directions,
Normal: Only we can know this thing.
Normal: This dharma—can't be shown by pointing,
Normal: Words fall silent when you try to speak it,
Normal: All them other kinds of living beings—
Normal: Ain't nobody among them understands,
Normal: Except for the bodhisattvas,
Normal: Them whose faith-power stands strong and firm.
Normal: The Buddha's disciples, you understand,
Normal: Who done served and honored countless Buddhas,
Normal: Who done exhausted all their outflows,
Normal: Who standing in their final body now—
Normal: Even folks like this here,
Normal: They ain't got the strength to bear this teaching.
Normal: Even if you filled the whole world up
Normal: With people smart as Śāriputra,
Normal: And they put their heads together trying to measure—
Normal: They couldn't measure the Buddha's wisdom.
Normal: Even if you filled up all ten directions,
Normal: Filled them full of folks like Śāriputra,
Normal: And all the other disciples too,
Normal: Filled up every Buddha-land there is,
Normal: Put their heads together trying to measure—
Normal: Still couldn't know this thing at all.
Normal: Them solitary-walkers with their sharp intelligence,
Normal: Without outflows, in their final body,
Normal: They fill up all ten directions too,
Normal: Numerous as bamboo in a bamboo forest,
Normal: And they all of one mind, you hear me?
Normal: For billions and billions of countless ages,
Normal: They wanting to think about the Buddha's real wisdom—
Normal: Couldn't know even the smallest little bit of it.
Normal: Them newly inspired bodhisattvas,
Normal: Who served and honored countless Buddhas,
Normal: Who understand all kinds of meanings,
Normal: Who can preach the dharma skillfully,
Normal: Numerous as rice plants and hemp and bamboo and reeds,
Normal: Filling up all the lands in ten directions,
Normal: With one mind using their wonderful wisdom,
Normal: For ages numerous as Ganges River sands,
Normal: All of them thinking about it together—
Normal: Still couldn't know the Buddha's wisdom.
Normal: Them non-backsliding bodhisattvas,
Normal: Numerous as Ganges River sands,
Normal: With one mind seeking together—
Normal: Still couldn't know this thing neither.
Normal: I'm telling you again, Śāriputra:
Normal: The dharma without outflow, inconceivable,
Normal: So deep and subtle, so wonderful—
Normal: I done fully obtained it now.
Normal: Only I know its true reality,
Normal: And all them Buddhas in ten directions too.
Normal: Śāriputra, you ought to know this:
Normal: The words of the Buddhas don't differ none.
Normal: Concerning the dharma that the Buddha speaks,
Normal: You got to generate great faith-power.
Normal: After the World-Honored One taught a long time,
Normal: He finally got to speak the real truth.
Normal: I'm telling all you disciples,
Normal: And them seeking the solitary-walker vehicle—
Normal: I freed you from the bonds of suffering,
Normal: Let you reach nirvāṇa, that's what I did.
Normal: But the Buddha used his skillful power,
Normal: Showed you three different vehicles of teaching.
Normal: Living beings get attached all over the place—
Normal: I led them so they could get themselves free.
Heading 2: THE ASSEMBLY'S DOUBT AND ŚĀRIPUTRA'S REQUEST
Normal: At that time, in the great assembly, there was disciples—them with no more outflows, them arhats—Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya and the rest, twelve hundred of them. And there was others too, monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, who done set their mind on the disciple vehicle or the solitary-walker vehicle. Every one of them thought to themselves:
Normal: "Right now, why's the World-Honored One going on so earnestly, praising and exalting skillful means like this? He says the dharma the Buddha obtained is so deep and hard to understand. What he speaks about got a meaning that's difficult to know. All them disciples and solitary-walkers can't reach it. The Buddha explained one liberation doctrine—we obtained that dharma too, reached nirvāṇa with it. But now we don't know where this teaching is heading."
Normal: At that time, Śāriputra, he knew the four groups in the assembly was doubting, and he himself didn't understand it neither. So he addressed the Buddha, saying:
Normal: "World-Honored One, for what cause, for what reason are you so earnestly praising the Buddhas' foremost skillful means, this deep, subtle, difficult-to-understand dharma? From way back till now, I ain't never heard you speak like this before. Right now, all four groups got doubts. I only wish the World-Honored One would explain this matter. World-Honored One, why are you so earnestly praising this deep, subtle, difficult-to-understand dharma?"
Normal: Then Śāriputra, wanting to speak this meaning again, he said it in verse:
Normal: Sun of Wisdom, Great Holy Honored One,
Normal: After such a long time you speaking this dharma now.
Normal: You say you obtained these kind of things—
Normal: Powers, fearlessness, meditations,
Normal: Concentration, liberation, all the rest,
Normal: Inconceivable dharmas like these.
Normal: The dharma you got at the place of awakening—
Normal: Ain't nobody can raise a question about it.
Normal: My mind's so hard to fathom out,
Normal: And ain't nobody can ask about it neither.
Normal: Without nobody asking, you just speak on your own,
Normal: Praising the road you walked yourself.
Normal: Your wisdom so subtle and wonderful,
Normal: The very thing all Buddhas obtained.
Normal: Them arhats without outflow,
Normal: And them seeking nirvāṇa too—
Normal: Now they all done fell into a net of doubt,
Normal: Wondering why the Buddha speaking this.
Normal: Them seeking to be solitary-walkers,
Normal: Monks and nuns alike,
Normal: Heavenly beings, dragons, spirits, gods,
Normal: And gandharvas and such—
Normal: They looking at each other, full of wondering,
Normal: Gazing up at the Honored One of Two Feet.
Normal: What is this matter all about?
Normal: We hoping the Buddha will explain it clear.
Normal: Among all them disciple folks,
Normal: The Buddha says I'm number one.
Normal: But right now, concerning my own wisdom,
Normal: I'm doubting, confused, can't understand—
Normal: Is this the ultimate dharma here,
Normal: Or is it just the road we walk?
Normal: We who was born from the Buddha's mouth,
Normal: We standing with palms pressed together, gazing up and waiting,
Normal: Hoping you'll send forth your subtle, wonderful voice,
Normal: Speak to us at this time just like it really is.
Normal: Them heavenly beings, dragons, spirits, and gods,
Normal: Numerous as Ganges River sands,
Normal: Them bodhisattvas seeking to be Buddhas,
Normal: Eighty thousand in their great number,
Normal: And from millions and billions of lands,
Normal: Wheel-turning holy kings done arrived,
Normal: Palms pressed together with reverent minds—
Normal: They wanting to hear about the complete road.
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA'S THREE REFUSALS
Normal: At that time, the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Stop, stop. Don't need to say no more. If I speak about this matter, all them beings in all the worlds—the heavenly folk and the human folk—they all gonna be shocked and full of doubt."
Normal: Śāriputra addressed the Buddha again, saying: "World-Honored One, I only wish you would speak about it, only wish you would speak! And why's that? In this assembly here, there's countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of innumerable living beings who done seen Buddhas before. Their faculties are sharp and fierce, their wisdom bright and clear. When they hear what the Buddha speaks, they gonna be able to respect it and believe it."
Normal: At that time, Śāriputra, wanting to speak this meaning again, he said it in verse:
Normal: Dharma King, Most High Honored One,
Normal: Just speak it out, don't you worry none.
Normal: In this assembly of measureless folks,
Normal: There's some who can respect and believe.
Normal: The Buddha again stopped Śāriputra: "If I speak about this matter, all them beings in all the worlds—heavenly folk, human folk, asuras—they all gonna be shocked and full of doubt. And them arrogant monks, they gonna fall into the great pit."
Normal: At that time, the World-Honored One spoke again in verse, saying:
Normal: Stop, stop, don't need to speak about it.
Normal: My dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive.
Normal: Them arrogant ones full of themselves—
Normal: If they hear it, they surely won't respect or believe.
Normal: At that time, Śāriputra addressed the Buddha again: "World-Honored One, I only wish you would speak about it, only wish you would speak! Right now in this assembly here, folks like me and more—hundreds of thousands of millions of billions—world after world we been receiving the Buddha's transforming teaching. Folks like this, they surely can respect and believe. They gonna have long-night peace and safety, gonna gain much benefit."
Normal: At that time, Śāriputra, wanting to speak this meaning again, he said it in verse:
Normal: Most High Honored One of Two Feet,
Normal: I wish you'd speak the foremost dharma.
Normal: I'm the Buddha's eldest son—
Normal: I only beg you to explain it clear and distinct.
Normal: This assembly of measureless folks,
Normal: They able to respect and believe this dharma.
Normal: The Buddha already, world after world,
Normal: Done taught and transformed folks like these.
Normal: They all with one mind, palms pressed together,
Normal: Wanting to listen and receive the Buddha's words.
Normal: We twelve hundred here,
Normal: And others seeking to be Buddhas—
Normal: We wish, for the sake of this whole assembly,
Normal: You'd just explain it clear and distinct.
Normal: When these folks hear this dharma,
Normal: They gonna be born with great rejoicing.
Normal: FIVE THOUSAND LEAVE THE ASSEMBLY
Normal: At that time, the World-Honored One told Śāriputra: "You done earnestly asked three times now. How can I not speak? Now you listen carefully, think about it well, remember it good. I'm gonna break it down for you clear and distinct."
Normal: When he spoke these words, right there in the assembly there was monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen—five thousand of them—they got up from their seats, bowed to the Buddha, and walked on out. And why was that? This bunch here, their roots of wrongdoing was deep and heavy, and they was full of arrogance. They thought they'd obtained what they hadn't obtained, thought they'd realized what they hadn't realized. They had faults like these, and that's why they didn't stay. The World-Honored One just stayed silent, didn't try to stop them none.
Normal: At that time, the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Now this assembly of mine, it ain't got no more dead branches and dead leaves. It's got only the genuine, truthful, real ones. Śāriputra, them arrogant folks leaving—that's a good thing. Now you listen well. I'm gonna speak it for you."
Normal: Śāriputra said: "Yes, indeed, World-Honored One. I'm joyful, wanting to hear."
Heading 2: THE ONE GREAT MATTER—THE ONE VEHICLE
Normal: The Buddha told Śāriputra:
Normal: "A wonderful dharma like this—the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, they only speak it from time to time. Just like the udumbara flower—it only appears once in a great while. Śāriputra, you and the rest ought to believe what the Buddha speaks. His words ain't false or empty.
Normal: "Śāriputra, when the Buddhas speak the dharma according to what's fitting, the meaning's hard to understand. And why's that? I use countless skillful means—all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions—to explain the dharmas. This dharma here, it ain't something thinking and discriminating can understand. Only the Buddhas can know it.
Normal: "And why's that? The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, they only appear in the world for one great matter, one great cause and condition. Śāriputra, what do I mean when I say the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, only appear in the world for one great matter, one great cause and condition?
Normal: "The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world because they want to open up the Buddha's knowing and seeing for living beings, make it pure—that's why they appear. They want to show living beings the Buddha's knowing and seeing—that's why they appear. They want to awaken living beings to the Buddha's knowing and seeing—that's why they appear. They want to cause living beings to enter into the path of the Buddha's knowing and seeing—that's why they appear.
Normal: "Śāriputra, this is why the Buddhas appear in the world for one great matter, one great cause and condition."
Normal: The Buddha told Śāriputra: "The Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, they only teach and transform bodhisattvas. Everything they do, it's always for this one matter. They only use the Buddha's knowing and seeing to show and awaken living beings.
Normal: "Śāriputra, the Tathāgata, he only teaches dharma to living beings using the One Buddha Vehicle. There ain't no other vehicles—not two, not three.
Normal: "Śāriputra, the dharma of all the Buddhas in all ten directions—it's like this too."
Heading 2: THE THREE TIMES—PAST, FUTURE, PRESENT
Normal: "Śāriputra, them Buddhas of the past, they used countless, numberless skillful means—all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions—to teach dharma for living beings. All them dharmas was for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All them living beings who heard the dharma from the Buddhas—in the end, they all obtained the wisdom of all modes.
Normal: "Śāriputra, them Buddhas of the future, when they gonna appear in the world, they also gonna use countless, numberless skillful means—all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions—to teach dharma for living beings. All them dharmas gonna be for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All them living beings who hear the dharma from the Buddhas—in the end, they all gonna obtain the wisdom of all modes.
Normal: "Śāriputra, right now, in the countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddha-lands throughout the ten directions, them Buddhas, them World-Honored Ones, they benefiting and bringing peace to living beings in so many ways. These Buddhas too, they using countless, numberless skillful means—all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions—to teach dharma for living beings. All them dharmas is for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All them living beings who hear the dharma from the Buddhas—in the end, they all gonna obtain the wisdom of all modes.
Normal: "Śāriputra, these Buddhas, they only teach and transform bodhisattvas. They want to show living beings the Buddha's knowing and seeing. They want to awaken living beings to the Buddha's knowing and seeing. They want to cause living beings to enter the Buddha's knowing and seeing.
Normal: "Śāriputra, I'm the same way right now too. I know living beings got all kinds of desires. Deep in their minds, they attached to things. Following their original natures, using all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions, the power of skillful means—I speak the dharma for them.
Normal: "Śāriputra, all this—it's all for the sake of obtaining the One Buddha Vehicle and the wisdom of all modes."
Heading 2: ONLY ONE VEHICLE—THE BUDDHA VEHICLE
Normal: "Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions, there ain't even two vehicles, much less three.
Normal: "Śāriputra, when the Buddhas appear in a world of five kinds of defilement—the defilement of the age, the defilement of afflictions, the defilement of living beings, the defilement of views, the defilement of lifespan—when it's like that, Śāriputra, when the age is all disturbed and chaotic, living beings heavy with filth, stingy and jealous, accomplishing roots of unwholesomeness, the Buddhas use the power of skillful means. Within the One Buddha Vehicle, they make distinctions and speak of three.
Normal: "Śāriputra, if my disciples call themselves arhats or solitary-walkers, but they don't hear, don't know that the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, only teach and transform bodhisattvas—these ain't disciples of the Buddha. They ain't arhats. They ain't solitary-walkers.
Normal: "Furthermore, Śāriputra, them monks and nuns who say they already obtained arhatship, say they in their final body, say they reached ultimate nirvāṇa—and then they don't keep seeking anuttara-samyak-sambodhi no more—you ought to know that folks like this, they all arrogant people.
Normal: "And why's that? If there's a monk who truly obtained arhatship, and he don't believe this dharma—that situation don't exist. Except after the Buddha's extinction, when there ain't no Buddha present in the world. And why's that? After the Buddha's extinction, sutras like this—folks who can accept and uphold them, read and recite them, understand their meaning—them kind of people is hard to find. If they meet another Buddha later on, concerning this dharma, they gonna obtain complete understanding.
Normal: "Śāriputra, all of you ought to single-mindedly believe, understand, accept and uphold the Buddha's words. The words of the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas—they ain't false. There ain't no other vehicle. There's only the One Buddha Vehicle."

Normal: Having himself realized the unsurpassed road,
Normal: The Great Vehicle dharma, equal for all—
Normal: If I was to use the Small Vehicle
Normal: To teach even one single person,
Normal: I'd be falling into stinginess and greed—
Normal: This matter would be impossible.
Normal: If a person has faith and takes refuge in the Buddha,
Normal: The Tathāgata don't deceive or cheat,
Normal: Don't have no greedy or jealous intention,

Normal: Therefore, the Buddha in the ten directions—

Normal: The Buddhas' original vow and wish was:
Normal: 'The Buddha-road that I'm walking—
Normal: I want to cause living beings universally
Normal: To obtain this same road too.'
Normal: The Buddhas of the future world,
Normal: Even though they gonna speak hundreds of thousands of billions,
Normal: Countless doors into the dharma,
Normal: Actually it's for the one vehicle.
Normal: The Buddhas, Honored Ones of Two Feet,
Normal: They know the dharma constantly has no nature—
Normal: Buddha-seed arises from conditions—
Normal: That's why they speak the one vehicle.
Normal: This dharma dwells in the dharma-position,
Normal: The worldly marks constantly abide.
Normal: Having known this at the place of awakening,
Normal: The Guide uses skillful means to speak.
Normal: The heavenly beings and humans who make offerings,
Normal: The present Buddhas of the ten directions,
Normal: Numerous as Ganges River sands,
Normal: Appearing in the world—
Normal: For the sake of bringing peace to living beings,
Normal: They also speak dharma like this.
Normal: Knowing the foremost still extinction,
Normal: Using the power of skillful means,
Normal: Although they showing various roads,
Normal: Actually it's for the Buddha Vehicle.
Normal: Knowing the practices of living beings,
Normal: What's thought deep in their minds,
Normal: Their karma practiced in the past,
Normal: Their desire-natures, vigor-power,
Normal: And whether their faculties sharp or dull—
Normal: Using various causes and conditions,
Normal: Comparisons and also expressions,
Normal: They speak with appropriate skillful means.
Normal: Now I'm the same way too—
Normal: For the sake of bringing peace to living beings,
Normal: Using various dharma-doors,
Normal: I'm proclaiming and showing the Buddha-road.
Normal: With my power of wisdom,
Normal: I know living beings' natures and desires.
Normal: Using skillful means, speaking all the dharmas,
Normal: I'm causing them all to gain joy.
Normal: Śāriputra, you ought to know—
Normal: With my Buddha-eye I'm looking,
Normal: Seeing living beings of the six paths,
Normal: Poor and without merit or wisdom,
Normal: Entering the dangerous road of birth and death,
Normal: Suffering continuing on without break,
Normal: Deeply attached to the five desires,
Normal: Like a yak loving its tail—
Normal: With greed and craving they damaging themselves,
Normal: Blind in the darkness, can't see nothing.
Normal: They don't seek the Buddha with his great might,
Normal: Don't seek the dharma that cuts off suffering neither.
Normal: Deep into all kinds of wrong views they go,
Normal: Trying to use suffering to get rid of suffering.
Normal: For the sake of living beings like these,
Normal: I arise with a great compassion-mind.
Normal: When I first sat at the place of awakening,
Normal: Gazing at the tree and also walking,
Normal: For three times seven days
Normal: I thought about matters like this:
Normal: 'The wisdom I obtained—
Normal: It's subtle, wonderful, most foremost.
Normal: Living beings got dull faculties,
Normal: Attached to pleasure, blinded by ignorance.
Normal: Folks like these here—
Normal: How can they possibly be ferried across?'
Normal: At that time, all them Brahma kings
Normal: And all them Lord Shakras too,
Normal: The Four Heavenly Kings protecting the world,
Normal: And the Great Freedom Heaven god,
Normal: Along with other hosts of heavenly beings,
Normal: Retinues of hundreds of thousands of millions,
Normal: Respectfully with palms pressed together, bowing,
Normal: They begged me to turn the dharma-wheel.
Normal: I immediately thought to myself:
Normal: 'If I only praise the Buddha Vehicle,
Normal: Living beings sunk down in suffering,
Normal: They won't be able to believe this dharma.
Normal: Because they break the dharma and don't believe,
Normal: They gonna fall into the three evil paths.
Normal: I'd rather not speak the dharma at all,
Normal: Just quickly enter into nirvāṇa.'
Normal: Then I remembered them Buddhas of the past,
Normal: The power of skillful means they practiced.
Normal: 'The road I obtained right now,
Normal: I also ought to speak three vehicles.'
Normal: While I was thinking like this,
Normal: Buddhas from the ten directions all appeared.
Normal: With their Brahma voices they comforted and instructed me:
Normal: 'Excellent! Śākyamuni!
Normal: Foremost of Guides,
Normal: You obtained this unsurpassed dharma.
Normal: Following all the Buddhas everywhere,
Normal: You gonna use the power of skillful means.
Normal: We too all obtained
Normal: The most wonderful, foremost dharma.
Normal: For the sake of all kinds of living creatures,
Normal: We make distinctions and speak three vehicles.
Normal: Folks with little wisdom who love the small dharma,
Normal: Who don't believe they can become Buddhas themselves—
Normal: That's why, using skillful means,
Normal: We make distinctions and speak about various fruits.
Normal: Even though we speak three vehicles,
Normal: It's only for teaching bodhisattvas.'
Normal: Śāriputra, you ought to know—
Normal: I heard them holy lion-roars,
Normal: Their deep, pure, subtle, wonderful sounds,
Normal: Joyfully calling 'Homage to the Buddha!'
Normal: Then I thought like this:
Normal: 'I came out into this defiled, evil world.
Normal: Just like all them Buddhas spoke,
Normal: I also ought to follow and practice accordingly.'
Normal: After I thought about this matter,
Normal: I immediately went to Varanasi.
Normal: The marks of the dharmas—still extinction—
Normal: Can't be proclaimed in words.
Normal: Using the power of skillful means,
Normal: For five monks I spoke it.
Normal: This is called turning the dharma-wheel.
Normal: Then there was the sound of nirvāṇa,
Normal: And also 'arhat,'
Normal: And 'dharma' and 'sangha'—these distinguishing names.
Normal: From ages long ago till now,
Normal: I been praising the dharma of nirvāṇa—
Normal: The suffering of birth and death forever exhausted—
Normal: I always speak like this.
Normal: Śāriputra, you ought to know:
Normal: I see them Buddha-children,
Normal: Ones aspiring and seeking the Buddha-road,
Normal: Countless thousands of millions of billions.
Normal: All with reverent minds,
Normal: They come to where the Buddha is.
Normal: They done heard from all them Buddhas before
Normal: Dharma spoken with skillful means.
Normal: I immediately thought like this:
Normal: 'The reason why the Tathāgata appears
Normal: Is for the sake of speaking the Buddha-wisdom.
Normal: Now is exactly the right time.'
Normal: Śāriputra, you ought to know:
Normal: Folks with dull roots and little wisdom,
Normal: Who attached to marks and full of arrogant pride—
Normal: They can't believe this dharma.
Normal: Now I'm joyful and without fear.
Normal: Among all the bodhisattvas here,
Normal: I'm straightforwardly casting off skillful means,
Normal: Only speaking the unsurpassed road.
Normal: When bodhisattvas hear this dharma,
Normal: All their nets of doubt already got removed.
Normal: Twelve hundred arhats—
Normal: They also, every one, gonna become Buddhas.
Normal: Like all them Buddhas of the three times,
Normal: The pattern and style of speaking dharma—
Normal: I'm doing the same thing now too,
Normal: Speaking the dharma without distinctions.
Normal: When Buddhas arise and appear in the world,
Normal: It's a far-off thing, hard to encounter.
Normal: Even when they do appear in the world,
Normal: Speaking this dharma is hard too.
Normal: Through measureless, countless ages,
Normal: Hearing this dharma is hard too.
Normal: And people able to listen to this dharma—
Normal: Folks like that is hard to find too.
Normal: Like the udumbara flower—
Normal: Everybody loves it and delights in it,
Normal: Heavenly beings and humans hold it rare—
Normal: It only appears from time to time.
Normal: When you hear the dharma, rejoice and praise it,
Normal: Even just speaking out one word—
Normal: That's already making an offering
Normal: To all the Buddhas of the three times.
Normal: A person like this is extremely rare,
Normal: Rarer than the udumbara flower.
Normal: All of you, don't have no doubts—
Normal: I'm the King of the Dharmas.
Normal: I'm announcing to the whole great assembly:
Normal: Only using the road of one vehicle,
Normal: I'm teaching and transforming bodhisattvas.
Normal: There ain't no disciples in the disciple-vehicle.
Normal: All of you, Śāriputra,
Normal: Disciples and bodhisattvas too—
Normal: You ought to know this wonderful dharma
Normal: Is the secret essential of all the Buddhas.
Normal: In this defiled, evil world of five kinds,
Normal: Folks only take pleasure in being attached to desires.
Normal: Living beings like these here—
Normal: They'll never seek the Buddha-road.
Normal: Evil people in the future world,
Normal: When they hear the Buddha speak one vehicle,
Normal: They gonna be confused, deluded, won't believe or accept it,
Normal: Gonna break the dharma and fall into evil paths.
Normal: But if there's folks with humility and purity,
Normal: Who aspire and seek the Buddha-road—
Normal: For folks like these,
Normal: I'm gonna extensively praise the road of one vehicle.
Normal: Śāriputra, you ought to know—
Normal: The dharma of all the Buddhas is like this:
Normal: Using ten thousand billions of skillful means,
Normal: According to what's fitting, they speak the dharma.
Normal: Them who don't study and learn it—
Normal: They ain't able to understand this clearly.
Normal: Since all of you already know
Normal: The Buddhas, teachers of the world,
Normal: Their appropriate skillful means and matters—
Normal: Don't have no more doubts and wondering.
Normal: Let your minds be born with great rejoicing—
Normal: Know that you yourselves gonna become Buddhas!
Normal: END OF CHAPTER TWO: THE LOVING TRICKS
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This blues vernacular interpretation transforms Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese into the rhythmic, direct language of the blues tradition. Key metaphorical choices:
Normal: 方便 (skillful means) → "loving tricks" / "skillful means" - capturing both the strategic and compassionate aspects
Normal: 諸佛智慧，甚深無量 → "deeper than any well you ever tried to draw from" - making abstract depth concrete
Normal: 一大事因緣 → "one great matter, one great cause and condition" / "the one great reason" - preserving both formality and accessibility
Normal: 五千人退席 → The five thousand leaving rendered as dramatic narrative moment
Normal: Repetitive verse structure → Blues-style repetition with variation
Normal: Technical terms (Tathāgata, Buddha, nirvāṇa) → Kept for their essential meaning, but surrounded by vernacular explanation

Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: ŚĀRIPUTRA'S JOY
Normal: Right then, Śāriputra—his heart just leaping up—he stood up, put his palms together, looked straight at the Buddha's face, and said:
Normal: "Lord, today I heard this teaching from you, and my heart's dancing like it ain't never danced before. I got something I never had. You know why? Because all this time I been hearing you teach, seeing you tell these bodhisattvas they gonna be buddhas, giving them their prophecies—and me and mine, we wasn't in on none of that. I felt cut to the heart, like I'd lost out on all that boundless wisdom you got.
Normal: "World-Honored One, I used to go off by myself—mountains, forests, under the trees—sitting or walking, and I'd think about it over and over: 'We all entered into the same dharma-nature, so how come the Buddha's saving us with this small-vehicle teaching?' But that was on me, Lord, not on you. Why? Because if we'd just waited to hear you explain the causes, the way to reach that supreme perfect enlightenment, we would've been saved by the great vehicle. But we didn't understand your skillful means, the way you teach different folks different ways. First time we heard the Dharma, we just grabbed hold, believed it, thought about it, and took it for proof.
Normal: "World-Honored One, all this time—day and night, day and night—I been blaming myself. But now I heard from you what I never heard before, a teaching I never even knew existed, and all my doubts and regrets just fell away. My body and mind feel easy now, like I finally got home safe. Today I know for real—I'm a true child of the Buddha, born from the Buddha's mouth, born from the Dharma's transformation, got my share of the Buddha's teaching."
Heading 2: ŚĀRIPUTRA'S VERSES
Normal: I heard this teaching sound,
Normal: got what I never had,
Normal: my heart's filled up with joy,
Normal: the net of doubts all torn away.
Normal: From way back I received your teaching,
Normal: didn't lose the great vehicle path.
Normal: Buddha's voice is precious rare,
Normal: can take away all living beings' pain.
Normal: I already got my leakages dried up,
Normal: hearing this takes away my worry and grief.
Normal: When I was in the mountain valleys,
Normal: or underneath the forest trees,
Normal: Whether sitting down or walking 'round,
Normal: I was always thinking on this thing,
Normal: crying out, blaming my own self:
Normal: "How come I went and fooled myself?"
Normal: We're Buddha's children too,
Normal: entered the same no-leak teaching,
Normal: but we can't, in the future time,
Normal: proclaim this unsurpassed Way.
Normal: The golden color and thirty-two marks,
Normal: the ten powers and all liberations—
Normal: we're in the same Dharma together,
Normal: but I didn't get none of this.
Normal: The eighty kinds of beautiful signs,
Normal: the eighteen things that buddhas alone have—
Normal: all these kind of virtues and powers,
Normal: and I done lost every one.
Normal: When I was walking by myself,
Normal: I'd see the Buddha in the great assembly,
Normal: his name filling up all ten directions,
Normal: bringing benefit far and wide to living beings.
Normal: I'd think: "I lost this advantage,
Normal: I done deceived my own self."
Normal: Day and night, day and night,
Normal: I kept thinking on this thing,
Normal: Wanting to ask the World-Honored One:
Normal: Did I lose out or didn't I?
Normal: I kept seeing the World-Honored One
Normal: praising all them bodhisattvas.
Normal: So day and night, day and night,
Normal: I was turning this thing over in my mind.
Normal: Now I heard the Buddha's voice
Normal: teaching according to what folks need,
Normal: That no-leak teaching, hard to imagine,
Normal: leading everyone to the place of the Way.
Normal: I used to hold wrong views,
Normal: I was a teacher for them brahmin priests.
Normal: World-Honored One knew my heart,
Normal: pulled out the wrong and taught nirvāṇa.
Normal: I swept away all them wrong views,
Normal: bore witness to the empty teaching.
Normal: Right then my heart told me
Normal: I'd reached the place of extinction.
Normal: But now I finally see clear—
Normal: that wasn't real extinction at all.
Normal: When I get to be a buddha,
Normal: with the thirty-two marks complete,
Normal: heaven-folk and yaksha crowds,
Normal: dragons and spirits showing respect—
Normal: That's when you can truly say
Normal: it's permanently done, nothing left over.
Normal: Buddha, in this great assembly,
Normal: said I'm gonna be a buddha.
Normal: Hearing this kind of teaching sound,
Normal: all doubts and regrets swept clean.
Normal: First time I heard what the Buddha said,
Normal: my heart was shocked and full of doubt:
Normal: "Could this be a demon pretending to be Buddha,
Normal: trying to mess with my mind?"
Normal: But Buddha used all kinds of causes,
Normal: parables and skillful words,
Normal: His heart calm as the ocean,
Normal: and when I heard, the net of doubt got cut.
Normal: Buddha told about the past ages,
Normal: countless buddhas gone to extinction,
Normal: Dwelling safe in skillful means,
Normal: they all taught this same teaching.
Normal: Present and future buddhas too,
Normal: their number beyond all counting,
Normal: They also use skillful means
Normal: to proclaim this very teaching.
Normal: Just like our present World-Honored One—
Normal: from his birth up to leaving home,
Normal: Finding the Way and turning the Dharma wheel,
Normal: he also taught by skillful means.
Normal: World-Honored One teaches the real Way—
Normal: the evil one ain't got nothing like this.
Normal: So now I know for certain sure,
Normal: this ain't no demon playing buddha.
Normal: I fell into that net of doubt,
Normal: thought it was the devil's doing.
Normal: I heard Buddha's gentle voice,
Normal: deep and far and so refined,
Normal: setting forth the pure and clean teaching.
Normal: My heart filled up with joy,
Normal: All doubts and regrets gone for good,
Normal: dwelling safe in the real wisdom.
Normal: I'm definitely gonna be a buddha,
Normal: honored by heaven-folk and humans,
Normal: Turning the unsurpassed Dharma wheel,
Normal: teaching and transforming bodhisattvas.
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA SPEAKS TO ŚĀRIPUTRA
Normal: Right then the Buddha told Śāriputra:
Normal: "Now, in front of all these heaven-folk, humans, monks, brahmin priests, and the whole great assembly, I'm telling you—way back, at the place of twenty billion buddhas, for the sake of this unsurpassed Way, I was always teaching you. And you, through the long night, you followed me and learned. I used skillful means to guide you, made you be born into my Dharma.
Normal: "Śāriputra, back then I taught you to set your will on the buddha-way, but you done forgot all about it now and went around thinking you already reached extinction. Now I want to make you remember again that original vow and the way you walked, so I'm preaching this Mahayana scripture to the voice-hearer disciples. It's called the Lotus of the Wonderful Dharma, teaching for bodhisattvas, cherished and protected by all buddhas.
Normal: "Śāriputra, in the future age, after you pass through a boundless, limitless, unthinkable number of ages, after you make offerings to thousands and millions and billions of buddhas, after you uphold the true Dharma and complete all the bodhisattva practices—you gonna be a buddha. Your name gonna be Flower Light Tathāgata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened in Knowledge, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.
Normal: "Your country gonna be called Free from Dirt, and that land gonna be level and straight, pure and beautiful, peaceful and rich and happy, heaven-folk and humans flourishing everywhere. The ground gonna be made of lapis lazuli, with eight roads crossing, gold ropes marking out the sides. Along them roads, seven-jewel trees everywhere, always full of flowers and fruit. That Flower Light Tathāgata gonna teach living beings using the three vehicles too.
Normal: "Śāriputra, when that buddha appears, even though it won't be an evil age, because of his original vow he gonna teach the three-vehicle Dharma. His age gonna be called Great Jewel Adornment. Why it called Great Jewel Adornment? Because in that country, bodhisattvas are the great jewels. And them bodhisattvas—boundless, limitless, beyond thought, can't be counted by numbers or comparisons. Unless you got buddha-wisdom power, can't nobody know their number.
Normal: "When they want to walk somewhere, jewel flowers gonna hold up their feet. These bodhisattvas ain't new to this—they been planting virtue for a long, long time. At the place of hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of buddhas they been practicing pure conduct, always praised by all them buddhas. They been cultivating buddha-wisdom constantly, got great spiritual powers, know well all the gates of all teachings. They straight and honest, no fakeness in them, their will and mind firm and solid. Bodhisattas like this gonna fill up that whole country.
Normal: "Śāriputra, that Flower Light Buddha gonna live twelve small ages, not counting the time when he was a prince before he became buddha. The people in that country gonna live eight small ages. After twelve small ages, Flower Light Tathāgata gonna give the prophecy to a bodhisattva named Firm Fullness, telling him he gonna reach that supreme perfect enlightenment. He gonna tell all the monks: 'This Firm Fullness Bodhisattva gonna be the next buddha, his name gonna be Flower Feet Peaceful Walker, Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One.' And his buddha country gonna be just like this one.
Normal: "Śāriputra, after that Flower Light Buddha passes into extinction, the true Dharma gonna remain in the world for thirty-two small ages, and the imitation Dharma gonna last another thirty-two small ages."

Heading 2: THE ASSEMBLY REJOICES
Normal: Right then the four groups—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen—and the dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, and all the rest of the great assembly, they saw Śāriputra receiving that prophecy of supreme perfect enlightenment right there in front of the Buddha. Their hearts got filled with joy, leaping up beyond measure. Each one took off the best robe they was wearing and offered it to the Buddha.
Normal: Shakra the king of gods, the Brahma king, and countless other divine beings, they also offered heavenly fine robes, heavenly mandara flowers, great mandara flowers, and such to the Buddha. Them heavenly robes they scattered, they hung there in the empty sky, turning around by themselves. All the heavenly music—hundreds of thousands of millions of kinds—played all at once up there in the sky, raining down heavenly flowers everywhere.
Normal: And they said: "Way back, at Benares, the Buddha first turned the Dharma wheel. Now he turning it again—the unsurpassed, the greatest Dharma wheel of all!"
Heading 2: THE HEAVEN-FOLK'S VERSES
Normal: Long ago at Benares
Normal: you turned the wheel of the Four Noble Truths,
Normal: explaining all the teachings clearly,
Normal: the five aggregates and how they born and die.
Normal: Now you turning again the most wonderful,
Normal: unsurpassed great Dharma wheel.
Normal: This teaching deep and mysterious—
Normal: ain't many can believe it.
Normal: From way back till now
Normal: we heard the World-Honored One teaching many times,
Normal: but we never heard nothing like this,
Normal: this deep and wonderful supreme teaching.
Normal: World-Honored One preaching this teaching,
Normal: we all rejoicing right along.
Normal: Great wisdom Śāriputra

Normal: you teach it by skillful means as needed.
Normal: Whatever merit we got,
Normal: in this life or lives gone by,
Normal: And seeing the Buddha's virtue—
Normal: we turn it all toward the buddha-way.
Normal: ŚĀRIPUTRA ASKS ABOUT THE DISCIPLES
Normal: Right then Śāriputra said to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, now I got no more doubts or regrets. Right here in front of the Buddha I received that prophecy of supreme perfect enlightenment. But these twelve hundred disciples whose hearts are free—they used to be in the learning stage. You was always teaching them, saying: 'My Dharma can free you from birth, old age, sickness, and death, finally reach nirvāṇa.'
Normal: "These folks, whether they still learning or done with learning, they also thought they'd gotten free from the 'I' view and the views about existence and non-existence and such—they thought they'd reached nirvāṇa. But now, right here in front of the World-Honored One, they hearing what they never heard before, and they all falling into doubt and confusion.
Normal: "Please, World-Honored One, for the sake of these four groups, tell us the causes and reasons, so they can let go of doubt and regret."
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA BEGINS THE PARABLE
Normal: Right then the Buddha told Śāriputra:
Normal: "Didn't I already tell you? All buddhas, all World-Honored Ones, they use all kinds of causes, parables, words, and skillful means to teach the Dharma, and it's all for the sake of that supreme perfect enlightenment. Everything they teach is for transforming bodhisattvas.
Normal: "But Śāriputra, now I'm gonna use another parable to make this meaning even clearer. Folks with wisdom, they can understand through parables.
Heading 2: THE PARABLE OF THE BURNING HOUSE BEGINS
Normal: "Śāriputra, say there's a country, a town, a village somewhere. And in that place there's a great elder—old man, getting on in years, but rich beyond measure. Got fields and houses, got servants and workers. His house is big, real big, but it only got one door.
Normal: "Whole lot of people living in that house—a hundred, two hundred, maybe up to five hundred people staying there. But listen now: that house is falling apart. The halls and rooms about to collapse, the pillars rotting at the roots, the beams and rafters leaning sideways, ready to fall. The foundation crumbling, everything breaking down.
Normal: "And all of a sudden, from every direction at once—WHOOSH!—fire breaks out, burning up the whole place.
Normal: "Now that elder, he got children—maybe ten, maybe twenty, maybe even thirty children—and they all inside that house. The elder sees this great fire rising up from all four sides. He gets scared, terrified, and he thinks to himself:
Normal: "'Even though I can get myself out through this burning door safe and sound, my children—they in there in that fire house, playing games, having fun, don't notice nothing, don't know nothing, ain't scared of nothing. Fire coming right at them, pain about to cut into them, but they don't hate it, don't even think about getting out.'
Heading 2: THE FATHER'S ANGUISH
Normal: "Śāriputra, that elder started thinking:
Normal: "'I got strength in my body and my hands. I could carry them out in my robe, or I could use a table or something, get them out that way.'
Normal: "Then he thought again: 'But this house only got one door, and it's narrow too. My children are young, ain't got no sense yet. They attached to where they playing at. They might fall down, get burned up by the fire. I got to tell them about the danger, tell them this house is burning, they need to get out quick, before the fire burns them up.'
Normal: "So he made up his mind like that, and he did just what he thought. He told all his children: 'Y'all got to get out, and get out now!'
Normal: "Even though that father loved them and spoke to them with kind words, trying to teach them—them children was so caught up in their games and fun, they wouldn't believe him, wouldn't listen. They wasn't scared, wasn't frightened, didn't have no mind to leave at all. They didn't even know what fire was, what a house was, what it meant to lose something. They just kept running around playing, looking at their father now and then.
Heading 2: THE FATHER'S SKILLFUL PLAN
Normal: "Right then that elder thought:
Normal: "'This house is already burning up in this great fire. If me and my children don't get out right now, we gonna get burned up for sure. I better use some skillful means to get my children out of this danger.'
Normal: "Now that father knew what his children liked, what each one of them wanted—all kinds of precious playthings and unusual objects they'd be crazy about. So he called out to them:
Normal: "'Y'all! The kind of playthings you like, rare things, hard to find—if you don't take them now, you gonna regret it later! All kinds of toys—sheep carts, deer carts, ox carts—they right outside the door now! You can play with them! Get out of this fire house right now, quick! Whatever you want, I'm gonna give it to you!'
Heading 2: THE CHILDREN ESCAPE
Normal: "Right then, when them children heard their father talking about these precious playthings, just what they wanted, each one of them got bold and excited. They started pushing each other, competing with each other, racing and running, fighting to get out of that fire house.
Normal: "That elder, he saw his children get out safe, all of them sitting there in the open space at the crossroads, on the ground, nothing blocking them, nothing threatening them. His heart calmed down, he was happy, he was rejoicing.
Normal: "Then each of the children came to their father and said: 'Daddy, them toys you promised us—the sheep cart, the deer cart, the ox cart—please give them to us now!'
Heading 2: THE ONE GREAT CART
Normal: "Śāriputra, right then that elder gave each one of his children the same thing—one great cart. These carts was high and wide, decorated with all kinds of jewels, surrounded by railings, with bells hanging on all four sides. On top of that, they had canopies spread out, also adorned with all kinds of rare and precious jewels. Jeweled ropes crisscrossed everywhere, flower garlands hanging down, layers of soft cushions inside, and fine pillows set out.
Normal: "They was pulled by white oxen—skin bright and clean, beautiful bodies, real strong and powerful, walking smooth and steady, fast as the wind. And there was many servants attending to each cart, guarding them.
Normal: "Why did he do this? Because that great elder was rich beyond measure. All kinds of storehouses, all of them overflowing. And he thought:
Normal: "'My wealth has no limit. I shouldn't give my children these small, inferior carts. These children, they all my children, I love them all the same, no favorites. I got these seven-jewel great carts, more than I can count. I ought to give them out equal-hearted, one to each, no different, no distinction. Why? Because even if I gave these things to fill up a whole country, I still wouldn't run out. How much more for my own children!'
Normal: "Right then, each of the children got to ride in one of these great carts. They got something they never had before, something way beyond what they hoped for.
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA ASKS ŚĀRIPUTRA
Normal: "Śāriputra, what you think? Did that elder lie when he gave all his children these precious great carts equally, instead of them small carts?"
Normal: Śāriputra said: "No, World-Honored One. That elder just wanted his children to get free from the fire disaster, to keep their bodies alive—that ain't no lie. Why? Because by keeping their lives and bodies, they already got a precious toy. And even more than that, he used skillful means to pull them out of that burning house!
Normal: "World-Honored One, even if that elder didn't give them even the smallest cart, it still wouldn't be a lie. Why? Because that elder already decided in his mind: 'I'm gonna use skillful means to get my children out.' For that reason alone, it ain't no lie. How much more so when that elder knew his own wealth was beyond measure, and he wanted to benefit his children, so he gave them all the great cart equally!"
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA APPLIES THE PARABLE
Normal: The Buddha told Śāriputra:
Normal: "Good, good! Just like you said. Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is just like this too—he's the father of the whole world. As for all fear, decline, trouble, worry, suffering, the darkness of ignorance—he done exhausted all that forever, nothing left, and he's completely fulfilled with boundless knowledge and vision, power and fearlessness. He got great spiritual power and wisdom power, he's complete in skillful means and the perfection of wisdom, great compassion and great mercy. He never gets tired or lazy, always seeking good things, benefiting everybody.
Normal: "And he's born into this triple world, this old, falling-apart fire house, to save living beings from birth, old age, sickness, death, worry, grief, suffering, trouble, ignorance, darkness, and the three poisons' fire. He teaching them so they can reach that supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: "He sees all living beings getting burned and boiled by birth, old age, sickness, death, worry, grief, suffering, and trouble. And also because of the five desires and the desire for wealth and profit, they suffering all kinds of pain. And also because they greedy and attached, always chasing after things, they suffering in the present. And later they gonna suffer in hell, as animals, as hungry ghosts. Even if they born in heaven or among humans—the suffering of poverty and hardship, the suffering of separation from loved ones, the suffering of being with those you hate—all these kinds of suffering.
Normal: "But living beings are drowning in all this, playing around happy, not noticing, not knowing, not scared, not frightened. They don't even get sick of it, don't seek to get free. In this triple-world fire house they just running around east and west, and even though they meeting great suffering, they don't see it as a problem.
Normal: "Śāriputra, when the Buddha sees this, he thinks:
Normal: "'I'm the father of these living beings. I should pull them out of suffering and difficulty, give them the joy of that boundless, unlimited buddha-wisdom, let them find their happiness there.'
Heading 2: WHY THE BUDDHA USES SKILLFUL MEANS
Normal: "Śāriputra, the Tathāgata thought again:
Normal: "'If I just use my spiritual power and wisdom power, put aside skillful means, and just praise the Tathāgata's knowledge and vision, his power and fearlessness, to all these living beings—they can't get saved that way. Why? Because these living beings ain't escaped from birth, old age, sickness, death, worry, grief, suffering, and trouble yet. They getting burned up in this triple-world fire house. How they gonna understand the Buddha's wisdom?'
Normal: "Śāriputra, just like that elder—even though he had strength in his body and hands, he didn't use it. He just used careful skillful means to save his children from that fire-house disaster. Then afterwards he gave each one a precious great cart.
Normal: "The Tathāgata is just like this too. Even though he got power and fearlessness, he don't use that. He just uses wisdom and skillful means to pull living beings out of the triple-world fire house. He teaches the three vehicles—the voice-hearer vehicle, the solitary-realizer vehicle, and the buddha vehicle.
Normal: "And he says to them: 'Y'all shouldn't enjoy staying in this triple-world fire house! Don't be greedy for these cheap and nasty forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. If you get greedy and attached and you start loving them, you gonna get burned. Get out of the triple world quick! You can attain the three vehicles—voice-hearer, solitary-realizer, and buddha vehicle. I'm guaranteeing this for you now—it ain't gonna be empty words. Y'all just need to work hard with diligence!'
Normal: "The Tathāgata uses this skillful means to encourage living beings forward. And then he says again:
Normal: "'Y'all should know—these three-vehicle teachings are all praised by the sages. They free and independent, no bondage, nothing you have to depend on or seek for. Riding these three vehicles, using the no-leak roots, powers, factors of enlightenment, the way, meditative concentrations, liberations, samādhis, and so forth—you can enjoy yourselves with these, and you'll get boundless peace, calm, and joy.'
Heading 2: THE THREE VEHICLES EXPLAINED
Normal: "Śāriputra, if there's living beings who got wisdom-nature inside them, they hear the Dharma from the Buddha World-Honored One, they believe and receive it, they work hard with diligence, they want to get out of the triple world quick and seek nirvāṇa for themselves—this is called the voice-hearer vehicle. Like them children seeking the sheep cart to get out of the fire house.
Normal: "If there's living beings who hear the Dharma from the Buddha World-Honored One, they believe and receive it, they work hard with diligence, they seeking natural wisdom, they love solitary goodness and quietness, they deeply know the causes and conditions of all teachings—this is called the solitary-realizer vehicle. Like them children seeking the deer cart to get out of the fire house.
Normal: "If there's living beings who hear the Dharma from the Buddha World-Honored One, they believe and receive it, they work hard diligently, they seeking all-knowledge, buddha-knowledge, natural knowledge, no-teacher knowledge, the Tathāgata's knowledge and vision, power and fearlessness, they feeling compassion for and wanting to bring peace and joy to boundless multitudes of living beings, benefiting heaven-folk and humans, saving and freeing everybody—this is called the great vehicle. Because bodhisattvas seek this vehicle, they called mahasattvas—'great beings.' Like them children seeking the ox cart to get out of the fire house.
Heading 2: ALL RECEIVE THE ONE VEHICLE
Normal: "Śāriputra, just like that elder—when he saw his children get out of the fire house safe, reaching that fearless place, he thought about his boundless wealth, and he gave the great cart equally to all his children.
Normal: "The Tathāgata is just like this too. He's the father of all living beings. If he sees boundless billions and thousands of living beings use the Buddha's teaching gate to get out of the triple world's suffering, its fearful and dangerous roads, and attain the joy of nirvāṇa—right then the Tathāgata thinks:
Normal: "'I got boundless, unlimited wisdom, power, fearlessness, and all the other buddha-dharma treasures. All these living beings are my children. I should give them all the great vehicle equally. I shouldn't let anyone get extinction by themselves alone. I should cause them all to reach extinction by the Tathāgata's extinction.'
Normal: "All these living beings who escape the triple world, he gives them all the buddhas' meditative concentrations, liberations, and other things to enjoy. They all one form, one kind, praised by the sages, able to produce pure, wonderful, supreme joy.
Normal: "Śāriputra, just like that elder—first he used three carts to entice his children, but then he only gave them the great cart, adorned with precious things, the safest and best. Still, that elder got no fault of lying.
Normal: "The Tathāgata is just like this too—no lying in him. First he teaches the three vehicles to guide living beings, but then he only uses the great vehicle to save and free them. Why? Because the Tathāgata has boundless wisdom, power, fearlessness, and a storehouse of all teachings. He able to give all living beings the great-vehicle Dharma. But not all of them able to receive it fully.
Normal: "Śāriputra, for this reason you should know: the buddhas, by the power of skillful means, within the one buddha-vehicle, they distinguish and teach three."

Normal: hungry, skinny, desperate, and scared,
Normal: everywhere looking for food.
Normal: Fighting and snarling and biting,
Normal: growling and howling and barking—

Normal: demons and evil spirits,
Normal: yakshas and wicked ghosts
Normal: eating human flesh.
Normal: Poisonous creatures of all kinds,

Normal: beating them till they lose their voice,
Normal: putting their feet on the dogs' necks,

Normal: their bodies tall and big,
Normal: naked, black, and skinny,
Normal: always living right there,
Normal: Making terrible evil sounds,
Normal: yelling out, crying for food.
Normal: And there was other ghosts
Normal: with throats like needles.
Normal: And there was other ghosts
Normal: with heads like ox heads,
Normal: some eating human flesh,
Normal: some also eating dogs,
Normal: Their hair all tangled up,
Normal: cruel and dangerous and mean,
Normal: pressed by hunger and thirst,
Normal: yelling and screaming and running around.
Normal: Yakshas and hungry ghosts
Normal: and all kinds of evil birds and beasts,
Normal: desperately hungry, looking in all directions,
Normal: peeping through the windows.
Normal: All these kinds of troubles,
Normal: fear beyond measure.
Normal: This old, falling-apart house
Normal: belonged to one person.
Normal: That person went out not long ago,
Normal: just a little while,
Normal: and then behind him in that house
Normal: suddenly a fire broke out.
Normal: All four sides at once,
Normal: the flames blazing together.
Normal: The beams, rafters, pillars, and posts
Normal: exploding and cracking with sounds,
Normal: Breaking and falling down,
Normal: the walls collapsing.
Normal: All them ghosts and spirits
Normal: raising their voices in great screams.
Normal: The hawks, vultures, all the birds,

Normal: running around frantic and scared,
Normal: not able to get themselves out.
Normal: Evil beasts and poisonous bugs

Normal: Pishacha demons

Normal: Because of their thin merit and virtue,
Normal: pressed by the fire,
Normal: they hurting each other,

Normal: And all them hungry ghosts,
Normal: heads burning with fire,
Normal: oppressed by hunger, thirst, and heat,
Normal: running around confused and frantic.
Normal: That house was like this—
Normal: terribly frightening.
Normal: Poison, harm, fire, disaster,
Normal: many troubles, not just one.
Normal: Right then the master of that house
Normal: standing outside the gate,
Normal: he heard somebody say:
Normal: "All your children—
Normal: They was playing around before,
Normal: and they came into this house.
Normal: They young and don't know nothing,
Normal: happy and enjoying and attached to playing."
Normal: When the elder heard that,
Normal: shocked, he ran into the fire house,
Normal: planning to rescue and save them,
Normal: keep them from getting burned and harmed.
Normal: He warned all his children,
Normal: told them about all the troubles:
Normal: evil ghosts, poisonous bugs,
Normal: the disaster-fire spreading everywhere,
Normal: All kinds of suffering one after another,
Normal: continuing without stopping.
Normal: Poisonous snakes and vipers,
Normal: and all them yakshas,
Normal: Kumbhanda demons,
Normal: jackals, foxes, and dogs,
Normal: hawks, vultures, kites, and owls,
Normal: centipedes and all the rest,
Normal: Pressed by hunger and thirst,
Normal: terrible and frightening.
Normal: "This is a place of suffering and trouble—
Normal: how much worse now with this great fire!"
Normal: But them children didn't know no better.
Normal: Even though they heard their father teaching,
Normal: they still kept on being attached and playful,
Normal: wouldn't stop their games.
Normal: Right then that elder
Normal: thought to himself:
Normal: "My children are like this,
Normal: adding to my grief and worry.
Normal: Right now this house
Normal: ain't got one thing to enjoy in it,
Normal: but all these children
Normal: are soaked in their games,
Normal: Won't accept my teaching,
Normal: gonna be harmed by this fire."
Normal: Right away he started thinking,
Normal: setting up skillful means.
Normal: He told all his children:
Normal: "I got all kinds
Normal: of precious toys,
Normal: wonderful jeweled fine carts—
Normal: Sheep carts and deer carts
Normal: and great ox carts,
Normal: right now outside the door.
Normal: Y'all come on out!
Normal: I made these carts for you,
Normal: whatever you like,
Normal: you can use them to play around with."
Normal: When the children heard him describe
Normal: all these kinds of carts,
Normal: right away they started competing,
Normal: racing and running out,
Normal: Getting to the open ground,
Normal: away from all that suffering and trouble.
Normal: When the elder saw his children
Normal: get out of the fire house,
Normal: All sitting at the crossroads,
Normal: he sat on a lion seat
Normal: and said to himself with celebration:
Normal: "Now I'm truly happy!
Normal: These children of mine,
Normal: they was so hard to raise up.
Normal: Foolish, small, didn't know nothing,
Normal: and they went into that dangerous house—
Normal: So many poisonous bugs,
Normal: demons frightening and terrible.
Normal: That fierce blazing great fire
Normal: rising up on all four sides—
Normal: But these children
Normal: was attached to their games.
Normal: Now I done rescued them,
Normal: made them escape the disaster.
Normal: That's why, all you people,
Normal: now I'm truly happy."
Normal: Right then, all the children,
Normal: knowing their father was sitting there safe,
Normal: All went to where their father was
Normal: and said to their father:
Normal: "Please give us
Normal: the three kinds of jeweled carts,
Normal: Just like you promised before.
Normal: When us children came out,
Normal: you said you'd give three carts,
Normal: whatever we wanted.
Normal: Now is the right time—
Normal: please give them to us."
Normal: The elder was greatly rich,
Normal: his storehouses many,
Normal: gold, silver, lapis lazuli,
Normal: mother-of-pearl, agate.
Normal: With all kinds of precious things
Normal: he built great carts,
Normal: Adorned and decorated beautifully,
Normal: surrounded by railings all around,
Normal: bells hanging on all four sides,
Normal: gold ropes crisscrossed.
Normal: Nets of real pearls
Normal: spread and set up on top,
Normal: golden flowers and garlands
Normal: hanging down everywhere,
Normal: All colors decorating it,
Normal: wrapping all around.
Normal: Soft silk fabrics
Normal: for cushions and seats.

Normal: beautiful in form and body,
Normal: pulling the jeweled carts.
Normal: Many attendant servants
Normal: guarding and serving them.
Normal: With these wonderful carts
Normal: he gave equally to all his children.
Normal: The children at that time
Normal: were filled with joy and happiness.
Normal: Riding these jeweled carts,
Normal: traveling in all four directions,
Normal: Playing around, happy and joyful,
Normal: free and without hindrance.
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA EXPLAINS TO ŚĀRIPUTRA
Normal: I'm telling you, Śāriputra,
Normal: I'm just like this too—
Normal: among all the sages, the most honored,
Normal: the father of the world.
Normal: All living beings
Normal: are my children.
Normal: They deeply attached to worldly pleasures,
Normal: they ain't got no wise heart.
Normal: The triple world ain't safe—
Normal: it's just like a fire house.
Normal: Suffering filling it up,
Normal: terrible and frightening.
Normal: Always there's birth, old age,
Normal: sickness, death, and worry—
Normal: fires like these
Normal: blazing fierce and never stopping.
Normal: The Tathāgata already left
Normal: the triple-world fire house,
Normal: dwelling quiet and leisurely,
Normal: peaceful in the forest wilds.
Normal: Now this triple world—
Normal: all of it is mine.
Normal: The living beings in it
Normal: all are my children.
Normal: But right now this place
Normal: is full of troubles and difficulties.
Normal: Only I, one person,
Normal: can be their rescue and protection.
Normal: Even though I teach and instruct them,
Normal: they won't believe and receive it.
Normal: They deeply soaked
Normal: in desires and attachments.
Normal: So using skillful means
Normal: I teach the three vehicles,
Normal: causing all living beings
Normal: to know the triple world's suffering.
Normal: I reveal and demonstrate and teach
Normal: the path out of the world.
Normal: If these children
Normal: their hearts get determined,
Normal: Complete the three clear knowledges
Normal: and the six spiritual powers,
Normal: some attaining solitary-realization,
Normal: some becoming non-retreating bodhisattvas—
Normal: You, Śāriputra,
Normal: I, for the sake of living beings,
Normal: using this parable,
Normal: teach the one buddha-vehicle.
Normal: If y'all can
Normal: believe and receive these words,
Normal: all of you will
Normal: accomplish and attain the buddha-way.
Normal: This vehicle is subtle and wonderful,
Normal: pure and supreme.
Normal: Throughout all the worlds
Normal: there's nothing above it.
Normal: What the Buddha delights in—
Normal: all living beings
Normal: ought to praise it,
Normal: make offerings to it, bow to it.
Normal: Boundless billions and thousands
Normal: of powers and liberations,
Normal: meditative concentration and wisdom,
Normal: and all the other buddha-dharmas—
Normal: Attaining a vehicle like this,
Normal: it lets all the children
Normal: day and night through the ages
Normal: always get to play around,
Normal: Together with all the bodhisattvas
Normal: and the voice-hearer assembly,
Normal: riding this jeweled vehicle,
Normal: going straight to the place of the Way.
Normal: For this reason,
Normal: even if you search the ten directions,
Normal: there ain't no other vehicle—
Normal: except the Buddha's skillful means.
Normal: I'm telling you, Śāriputra,
Normal: all y'all people
Normal: are all my children,
Normal: and I am the father.
Normal: For age after age after age
Normal: y'all been burned by all kinds of suffering.
Normal: I done pulled and rescued all of you,
Normal: made you get out of the triple world.
Normal: Even though I said before
Normal: that y'all reached extinction,
Normal: you only exhausted birth and death—
Normal: you didn't really reach extinction.
Normal: What you should do now
Normal: is only buddha-wisdom.
Normal: If there's bodhisattvas
Normal: in this assembly here
Normal: Who can single-heartedly listen
Normal: to the buddhas' real teaching—
Normal: even though the buddhas, the World-Honored Ones,
Normal: use skillful means,
Normal: The living beings they transform
Normal: are all really bodhisattvas.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER THREE: THE PARABLE
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This is the foundational parable of the entire Lotus Sutra—the one every Buddhist knows, the one that contains the whole teaching in story form. A father. His children. A burning house. Three promised carts. One great cart actually given. It's the architecture of skillful means (upaya) made visible, concrete, urgent.
Normal: In translating this into blues/gospel vernacular, I'm drawing on a parallel tradition that also knows about:
Normal: A father desperate to save his children
Normal: A world on fire
Normal: Children too caught up in their games to see the danger
Normal: The preacher's holy trickery (promising heaven to get folks through the church door, then giving them something far greater)
Normal: The generosity of God that exceeds any promise
Normal: The urgency of salvation NOW, not later
Normal: This chapter alternates between tender joy (Śāriputra's awakening) and desperate urgency (the burning house) and stern warning (the karmic consequences of rejection). The blues/gospel tradition knows all three of these registers intimately.
Heading 1: CHAPTER FOUR: FAITH AND UNDERSTANDING
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE PARABLE OF THE PRODIGAL SON - A BLUES STORY OF COMING HOME
Normal: Now listen here, 'cause this is how it went down:
Normal: When the Buddha had finished speaking them words, old Subhūti and Mahākātyāyana and Mahākāśyapa and Mahāmaudgalyāyana - they heard something they never heard before. The World-Honored One had just told Śāriputra he was gonna be a Buddha, gonna get that supreme perfect enlightenment, and these four old men - they felt something rare stir up in their hearts. Joy came bubbling up like a spring. They stood up from where they was sitting, straightened out their robes, bared that right shoulder the way you do when you showing respect, dropped down on their right knee, put their palms together, bowed down low, and looked up at the Buddha's face. And they said:
Normal: "Lord, we're the eldest ones here, the heads of this congregation. We're old now, getting on in years. We thought we'd made it to the end of the road - thought we'd reached nirvāṇa, that final rest. We figured we wasn't capable of nothing more, wasn't no use trying for that supreme perfect enlightenment no more.
Normal: "World-Honored One, when you was preaching all them years past, I was sitting right there in the assembly. But my body got tired, my mind got weary. I just kept thinking about emptiness and signlessness and wishlessness - them three doors to liberation. As for all that Bodhisattva business - playing in supernatural powers, purifying Buddha lands, bringing beings to ripeness - that didn't make my heart sing none. Know why? 'Cause you, World-Honored One, you already brought us out of the three realms of suffering, gave us the certificate of nirvāṇa. And we're old now, getting ancient. When you was teaching them Bodhisattvas about that supreme perfect enlightenment, we didn't feel one spark of desire for it in our hearts.
Normal: "But now - oh, now! - we standing here before the Buddha, and we heard you give us hearers that prophecy of supreme perfect enlightenment, and our hearts is full of joy, overflowing with something we never felt before. We never expected this. We never thought that on this day, all of a sudden, we'd hear this rare teaching, this precious thing. We're congratulating ourselves, celebrating deep down, 'cause we done received this great good fortune. We got these infinite treasures - and we wasn't even looking for them. They just came to us on their own."
Heading 2: THE PARABLE OF THE PRODIGAL SON: A BLUES STORY
Normal: "World-Honored One, we got a story to tell, a parable to make this meaning clear. Let us lay it out for you:
Normal: Once there was a young man, just a boy really, didn't know no better. He up and left his father's house, ran away from home, went wandering off to a far country. And he stayed gone - ten years, twenty years, might've been fifty years. Time got away from him.
Normal: As the years rolled by, the boy grew into a man, but he fell on hard times. Got poor. Got desperate. He was running from place to place, chasing after his next meal, looking for clothes to cover his back. He kept drifting, wandering, and wouldn't you know it - his footsteps led him back toward his home country, though he didn't even know it.
Normal: Now his father - the father had been looking for that boy all along. Looked everywhere, couldn't find him. Finally the old man settled down in one city to wait. And that father? He got rich. I mean RICH. His house was overflowing with treasure - gold and silver, lapis lazuli and coral and amber and crystal and pearls. His storehouses was so full they was about to burst. He had servants by the dozens, officials and administrators and workers, elephants and horses, carriages and oxen and sheep - couldn't even count them all. His business dealings spread out across other countries, merchants and traders coming and going, crowds of people everywhere.
Normal: Meanwhile that poor wandering son - he was going through villages and towns, drifting from country to country, and he came right to the city where his father lived. Didn't even know it was home.
Normal: Now the father, he'd been thinking about that boy every day for fifty-some years. Never told nobody about it. Just kept it inside, thinking and mourning, full of regret. He'd say to himself: 'I'm getting old now. I got all this wealth - gold and silver and jewels, storehouses overflowing - but I ain't got no heir, no son to pass it to. One day I'm gonna die, and all this wealth gonna scatter to the wind, won't have nobody to leave it to.' That thought was eating him up inside. He kept remembering his son, couldn't stop thinking about him.
Normal: And he'd say to himself: 'If I could just find my boy, if I could just pass all this wealth on to him, then I could rest easy. I could be at peace. Wouldn't have nothing to worry about no more.'
Heading 2: THE SON COMES HOME - BUT HE DON'T KNOW IT
Normal: "World-Honored One, this is how it went:
Normal: That poor son was hiring himself out for day labor, going wherever the work was. And his wandering feet brought him right to his father's mansion. He stopped outside the gate, standing off to the side.
Normal: From where he stood, he could see through them gates. He saw his father sitting on a lion throne, a jeweled footstool under his feet. Brahmins and nobles and householders all around him, showing respect, surrounding him with honor. The old man was draped in pearl necklaces worth ten million, all kinds of jewels adorning his body. Officials and servants stood on his left and right, holding white whisks, attending to him. Above him was a canopy made of precious things, silk banners hanging down. They'd sprinkled scented water on the ground, scattered rare flowers everywhere. Treasures was being brought in and taken out, transactions happening, all kinds of magnificent decorations. The old man's authority was powerful, his dignity was overwhelming.
Normal: The poor son saw all this, saw his father wielding all that power, and fear grabbed hold of his heart. He regretted coming to this place. He thought to himself: 'This must be a king, or somebody equal to a king. This ain't no place for a man like me to hire out his labor and earn his keep. Better I go to some poor neighborhood where a man can work with his hands, where food is easy to come by. If I stay here too long, they might force me to work, might press me into service against my will.'
Normal: Soon as he thought that, he turned around and ran. Ran fast as he could.
Heading 2: THE FATHER SEES HIS SON
Normal: "Now the rich old man was sitting up on that lion throne, and he saw the boy. Recognized him immediately. His heart exploded with joy. He thought to himself: 'NOW I got somebody to inherit all my wealth and treasures and storehouses! I been thinking about this child day and night, had no way to see him, and now he just showed up on his own - this is exactly what I been praying for! I'm old now, getting ancient, but I still care about all this wealth, still want to pass it on.'
Normal: Right away he sent people running after the boy. 'Go quick!' he said. 'Bring him back!'
Normal: The servants ran after that poor son and grabbed hold of him.
Normal: The boy was startled, terrified. He started yelling: 'I ain't done nothing to you! Why you grabbing me? I didn't do nothing wrong!'
Normal: But the servants held on tighter, dragged him back by force.
Normal: That poor son, he was thinking to himself: 'I'm innocent, I ain't committed no crime, and they got me like a prisoner - they must be fixing to kill me!' The fear got worse and worse until he fainted dead away, fell out on the ground.
Normal: The father saw all this from a distance. He told the servants: 'I don't need this man brought in by force. Let him go. Sprinkle cold water on his face so he wakes up, but don't say nothing else to him.'
Normal: Why'd the father do that? 'Cause he knew his son's spirit was beaten down low. He knew his own wealth and power was frightening to the boy. He knew for certain this was his child, but he used skillful means - he didn't tell nobody else, 'This is my son.'
Normal: The servants said to the boy: 'You free to go now. Go wherever you want.'
Normal: That poor son - he was happy as he'd ever been. He got up off the ground and headed straight for the poor part of town to look for food and work.
Heading 2: THE FATHER'S PLAN - SKILLFUL MEANS
Normal: "Now the old man, he wanted to draw his son back home, so he set up a plan, used skillful means. He secretly sent two men - men who looked poor and worn down, didn't have no impressive appearance. He told them: 'Go find that poor man and tell him gently: We got work here, and we'll pay you double wages. If he agrees, bring him here to work. If he asks what kind of work, tell him: We'll hire you to clear away dung and trash. Tell him we'll be working right alongside him.'
Normal: So them two men went and found the poor son. When they found him, they laid out the whole proposition.
Normal: The poor son, he agreed to the price right away and came along to shovel dung.
Normal: The father saw his son doing this work, and his heart hurt for him. He felt pity and wonder at the same time.
Normal: Then one day, the father looked out through a window and saw his son's body - thin and worn down, covered in dust and dung, filthy and pitiful.
Normal: Right then, the father took off his pearl necklaces, took off his fine soft robes and all his ornaments. He put on rough, dirty, tattered clothes, covered himself in dust. He took a dung-shoveling tool in his right hand, made himself look scared and humble. Then he went out to where the workers was and said: 'Y'all work hard now, don't be lazy.'
Normal: This was skillful means, so he could get close to his son.
Normal: After a while, he spoke to his son directly. Said: 'Hey there, young man. You stay here and keep working, don't go nowhere else. I'll raise your wages. Whatever you need - pots and pans, rice flour, salt and vinegar - don't hesitate to ask. I got some old servants here, too - if you need anything, they'll provide it. Put your mind at ease. I'm like a father to you, don't you worry about nothing.
Normal: 'Why do I say that? 'Cause I'm old now, and you're young and strong. Long as you been working here, you ain't never been lazy or deceitful, ain't never been angry or resentful or complained. I don't see in you none of them bad qualities I see in other workers. From this day forward, you like a son born to me.'
Normal: Right then and there, the old man gave the boy a new name, called him 'son.'
Normal: Now the poor son - he was glad about this, but deep down he still thought of himself as just a hired hand, a lowly worker. And so it went for twenty years - the father kept him cleaning out dung and trash.
Normal: After them twenty years passed, they'd built up trust between them, and the son could come and go freely in the house. But even so, he still lived in his same place, that little shack outside.
Heading 2: THE FATHER GETS READY TO PASS IT ON
Normal: "World-Honored One, then the time came when the old man got sick. He knew death wasn't far off. He said to the poor son: 'I got a lot of gold and silver and jewels, and my storehouses is overflowing. You know how much is in there, what needs to be brought in and taken out - you know all about it. This is what I want - you need to understand my heart in this. Why am I telling you? 'Cause now, you and me ain't no different. You need to pay careful attention so nothing gets lost or wasted.'
Normal: Right away the poor son received these instructions. He took charge of all them goods - gold and silver and jewels and all them storehouses. But he didn't want to take not even one meal's worth for himself. He still lived in his same spot outside. That low-down feeling in his heart - he couldn't shake it, couldn't let it go.
Normal: Time passed. The father saw his son's mind was gradually opening up, growing bigger. His will was getting stronger, his aspirations was rising. He was starting to feel ashamed of how small he used to think.
Normal: When the father's death was getting close, he called his son to him. He gathered all his relatives, the king and his great ministers, the nobles and householders - got everybody together. Then he made this announcement:
Normal: 'Gentlemen, listen here! This is my son, born from my own body. Years ago in a certain city, he left me and ran away. He wandered suffering and struggling for fifty-some years. His original name was such-and-such, and my name is such-and-such. Back in my home city, I was full of sorrow, searching everywhere for him. Then suddenly in this place, we met again and I found him. This truly is my son, and I truly am his father. Now everything I own - all my wealth and property - it all belongs to him. Everything that's been going in and out of the storehouses - he's known about all of it.'
Normal: World-Honored One, when the poor son heard his father say these words, his joy overflowed, burst out of him like he'd never known before. He thought to himself: 'Originally, I had no mind to hope for nothing, wasn't looking for nothing. But now all these treasures have come to me naturally, on their own!'
Heading 2: THE APPLICATION - THIS IS US
Normal: "World-Honored One, that rich old man - that's the Tathāgata. And we're all like Buddha's children. The Tathāgata has always been saying we are his sons.
Normal: "World-Honored One, because of the three kinds of suffering, we been burning up with torment in birth-and-death, confused and ignorant, attached to small teachings, loving little dharmas.
Normal: "But today the World-Honored One made us think, made us sweep away all that garbage of discriminating thoughts about dharmas. We worked hard at it, put in effort, and we reached nirvāṇa - got that one day's wages. Once we got that, our hearts was full of joy, and we thought we was satisfied. We said to ourselves: 'Because we worked so hard in the Buddha's teaching, we got a whole lot.'
Normal: "But the World-Honored One - he already knew our hearts was stuck on shabby little desires, loving them small teachings. So he just let us be, didn't try to force us. He didn't say to us: 'Y'all got a share in the Tathāgata's treasury of knowledge and vision.' The World-Honored One used skillful means to preach about the Tathāgata's wisdom. We followed the Buddha and got that one day's wages of nirvāṇa, and we thought it was a huge accomplishment. We had no ambition for this Great Vehicle.
Normal: "We also explained the Tathāgata's wisdom for the Bodhisattvas, opened it up and demonstrated it and taught it. But we ourselves had no aspiration for it. Why not? The Buddha knew our hearts loved small teachings, so he used skillful means and taught according to what we could handle. And we didn't know we was really Buddha's children.
Normal: "Now - NOW - we finally know: The World-Honored One don't hold back none of his Buddha-wisdom. Why we know that? Because all along, we really BEEN Buddha's children. It's just that we loved them small teachings. If we'd had minds that loved the great teachings, the Buddha would've preached the Great Vehicle to us.
Normal: "In this scripture, he only preaches the One Vehicle. But back in the day, in front of the Bodhisattvas, he used to criticize them hearers who loved small teachings. But really, the Buddha was teaching the Great Vehicle all along.
Normal: "That's why we're saying: Originally, we had no mind to hope for nothing, wasn't looking for nothing. But now the Dharma King's great treasure has come to us naturally, on its own. Everything that Buddha's children ought to receive - we done already received it all."

Normal: from country to country,
Normal: Sometimes he got something,
Normal: sometimes he got nothing,
Normal: Hungry and starving and thin,
Normal: his body covered with sores,
Normal: Step by step he traveled
Normal: till he came to his father's city,
Normal: Hiring himself out along the way,
Normal: finally reached his father's house.
Normal: Right then the old man
Normal: was inside his gate,
Normal: Under a great jeweled canopy,
Normal: sitting on a lion throne,
Normal: Surrounded by his household,
Normal: people attending and guarding him,
Normal: Some was calculating
Normal: gold and silver treasures,
Normal: Recording incoming and outgoing wealth,
Normal: making notes on ledgers.
Normal: The poor son saw his father -
Normal: so wealthy and honorable and stern -
Normal: Thought he must be a king
Normal: or somebody equal to a king,
Normal: Got scared, startled at himself,
Normal: wondering why he came to this place.
Normal: He said to himself:
Normal: 'If I stay here long,
Normal: I might get pressed into service,
Normal: forced to work against my will.'
Normal: Soon as he thought that,
Normal: he turned and ran away,
Normal: Asked directions to the poor part of town,
Normal: wanted to go hire himself out.
Normal: Right then the old man
Normal: was sitting on that lion throne,
Normal: Saw his son from a distance,
Normal: recognized him without saying a word,
Normal: Immediately told his servants:
Normal: 'Go chase him down and bring him here!'
Normal: The poor son cried out in fear,
Normal: fainted and fell to the ground:
Normal: 'This man grabbing me
Normal: must be fixing to kill me -
Normal: Why I need food and clothes
Normal: if they bringing me here to die?'
Normal: The old man knew his son
Normal: was foolish and narrow-minded,
Normal: Wouldn't believe what he said,
Normal: wouldn't believe he was the father.
Normal: So he used skillful means,
Normal: sent some other people instead,
Normal: One-eyed and ugly,
Normal: didn't have no impressive appearance:
Normal: 'Tell him we'll hire him,
Normal: say we'll pay him wages,
Normal: To clear away dung and garbage,
Normal: we'll pay him double price.'
Normal: The poor son heard this
Normal: and came along, happy,
Normal: Cleared away the dung,
Normal: cleaned out all the rooms.
Normal: The old man from his window
Normal: kept watching his son,
Normal: Thought about the boy's foolishness,
Normal: how he enjoyed lowly work.
Normal: So the old man
Normal: put on shabby dirty clothes,
Normal: Picked up a dung-clearing tool,
Normal: went to where his son was,
Normal: Used skillful means to get close,
Normal: told him to work hard:
Normal: 'I'll raise your wages,
Normal: put oil on your feet,
Normal: Give you plenty to eat,
Normal: thick warm bedding,
Normal: Like this' - rough words -
Normal: 'you better work hard!'
Normal: Then gentle words:
Normal: 'You like my own son.'
Normal: The old man was wise,
Normal: gradually let him come and go,
Normal: For twenty years
Normal: he handled household business,
Normal: Showed him the gold and silver,
Normal: genuine pearls and crystal,
Normal: All the goods coming in and out -
Normal: let him know about all of it.
Normal: But he still stayed outside the gate,
Normal: sleeping in a grass hut,
Normal: Thinking his poor thoughts:
Normal: 'I don't own none of this.'
Normal: The father knew his son's mind
Normal: was gradually growing bigger,
Normal: Wanted to give him the wealth,
Normal: so he gathered his relatives,
Normal: The king and great ministers,
Normal: nobles and householders.
Normal: Before this great assembly
Normal: he said: 'This is my son,
Normal: He left me and went away
Normal: for fifty years.
Normal: Since I saw my son return,
Normal: it's been twenty years,
Normal: Long ago in a certain city
Normal: I lost this boy,
Normal: Went searching everywhere,
Normal: finally came to this place.
Normal: Everything I own -
Normal: house and people -
Normal: I'm giving it all to him,
Normal: let him use it as he wishes.'
Normal: The son remembered his past poverty,
Normal: his low-down mentality,
Normal: Now at his father's place
Normal: he received great treasures,
Normal: Including the house
Normal: and all the wealth,
Normal: He was filled with joy,
Normal: something he never knew before.
Normal: The Buddha's like that too,
Normal: knew I loved small things,
Normal: Never came right out and said:
Normal: 'Y'all gonna be Buddhas.'
Normal: Instead he said we
Normal: attained the outflows-free state,
Normal: Accomplished the Small Vehicle,
Normal: disciples who are hearers.
Normal: The Buddha commanded us
Normal: to preach the supreme path:
Normal: 'Those who cultivate this
Normal: will become Buddhas.'
Normal: We followed the Buddha's teaching,
Normal: preached to the great Bodhisattvas,
Normal: Using all kinds of causes and conditions,
Normal: various parables,
Normal: Many different words,
Normal: teaching the supreme path.
Normal: The Buddha's children
Normal: heard the Dharma from us,
Normal: Thought about it day and night,
Normal: practiced diligently,
Normal: Then the Buddhas
Normal: gave them their prophecies:
Normal: 'In a future age
Normal: you'll become Buddhas.'
Normal: All the Buddhas'
Normal: secret treasury teachings,
Normal: They just preached them to Bodhisattvas,
Normal: taught the real truth,
Normal: But didn't preach to us
Normal: these essential teachings.
Normal: Like that poor son
Normal: who got close to his father -
Normal: Even though he knew about all the goods,
Normal: his heart didn't wish to take them.
Normal: We preached
Normal: the Buddha's Dharma treasury,
Normal: But had no aspiration ourselves -
Normal: it was just like that.
Normal: Inside ourselves, we extinguished afflictions,
Normal: thought that was enough,
Normal: Only understood this one thing,
Normal: didn't think there was nothing else.
Normal: When we heard about
Normal: purifying Buddha lands,
Normal: Teaching and transforming beings,
Normal: we had no joy in it at all.
Normal: Why was that?
Normal: All dharmas
Normal: Are completely empty and still,
Normal: no birth and no death,
Normal: No great and no small,
Normal: no outflows, no conditioned action.
Normal: Thinking like this,
Normal: we didn't feel no joy.
Normal: For long nights
Normal: in the Buddha's wisdom
Normal: We had no greed, no attachment,
Normal: no aspirations at all,
Normal: And concerning the Dharma for ourselves,
Normal: we thought that was the ultimate.
Normal: For long nights
Normal: we cultivated empty dharmas,
Normal: Got free from the three realms'
Normal: suffering and afflictions,
Normal: Dwelling in the final body,
Normal: the remainder-nirvāṇa.
Normal: The Buddha's teaching
Normal: achieved the Way without fail,
Normal: We thought we'd already
Normal: repaid the Buddha's kindness.
Normal: Even though we taught
Normal: the Buddha's children
Normal: The Bodhisattva Dharma
Normal: for seeking the Buddha Way,
Normal: Regarding this Dharma
Normal: we never had no wish or joy.
Normal: The Guide Teacher let us be,
Normal: observed our minds,
Normal: Never pushed us at first
Normal: to talk about real benefit.
Normal: Like that rich old man
Normal: who knew his son's will was low,
Normal: Used skillful means
Normal: to soften his heart,
Normal: Then after that
Normal: gave him all the wealth.
Normal: The Buddha's like that too,
Normal: showing rare wonders,
Normal: Knowing those who love small things,
Normal: using skillful means
Normal: To tame their minds,
Normal: then teaching great wisdom.
Normal: We today
Normal: got something we never had,
Normal: Never hoped for it before,
Normal: but now we got it ourselves,
Normal: Like that poor son
Normal: receiving infinite treasures.
Normal: World-Honored One, today
Normal: we got the Way, got the fruit,
Normal: In the outflows-free Dharma
Normal: we got pure eyes.
Normal: For long nights
Normal: we kept the Buddha's pure precepts,
Normal: Only today
Normal: we got the fruit of that,
Normal: In the Dharma King's Dharma
Normal: we cultivated the holy life for ages,
Normal: Now we attained the outflows-free,
Normal: supreme great fruit.
Normal: We today
Normal: are truly hearers,
Normal: With the Buddha Way's voice
Normal: making everyone hear.
Normal: We today
Normal: are true Arhats,
Normal: Among all the world's
Normal: people and gods, māras and Brahmās,
Normal: Universally among them
Normal: we should receive offerings.
Normal: The World-Honored One's great kindness,
Normal: using rare wonders,
Normal: Showing pity, teaching and transforming,
Normal: benefiting us -
Normal: Through infinite millions of eons,
Normal: who could repay this?
Normal: Serving with hands and feet,
Normal: bowing with head to ground,
Normal: Every kind of offering
Normal: can't repay it.
Normal: Even if we carried him on our heads,
Normal: bore him on both shoulders,
Normal: For Ganges' sands of eons,
Normal: with wholehearted reverence,
Normal: And also offered fine food,
Normal: infinite precious robes,
Normal: All kinds of bedding,
Normal: various medicines,
Normal: Ox-head sandalwood
Normal: and all kinds of jewels,
Normal: Building stupas and temples,
Normal: spreading precious cloth on the ground,
Normal: All these things
Normal: used for making offerings,
Normal: For Ganges' sands of eons,
Normal: still couldn't repay him.
Normal: The Buddhas are rare,
Normal: infinite and limitless,
Normal: Inconceivable,
Normal: great supernatural power,
Normal: Outflows-free and unconditioned,
Normal: kings of all dharmas,
Normal: Able for the sake of the lowly
Normal: to endure these matters,
Normal: Taking up ordinary people clinging to marks,
Normal: teaching according to what's appropriate.
Normal: The Buddhas in the Dharma
Normal: got complete freedom,
Normal: Knowing all beings'
Normal: various desires and joys,
Normal: And their will-power,
Normal: according to what they can handle,
Normal: Using infinite parables
Normal: to teach the Dharma for them,
Normal: According to beings'
Normal: past good roots,
Normal: Also knowing those who are ripe
Normal: and those not yet ripe,
Normal: Calculating in various ways,
Normal: discriminating and knowing,
Normal: On the One Vehicle path,
Normal: teaching three according to what's appropriate.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER FOUR: FAITH AND UNDERSTANDING
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This blues vernacular rendering of the Prodigal Son parable preserves the emotional architecture of Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese while translating it into the idiom of the blues tradition - a tradition that knows intimately about leaving home, hard times, shame, fear, fathers who wait, and unexpected inheritance.
Normal: Key metaphorical choices:
Normal: "One day's wages" for nirvāṇa - the limited payment that seemed like everything
Normal: "Dung-shoveling" as the humble spiritual work the disciples thought was all they were fit for
Normal: The father's patient skillful means shown through concrete gestures: changing clothes, picking up the shovel, working alongside
Normal: The son's "low-down feeling" and "poverty consciousness" as psychological realism
Normal: The inheritance "coming naturally" without seeking - grace, not achievement
Normal: The parable tracks the journey from:
Normal: Self-imposed limitation → recognition of true identity
Normal: Day laborer → heir
Normal: Poverty consciousness → knowing the wealth was always yours
Normal: Shame and fear → joy and homecoming
Normal: This is the blues truth: sometimes what's keeping us poor ain't the world - it's what we think about ourselves. And sometimes there's a father who's been waiting all along, ready to give us everything, soon as we ready to receive it.
Heading 1: CHAPTER FIVE: THE PARABLE OF THE MEDICINAL HERBS
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA PRAISES MAHĀKĀŚYAPA
Normal: Now when the Buddha heard what Mahākāśyapa and them other great disciples had to say, he smiled and said:
Normal: "That's right, that's right, Kāśyapa. You done spoke the truth about the Tathāgata - you told it plain. But let me tell you something: the Tathāgata got powers and virtues you ain't even started to count yet. You could talk for a billion kalpas - lifetimes stacked on lifetimes - and still wouldn't get to the end of what the Buddha can do.
Normal: "Listen here, Kāśyapa: The Tathāgata is the king of all dharmas - king of all truth, you hear me? And when the Buddha speaks, ain't nothing false come out his mouth. Every teaching he gives, he gives it with wisdom and skillful means, and every teaching leads straight to the ground of all-knowledge. The Tathāgata sees where every dharma is heading, knows where every truth is going. He knows what's deep in every living being's heart, knows what they're doing, thinking, walking toward. Nothing blocks his sight. He sees clear through to the bottom of all things, and he shows all beings the path to perfect wisdom."
Heading 2: THE PARABLE OF THE ONE RAIN
Normal: "Now Kāśyapa, let me tell you a story. Let me paint you a picture:
Normal: "Imagine the whole world - this whole three-thousand-fold universe with all its mountains and valleys, its streams and flatlands, every inch of dirt and rock. And growing up from that ground you got all kinds of plants - you got bushes and forests, you got medicinal herbs and wildflowers, every kind and color you can name. All different, you understand? Different names, different natures, different ways of being.
Normal: "Now here come a great cloud - a mighty rain cloud - spreading across the whole sky, covering this entire three-thousand-fold world. And that cloud, it opens up and lets the rain fall. One rain, falling everywhere at once. The rain falls equal on every living thing.
Normal: "And all them bushes and forests, all them medicinal herbs - they drinking that rain according to what they are:
Normal: "The little herbs with little roots, little stems, little branches, little leaves - they take what they can take.
Normal: "The medium herbs with medium roots, medium stems, medium branches, medium leaves - they take what they need.
Normal: "The big herbs with big roots, big stems, big branches, big leaves - they drink deep.
Normal: "And the trees - small trees and great trees, high and low - every one of them receives according to its nature.
Normal: "One cloud. One rain. But each plant takes what it can hold. Each grows according to its own kind - each puts out its flowers and fruit according to what it is.
Normal: "You see? They all growing from the same earth, all drinking from the same rain, but each plant different from the next. The rain don't pick and choose. The rain just falls."
Heading 2: THE APPLICATION - THE BUDDHA IS LIKE THE RAIN
Normal: "Now Kāśyapa, understand this: The Tathāgata is just like that. When the Buddha appears in this world, he's like that great cloud rising up. His voice - his great voice - spreads everywhere, reaching the gods and humans and asuras, covering the whole world like that cloud covers the three-thousand-fold universe.
Normal: "And the Buddha stands before the multitude and declares:
Normal: "'I am the Tathāgata - the One Who Comes Thus. I am the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed One, the Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.
Normal: "'Those who ain't crossed over yet - I'll get them across. Those who ain't understood yet - I'll make it clear. Those who ain't found peace yet - I'll give them rest. Those who ain't reached nirvāṇa yet - I'll lead them there.
Normal: "'I know this present world and the world to come. I know them as they truly are. I'm the all-knowing one, the all-seeing one. I know the path, I opened the path, I teach the path.
Normal: "'So all you gods and humans and asuras - come on here. Come and listen to the Dharma.'
Normal: "And when the Buddha calls like that, countless millions of living beings come to hear the teaching.
Normal: "Now the Tathāgata looks out at all them beings and sees who got sharp faculties and who got dull ones, who's diligent and who's lazy. And according to what each one can bear, he teaches the Dharma - gives it to them in countless different ways, makes each one glad, helps each one get some benefit.
Normal: "And these beings, when they hear this teaching, they find peace in this present life. And when they die, they born in good places. They experience joy through practicing the path. They get to hear the Dharma again. And hearing it, they break through all the obstacles. According to their strength - according to what power they got - they gradually enter the Way.
Normal: "Just like that great cloud raining down on all the bushes and forests and medicinal herbs, and each plant - according to its kind - receives the moisture and grows.
Heading 2: THE ONE FLAVOR OF LIBERATION
Normal: "Listen: When the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma, it's one mark, one flavor. What flavor is that? The flavor of liberation - the mark of freedom, the mark of letting go, the mark of extinction. It all leads to one place: the ground of all-knowing wisdom.
Normal: "Now the beings who hear the Tathāgata's teaching - who uphold it, read it, recite it, practice it just like it's taught - they don't even know themselves what merit they're getting. Why not? Because only the Tathāgata knows. Only the Buddha sees clear.
Normal: "The Buddha knows each being's mark and nature. He knows what they're thinking about, what they're pondering, what they're practicing. How they think, how they ponder, how they practice. What dharma they're thinking about, what dharma they're pondering, what dharma they're practicing. What dharma they're using to attain what dharma.
Normal: "These beings living in all different stations - only the Tathāgata sees them as they really are, sees them clear with no obstruction.
Normal: "Just like them bushes and forests and medicinal herbs - they don't know their own nature, don't know if they're high, middle, or low. But the Tathāgata knows.
Normal: "The Buddha knows this is the one-mark, one-flavor Dharma - the mark of liberation, the mark of freedom, the mark of letting go, the ultimate mark of nirvāṇa, the always-still-and-quiet mark that ends in emptiness.
Normal: "And knowing this, the Buddha watches what beings want and need, and he protects them. That's why he don't just come right out and teach the all-knowing wisdom straight away. He waits. He watches. He knows the time.
Normal: "Now you, Kāśyapa, and the rest of you - it's rare what you done. You understood that the Tathāgata teaches according to what's appropriate. You believed it. You accepted it. Why is that rare? Because when the buddhas - the World-Honored Ones - teach according to what's appropriate, that teaching is hard to grasp, hard to understand."
Heading 2: THE VERSES: THE PARABLE TOLD AGAIN IN SONG
Normal: The Dharma King who breaks through existence
Normal: Appears in this world,
Normal: Teaching in all kinds of ways
Normal: According to what beings desire.
Normal: The Tathāgata - honored and revered,
Normal: His wisdom deep and far-reaching -
Normal: He kept this essential teaching quiet for a long time,
Normal: Wasn't in no hurry to speak it out.
Normal: Those with wisdom, when they hear it,
Normal: They can believe and understand.
Normal: Those without wisdom doubt and regret,
Normal: And they lose it forever.
Normal: That's why, Kāśyapa,
Normal: The Buddha teaches according to people's power,
Normal: Using all kinds of causes and conditions
Normal: To help them get to right seeing.
Normal: Now Kāśyapa, understand:
Normal: It's like a great cloud
Normal: Rising up in the world,
Normal: Spreading over everything.
Normal: That wisdom-cloud full of moisture,
Normal: Lightning flashing bright,
Normal: Thunder rolling in the distance,
Normal: Making everybody glad.
Normal: The sun's light gets covered over,
Normal: The ground gets cool,
Normal: The cloud hangs low and thick,
Normal: Looking like you could reach up and grab it.
Normal: And that rain falls equal everywhere -
Normal: North, south, east, west -
Normal: Pouring down without measure,
Normal: Soaking the whole earth.
Normal: In the mountain valleys and dangerous ravines,
Normal: In the hidden and secret places,
Normal: All the grasses and medicinal herbs grow,
Normal: Big trees and little trees,
Normal: The hundred grains and crops,
Normal: Sugarcane and grape vines -
Normal: The rain moistens them all,
Normal: None go without.
Normal: The dry ground gets watered everywhere,
Normal: The herbs and trees flourish together.
Normal: That cloud pours out
Normal: One flavor of water.
Normal: But the grasses and trees and forests -
Normal: Each takes its portion of moisture.
Normal: All the trees -
Normal: High ones, middle ones, low ones -
Normal: According to their size,
Normal: Each grows as it can.
Normal: Roots, stems, branches, leaves,
Normal: Flowers, fruits, colors, and light -
Normal: All made fresh by that one rain.
Normal: According to their body, their nature,
Normal: Their portion, their size,
Normal: The moisture is one
Normal: But each flourishes in its own way.
Normal: The Buddha is like this too,
Normal: Appearing in this world
Normal: Like that great cloud covering everything.
Normal: When he comes into the world,
Normal: He teaches beings
Normal: And explains the truth
Normal: Of all things.
Normal: The Great Holy World-Honored One
Normal: Among all the gods and humans,
Normal: In the whole assembly,
Normal: Declares and says:
Normal: "I am the Tathāgata,
Normal: Most honored among two-legged beings.
Normal: I appear in the world
Normal: Like a great cloud
Normal: Giving moisture to all
Normal: The dried-up living beings,
Normal: Making them all leave suffering behind
Normal: And find peace and joy and happiness -
Normal: The happiness of this world
Normal: And the happiness of nirvāṇa.
Normal: "You gods and humans,
Normal: Listen with one mind!
Normal: Come here, all of you,
Normal: To see the Unsurpassed Honored One.
Normal: "I am the World-Honored One -
Normal: Ain't nobody can compare.
Normal: To give peace to living beings,
Normal: That's why I appear in the world.
Normal: "I teach the assembly
Normal: The pure Dharma like sweet dew.
Normal: That Dharma is one flavor:
Normal: Liberation and nirvāṇa.
Normal: "With one wonderful sound
Normal: I explain this meaning,
Normal: Always making great causes and conditions
Normal: For the Great Vehicle.
Normal: "I look at everything
Normal: And see it all equal -
Normal: No this and that,
Normal: No love and hate.
Normal: "I got no greed or attachment,
Normal: No limits or obstructions.
Normal: I always teach everybody
Normal: With the same equal teaching.
Normal: "Whether it's one person
Normal: Or a crowd of many,
Normal: It's all the same to me.
Normal: I'm always teaching the Dharma -
Normal: "Never doing nothing else.
Normal: Coming, going, sitting, standing,
Normal: I never get tired.
Normal: I fill up the world
Normal: "Like rain soaking everything.
Normal: High-class and low-class,
Normal: Those who keep the precepts and those who break them,
Normal: Those with perfect dignity and those without,
Normal: "Right views and wrong views,
Normal: Sharp faculties and dull faculties -
Normal: I rain the Dharma rain on all of them equally,
Normal: Never getting tired or lazy.
Normal: "All living beings
Normal: Who hear my teaching
Normal: Receive it according to their power
Normal: And dwell in various stations.
Normal: "Some dwelling among humans and gods,
Normal: Wheel-turning sage kings,
Normal: Kings like Śakra and Brahmā -
Normal: These are the small medicinal herbs.
Normal: "Those who know the undefiled Dharma,
Normal: Who can attain nirvāṇa,
Normal: Who raise up the six spiritual powers
Normal: And attain the three clear knowledges,
Normal: "Who dwell alone in mountain forests,
Normal: Always practicing meditation and stillness,
Normal: Who attain the realization of the Pratyekabuddha -
Normal: These are the medium medicinal herbs.
Normal: "Those who seek the World-Honored One's station,
Normal: Saying 'I will become Buddha,'
Normal: Who practice with diligence and concentration -
Normal: These are the superior medicinal herbs.
Normal: "And the Buddha's children
Normal: Who give their whole mind to the Buddha's path,
Normal: Always practicing kindness and compassion,
Normal: Knowing they themselves will become buddhas,
Normal: "Certain without any doubt -
Normal: These are called small trees.
Normal: Those who abide in spiritual powers,
Normal: Who turn the wheel that don't turn back,
Normal: "Who save countless hundreds of thousands
Normal: Of millions of living beings -
Normal: Bodhisattvas like this
Normal: Are called great trees.
Normal: "The Buddha's equal teaching
Normal: Is like that one-flavor rain,
Normal: But according to beings' natures,
Normal: What they receive is different -
Normal: "Just like them grasses and trees,
Normal: Each takes in different amounts.
Normal: The Buddha uses this parable
Normal: As skillful means to reveal and show,
Normal: "Using all kinds of words
Normal: To teach the one Dharma.
Normal: In relation to the Buddha's wisdom,
Normal: It's like one drop from the ocean.
Normal: "I rain the Dharma rain,
Normal: Filling up the whole world.
Normal: This one-flavor Dharma -
Normal: People practice it according to their power,
Normal: "Just like them forests,
Normal: Medicinal herbs and trees,
Normal: According to their size,
Normal: Gradually growing more and more lush.
Normal: "The buddhas' Dharma
Normal: Is always this one flavor,
Normal: Making all the worlds
Normal: Reach complete fulfillment.
Normal: "Through gradual practice,
Normal: All attain the fruit of the path.
Normal: The śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas
Normal: Dwelling in mountain forests,
Normal: "Living in their final bodies,
Normal: Hearing the Dharma and attaining the fruit -
Normal: These are called medicinal herbs,
Normal: Each getting its increase.
Normal: "If there are bodhisattvas
Normal: Whose wisdom is firm and solid,
Normal: Who understand the three realms completely
Normal: And seek the supreme vehicle -
Normal: "These are called small trees,
Normal: Getting their increase.
Normal: Then there are those who dwell in meditation,
Normal: Who attain spiritual powers,
Normal: "Who hear about the emptiness of all dharmas
Normal: And their hearts are filled with great joy,
Normal: Who emit countless lights
Normal: And save many living beings -
Normal: "These are called great trees,
Normal: Getting their increase.
Normal: Like this, Kāśyapa,
Normal: The Dharma the Buddha teaches
Normal: "Is like that great cloud
Normal: With its one-flavor rain
Normal: Moistening human flowers,
Normal: Each bearing its fruit.
Normal: "Kāśyapa, you should know:
Normal: Using all kinds of causes and conditions,
Normal: All kinds of parables,
Normal: I reveal and show the Buddha's path.
Normal: "This is my skillful means.
Normal: All buddhas are like this too.
Normal: Now for you all
Normal: I'm telling the most real thing:
Normal: "All you in the śrāvaka assembly -
Normal: You ain't reached extinction yet.
Normal: What you're practicing right now,
Normal: That's the bodhisattva path.
Normal: "If you gradually study and learn,
Normal: You all will become buddhas."
Normal: END OF CHAPTER FIVE: THE PARABLE OF THE MEDICINAL HERBS
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This interpretation renders Chapter 5 (藥草喻品) into blues vernacular, maintaining the core teaching while making it accessible through everyday language and imagery familiar to the African American oral tradition.
Normal: Key Metaphors:
Normal: THE RAIN = The Buddha's teaching, falling equally on everyone
Normal: THE PLANTS = Living beings with different capacities (small herbs, medium herbs, large herbs, small trees, great trees)
Normal: ONE FLAVOR = The single truth of liberation taught in many ways
Normal: THE GROWTH = Each being's progress according to their nature and capacity
Normal: The Five Types of Plants:
Normal: Small medicinal herbs
Normal: (小藥草) = Humans, gods, worldly kings - those seeking worldly happiness
Normal: Medium medicinal herbs
Normal: (中藥草) = Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas seeking personal liberation
Normal: Superior medicinal herbs
Normal: (上藥草) = Beginning bodhisattvas aspiring to buddhahood
Normal: Small trees
Normal: (小樹) = Established bodhisattvas certain of their future buddhahood
Normal: Great trees
Normal: (大樹) = Advanced bodhisattvas with spiritual powers saving countless beings
Normal: Core Teaching:
Normal: This parable addresses the paradox at the heart of the Lotus Sutra: How can there be "one vehicle" when beings seem to attain different results? The answer: The teaching is one (like one rain), but beings receive it according to their capacity (like different plants). The rain doesn't discriminate - the plants take what they can hold. Similarly, the Buddha teaches the one Dharma of liberation, but beings understand and practice at different levels.
Normal: The blues vernacular makes this democratic vision concrete: like rain falling on rich and poor alike, like grace that doesn't pick favorites, the Buddha's teaching is available to everyone. What you receive depends on what you can hold, what you're ready for - but the offering is universal and impartial.
Normal: The final revelation is crucial: Even the śrāvakas who think they've reached final nirvāṇa are actually on the bodhisattva path - they just don't know it yet. They're still growing. The rain is still falling. The journey continues.
Heading 1: CHAPTER SIX: THE NAMING
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: WHEN THE TEACHER CALLS OUT WHO YOU'RE GONNA BE
Normal: Now when the World-Honored One finished singing that verse, he turned to all the folks gathered round and he said it loud and clear:
Normal: "I got something to tell you about this disciple of mine, Mahākāśyapa. I see him. I see who he's gonna be. In the world that's coming, he gonna meet three hundred million billion Buddhas. Three hundred million billion! He gonna serve them, honor them, respect them, praise them. He gonna spread the boundless teaching far and wide. And then—you hear me now—in his very last body, he gonna become a Buddha himself.
Normal: "His name gonna be Light Brightness Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed Guide, the Tamer of Hearts, the Teacher of Gods and Human Folk, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.
Normal: "His world gonna be called Light and Virtue. The age gonna be called Great Majesty. That Buddha gonna live twelve small ages. The true Dharma gonna stand for twenty small ages, and the reflected Dharma gonna stand another twenty.
Normal: "And let me tell you about that land: It gonna be beautiful. No filth, no rubble, no thorns, no waste. That ground gonna be level—no hills, no valleys, no pits, no bumps. The ground gonna be made of lapis lazuli, and treasure trees gonna stand in rows. Golden ropes gonna mark the boundaries of the roads, and precious flowers gonna be scattered everywhere. That whole land gonna be clean, clean, clean.
Normal: "In that country, there gonna be countless thousands of billions of bodhisattvas. The voice-hearers gonna be beyond counting too. There won't be no trouble from demons—though demons and demon-folk will be there, they all gonna protect the Buddha's teaching."
Normal: I'm telling you monks here,
Normal: I'm telling you what I see with my Buddha-eye—
Normal: I see Kassapa clear,
Normal: I see where he's going by and by.
Normal: After ages beyond counting,
Normal: He gonna become a Buddha too.
Normal: In the world that's coming,
Normal: He gonna serve and honor what's true—
Normal: Three hundred million billion Buddhas,
Normal: World-Honored Ones every one.
Normal: For the sake of Buddha-wisdom,
Normal: That pure holy life gonna be done.
Normal: After serving the highest,
Normal: The Two-Footed Honored Ones,
Normal: After learning all wisdom,
Normal: The unsurpassed wisdom that comes—
Normal: In his very last body,
Normal: He gonna become a Buddha at last.
Normal: That land gonna be pure and holy,
Normal: Lapis lazuli ground stretched vast.
Normal: Many treasure trees standing,
Normal: All lined up along the road,
Normal: Golden ropes dividing,
Normal: Joy in everyone who beholds.
Normal: Sweet fragrance always rising,
Normal: Flowers of every name scattered round,
Normal: All manner of wonders surprising,
Normal: Making that whole land renowned.
Normal: That ground gonna be level,
Normal: No hills and no pits to see.
Normal: Bodhisattvas beyond measure,
Normal: More than you could count, more than could be—
Normal: Their hearts gonna be gentle,
Normal: They gonna have mighty spiritual power,
Normal: Holding to the Buddha-teaching central,
Normal: The Great Vehicle every hour.
Normal: Voice-hearers beyond counting,
Normal: In their final flawless frame,
Normal: Sons and daughters of the Dharma-King mounting,
Normal: More than you could name—
Normal: Even with the eye of heaven
Normal: You couldn't count them all.
Normal: That Buddha gonna live eleven,
Normal: Twelve small ages standing tall.
Normal: The true Dharma gonna last
Normal: Twenty small ages true,
Normal: The reflected Dharma past
Normal: Twenty small ages too.
Normal: Light Brightness, World-Honored One—
Normal: This is how it's gonna be done.
Normal: Now at that time, Mahāmaudgalyāyana and Subhūti and Mahākātyāyana, they all started trembling. They put their palms together and they looked up at the Honored One's face and they couldn't take their eyes away. And together, with one voice, they sang out in verse:
Normal: Great Hero, World-Honored One,
Normal: Dharma-King of all Śākya's line,
Normal: Have mercy on us, every one,
Normal: And give us that Buddha-voice divine.
Normal: If you know what's in our deep heart,
Normal: If you see us and call our name,
Normal: It'll be like cool water when the heat departs,
Normal: Like sweet dew putting out the flame.
Normal: Like a man from a hungry land
Normal: Who suddenly sees a royal feast—
Normal: His heart still scared to understand,
Normal: Still afraid, to say the least.
Normal: He don't dare just eat right away,
Normal: Not till the king himself says "Come."
Normal: Then and only then, that day,
Normal: He knows it's safe and he ain't dumb.
Normal: We're just like that, you know—
Normal: We been thinking about our small-vehicle mistake.
Normal: We don't know how we gonna go
Normal: And get that Buddha-wisdom for wisdom's sake.
Normal: We heard you say with your Buddha-voice
Normal: That we all gonna become Buddhas too,
Normal: But our hearts still scared to rejoice,
Normal: Still afraid it ain't really true.
Normal: But if you name us, if you call our name,
Normal: If you give us that prophecy—
Normal: Then we gonna be happy, and ain't no shame,
Normal: Then we gonna rest easy.
Normal: Great Hero, World-Honored One,
Normal: You always trying to give the world peace—
Normal: Please give us that naming, every one,
Normal: Like a hungry man needs to feast.
Normal: Now the World-Honored One, he knew what was in his great disciples' hearts, and he turned to all the monks and said:
Normal: "This Subhūti here—in the world that's coming, he gonna meet and serve three hundred million billion nayuta Buddhas. He gonna serve them, honor them, respect them, praise them. He gonna practice that pure holy life always. He gonna complete the bodhisattva way. And then in his very last body, he gonna become a Buddha.
Normal: "His name gonna be Fame Mark Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed Guide, the Tamer of Hearts, the Teacher of Gods and Human Folk, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.
Normal: "The age gonna be called Having Treasure. The world gonna be called Treasure Born.
Normal: "That land gonna be level, with crystal for the ground. Treasure trees gonna make it beautiful. No hills, no pits, no sand, no gravel, no thorns, no filth. Precious flowers gonna cover the ground, clean all over. The people of that land gonna live in jeweled pavilions, in wonderful towers and terraces.
Normal: "The voice-hearer disciples gonna be beyond measure, beyond counting—you couldn't calculate them with numbers or comparisons. The bodhisattvas gonna number in the countless thousands of millions of billions of nayutas.
Normal: "That Buddha gonna live twelve small ages. The true Dharma gonna stand twenty small ages, and the reflected Dharma gonna stand another twenty.
Normal: "That Buddha gonna dwell always in emptiness, teaching the Dharma to the assembly, liberating countless bodhisattvas and voice-hearers."
Normal: You monks gathered here,
Normal: I'm telling you now,
Normal: Listen with your whole heart clear,
Normal: Hear what I'm gonna avow.
Normal: My great disciple here,
Normal: Subhūti, this one—
Normal: He gonna become a Buddha, it's clear,
Normal: His name gonna be Fame Mark, the Honored One.
Normal: He gonna serve countless,
Normal: Millions and billions of Buddhas every one,
Normal: Following where each Buddha goes,
Normal: Step by step till the great way is done.
Normal: In his very last body earned,
Normal: The thirty-two marks gonna be his,
Normal: Handsome and beautiful, we learned,

Normal: The purest and the best,
Normal: And everyone who comes to see
Normal: Gonna love it, gonna be blessed.
Normal: That Buddha in the middle there
Normal: Gonna liberate countless souls.
Normal: In that Buddha's teaching, everywhere,
Normal: Many bodhisattvas gonna fill the roles—
Normal: All of them sharp and keen,

Normal: That country always gonna be seen
Normal: Full of bodhisattvas, nothing lack.

Normal: Listening to the Buddha's word firsthand.
Normal: That Buddha gonna live, we're told,
Normal: Twelve small ages long.
Normal: True Dharma twenty ages old,
Normal: Reflected Dharma twenty ages strong.
Normal: Then the World-Honored One turned again to the assembly and said:
Normal: "Now I'm telling you about this Great Kātyāyana here. In the world that's coming, he gonna serve and honor eight thousand billion Buddhas with all manner of offerings. He gonna respect them, revere them.
Normal: "After each of those Buddhas passes on, he gonna build them a stupa—a thousand yojanas high, five hundred yojanas wide and deep, all perfectly square. He gonna make them out of gold and silver and lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl and agate and pearl and rose quartz—all seven precious things combined. He gonna offer to those stupas flowers and garlands, ointments and incense powders and burning incense, silk canopies and banners.
Normal: "After that's done, he gonna serve another twenty million billion Buddhas, just the same way.
Normal: "After serving all those Buddhas, after completing the bodhisattva way, he gonna become a Buddha himself.
Normal: "His name gonna be Jambū River Gold Light Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed Guide, the Tamer of Hearts, the Teacher of Gods and Human Folk, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.
Normal: "That land gonna be level, with crystal for the ground. Treasure trees gonna make it beautiful. Golden ropes gonna mark the roads. Wonderful flowers gonna cover the ground, clean all over, and everyone who sees it gonna rejoice.
Normal: "There won't be no four evil paths there—no hell, no hungry ghosts, no animals, no fighting demons. There gonna be many gods and many human folk, many voice-hearers and many bodhisattvas—countless millions and billions beautifying that land.
Normal: "That Buddha gonna live twelve small ages. The true Dharma gonna stand twenty small ages, and the reflected Dharma gonna stand another twenty."
Normal: All you monks here,
Normal: Listen with one heart,
Normal: What I'm saying is true and clear,
Normal: Ain't no false part.
Normal: This Kātyāyana here,
Normal: He gonna serve with all kinds of
Normal: Beautiful offerings sincere
Normal: All the Buddhas above.
Normal: After those Buddhas gone,
Normal: He gonna raise up seven-jeweled towers,
Normal: He gonna offer flowers and incense on
Normal: Those relics for hours and hours.
Normal: In his very last frame,
Normal: He gonna gain the Buddha-wisdom complete,
Normal: The perfect awakening by name.
Normal: That land gonna be pure and sweet,
Normal: Liberating countless souls,

Normal: Bodhisattvas and voice-hearers there,
Normal: All existence cut through and done—

Normal: "After each of those Buddhas passes on, he gonna build them a stupa—a thousand yojanas high, five hundred yojanas wide and deep, all perfectly square.

He gonna offer to those stupas flowers and garlands, ointments and incense powders and burning incense, silk canopies and banners.
Normal: "After that's done, he gonna serve another two hundred million billion Buddhas, just the same way.
Normal: "Then he gonna become a Buddha himself.
Normal: "His name gonna be Tamāla Sandalwood Fragrance Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed Guide, the Tamer of Hearts, the Teacher of Gods and Human Folk, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.
Normal: "The age gonna be called Joy Fulfilled. The world gonna be called Delightful.
Normal: "That land gonna be level, with crystal for the ground. Treasure trees gonna make it beautiful. Pearls gonna be scattered like flowers, clean all over, and everyone who sees it gonna rejoice.
Normal: "There gonna be many gods and many human folk, many bodhisattvas and many voice-hearers, beyond all counting.
Normal: "That Buddha gonna live twenty-four small ages. The true Dharma gonna stand forty small ages, and the reflected Dharma gonna stand another forty."
Normal: This disciple of mine here,
Normal: Great Maudgalyāyana by name—
Normal: When he sheds this body, it's clear,
Normal: He gonna see eighty-two hundred million
Normal: Buddhas, World-Honored Ones.

Normal: We got causes from way back when,
Normal: From ancient lifetimes, you and me.
Normal: What I'm about to tell you then,
Normal: You listen good, you gonna see.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER SIX: THE NAMING
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter is all about being seen and being named—one of the most powerful acts in any tradition. The Buddha is saying: "I see you. I know who you are. And I'm gonna tell you who you're going to become."
Normal: Key Metaphors and Choices:
Normal: "The Naming" as the chapter title
Normal: - In blues and gospel traditions, naming carries profound power. To be named is to be called into existence, to have your destiny spoken aloud. The Buddha isn't just predicting; he's recognizing and affirming who these disciples already are and will be.
Normal: "I see him clear, I see where he's going by and by"
Normal: - The blues has always been about seeing clearly, about truth-telling. The Buddha's vision isn't mystical abstraction; it's recognition, the way a master bluesman sees the music in a young player.
Normal: The disciples' request: "Like a hungry man needs to feast"
Normal: - They use this metaphor themselves in the Chinese text. The hunger for recognition, for validation, for being seen—this is human hunger at its deepest. They're saying: "We heard you say it, but we're still scared to believe it. We need you to say our names."
Normal: Each prophecy's details matter
Normal: - The specifics aren't filler. Each Buddha-name, each world-name, each measurement tells these disciples: "This is real. This is particular. This is YOUR future, not just anybody's." That's why I kept the details—the twelve ages, the twenty ages, the crystal ground, the jeweled towers. Particularity is how love speaks.
Normal: "In his very last body"
Normal: - This phrase recurs like a refrain, like the turn in a blues verse. It marks the culmination, the arrival, the moment when all that walking finally gets you home.
Normal: The Buddha's epithets
Normal: - I kept the full tenfold list for each Buddha-to-be because in oral tradition, repetition isn't redundancy—it's respect, it's rhythm, it's the way you mark something sacred.
Heading 1: CHAPTER SEVEN: THE PHANTOM CITY BLUES
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE STORY OF TIME SO DEEP YOU CAN'T EVEN COUNT IT
Normal: Now the Buddha, he gathered them monks around him and said:
Normal: "Listen here, brothers and sisters. I'm gonna tell you about something that happened so far back, so long ago, that your mind can't even stretch that far. We talking about time past counting, time past measuring, time past imagining—we talking about uncountable cosmic ages ago.
Normal: Back in that time, there was a Buddha. His name was Great Universal Wisdom Excellence—that's what they called him: the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed One, the Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. His country was called Good City, and that cosmic age was called Great Mark.
Normal: Now brothers and sisters, listen up. That Buddha passed on into final rest so long ago, the time's so vast you can't wrap your head around it. Let me paint you a picture:
Normal: Imagine you took all the earth in three thousand great thousand-fold worlds—every bit of dirt, every grain of sand, every rock and stone—and you ground it all down into ink, finest ink you ever saw. Then you start walking east, and after you pass a thousand worlds, you put down one tiny drop, small as a speck of dust. Then you walk another thousand worlds, and you put down another tiny drop. And you keep on doing this, walking and dropping, walking and dropping, until all that ink is gone, every last bit used up.
Normal: Now tell me—could any mathematician, any accountant, any number-cruncher or their best student—could they count up all them worlds you passed through, both the ones where you dropped ink and the ones you didn't? Could they reach the edge of that number and tell you what it is?"
Normal: "No, World-Honored One," they said. "They couldn't do it."
Normal: "Brothers," the Buddha said, "take all them worlds that man passed through—the ones with ink drops and the ones without—and grind them all down into dust. Every single speck of dust, that's one cosmic age. The time since that Buddha Great Universal Wisdom Excellence passed into final rest is even longer than that—we talking countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of uncountable ages beyond even that number.
Normal: But I'm telling you true: with the power of the Tathāgata's knowing and seeing, when I look back at that distant time, it's clear as yesterday. I can see it like it's happening right now."
Normal: I remember way back in the past,
Normal: Countless ages, time so vast,
Normal: There was a Buddha, honored and true,
Normal: Named Great Universal Wisdom Excellence, through and through.
Normal: Like someone grinding with all their might,
Normal: Three thousand great thousand worlds to dust so light,
Normal: Taking all that earth and making it ink,
Normal: More than you could count or even think.
Normal: Passing through a thousand worlds, you go,
Normal: Drop one speck of dust, let it show,
Normal: Keep on moving, dropping as you roam,
Normal: Till all that dust-ink finds a home.
Normal: All them worlds where you dropped or not,
Normal: Grind them down, every single spot,
Normal: Turn it all to dust, don't miss a grain—
Normal: Each dust speck equals one age's span, I'm saying plain.
Normal: These countless specks of dust you see,
Normal: The ages since that Buddha passed are even more than these.
Normal: That Buddha's been gone, entered into rest,
Normal: For unmeasured ages, I attest.
Normal: The Tathāgata's wisdom, clear and bright,
Normal: Knows when that Buddha passed from sight,
Normal: Knows his disciples, the hearers and bodhisattvas too,
Normal: Sees them clear as today's morning dew.
Normal: You monks should know and understand,
Normal: The Buddha's wisdom is pure and grand,
Normal: Without outflows, without any wall,
Normal: It penetrates through ages, encompasses all.
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA WHO SAT STILL FOR TEN SMALL AGES
Normal: The Buddha told them monks:
Normal: "This Buddha called Great Universal Wisdom Excellence, he lived for five hundred forty million billion nayuta ages. Now when he first sat down at the place of enlightenment and broke through the demon armies—when he was right there on the verge of getting that supreme perfect enlightenment—the Buddha-truths still wouldn't show themselves to him. They just wouldn't appear.
Normal: He sat there like that for one small age. Then ten small ages. Sitting cross-legged, body still, mind still, not moving at all. And still them Buddha-truths wouldn't come into view."
Heading 2: THE HEAVENLY KINGS PREPARE THE THRONE
Normal: "Now the gods from the Thirty-Three Heavens, they had already prepared for this Buddha. Under that bodhi tree, they laid out a lion throne, high as a mile up in the air. The Buddha was meant to sit on that throne and attain supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: Soon as he sat down on that seat, all the Brahma kings rained down heavenly flowers—flowers falling like rain across a hundred miles. A fragrant wind would come and blow away the wilted flowers, and fresh new ones would rain down to take their place. This went on without stopping for ten small ages, making offerings to that Buddha—kept going like that right up till he passed away, always raining them flowers.
Normal: The Four Heavenly Kings and their gods, they struck the heavenly drums to make offerings to the Buddha. The other gods played heavenly music. For ten full small ages they kept it up, right until he passed into final rest—even then, they kept on playing."
Heading 2: THE SIXTEEN PRINCES COME TO SEE THEIR FATHER THE BUDDHA
Normal: "Brothers," the Buddha said, "after ten small ages passed, the Buddha-truths finally appeared before Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha, and he achieved that supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: Now before he left home, that Buddha had sixteen sons. The first one was named Wisdom Accumulation. Each of them sons had all kinds of precious toys and treasures they loved to play with. But when they heard their father had achieved that supreme perfect enlightenment, they let go of all them precious things and went to where the Buddha was. Their mothers cried tears and followed along behind them.
Normal: Their grandfather was a wheel-turning holy king. He came with a hundred great ministers and hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of other people, all surrounding them, following them to the place of enlightenment. They all wanted to get close to Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Tathāgata, to make offerings, to show respect, to honor and praise him.
Normal: When they arrived, they bowed their heads to his feet, walked around him in respect, then put their palms together and gazed up at the World-Honored One. They sang their praise in verse:
Normal: Great World-Honored One of mighty virtue and power,
Normal: You worked to free all beings hour by hour,
Normal: Through countless hundreds of millions of ages long,
Normal: Finally became a Buddha, righteous and strong.
Normal: All your vows are now complete and whole,
Normal: Good fortune! Most excellent goal!
Normal: World-Honored One, so rare to see,
Normal: You sat for ten small ages patiently.
Normal: Your body, hands, and feet so still,
Normal: Quiet, peaceful, holding to your will,
Normal: Your mind calm and serene always,
Normal: Never once scattered in any ways.
Normal: Ultimately reaching final silence and peace,
Normal: Dwelling firm where outflows cease.
Normal: Now we see the World-Honored One
Normal: Safe and stable, the Buddha-work done.
Normal: We receive this good fortune today,
Normal: Celebrate with joy, come what may!
Normal: But living beings suffer constant pain,
Normal: Blind and lost without a guide to explain.
Normal: They don't know the path where suffering ends,
Normal: Don't know how to seek freedom, my friends.
Normal: Long dark night makes evil paths increase,
Normal: While heavenly beings decrease and decrease.
Normal: From darkness into darkness they go,
Normal: Never hearing the Buddha's name, don't you know.
Normal: Now the Buddha's got that highest way,
Normal: Safe and stable, where outflows hold no sway.
Normal: We along with gods and human folk
Normal: Receive the greatest benefit, ain't no joke!
Normal: That's why we bow our heads down low,
Normal: Take refuge in the Highest One we know."
Heading 2: THE SIXTEEN PRINCES REQUEST THE DHARMA WHEEL
Normal: Then them sixteen princes, after they finished singing the Buddha's praise, urged the World-Honored One to turn the Dharma wheel. They all said together:
Normal: "World-Honored One, please speak the Dharma! You'll bring safety and peace, compassion and benefit to all the gods and human beings!"
Normal: Then they spoke it again in verse:
Normal: O World Hero, ain't nobody like you,
Normal: Adorned with a hundred blessings, through and through,
Normal: You got that supreme wisdom, yes you do—
Normal: Please speak it out for all the world to view!
Normal: Free us and all the living beings too,
Normal: Show us clear, distinguish what is true,
Normal: Help us gain this wisdom like you got,
Normal: So we can follow in your footsteps, hit that spot.
Normal: If we become Buddhas one day soon,
Normal: All beings can too, under the same moon.
Normal: World-Honored One, you know what's deep inside,
Normal: What beings are thinking, what they try to hide.
Normal: You know the path that each one walks,
Normal: You know their wisdom-power when anybody talks,
Normal: Their desires, their joys, the good they cultivate,
Normal: The karma from past lives that shapes their fate.
Normal: World-Honored One, you know it all complete—
Normal: Now turn that supreme wheel, don't miss a beat!
Heading 2: WHEN THE BUDDHA ACHIEVED ENLIGHTENMENT, THE WHOLE UNIVERSE SHOOK
Normal: The Buddha told them monks:
Normal: "When Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha attained that supreme perfect enlightenment, in each of the ten directions, five hundred million billion buddha-worlds shook in six different ways. Even them dark places between the worlds—places so dark that the sun and moon with all their power can't light them up—even them places became bright and clear.
Normal: The beings living in them dark places could suddenly see each other. They said to each other, 'How come all these beings suddenly appeared here?'
Normal: And in all them worlds, the palaces of the gods, right up to the Brahma palaces, they all shook in six ways, and a great light shined everywhere, filling all the worlds, brighter than any heavenly light."
Heading 2: THE BRAHMA KINGS FROM THE EAST SEE THE LIGHT
Normal: Then in the eastern direction, in five hundred million billion countries, the palaces of the Brahma kings lit up with a brightness twice as bright as usual. Each of them Brahma kings thought to themselves:
Normal: "My palace is glowing with light like never before. What's causing this? Why is this happening?"
Normal: So them Brahma kings went to visit each other to talk it over. In that group, there was one great Brahma king named Save Everyone. He spoke to all the Brahma beings in verse:
Normal: Our palaces are glowing bright,
Normal: This light we never seen before tonight.
Normal: What's the reason for this sign?
Normal: Let's search together, yours and mine.
Normal: Could a god of great virtue just been born?
Normal: Or has a Buddha come to grace the morn?
Normal: This great light shining far and wide
Normal: Illuminates the ten directions on every side.
Normal: Then them five hundred million billion Brahma kings from all them countries, they came together with their palaces, carrying heavenly flowers wrapped in their robes, and traveled west to track down the source of this sign.
Normal: They saw Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Tathāgata sitting there at the place of enlightenment under the bodhi tree, seated on the lion throne, with all the gods, dragon kings, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans surrounding him respectfully. And they saw them sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel.
Normal: Right then, them Brahma kings bowed down, touching their heads to the Buddha's feet, walked around him hundreds of thousands of times, then scattered heavenly flowers on the Buddha. The flowers they scattered piled up like Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi tree—that tree was ten miles high. After making flower offerings, each one presented their palace to the Buddha, saying:
Normal: "Please have compassion on us and benefit us. We offer these palaces—we hope you'll accept them."
Normal: Then them Brahma kings, right there in front of the Buddha, spoke together with one voice in verse:
Normal: World-Honored One, so rare and precious,
Normal: Hard to encounter, truly precious,
Normal: Endowed with countless virtues, it's true,
Normal: Able to rescue and protect everyone through and through.
Normal: Great Teacher of gods and humans, we say,
Normal: Have compassion on this world today.
Normal: Beings in the ten directions, one and all,
Normal: Receive your abundant grace, we call.
Normal: We came from five hundred million billion lands,
Normal: Left deep meditation joy to make our stands,
Normal: Came here to make offerings to the Buddha, you see,
Normal: Left that peaceful bliss to honor thee.
Normal: Our palaces from merit we earned before,
Normal: Decorated and adorned, we couldn't ask for more.
Normal: Now we offer them to the World-Honored One—
Normal: Please accept them with compassion when all is done.
Normal: Then them Brahma kings, after singing the Buddha's praise, each said:
Normal: "We only hope the World-Honored One will turn the Dharma wheel, free living beings, and open up the road to nirvāṇa!"
Normal: Then them Brahma kings spoke together with one voice in verse:
Normal: World Hero, Most Honored of Two-Legged Ones,
Normal: Please speak the Dharma before this day is done!
Normal: With your great compassion and mighty power so strong,
Normal: Free suffering beings from this world of wrong!
Normal: Then Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Tathāgata—he just nodded silently, saying yes.
Heading 2: THE BRAHMA KINGS FROM THE OTHER NINE DIRECTIONS
Normal: "And brothers," the Buddha continued, "from the southeast direction, five hundred million billion countries—the great Brahma kings in all them places saw their palaces glowing with light like never before. They got happy, started jumping for joy, filled with wonder. They went to visit each other to discuss what this meant.
Normal: In that group, there was one great Brahma king named Great Compassion. He spoke to all them Brahma beings in verse:
Normal: What's the reason for this thing,
Normal: Why this sign appearing?
Normal: Our palaces glowing bright,
Normal: Light we never seen before tonight.
Normal: Could a god of great virtue just been born?
Normal: Or has a Buddha come to grace the morn?
Normal: Never seen this sign before—
Normal: Let's search with one mind, that's for sure.
Normal: We'll pass through thousands of millions of billions of lands,
Normal: Following the light with searching hands.
Normal: Most likely a Buddha has appeared in the world,
Normal: Come to free suffering beings, the truth unfurled.
Normal: Then them five hundred million billion Brahma kings, with their palaces, carrying heavenly flowers wrapped in their robes, traveled together to the northwest to track down this sign. They saw Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Tathāgata sitting at the place of enlightenment under the bodhi tree, seated on the lion throne, surrounded respectfully by gods, dragon kings, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans. And they saw them sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel.
Normal: Then them Brahma kings bowed their heads to the Buddha's feet, walked around him hundreds of thousands of times, and scattered heavenly flowers on him. The flowers they scattered piled up like Mount Sumeru, and they made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi tree. After the flower offerings, each presented their palace to the Buddha, saying:
Normal: "Please have compassion and benefit us. We offer these palaces—we hope you'll accept them."
Normal: Then them Brahma kings, right there in front of the Buddha, spoke together with one voice in verse:
Normal: Holy Master, King Among the Heavenly Ones,
Normal: Your voice like the kalavinka bird's beautiful runs,
Normal: Have compassion on all beings today,
Normal: We bow down to honor you, we pray.
Normal: World-Honored One, so rare to find,
Normal: Only appears once in a long, long time.
Normal: Through a hundred eighty ages gone by,
Normal: Empty—no Buddha in the sky.
Normal: The three evil paths are overflowing and full,
Normal: While heavenly beings diminish and dull.
Normal: Now a Buddha's appeared in this world today,
Normal: Becoming the eye for beings to see the way.
Normal: The world's place of refuge, where we all run,
Normal: Rescuing and protecting everyone.
Normal: Father of all beings, compassionate one,
Normal: Full of mercy, the blessed One.
Normal: We have this good fortune from way back when,
Normal: Now we get to meet the World-Honored One again!
Normal: Then them Brahma kings, after singing the Buddha's praise, each said:
Normal: "We only hope the World-Honored One will have compassion on everyone and turn the Dharma wheel to free all beings."
Normal: Then them Brahma kings spoke together with one voice in verse:
Normal: Great Holy One, turn the Dharma wheel today,
Normal: Reveal how all phenomena work and play,
Normal: Free the suffering beings from their pain,
Normal: Let them receive great joy again.
Normal: When beings hear this teaching you bring,
Normal: Some reach the Way, some to heaven they'll spring.
Normal: Evil paths will decrease and fall away,
Normal: While those who bear and practice goodness will increase each day.
Normal: Then Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Tathāgata—he just nodded silently, saying yes.
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA TURNS THE DHARMA WHEEL
Normal: The Buddha continued:
Normal: "Then Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Tathāgata, having received the requests from the Brahma kings of the ten directions and from them sixteen princes—right then and there, he turned the Dharma wheel three times with twelve aspects.
Normal: This is the kind of wheel that no monk or brahmin priest, no god or demon or Brahma being, nobody else in the whole world could turn. He said:
Normal: 'This is suffering.
Normal: This is the arising of suffering.
Normal: This is the cessation of suffering.
Normal: This is the path to the cessation of suffering.'
Normal: And he spoke extensively about the twelve-linked chain of dependent origination:
Normal: Ignorance causes karmic formations.
Normal: Karmic formations cause consciousness.
Normal: Consciousness causes name-and-form.
Normal: Name-and-form causes the six sense bases.
Normal: The six sense bases cause contact.
Normal: Contact causes feeling.
Normal: Feeling causes craving.
Normal: Craving causes grasping.
Normal: Grasping causes becoming.
Normal: Becoming causes birth.
Normal: Birth causes old age, death, sorrow, grief, suffering, and distress.
Normal: And when ignorance ceases, karmic formations cease.
Normal: When karmic formations cease, consciousness ceases.
Normal: When consciousness ceases, name-and-form ceases.
Normal: When name-and-form ceases, the six sense bases cease.
Normal: When the six sense bases cease, contact ceases.
Normal: When contact ceases, feeling ceases.
Normal: When feeling ceases, craving ceases.
Normal: When craving ceases, grasping ceases.
Normal: When grasping ceases, becoming ceases.
Normal: When becoming ceases, birth ceases.
Normal: When birth ceases, old age, death, sorrow, grief, suffering, and distress cease.
Normal: "When the Buddha spoke this teaching before that great assembly of gods and humans, six hundred million billion nayuta people—because they didn't cling to any dharma—their minds were freed from all outflows. They all attained deep and wonderful meditation, the three knowledges, the six spiritual powers, and the eight liberations.
Normal: When he spoke the teaching the second time, the third time, and the fourth time, thousands of millions of billions like the sands of the Ganges River—all them beings also, because they didn't cling to any dharma, got their minds freed from all outflows.
Normal: From then on, the community of hearers was beyond measure, beyond counting—you couldn't figure out how many."
Heading 2: THE SIXTEEN PRINCES BECOME MONKS AND TEACH THE LOTUS SUTRA
Normal: "At that time, them sixteen princes all left home as young boys to become novice monks. They had sharp faculties, bright and clear intelligence. They'd already made offerings to hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas in the past, practicing pure conduct, seeking that supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: Together they said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, all these countless thousands of millions of billions of great and virtuous hearers have already achieved realization. World-Honored One, please teach us too about the Dharma of supreme perfect enlightenment. When we hear it, we'll all practice and study it together. World-Honored One, we aspire to the Tathāgata's knowing and seeing. What's deep in our minds, the Buddha knows it himself.'
Normal: At that time, among the people that the wheel-turning holy king had brought with him, eighty million billion people saw them sixteen princes leave home, and they also asked to leave home. The king gave them permission.
Normal: "After that, the Buddha accepted the request of them novice monks. After twenty thousand ages passed, then before the fourfold assembly, he spoke this Mahayana sutra called the Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Dharma—the Teaching for Bodhisattvas, What the Buddha Protects and Keeps in Mind.
Normal: When he finished speaking this sutra, them sixteen novice monks—for the sake of supreme perfect enlightenment—all received it, upheld it, recited it, and penetrated it completely.
Normal: When this sutra was being taught, them sixteen bodhisattva novice monks all believed and accepted it. Among the hearer community, some also understood with faith. But other beings—thousands of millions of billions of kinds—all gave rise to doubts.
Normal: The Buddha spoke this sutra for eight thousand ages without ever resting. After finishing speaking this sutra, he went into a quiet room and entered deep meditation for eighty-four thousand ages.
Normal: During that time, them sixteen bodhisattva novice monks knew the Buddha had entered his room and was sitting in silent meditation. So each one climbed up on a Dharma seat, and for eighty-four thousand ages, for the fourfold assembly, they extensively explained and analyzed this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra.
Normal: Every single one of them guided six hundred million billion nayuta beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River. They taught them, benefited them, gladdened them, and caused them to develop the mind for supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: "After eighty-four thousand ages, Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha came out of his samādhi. He went to the Dharma seat, sat down peacefully, and announced to the great assembly:
Normal: 'These sixteen bodhisattva novice monks are extremely rare and precious. Their faculties are sharp and clear, their wisdom bright and penetrating. They've already made offerings to countless thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas. In the presence of those Buddhas, they constantly practiced pure conduct, receiving the Buddha's wisdom and opening it up for beings, causing them to enter into it.
Normal: You should all repeatedly draw near to them and make offerings to them. Why? Because if any hearers, solitary realizers, or bodhisattvas can believe the sutra-teaching spoken by these sixteen bodhisattvas, can accept it and not reject it—then every one of them will attain the supreme perfect enlightenment and the Tathāgata's wisdom.'"
Heading 2: THE SIXTEEN PRINCES ARE NOW BUDDHAS IN THE TEN DIRECTIONS
Normal: The Buddha told them monks:
Normal: "These sixteen bodhisattvas constantly delighted in speaking this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra. Each bodhisattva guided six hundred million billion nayuta beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River. Life after life, wherever those beings were born, they were born together with the bodhisattva, heard the teaching from him, and all believed and understood. Through this cause and condition, they encountered four hundred million billion World-Honored Buddhas, and even now it ain't finished.
Normal: Brothers, I'm telling you now: them sixteen novices who were disciples of that Buddha—they've all now attained supreme perfect enlightenment. In the lands of the ten directions, right now they're speaking the Dharma, with countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of bodhisattvas and hearers as their followers.
Normal: Two of them novices are Buddhas in the eastern direction. One is named Akṣobhya, in the Land of Joy. The other is named Sumeru Peak.
Normal: In the southeast direction, there are two Buddhas: one named Lion Sound, one named Lion Mark.
Normal: In the south, there are two Buddhas: one named Dwelling in Empty Space, one named Eternally Extinguished.
Normal: In the southwest, there are two Buddhas: one named Emperor Mark, one named Brahma Mark.
Normal: In the west, there are two Buddhas. One is named Amitabha. The other is named Crossing Through All Worldly Suffering and Distress.
Normal: In the northwest, there are two Buddhas: one named Tamalapattra-Sandalwood-Fragrance Spiritual Powers, one named Sumeru Mark.
Normal: In the north, there are two Buddhas: one named Cloud Freedom, one named Cloud Freedom King.
Normal: In the northeast, there's a Buddha named Destroyer of All Worldly Fear.
Normal: The sixteenth one—that's me, Śākyamuni Buddha, right here in the Saha world, having attained supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: "Brothers, when we were novice monks, each of us taught countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River. They heard the Dharma from us and headed toward supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: Among these beings, some now dwell on the hearer ground. But I'm constantly teaching them about supreme perfect enlightenment. These people, through this Dharma, will gradually enter the Buddha Way. Why? Because the Tathāgata's wisdom is hard to believe, hard to understand.
Normal: Those countless beings like the sands of the Ganges River that we taught back then—that's you monks right here, and after I pass into final rest, the hearer disciples in the future world—that's who they are.
Normal: After I pass away, there will be other disciples who don't hear this sutra, don't know or awaken to what bodhisattvas do. Through the merit they've gained, they'll give rise to the thought of extinction and enter nirvāṇa. I'll be a Buddha in another land with a different name. Even though these people give rise to the thought of extinction and enter nirvāṇa, in that land they'll seek the Buddha's wisdom and get to hear this sutra. It's only through the Buddha Vehicle that they'll reach true extinction—there ain't no other vehicle, except when the Tathāgata uses skillful means to teach.
Heading 2: THE PARABLE OF THE PHANTOM CITY
Normal: "Let me give you an example. Say there's a dangerous and terrible road, five hundred yojanas long, a desolate wilderness with no people, a frightening place. A big group of people wants to cross this road to get to where the treasure is.
Normal: There's a guide—smart, sharp, wise—who knows this dangerous road inside and out, knows where it's passable and where it ain't. He's leading this group of people, trying to get them through this difficult path.
Normal: But the people he's leading get tired and worn out halfway through. They say to the guide: 'We're exhausted, and we're scared too. We can't go any further. The road ahead is still so far. We want to turn back now.'
Normal: Now this guide, he's got all kinds of skillful methods. He thinks to himself: 'What a shame! How can they give up this great treasure and want to turn back?'
Normal: After thinking this, with his skillful power, on that dangerous road, after three hundred yojanas, he conjures up a great city. He tells them people:
Normal: 'Don't be afraid! Don't turn back! Look—here's a big city right here where you can rest. Go in and do whatever you want. Once you enter this city, you'll be comfortable and safe. If you can push on to where the treasure is, you can go there too.'
Normal: Then them tired, exhausted people—their hearts fill up with great joy. They're amazed and say: 'Now we've escaped this terrible road! Now we're comfortable and safe!'
Normal: So all them people go into that magic city. They think they've already crossed over. They think they're safe now.
Normal: Then the guide, knowing these people have rested up and ain't tired anymore, makes that magic city disappear. He tells them:
Normal: 'Come on, let's go. The place where the treasure is—it's close now. That big city back there? I conjured it up just so you could rest.'"
Heading 2: THE MEANING OF THE PARABLE
Normal: "Brothers, the Tathāgata is the same way. Right now I'm the great guide for all of you. I know that the road of birth-and-death and afflictions is dangerous, difficult, and long. You got to get away from it. You got to cross it.
Normal: If beings only heard about the One Buddha Vehicle, they wouldn't want to see the Buddha, wouldn't want to get close to him. They'd think: 'The Buddha Way is long and far. We'd have to undergo suffering for a long, long time before we could achieve it.'
Normal: The Buddha knows this mind is cowardly and inferior. Using skillful means, he teaches two kinds of nirvāṇa as a resting place midway along the road.
Normal: If beings dwell in these two stages, then the Tathāgata tells them: 'What you've done ain't finished yet. This stage where you're dwelling—it's close to the Buddha's wisdom. You should observe and consider: the nirvāṇa you've attained ain't the real thing. It's just the Tathāgata's skillful means. Within the One Buddha Vehicle, I've made distinctions and spoken of three.'
Normal: It's like that guide who, for the sake of resting, conjured up a great city. Once he knew they'd rested up, he told them: 'The treasure place is close. This city ain't real. I just conjured it up.'"
Normal: Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha—
Normal: Ten small ages sitting at the place of the Way,
Normal: Buddha-truths wouldn't appear before him,
Normal: Couldn't complete the Buddha Way that day.
Normal: The gods, spirit-dragons, and kings,
Normal: Asuras and all their company,
Normal: Constantly rained down heavenly flowers,
Normal: Making offerings to that Buddha, you see.
Normal: The gods struck their heavenly drums,
Normal: And played all kinds of heavenly music too,
Normal: Fragrant winds blew the wilted flowers away,
Normal: And rained down fresh beautiful ones, brand new.
Normal: After ten small ages passed on by,
Normal: Then he finally achieved the Buddha Way.
Normal: Gods and humans, their hearts all leaped for joy,
Normal: Filled with happiness that glorious day.
Normal: That Buddha's sixteen sons—
Normal: Each one with their whole family tree,
Normal: Thousands of millions of billions surrounding them,
Normal: All went together to where that Buddha would be.
Normal: They bowed their heads, touching his feet,
Normal: Requested him to turn the Dharma wheel, please do.
Normal: "Holy teacher's rain of Dharma, let it fall,
Normal: Fill us up and all beings too!"
Normal: World-Honored One is so hard to meet,
Normal: Only appears once in the longest, longest while.
Normal: To awaken all the living beings,
Normal: He shakes up everything for miles and miles.
Normal: In the eastern direction's many worlds—
Normal: Five hundred million billion lands—
Normal: The Brahma palaces lit up with light,
Normal: Brighter than they'd ever seen in all them strands.
Normal: When the Brahmas saw this sign,
Normal: They came searching to find the Buddha's place,
Normal: Scattered flowers to make offerings,
Normal: Offered up their palaces with grace.
Normal: They requested the Buddha to turn the wheel,
Normal: Sang his praises in verses fine.
Normal: The Buddha knew the time wasn't right yet,
Normal: So he just sat there, accepting, giving them a sign.
Normal: From three directions and four corners too,
Normal: From up above and down below, just the same—
Normal: Scattering flowers, offering palaces,
Normal: Requesting the Buddha to turn the wheel, speaking his name.
Normal: "World-Honored One, so hard to meet!
Normal: Please, with your great compassion today,
Normal: Open wide the gate of immortal nectar,
Normal: Turn the supreme Dharma wheel, show us the way!"
Normal: That World-Honored One of boundless wisdom,
Normal: He accepted what all them people requested.
Normal: He proclaimed all kinds of teachings for them—
Normal: The Four Noble Truths, the twelve-linked chain he manifested.
Normal: From ignorance all the way to old age and death—
Normal: It all comes from birth, from being born at all.
Normal: All these faults and troubles,
Normal: Y'all should understand them, big and small.
Normal: When he proclaimed this teaching,
Normal: Six hundred million billion gai [immeasurable numbers]—
Normal: They reached the end of all suffering,
Normal: Became arhats, free from dangers.
Normal: When he spoke the Dharma the second time,
Normal: Thousands of millions like the Ganges sands,
Normal: Because they didn't cling to dharmas,
Normal: Also became arhats throughout all lands.
Normal: After that, those who reached the Way—
Normal: Their number was beyond all measure,
Normal: You could count for millions of billions of ages,
Normal: Still couldn't reach the edge of that treasure.
Normal: At that time them sixteen princes—
Normal: They left home to become novices, every one.
Normal: They all together requested that Buddha:
Normal: "Speak the Great Vehicle teaching, let it be done!
Normal: For us and all our followers,
Normal: May we all complete the Buddha Way.
Normal: May we gain what the World-Honored One has—
Normal: The wisdom-eye, first and pure, we pray."
Normal: The Buddha knew what them boys were thinking,
Normal: Knew the practices they'd done in lives gone by.
Normal: Using countless causes and conditions,
Normal: And all kinds of parables, he taught them high.
Normal: He spoke of the Six Perfections,
Normal: And all kinds of spiritual power matters.
Normal: He analyzed the real and true teachings,
Normal: The path that bodhisattvas walk and what really matters.
Normal: He spoke this Lotus Flower Sutra,
Normal: Verses numerous as the Ganges sands.
Normal: After that Buddha finished speaking,
Normal: He went to his quiet room with folded hands.
Normal: Sitting in one-pointed meditation,
Normal: For eighty-four thousand ages he stayed.
Normal: Meanwhile all them novice boys,
Normal: Knowing the Buddha in meditation hadn't yet swayed—
Normal: For countless billions of beings,
Normal: They spoke of the Buddha's supreme wisdom, clear and bright.
Normal: Each one sat on a Dharma seat,
Normal: Speaking this Great Vehicle sutra day and night.
Normal: After the Buddha came out of silence,
Normal: They preached to help spread the transformation.
Normal: Each and every one of them novices
Normal: Guided living beings—six hundred million billion, that's the calculation—
Normal: Like the sands of the Ganges River, endless and more.
Normal: After that Buddha passed into final rest,
Normal: Those who heard the Dharma from him before,
Normal: In all the Buddha-lands manifest—
Normal: They're constantly born together with their teacher.
Normal: These sixteen novices too—
Normal: They've fully walked the Buddha path,
Normal: Now dwelling in the ten directions, teaching true.
Normal: Right now they're speaking the Dharma,
Normal: Each one already perfectly enlightened.
Normal: Those who heard the teaching back then,
Normal: In all the Buddha-places, their paths brightened.
Normal: Those dwelling on the hearer ground—
Normal: I'm gradually teaching them the Buddha Way.
Normal: I was one of them sixteen back then,
Normal: And for you I spoke the Dharma in the olden days.
Normal: That's why with skillful means today,
Normal: I'm leading you toward Buddha wisdom's call.
Normal: Because of this original cause and condition,
Normal: Now I speak the Lotus Sutra to y'all.
Normal: To make you enter the Buddha Way—
Normal: Be careful, don't be frightened or dismayed!
Normal: Like a dangerous and terrible road,
Normal: Remote and far, where many dangers laid—
Normal: With vicious beasts all around,
Normal: And not a drop of water, not a blade of grass—
Normal: A place that people fear and dread,
Normal: Countless thousands of millions wanting to pass.
Normal: The road stretches out so far away—
Normal: Five hundred yojanas, the distance goes.
Normal: At that time there was one guide,
Normal: Strong in memory, with wisdom, one who knows.
Normal: His understanding clear, his mind made up,
Normal: On that dangerous path, saving folks from disaster.
Normal: But all the people got worn out and tired,
Normal: They said to that guide, their master:
Normal: "Right now we're completely exhausted,
Normal: We want to turn back from here today."
Normal: The guide thought about it, considered it:
Normal: "What a pity, what a shame, I must say!
Normal: How could they want to turn around,
Normal: And lose out on that great treasure-ground?"
Normal: Right then he thought up a skillful method,
Normal: Where his spiritual power could be found.
Normal: He conjured up a great walled city,
Normal: With decorated houses, beautiful and bright,
Normal: Surrounded by gardens and forests,
Normal: Streams and bathing pools, a lovely sight.
Normal: Double gates and tall towers,
Normal: Filled with men and women everywhere.
Normal: After he made this conjuration,
Normal: He comforted them folks: "Don't despair!
Normal: Go ahead and enter this city,
Normal: Each of you can do what brings you pleasure."
Normal: When all them people entered the city,
Normal: Their hearts filled up with joy beyond measure.
Normal: They all felt safe and secure,
Normal: Thinking: "Now we've crossed over for sure!"
Normal: The guide knew they'd rested up enough,
Normal: Gathered everyone together, that's what he was there for.
Normal: He told them: "You should keep moving on now,
Normal: This is just a conjured city here.
Normal: I saw you were exhausted,
Normal: Wanted to turn back out of fear.
Normal: So with my skillful power,
Normal: I temporarily conjured up this city wall.
Normal: Now y'all should push forward with energy—
Normal: Together we'll reach the treasure after all!"
Normal: I too am like this,
Normal: I'm the guide for everyone, you see.
Normal: I see all these seekers of the Way
Normal: Giving up halfway, unable to break free—
Normal: Unable to cross birth and death,
Normal: And all the dangerous roads of affliction too.
Normal: So with my skillful power,
Normal: I speak of nirvāṇa for rest, to help them through.
Normal: I say: "Your suffering is extinguished,
Normal: You've accomplished everything you need to do."
Normal: Once I know they've reached nirvāṇa,
Normal: All become arhats, through and through—
Normal: Then I gather the great assembly,
Normal: And speak the real truth for their sake:
Normal: The Buddhas' skillful power—
Normal: They made distinctions, spoke of three for your sake.
Normal: There's only one Buddha Vehicle,
Normal: The rest—they're just resting places, nothing more.
Normal: Now I'm telling you the real deal:
Normal: What you attained ain't the final score.
Normal: To gain the Buddha's all-knowing wisdom,
Normal: You should generate great energy and will!
Normal: When you've realized all-knowing wisdom,
Normal: The Ten Powers and all the Buddha-dharmas still—
Normal: With the thirty-two marks adorning you—
Normal: That's when you reach true extinction, nothing left to kill.
Normal: The Buddhas who are the guides,
Normal: They speak of nirvāṇa to give folks a rest on the hill.
Normal: Once they know that rest is finished,
Normal: They lead them into the Buddha's wisdom, that's the thrill."
Normal: END OF CHAPTER SEVEN: THE PHANTOM CITY BLUES
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter is about time—time so vast your mind can't hold it—and about how a good teacher knows when to let tired people rest before pushing them toward the ultimate goal. I've tried to make it sing like the blues while keeping every bit of the depth.
Normal: Key Metaphors and Choices:
Normal: The Ink and Dust Parable
Normal: : The original uses grinding earth into ink and dropping it across inconceivable distances to show how long ago this ancient Buddha lived. I kept the concrete imagery—grinding, walking, dropping—because that's what makes it real. You can feel the vastness through the physical action.
Normal: The Sixteen Princes
Normal: : These are the sixteen sons who became monks, taught the Lotus Sutra, and are now Buddhas throughout the universe—including Amitabha (Pure Land) and Śākyamuni (our Buddha). This is a profound teaching about the eternal connection between teachers and students across cosmic time.
Normal: The Phantom City
Normal: : This is the heart of the chapter. A guide leading exhausted travelers creates a magical rest stop—a phantom city—so they can catch their breath before continuing to the real treasure. The Buddha says this is what he does: he teaches "lesser" forms of liberation (the hearer and solitary realizer paths) as rest stops on the way to full Buddha-hood. It ain't the final destination, but it's a necessary mercy for folks who can't make the full journey all at once.
Normal: Blues Elements Used:
Normal: Call and response structure in the verses
Normal: Repetition with variation (each direction's Brahma kings)
Normal: Direct address ("brothers," "you see," "I'm telling you")
Normal: Concrete physical imagery (grinding, walking, raining flowers, tired feet)
Normal: The blues truth: rest is real, exhaustion is real, but the journey ain't over
Normal: The blues has always known how to carry heavy truth with a light touch, how to make the cosmic feel personal, how to honor both rest and journey. This chapter does the same thing—and I've tried to let that music come through while keeping every grain of wisdom intact.
Normal: May all beings find the rest they need and the courage to keep walking toward that treasure.
Heading 1: CHAPTER EIGHT: WHEN THE FIVE HUNDRED FINALLY HEARD THEIR NAMES CALLED
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Normal: Listen now, this is the story of how five hundred disciples found out they'd been carrying diamonds in their pockets all along.
Heading 2: THE PREACHER MAN FINALLY UNDERSTANDS
Normal: Now when Full Son heard all this - Full Son, that's Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra, best preacher man in the whole congregation - when he heard the Buddha laying out that wisdom, talking about how you got to meet folks where they are, speaking their language, teaching by whatever means it takes... and when he heard how the big-time disciples were getting their names called, getting told they gonna be Buddhas themselves someday... and when he heard about all the old-time connections, all that history stretching way back... and when he heard about how the Buddhas got more power and freedom than you can shake a stick at...
Normal: Man, something he never felt before washed over him. His heart got clean and jumped up in his chest. He rose right up from his seat, walked straight to the Buddha, bowed down low - put his whole face to the Buddha's feet, you know - then stepped back to one side. And he stood there looking at the Buddha's face, couldn't take his eyes off him for nothing. And he thought to himself:
Normal: "Lord have mercy, this World-Honored One is something else entirely. What he does is rare as hen's teeth. He knows how to reach all kinds of different folks, all their different ways of being. He's got this skillful knowing, this way of seeing, and he teaches to match it. He pulls people out of all the places they get stuck, all the things they grasp onto that keep 'em trapped. We can't even put words to all the Buddha's done. Only the Buddha himself knows what we been carrying deep down in our hearts all along, what we been wishing for since before we can remember."
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA CALLS OUT HIS BEST PREACHER
Normal: Now the Buddha turned to all the monks and said: "Y'all see this Full Son, this Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra? I been saying it all along - among all the folks who can preach, he's number one. Nobody better. And I always been talking about all the different kinds of good he does - how hard he works, how he protects and holds up the teaching, how he helps me spread this Dharma. When it comes to teaching the four kinds of followers, he shows 'em the way, he teaches 'em right, he benefits 'em, he brings 'em joy. He can break down the Buddha's true teaching every which way, and he brings real benefit to everybody walking this holy path with him. Besides the Tathāgata himself, ain't nobody can match his way with words."
Normal: "Now don't y'all go thinking Full Son only been helping me preach my Dharma. No sir. He been doing this work with ninety billion Buddhas in the past - protecting and helping spread the Buddha's true teaching. And among all those preacher men with all those Buddhas, he was number one there too. And when it comes to those Buddhas teaching about emptiness, about how things don't have any fixed self - Full Son understood that clear as day, understood it all the way through. He got what they call the four unobstructed wisdoms. He could always preach steady and clean and clear, no doubts, no hesitation. He had all the Bodhisattva's supernatural powers. All through his life, however long he lived, he walked that pure holy path. The people in those Buddha-times, they all thought he was just a hearer-disciple, just a śrāvaka. But Full Son was using that as a skillful means, you understand, and through it he benefited hundreds of thousands of beings beyond counting. And he helped countless folks without number to establish themselves on the path to supreme perfect enlightenment. Because he wanted to purify Buddha-lands, he was always doing Buddha-work, always teaching and transforming beings."
Normal: "Now listen, monks - Full Son was the number one preacher among the seven Buddhas before me. And right now with me, he's number one among those who preach. And in the coming age, the good age to come with all its Buddhas - he gonna be number one among the preachers then too. And in every case, he gonna be protecting and helping spread the Buddha's Dharma. And in the future, he gonna keep on protecting and helping spread the Dharma of countless Buddhas beyond measure - teaching and benefiting beings without number, helping 'em establish themselves on the path to supreme perfect enlightenment. Because he wants to purify Buddha-lands, he gonna keep working hard, teaching and transforming beings, little by little fulfilling the whole Bodhisattva path."
Normal: "After countless, immeasurable, infinite ages pass, right here in this land he gonna attain supreme perfect enlightenment. His name gonna be Dharmaprabha Tathāgata - that means Dharma-Light Buddha. And he gonna have all ten titles: Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One."
Heading 2: THE LAND WHERE LAW-LIGHT BUDDHA GONNA REIGN
Normal: Now his Buddha-land gonna include three thousand great thousand worlds - as many as the sands in the Ganges River - all rolled into one Buddha-land. The ground gonna be made of seven kinds of precious things. The land gonna be flat as the palm of your hand - no mountains, no valleys, no streams running through ravines, no ditches. Gonna be pavilions and towers made of seven precious things filling up that whole place. The palaces where the gods live gonna be floating right there in the sky, close by. Heaven and earth gonna meet, people and gods gonna see each other face to face.
Normal: Won't be no evil paths there - no hell, no hungry ghosts, no animals suffering. Won't be no women there either. Every being gonna be born by transformation - just appear, you know. Won't be no sexual desire. They gonna have great supernatural powers. Their bodies gonna shine with light. They gonna fly around free as birds. Their will gonna be strong and steady. They gonna be full of effort and wisdom. Every single one gonna be golden-colored and marked with the thirty-two signs that show their dignity.
Normal: The beings in that land gonna eat two kinds of food. First kind: joy in the Dharma - that's law-food, teaching-food, truth-food. Second kind: the happiness that comes from meditation - that's the food you eat when you sit still and touch what's real. There gonna be countless thousands of myriads of millions of Bodhisattvas beyond measure - they gonna have great supernatural powers and the four unobstructed wisdoms, and they gonna be good at teaching all different kinds of beings. And the hearer-disciples there, you can't even count 'em - no arithmetic, no calculation can reach that number. Every one of 'em gonna have the six supernatural powers, the three clear knowledges, and the eight liberations complete.
Normal: That Buddha-land gonna be accomplished and adorned with countless limitless virtues like these. The age gonna be called Jewel-Bright. The country gonna be called Good-and-Pure. That Buddha gonna live for countless, limitless ages beyond measure. The true Dharma gonna last way longer than that. And the reflection of the Dharma - what we call the image-age - gonna last twice as long again. When the Dharma finally disappears, the gods and humans gonna grieve.
Heading 2: NOW THE BUDDHA GONNA SAY IT IN VERSE
Normal: Monks, you better listen close,

Normal: They learned the skillful way so well,
Normal: it's beyond what thinking's mind can tell.

Normal: played the part of disciples everywhere -
Normal: Acting like hearers, acting small,
Normal: using countless means to reach 'em all.
Normal: They said, "We just disciples be,
Normal: from Buddha-way we're far as far can be."
Normal: But they delivered countless souls,
Normal: made 'em whole, fulfilled their roles.
Normal: Though people lazy, wanting less,
Normal: slowly they'd lead 'em to Buddha-ness.
Normal: Inside they kept the Bodhisattva way,
Normal: outside they looked like disciples day to day.
Normal: Seemed like they had small desires, hated birth and death,
Normal: but really they were purifying Buddha-lands with every breath.

Normal: My disciples work like this, you see,
Normal: with skillful means they set folks free.

Normal: these gonna be the congregation he gonna meet.
Normal: All the beings in that nation,

Normal: Full Son the monk, you understand,
Normal: got all his virtues filled out grand.
Normal: He gonna get this pure land here,
Normal: with wise and holy folks so dear.
Normal: Countless things like this there be,
Normal: but I just told it briefly.
Heading 2: THE TWELVE HUNDRED START HOPING
Normal: Now at that time, those twelve hundred arhats - the ones who done got their minds free - they was thinking: "We're so happy, we ain't never felt nothing like this before. If the World-Honored One would call our names one by one, give us our prophecies like he done for those other big-time disciples, wouldn't that be something sweet?"
Normal: The Buddha knew what they was thinking in their hearts. He turned to Mahākāśyapa - that's Great Kāśyapa - and said: "I'm gonna call these twelve hundred arhats' names right here and now, one after another, and give 'em their prophecies of supreme perfect enlightenment."
Normal: "Now in this congregation here, my great disciple Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya - that's Understanding-Chen-Ru - he gonna make offerings to sixty-two thousand billion Buddhas, and after that, he gonna become a Buddha himself. His name gonna be Samantaprabha Tathāgata - that's Universal-Light Buddha. And he gonna have all ten titles: Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One."
Normal: "And those five hundred arhats - Uruvilva-Kāśyapa, Gaya-Kāśyapa, Nadi-Kāśyapa, Kālodayin, Udāyin, Aniruddha, Revata, Kapphina, Bakkula, Cunda, Svāgata, and the rest - every single one of 'em gonna attain supreme perfect enlightenment. Every one of 'em gonna share the same title, all gonna be called Samantaprabha - Universal-Light."
Heading 2: NOW THE BUDDHA GONNA SAY IT IN VERSE AGAIN
Normal: Understanding-Chen-Ru monk gonna see
Normal: countless Buddhas endlessly.
Normal: After ages past all measure time,
Normal: he gonna reach enlightenment's peak and climb.
Normal: Always gonna send out great big light,
Normal: filled up with supernatural powers and might.
Normal: His name gonna be famous through every direction,
Normal: everyone gonna give him respect and affection.
Normal: Always gonna preach the highest way,
Normal: that's why they call him Universal-Light, they say.
Normal: His Buddha-land gonna be pure and clean,
Normal: Bodhisattvas brave like you ain't never seen.
Normal: They gonna climb up wonderful towers high,
Normal: travel to worlds in every part of the sky,
Normal: with offerings supreme beyond all telling,
Normal: presenting them to Buddhas in every dwelling.
Normal: After they done made these offerings complete,
Normal: their hearts filled up with joy so sweet,
Normal: in just a moment they gonna fly back home -
Normal: that's the kind of supernatural power they own.
Normal: That Buddha gonna live sixty thousand ages long,
Normal: the true Dharma gonna last twice that song.
Normal: The image-Dharma twice that time again,
Normal: when the Dharma dies, gods and humans feel the pain.
Normal: Those five hundred monks, you understand,
Normal: one by one gonna become Buddhas in this land.
Normal: All of 'em gonna share the name Universal-Light,
Normal: taking turns getting prophecies, that's right.
Normal: "After I done passed away," the Buddha said,
Normal: "So-and-so gonna be a Buddha instead.
Normal: The world that he gonna teach and transform there
Normal: gonna be just like mine everywhere.
Normal: The purity of that Buddha-land,
Normal: the supernatural powers so grand,
Normal: the Bodhisattvas and hearers he gonna teach,
Normal: the true Dharma and image-Dharma's reach,
Normal: How long his life gonna measure out -
Normal: all gonna be like what I been talking about.
Normal: Kāśyapa, now you done learned and know
Normal: about these five hundred who done been freed to go.
Normal: As for all the other hearer-disciples here,
Normal: they gonna be just like this, that's clear.
Normal: Those who ain't in this meeting today,
Normal: you gotta go and tell 'em what I say."
Heading 2: THE JEWEL SEWN IN THE ROBE - THE HEART OF IT ALL
Normal: Now when those five hundred arhats got their prophecies called out right there in front of the Buddha, they was so happy they was jumping up and down. They rose up from their seats, went right to the Buddha, bowed down with their faces to his feet, and they confessed, they repented, they held themselves accountable:
Normal: "World-Honored One, we been thinking all this time that we done reached the final destination, that we'd got to ultimate liberation. But now we see we was like folks with no sense, no wisdom at all. Why we say that? Because we should've got the Tathāgata's wisdom, but instead we settled for small wisdom and thought that was enough."
Normal: "World-Honored One, it's like this - it's like there was a man, and he went to his good friend's house. This was a close friend, a real friend. And he got drunk and passed out, just fell out sleeping. Now his friend, he had some official business he had to take care of, had to go handle something. So before he left, he took a priceless jewel - I mean priceless, worth more than you can count - and he sewed it into the lining of his friend's robe. Just sewed it right in there and left."
Normal: "Now that man, he was passed out drunk, didn't know nothing about it, didn't feel a thing. When he woke up, he hit the road, started traveling around, went to another country altogether. And he had to scrape for food, scrape for clothes to wear. He was working hard, straining and struggling, having it real rough. And if he managed to get just a little bit of something, he figured that was enough. He'd settle for that."
Normal: "Later on, that good friend happened to run into him and saw him living like this. And he said: 'Man! Brother! Why you out here struggling for food and clothes like this? Way back when, I wanted you to be comfortable, wanted you to have ease, wanted you to be able to enjoy all five kinds of pleasures however you wanted. On such-and-such a year, such-and-such a month, such-and-such a day, I sewed a priceless jewel into the lining of your robe. It's still right there! And here you are not knowing it, worrying and suffering and working yourself to death just to survive. That's foolish, man! You can take this jewel and trade it for whatever you need. You can live however you want, never have to worry about running short of nothing.'"
Normal: "The Buddha's just like that. When he was a Bodhisattva, he taught us, he helped us develop the mind that seeks all-knowing wisdom. But we forgot. We forgot all about it. We didn't know, didn't remember. When we got to the arhat path, we thought we'd reached liberation, thought we was done. Making it through life was hard. Getting a little bit seemed like enough. But that wish for all-knowing wisdom - it was still there, never lost."
Normal: "Now the World-Honored One woke us up, made us see. He said to us: 'Monks, what y'all got ain't the ultimate liberation. Long ago I had y'all plant Buddha-seeds, good roots that grow into Buddha-trees. I used skillful means to show y'all what looked like nirvāṇa, what looked like the final destination. And y'all thought you'd really reached ultimate liberation.'"
Normal: "World-Honored One, now we finally understand - we really are Bodhisattvas. We done received the prophecy of supreme perfect enlightenment. Because of this, we're happier than we ever been in our lives. This is joy we ain't never known before."
Heading 2: NOW THEY GONNA SAY IT IN VERSE
Normal: We heard that highest, peaceful voice,
Normal: telling us our names - we had no choice
Normal: but to feel a joy we ain't never known,
Normal: and bow to the Buddha with wisdom full-grown.
Normal: Now here before the World-Honored One
Normal: we confess what we done and ain't done.
Normal: Though we had a share of Buddha-treasure beyond measure,
Normal: we settled for a little bit of nirvāṇa-pleasure,
Normal: Like foolish folks without good sense,
Normal: we thought that little bit was immense.
Normal: It's like a poor man, see,
Normal: went to his good friend's place to be.
Normal: That friend's house was mighty rich,
Normal: had all kinds of food, every dish.
Normal: He took a priceless jewel, you understand,
Normal: and sewed it in the poor man's robe with his own hand,
Normal: Gave it quiet-like and then was gone.
Normal: The man was sleeping, didn't know what was going on.
Normal: When that man woke up and rose,
Normal: he traveled to another country, as the story goes.
Normal: Looking for clothes and for food to get by,
Normal: scraping to survive with many a sigh.
Normal: Life was hard, so hard to bear,
Normal: if he got a little something, he thought that was rare -
Normal: He didn't wish for nothing better than that little bit.
Normal: He didn't know that right there where he sit,
Normal: sewn inside his robe's lining there
Normal: was a priceless jewel beyond compare.
Normal: The friend who gave that jewel back when,
Normal: he saw this poor man struggling again.
Normal: He scolded him hard, got after him good,
Normal: and showed him the jewel sewn in where it stood.
Normal: When the poor man saw that jewel shine,
Normal: his heart was filled with joy so fine.
Normal: He was rich! Had wealth to burn!
Normal: Could enjoy five pleasures at every turn.
Normal: We're just like that, every one.
Normal: World-Honored One, through the long dark night you done
Normal: always pitied us, always helped us see,
Normal: made us plant seeds of the highest wish to be free.
Normal: But we had no wisdom, didn't understand,
Normal: didn't know it, didn't see what was in our hand.
Normal: We got a little share of nirvāṇa, small and slight,
Normal: thought that was enough, thought we was done right.
Normal: Now the Buddha woke us up, you see,
Normal: said what we got ain't real and final and free.
Normal: When we get the Buddha's highest wisdom, that unsurpassed knowing,
Normal: only then we gonna reach real liberation's showing.
Normal: Now we done heard from the Buddha here
Normal: about prophecies and adornments, made it all clear.
Normal: And heard we gonna take our turns receiving the call,
Normal: and our bodies and minds are full of joy, one and all.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER EIGHT: WHEN THE FIVE HUNDRED FINALLY HEARD THEIR NAMES CALLED
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter is the heart of the Lotus Sutra's democratic revelation - the moment when the "ordinary" disciples discover they've been carrying Buddha-nature all along without knowing it. The central parable of the jewel sewn into the robe is one of the most powerful images in Buddhist literature, and it speaks directly to the blues tradition's understanding of hidden dignity, forgotten promise, and the shocking grace of recognition.
Normal: Key metaphorical choices:
Normal: "Full Son" for Pūrṇa
Normal: - His name literally means "full" (pūrṇa), and "Maitrāyaṇīputra" means "son of Maitrāyaṇī," so "Full Son" captures both elements in vernacular English that sounds natural when spoken aloud.
Normal: "Preacher man"
Normal: - Pūrṇa's designation as foremost in teaching the Dharma translates naturally to the African American religious tradition's "preacher," a figure of respect and power.
Normal: "Getting drunk and passing out"
Normal: - The original Chinese "醉酒而臥" is frank about intoxication. The blues tradition doesn't sanitize human weakness - it names it directly while holding space for redemption.
Normal: "Scraping for food and clothes"
Normal: - The original describes arduous struggle for basic survival ("為衣食故，勤力求索，甚大艱難"). This directly parallels the blues tradition's unflinching acknowledgment of poverty and hard times.
Normal: "Man! Brother! Why you out here struggling like this?"
Normal: - The original "咄哉、丈夫" is an exclamation of shock and dismay. The blues vernacular "Man! Brother!" captures that emotional directness.
Normal: "I sewed a priceless jewel into the lining of your robe"
Normal: - This image is preserved exactly because it's already perfect - concrete, specific, shocking. The hidden wealth sewn into the garment of someone who doesn't know they're carrying it speaks across centuries and cultures.
Normal: The spiritual truth here is universal: we've been wandering in poverty thinking we're far from home, when all along we've been carrying everything we need. We settled for small blessings when infinite blessing was sewn into our very garments. The Buddha (like the true friend) doesn't give us something new - he reveals what we've had all along but forgot. This is the blues revelation: you been somebody all along, child. You just forgot. Now remember.
Heading 1: CHAPTER NINE: WHEN THE FAITHFUL GET THEIR DUE
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: PROPHECIES FOR THE LEARNERS AND THE LEARNED
Normal: Now Ānanda and Rāhula, they been sitting there watching all these prophecies going out, and something starts stirring in their hearts. They thinking to themselves: "We been here all along, ain't we? Don't we get a word too? Wouldn't that be something—wouldn't that be sweet?"
Normal: So they rise up from where they sitting, and they walk right up to the Teacher, and they bow down low, faces to his feet, showing proper respect. And together they speak up:
Normal: "World-Honored One, we been thinking—we got a place in this too, don't we? Ain't nobody else we can turn to but you, Lord. You the only one. And everybody knows us—all the heavenly beings and earthly folk, even the demons know who we are. Ānanda here, he been standing by your side, keeping watch over every word you spoke, holding the teaching safe like a mama holds her baby. And Rāhula, well, he your own flesh and blood, your actual son. So if you gonna speak that supreme enlightenment over us, if you gonna call our names too—well, that would fill up what we been hoping for. That would satisfy what all these people been expecting. Our cup would overflow, and the crowd's cup too."
Normal: Now there was two thousand disciples in that assembly—some still learning, working it out, still on the journey; some already graduated, got their lessons down. And when they heard Ānanda and Rāhula speak up, every last one of them rises to their feet. They slip their right shoulder out of their robes—that's the way you show respect—and they come forward to the Buddha, and they put their palms together, and they just stand there looking up at him with one heart, one hope, same desire Ānanda and Rāhula got. Just standing there on the side, waiting. Patient people. Faithful people. Been there all along.
Normal: Then the Buddha, he turns to Ānanda and he says:
Normal: "Ānanda, listen now. In the world that's coming, you gonna become a Buddha. They gonna call you Mountain-Sea-Wisdom-Free-Penetration-King Tathāgata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.
Normal: "You gonna serve sixty-two billion Buddhas, gonna keep watch over the teaching for every one of them, protecting that Dharma like you been protecting mine. And after all that faithful service, after all that holding and keeping and remembering—then you gonna reach that supreme perfect enlightenment your own self.
Normal: "You gonna teach twenty thousand million billion Ganges-river-sands worth of bodhisattvas, gonna bring them all the way up to that supreme perfect enlightenment. Your land gonna be called Constant-Victory-Banner-Standing—and child, that land gonna be clean. Pure as pure can be. The ground gonna be lapis lazuli, that deep blue stone, smooth and precious. And the era you teaching in, they gonna call it Wonderful-Sound-Pervading, 'cause your voice gonna fill everything, gonna reach everywhere.
Normal: "Your life as a Buddha gonna last countless thousands of millions of billions of immeasurable eons—you can't even count it. You could spend a thousand million billion immeasurable eons trying to calculate it with your finest mathematics, and you still couldn't get the number. The true Dharma gonna last twice as long as your lifetime. The reflected Dharma gonna last twice as long as the true Dharma.
Normal: "And Ānanda, this Mountain-Sea-Wisdom-Free-Penetration-King Buddha—that's you, child—you gonna be praised by innumerable thousands of millions of billions of Ganges-sands worth of Buddhas in all ten directions. They all gonna be singing your name, speaking your merit, telling what you done."
Normal: Right here in this assembly, I'm speaking it plain:
Normal: Ānanda, who holds the Dharma like a vessel holds rain,
Normal: You gonna serve the Buddhas, every one that you meet,
Normal: Then you gonna wake up perfect, gonna claim your own seat.
Normal: They'll call you Mountain-Sea-Wisdom, Self-Mastered-King,
Normal: Your land gonna be spotless, purest precious thing,
Normal: Called Constant-Victory-Banner, that's the name of your ground,
Normal: You gonna teach bodhisattvas thick as stars all around.
Normal: Countless as the Ganges sand, that's how many you'll raise,
Normal: Your Buddha-power gonna be mighty, your reputation gonna blaze,
Normal: Your name gonna fill ten directions, everywhere they gonna know,
Normal: Your lifetime can't be measured—mercy makes it overflow.
Normal: You gonna live so long, child, out of love for what you teach,
Normal: True Dharma gonna last double that, extending your reach,
Normal: And the reflected Dharma, it gonna double that again—
Normal: Like Ganges-river-sandgrains, countless people you'll bring in.
Normal: All those innumerable beings gonna plant their seeds
Normal: In this Buddha-Dharma of yours, gonna meet their deepest needs,
Normal: They gonna start their journey to Buddhahood right there,
Normal: In the field you tended faithful, with your patient care.
Normal: Now there was eight thousand bodhisattvas in that gathering who just recently started out on the path, beginners really, and they looking at all this and they start wondering. They thinking to themselves: "Hold on now—we ain't even heard the great bodhisattvas, the advanced ones, getting prophecies like this. So what's the reason, what's the cause, that these voice-hearers, these disciples, getting such clear predictions?"
Normal: The World-Honored One, he knows what they thinking—he can read a heart like you read a book. So he speaks to them directly:
Normal: "Good sons, listen here. Me and Ānanda, we made our vows together way back when, under the Buddha called Empty-King. We both set our hearts on that supreme perfect enlightenment at the same time, same place.
Normal: "But Ānanda, he always loved learning. He wanted to hear it all, study it all, remember it all. Me, I went the route of vigorous practice, constant pushing, hard work, discipline. That's why I already reached that supreme perfect enlightenment, and Ānanda—he been protecting my teaching, keeping the Dharma safe. He gonna protect the Dharma-treasure of all the Buddhas coming in the future too. He gonna teach and bring to completion multitudes of bodhisattvas.
Normal: "That was his original vow, you see. That was his heart's desire from way back. That's why he gets this prophecy now. He been faithful to his calling."
Normal: Now Ānanda, standing right there before the Buddha, hearing his own name called, hearing about that pure land that's coming, hearing every single thing he ever hoped for being confirmed—his heart just fills up. Joy like he never known before washes over him. It's unprecedented. Never felt nothing like it.
Normal: And right then, in that moment, he remembers. He remembers the Dharma-treasures of countless thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas from the ancient past. All of it comes flooding back, and he understands it perfectly, no obstacles, clear as day—just like what he hearing right now. And he understands his original vow too. He remembers who he always been.
Normal: So Ānanda, he sings out his own verse:
Normal: World-Honored One, you so rare, so precious, so unique—
Normal: You made me remember the past, made the ancient present speak,
Normal: All those countless Buddha-teachings from so long ago
Normal: Coming back clear as today, now I finally know.
Normal: I ain't got no doubts no more, I'm settled on this road,
Normal: I'm standing firm in Buddha-way, carrying this load,
Normal: I played my part with skillful means, standing by your side,
Normal: Protecting all the Buddhas' Dharma, faithful as a bride.
Normal: Then the Buddha turns to Rāhula and he says:
Normal: "Rāhula, in the world to come, you gonna become a Buddha. They gonna call you Stepping-on-Seven-Jewel-Flowers Tathāgata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.
Normal: "You gonna serve Buddhas numbering like the dust-motes in ten worlds, and you gonna always be the eldest son to all of them, just like you are to me right now. Always the firstborn. Always that close.
Normal: "This Stepping-on-Seven-Jewel-Flowers Buddha—the purity of your land, how long you gonna live, how long the era lasts, how many disciples you gonna teach, the true Dharma period, the reflected Dharma period—all of it gonna be just like Mountain-Sea-Wisdom-Free-Penetration-King Tathāgata. No different. And you gonna be the eldest son to that Buddha too, before you step into your own enlightenment and become a Buddha yourself."
Normal: When I was a prince in the palace, living that royal life,
Normal: Rāhula was my firstborn son, before all the strife,
Normal: Now I've awakened to Buddha-way, and he's my son in Dharma too,
Normal: Receiving the teaching, carrying it on, loyal and true.
Normal: In the ages yet to come, he gonna see billions of Buddhas rise,
Normal: Gonna be the eldest son to every one, that's his prize,
Normal: Single-hearted, seeking Buddha-way with everything he got,
Normal: Faithful to that one true path, never forgot.
Normal: Rāhula practices in secret, hidden deep inside,
Normal: Only I can see it, only I know what he hides,
Normal: Right now he shows himself as my eldest son for all to see,
Normal: Teaching these multitudes by his example, humble as can be.
Normal: Billions and billions of merit, countless virtues he done stored,
Normal: Settled firm in Buddha-Dharma, seeking that supreme reward,
Normal: Standing steady on the path, walking toward that highest light,
Normal: Patient as the morning, faithful as the night.
Normal: Now the World-Honored One, he looks out at those two thousand people—learners and learned, still-training and beyond-training—and he sees that their hearts are soft now, quiet and clean, peaceful and pure, all of them looking at him with one mind, one gaze.
Normal: The Buddha says to Ānanda: "You see these two thousand people—the learners and the learned?"
Normal: Ānanda says: "Yes, Lord, I see them."
Normal: "Ānanda, every single one of these people gonna serve Buddhas numbering like the dust-motes in fifty worlds. They gonna honor them, respect them, protect the Dharma-treasure for every one.
Normal: "And then, at the end, they all gonna become Buddhas at the same time, in the same moment, in lands throughout the ten directions. And they all gonna have the same name—every last one. They gonna be called Jewel-Mark Tathāgata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.
Normal: "They all gonna live for one eon. The purity of their lands, the number of voice-hearers and bodhisattvas, the true Dharma period, the reflected Dharma period—all of it gonna be exactly equal, exactly the same. No difference between them. All equal. All honored."
Normal: These two thousand voice-hearers standing here today,
Normal: I'm giving prophecy to every one, showing them the way,
Normal: In the future they gonna become Buddhas, gonna reach that goal,
Normal: After serving countless Buddhas, they gonna make it whole.
Normal: They gonna serve as many Buddhas as the dustmotes I described,
Normal: Protecting the Dharma-treasure, keeping the truth alive,
Normal: After all that faithful service, they gonna wake up at last,
Normal: Gonna sit in perfect enlightenment, free from the past.
Normal: Each in their own direction, in lands spread all around,
Normal: But they gonna share one name, one title, one renown,
Normal: All sitting in the place of enlightenment at the exact same time,
Normal: All bearing witness to supreme wisdom, all in their prime.
Normal: Every one called Jewel-Mark—that's the name they'll bear,
Normal: Their countries and their students, everything they'll share,
Normal: True Dharma and reflected Dharma lasting just the same,
Normal: Equal in every measure, equal in their fame.
Normal: All of them using supernatural powers to save beings far and wide,
Normal: Their reputation spreading everywhere, reaching every side,
Normal: Gradually they gonna enter into nirvāṇa's peaceful rest,
Normal: After a lifetime of teaching, after giving their very best.
Normal: When those two thousand learners and learned ones heard the Buddha speak their prophecy, they couldn't hold it in. Joy jumped up in them, they started leaping and dancing, and they sang back to him:
Normal: World-Honored One, you a lamp of wisdom burning bright,
Normal: We heard you call our names, we heard you speak our plight,
Normal: Our hearts are overflowing, filled up to the brim,
Normal: Like we been touched by immortal nectar, like sweet dew on the rim.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER NINE: WHEN THE FAITHFUL GET THEIR DUE
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter is about the dignity of service, the honor of patience, and the vindication of the faithful. I made several key interpretive choices:
Normal: Central Metaphors:
Normal: "Holding the teaching like a mama holds her baby" - for Ānanda's role as protector of the Dharma
Normal: "Our cup would overflow" - blues/gospel language for fulfillment and satisfaction
Normal: "Faithful as a bride" - for Ānanda's loyal devotion
Normal: "Patient as the morning, faithful as the night" - for Rāhula's steady practice
Normal: "Like sweet dew on the rim" - transforming "nectar" (甘露/amṛta) into something both familiar and transcendent
Normal: Character Voices:
Normal: Ānanda and Rāhula speak with humility but also with legitimate desire for recognition
Normal: The 2,000 are characterized by their patient silence and collective hoping
Normal: The Buddha speaks with both formality (in the official prophecies with full titles) and intimacy (in explanation)
Normal: Key Teachings Preserved:
Normal: Ānanda chose the path of learning/remembering while Buddha chose vigorous practice
Normal: This explains their different roles and timing of enlightenment
Normal: Rāhula's practice is "secret" (密行) - hidden, inner work
Normal: The 2,000 are all equal in their eventual attainment - democracy of enlightenment
Normal: Service and waiting have their own dignity and lead to full realization
Normal: The title "When the Faithful Get Their Due" captures the chapter's essence: this is about patient people, background people, faithful servants finally receiving public acknowledgment and prophecy.
Heading 1: CHAPTER TEN: HONOR THE WORD-CARRIERS
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE TEACHERS OF THE DHARMA
Normal: Now at that time, the World-Honored One, he turns to Medicine King Bodhisattva, and through him he's talking to eighty thousand great beings, and he says:
Normal: "Medicine King, you see this great crowd gathered here? You see all these countless heavenly beings, dragon-kings, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas? You see the human folks and the non-human folks? You see the monks and nuns, the lay brothers and lay sisters? You see those seeking to be voice-hearers, those seeking solitary enlightenment, those seeking the Buddha-way?
Normal: "Listen now: Every single one of these people—if they hear even one verse, even one sentence of this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra while standing here before me, if they feel even one moment of joy rising in their hearts—I'm giving them all a prophecy right now. Every last one. They all gonna reach that supreme perfect enlightenment. All of them. No exceptions."
Normal: Then the Buddha says to Medicine King:
Normal: "Now let me tell you about after I'm gone, after I leave this world. If there's anybody who hears this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra—even just one verse, just one sentence—and feels one moment of joy in their heart, I'm giving them that prophecy too. They gonna reach that supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: "And if there's people who receive and uphold this sutra, who read it, recite it, explain it to others, copy it down—even if it's just one verse—if they look at this scripture with reverence like they looking at the Buddha himself, if they make offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners and flags, clothing, music, even just bringing their palms together in respect—
Normal: "Medicine King, you need to know: These people already served ten thousand billion Buddhas in the past. They already made great vows in the presence of all those Buddhas. Out of compassion for suffering beings, they chose to be born here in this human world. They came here on purpose."
Normal: "Medicine King, if somebody asks you, 'Which beings are gonna become Buddhas in the future?'—you should point to these people right here. Point to the ones who receive and uphold this Lotus Sutra. You should say: 'These people right here, they gonna become Buddhas in the future world. Guaranteed.'
Normal: "Why? Because if good men or good women receive even one sentence of the Lotus Sutra, if they uphold it, read it, recite it, explain it, copy it down, if they make offerings to the scripture-scroll with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners and flags, clothing, music, bringing their palms together in reverence—
Normal: "These people deserve the respect of the whole world. You should honor them the same way you honor the Buddha himself. You need to know: This person is a great bodhisattva. They already accomplished that supreme perfect enlightenment. Out of pity for suffering beings, they chose to be born here in this world to widely proclaim and explain this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra.
Normal: "How much more so for someone who can receive the whole thing, who makes all kinds of offerings? That person is beyond measure."
Normal: "Medicine King, you need to understand something: These people gave up their clean, pure rewards. After I'm gone, out of compassion for suffering beings, they chose to be born in this evil world just to spread this sutra far and wide.
Normal: "If a good man or good woman, after I'm gone, can secretly teach even one person even one sentence of the Lotus Sutra—you need to know this person is sent by the Buddha himself. The Buddha dispatched them. They're doing the Buddha's own work.
Normal: "How much more so for someone who teaches it broadly to the crowds?"
Normal: "Medicine King, listen to this: If there's an evil person with a bad heart who stands before the Buddha for a whole eon—a whole cosmic age—and constantly curses the Buddha, insults him, speaks against him—well, that sin is still relatively light.
Normal: "But if somebody speaks even one evil word, one bad word, against someone who reads and recites the Lotus Sutra—whether they're a monk or a laywoman, whether they left home or still got a home—if you badmouth a teacher of this sutra, that sin is far, far heavier. You hear me? Far heavier."
Normal: "Medicine King, anyone who reads and recites the Lotus Sutra—you need to know this person is adorned with the Buddha's own adornment. They're carried on the Buddha's own shoulders. The Buddha himself is carrying them.
Normal: "Wherever they go, you should turn toward them and bow. You should bring your palms together with single-minded focus. You should honor them, serve them, respect them, praise them. Offer them flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners and flags, clothing, fine food, make music for them. Bring them the best offerings that humans can bring, the finest you got. You should scatter heavenly treasures on them. You should present them with collections of heavenly jewels.
Normal: "Why? Why all this honor?
Normal: "Because this person joyfully teaches the Dharma. If you hear them for just a moment, just a little while, you immediately reach the ultimate—that supreme perfect enlightenment. That's why."
Normal: If you want to walk the Buddha-road,
Normal: If you want to gain that natural wisdom-load,
Normal: You better constantly make offerings, I'm telling you true,
Normal: To those who receive and uphold this sutra, through and through.
Normal: If you want to quickly gain
Normal: All-wisdom, that's the highest plane,
Normal: You should receive and hold this scripture tight,
Normal: And honor those who hold it day and night.
Normal: If there's anybody who can receive and uphold
Normal: This Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra of old,
Normal: You need to know they're sent by the Buddha himself,
Normal: Came here out of pity for suffering, not for wealth.
Normal: Those who can receive and uphold this teaching here,
Normal: This Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra so dear,
Normal: They left their pure lands behind, you see,
Normal: Came to this world out of compassion, born to set us free.
Normal: You need to know people like this,
Normal: They got freedom to be born wherever they wish,
Normal: They can choose to come to this evil world,
Normal: To widely proclaim this supreme Dharma, let it be unfurled.
Normal: You should make offerings with heavenly flowers and incense sweet,
Normal: Heavenly jeweled clothing, lay it at their feet,
Normal: Heavenly collections of wonderful treasures, the finest kind,
Normal: To honor those who teach this Dharma to humankind.
Normal: After I'm gone, in that evil world to come,
Normal: If there's anybody can uphold this sutra, even some,
Normal: You should bring your palms together and bow down low,
Normal: Honor them like you honor the World-Honored One, you know.
Normal: Bring them the finest food, the sweetest tastes,
Normal: All kinds of clothing, nothing gone to waste,
Normal: Make offerings to this child of Buddha with everything you got,
Normal: Hoping just to hear them teach a little, just a single thought.
Normal: If there's somebody in the future world
Normal: Who can receive and uphold this sutra that's been unfurled,
Normal: I'm sending them among the people, that's where they belong,
Normal: To carry on the Buddha's work, to sing the Buddha's song.
Normal: If for a whole eon long
Normal: Somebody harbors a heart that's wrong,
Normal: Makes ugly faces and curses the Buddha to his face,
Normal: That person's sin is heavy, but it ain't the worst disgrace.
Normal: But if somebody reads, recites, and holds
Normal: This Lotus Sutra, precious as gold,
Normal: And you speak evil against them, even for a little bit,
Normal: That sin is heavier than the first—remember it.
Normal: If there's somebody seeking Buddha's way
Normal: Who for a whole eon, every single day,
Normal: Stands before me with palms together, praising me
Normal: With countless verses, honoring what they see—
Normal: They get immeasurable merit from praising Buddha so,
Normal: But if you praise someone who upholds this sutra, you should know,
Normal: The blessings you receive surpass even that,
Normal: They're greater than all those praises—now how about that?
Normal: For eighty billion eons long,
Normal: If you make offerings with your sweetest song,
Normal: With the finest colors, sounds, fragrances, tastes, and touches too,
Normal: To someone who upholds this sutra, honoring what they do—
Normal: After making all those offerings, precious and refined,
Normal: If you get to hear this sutra for just a moment's time,
Normal: You should rejoice and celebrate, count yourself blessed:
Normal: "I have gained great benefit today, I have truly been caressed!"
Normal: Medicine King, I'm telling you plain,
Normal: Of all the sutras I've taught again and again,
Normal: All the scriptures I've already spoken, am speaking now, will speak later on,
Normal: Among all of them, this Lotus Sutra is the jewel, the crown.
Normal: At that time the Buddha spoke again to Medicine King Bodhisattva Mahāsattva:
Normal: "The scriptures I have taught are countless—thousands, ten thousands, billions. The ones I've already spoken, the ones I'm speaking now, the ones I will speak in the future—among all of them, this Lotus Sutra is the most difficult to believe, the most difficult to understand.
Normal: "Medicine King, this sutra is the secret treasury of all the Buddhas. It's the treasure-room, the locked vault. You can't just hand it out, can't just pass it around carelessly to anybody. This is what all the Buddhas in all the worlds have guarded and protected from ancient times until now. This teaching has never been revealed openly before.
Normal: "And this sutra—even while the Buddha is still alive, still in the world, there's plenty of hatred toward it, plenty of jealousy. How much more so after the Buddha's gone?"
Normal: "Medicine King, you need to know: After the Buddha leaves this world, if there's people who can copy this sutra, uphold it, read it, recite it, make offerings to it, explain it to others—the Buddha himself will cover them with his robe. He'll wrap them up, keep them safe.
Normal: "And they'll be protected and thought of by all the Buddhas in other lands, Buddhas who are alive right now in those worlds. These people got great faith-power, great will-power, great roots of goodness.
Normal: "You need to know: These people sleep in the same room as the Buddha. The Buddha himself lays his hand on their heads. He touches them."
Normal: "Medicine King, wherever this sutra is spoken, wherever it's read, wherever it's recited, wherever it's copied down, wherever the scripture-scroll stays—in all those places you should build a stupa made of seven precious materials. Make it extremely high, extremely wide, extremely decorated and beautiful.
Normal: "You don't need to put relics in it. You hear me? No need for relics.
Normal: "Why? Because this sutra right here already contains the Buddha's whole body. The complete body is already in there.
Normal: "This stupa should receive offerings of all kinds of flowers, incense, necklaces, silk canopies, banners and flags, music and singing. People should make offerings, show reverence, honor it, praise it.
Normal: "If anybody sees this stupa, bows to it, makes offerings to it—you need to know all these people are getting close to that supreme perfect enlightenment. They're almost there."
Normal: "Medicine King, there's a lot of people—whether they left home or still got a home—who say they're walking the bodhisattva path. But if they can't see this sutra, can't hear it, can't read it, can't recite it, can't copy it, can't uphold it, can't make offerings to it—you need to know these people haven't really walked the bodhisattva path the right way. They ain't doing it properly.
Normal: "But if there's beings who hear this sutra-teaching, who truly hear it—then they know how to walk the bodhisattva path the right way.
Normal: "Any being who's seeking the Buddha-way—if they see this Lotus Sutra or hear it, and after hearing it they believe it, understand it, receive it, uphold it—you need to know this person is getting close to that supreme perfect enlightenment. They're almost home."
Normal: "Medicine King, it's like this—imagine there's a person who's thirsty, desperate for water, needs it bad. So they go up on a high plateau, a high dry place, and they start digging, searching for water, working for it.
Normal: "At first they just see dry soil, dusty dirt. They know the water's still far off, still way down there.
Normal: "But they don't give up. They keep working, keep applying effort, don't quit. After a while they start seeing damp soil, wet dirt. Then gradually they hit mud.
Normal: "Their heart becomes certain, becomes settled. They know for sure: Water's definitely close now. It's right there.
Normal: "It's the same way with bodhisattvas. If they haven't heard this Lotus Sutra, haven't understood it, haven't been able to practice and cultivate it—you need to know these people are still far from that supreme perfect enlightenment. The water's still way down there.
Normal: "But if they hear it, understand it, think about it deeply, practice and cultivate it—then you can be certain, you can know for sure they're close to that supreme perfect enlightenment. The water's right there.
Normal: "Why? Because all bodhisattvas' supreme perfect enlightenment belongs to this sutra. This sutra opens the gate of skillful means. It reveals the true mark of reality. This Lotus Sutra treasury is deep, solid, hidden, distant. Nobody can reach it on their own.
Normal: "But now the Buddha teaches it, helps beings mature, brings bodhisattvas to completion, and opens it up for them. Shows them what's been hidden."
Normal: "Medicine King, if there's a bodhisattva who hears this Lotus Sutra and gets startled, doubtful, frightened—you need to know that's a brand-new bodhisattva, just started out. That's normal for beginners.
Normal: "If a voice-hearer, a disciple, hears this sutra and gets startled, doubtful, frightened—you need to know that's someone full of pride. That's arrogance talking."
Normal: "Medicine King, if a good man or good woman wants to teach this Lotus Sutra to the four assemblies after the Buddha's gone—how should they teach it? How should they do it?
Normal: "This good man or good woman needs to enter the Buddha's room, wear the Buddha's robe, sit on the Buddha's seat. Only then should they widely teach this sutra to the four assemblies.
Normal: "What's the Buddha's room? Great compassion for all beings—that's the Buddha's room.
Normal: "What's the Buddha's robe? Gentleness and patience—that's the Buddha's robe.
Normal: "What's the Buddha's seat? The emptiness of all things—that's the Buddha's seat.
Normal: "Settle yourself in these three. Establish yourself there. Then, with a heart that doesn't slack off, doesn't get lazy, teach this Lotus Sutra to the bodhisattvas and the four assemblies. Teach it wide."
Normal: "Medicine King, when I'm in other lands, other countries, I'll send magical people, conjured-up people, to gather an audience to hear the Dharma. I'll send magical monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen to listen to the teaching.
Normal: "These magical people, they'll hear the Dharma, believe it, receive it, follow it, not oppose it.
Normal: "If the teacher's in a secluded place, an empty quiet place, I'll send a whole host at that time—heavenly dragons, ghosts and spirits, gandharvas, asuras, all kinds of beings—to listen to the teaching.
Normal: "Even though I'm in another land, another country, I'll make sure the teacher sees me from time to time. If they forget a line of the sutra, forget the words, I'll appear and tell them again, help them get it complete."
Normal: If you want to cast off laziness,
Normal: Want to leave all slacking behind,
Normal: You should listen to this sutra here,
Normal: This sutra's hard to hear, hard to find.
Normal: Those who believe and receive it—
Normal: They're hard to find too, you see,
Normal: Like a person thirsty for water
Normal: Digging on a plateau, digging to get free.
Normal: Even when they see dry dusty soil,
Normal: They know the water's still far below,
Normal: But gradually they see damp dirt and mud,
Normal: They know for certain the water's close, they know.
Normal: Medicine King, you need to understand,
Normal: These people are like that, every one:
Normal: If they never heard the Lotus Sutra,
Normal: They're far from Buddha-wisdom, far from the sun.
Normal: But if they hear this deep sutra here,
Normal: This teaching that clarifies the voice-hearer's way,
Normal: This king of all the sutras,
Normal: And after hearing it they think on it, meditate and pray—
Normal: You need to know these people
Normal: Are close to Buddha-wisdom, getting near,
Normal: If somebody teaches this sutra to others,
Normal: They should enter the Buddha's room without fear.
Normal: They should put on the Buddha's robe,
Normal: Sit down on the Buddha's seat,
Normal: Then face the crowd without being scared,
Normal: Widely explain it, make the teaching complete.
Normal: Great compassion—that's the room,
Normal: Gentleness and patience—that's the robe you wear,
Normal: The emptiness of all things—that's the seat,
Normal: Settle in these and teach from there.
Normal: If while you're teaching this sutra
Normal: Somebody comes with an evil mouth to curse,
Normal: With swords and sticks and stones to attack,
Normal: Remember the Buddha and bear it—don't rehearse.
Normal: In thousands of millions of billions of lands
Normal: I show my pure and solid body still,
Normal: For countless billions of eons
Normal: I teach the Dharma to beings, that's my will.
Normal: After I'm gone from this world,
Normal: If there's somebody who can teach this sutra true,
Normal: I'll send four magical assemblies—
Normal: Monks and nuns, laymen and women too—
Normal: To make offerings to this Dharma-teacher,
Normal: To guide and gather the crowds all around,
Normal: To bring the beings together
Normal: So they can hear this teaching, hear this sound.
Normal: If people want to do evil,
Normal: Come with swords and sticks and stones to harm,
Normal: I'll send magical people to appear
Normal: To guard and protect them, keep them from alarm.
Normal: If the teacher's all alone,
Normal: In a secluded empty place somewhere,
Normal: Quiet and still with no human voices,
Normal: Reading and reciting this scripture there—
Normal: At that time I'll appear for them,
Normal: Show them my pure bright shining form,
Normal: If they forget a line or phrase,
Normal: I'll tell them again, help them perform.
Normal: If somebody has these virtues,
Normal: Whether teaching the four assemblies or alone,
Normal: Reading and reciting in empty places—
Normal: They all get to see me, get to see my throne.
Normal: If somebody's in a secluded spot,
Normal: I'll send heavenly dragon-kings their way,
Normal: Yakṣas, ghosts and spirits,
Normal: To be their Dharma-listening audience that day.
Normal: This person loves to teach the Dharma,
Normal: Explains it clearly without any block,
Normal: Because all the Buddhas protect and remember them,
Normal: They can make the great crowd rejoice, the whole flock.
Normal: If you stay close to a Dharma-teacher,
Normal: You'll quickly gain the bodhisattva way,
Normal: Follow and learn from this teacher,
Normal: You'll see Buddhas like Ganges sands one day.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER TEN: HONOR THE WORD-CARRIERS
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter is about honoring the carriers of wisdom, the teachers and preachers and truth-speakers who keep the word alive. In the blues/gospel tradition, there's deep reverence for those who carry the song forward, who keep the story going, who stand up and testify even when it's hard. This interpretation tries to honor that tradition.
Normal: Key Interpretive Choices:
Normal: The Title:
Normal: "Honor the Word-Carriers" captures the chapter's essence—this is about respecting those who carry, protect, and transmit the teaching.
Normal: Central Metaphors:
Normal: "Digging for water on a plateau" - Preserved this parable exactly because it's already perfect. The progression from dry soil → damp soil → mud → water is universal human experience.
Normal: "The Buddha's room, robe, and seat" - Kept these concrete, physical metaphors. Great compassion is a room you enter. Gentleness is a robe you put on. Emptiness is a seat you sit down on.
Normal: "Carried on the Buddha's shoulders" - A powerful image of being supported, held up, borne along by the Buddha himself.
Normal: The Warning Section:
Normal: The sharp contrast between cursing the Buddha (lighter sin) and badmouthing a teacher of the sutra (heavier sin) is shocking—and meant to be. This teaching says: The living carriers of wisdom are more vulnerable and thus deserve more protection than the Buddha himself.
Normal: Key Theological Points Preserved:
Normal: Universal accessibility
Normal: : "Even one verse, even one moment of joy" = enlightenment is promised to all.
Normal: Teachers are already enlightened
Normal: : They chose to be born here out of compassion.
Normal: The sutra contains Buddha's whole body
Normal: : No relics needed where this teaching is.
Normal: Buddha's ongoing protection
Normal: : He sends magical audiences, appears to help teachers who forget lines.
Normal: Rarity and preciousness
Normal: : This teaching is harder to find than water in the desert.
Normal: The three garments formula
Normal: : Compassion (room) + Patience (robe) + Emptiness (seat) = how to teach.
Normal: This chapter is ultimately about the sanctity of transmission, the holiness of teaching, the honor due to those who carry truth forward. The water-seeker parable is the perfect center: We're all thirsty. We're all digging. The teacher is the one who's hit mud, who knows the water's close, who can tell you to keep digging right there. Honor them. Listen to them. They're showing you where to find what you're desperate for.
Heading 1: CHAPTER ELEVEN: WHEN THE JEWELED TOWER ROSE UP
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: SEEING THE JEWELED STUPA
Normal: Now at that time, right there in front of the Buddha, a tower made of seven kinds of precious jewels comes rising up out of the ground. A tower! Five hundred yojanas tall—that's so high you can't even see the top—and two hundred and fifty yojanas wide. Coming up from under the earth, rising, rising, until it's hanging there in the middle of the air, just floating in space.
Normal: And this tower, it's decorated with every kind of precious thing you can imagine. It's got five thousand railings and balconies, ten thousand chambers and rooms, countless banners and flags hanging from it for adornment. Jeweled necklaces dripping down from it. Ten thousand billion precious bells hanging and ringing. And from all four sides of this tower comes the fragrance of tamāla and sandalwood incense, filling up the whole world with that sweet smell.
Normal: All the banners and canopies on this tower are made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, real pearls, rose-jade—seven precious materials all combined together. And this tower, it rises up so high it reaches all the way to the palaces of the Four Heavenly Kings.
Normal: And the thirty-three gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, they start raining down mandārava flowers as offerings to the jeweled tower. And all the other heavenly beings, the dragons, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans—thousands, ten thousands, billions of them—they all make offerings to this tower with every kind of flower, incense, necklaces, banners, canopies, and music, honoring it, respecting it, singing its praises.
Normal: Right then and there, from inside that jeweled tower, a great voice comes booming out, shouting in praise:
Normal: "Excellent! Excellent! Śākyamuni, World-Honored One! You're able to use your equal great wisdom to teach the Dharma for bodhisattvas, the Dharma that all Buddhas protect and keep in mind—this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra—teaching it to this great assembly. Yes! Yes! Śākyamuni, World-Honored One! Everything you're saying is TRUE. Every word is REAL."
Normal: At that time the four assemblies—they see this great jeweled tower hanging there in the air, and they hear that voice coming from inside the tower, and they all receive Dharma-joy, happiness rising up in them. They can't believe what they're seeing—never seen anything like this before in their lives. So they all stand up from their seats, respectfully bring their palms together, and step back to one side.
Normal: Now at that time there's a bodhisattva mahāsattva named Great Joy in Preaching. He knows what's in the hearts of all the world's heavenly beings, humans, asuras, and the rest—knows they're all wondering, all questioning. So he speaks to the Buddha and says:
Normal: "World-Honored One, what's the reason for this? What's the cause? Why did this jeweled tower rise up from the ground? And who's that voice speaking from inside it?"
Normal: Right then the Buddha tells Great Joy in Preaching Bodhisattva:
Normal: "Inside this jeweled tower there's the complete body of a tathāgata. Way back in the past, in the eastern direction, beyond countless thousands, ten thousands, billions of incalculable worlds, there's a land called Jewel-Purity. In that land there was a buddha named Prabhūtaratna—Many Treasures.
Normal: "When that buddha was walking the bodhisattva path, he made a great vow, a great promise. He said: 'If after I become a buddha and pass into extinction, in any of the lands in the ten directions where somebody is teaching the Dharma Flower Sutra, my stupa—my tower, my monument—will rise up and appear right there in front of them to bear witness to the teaching, to testify that it's true, to shout out "Excellent!"'
Normal: "After that buddha achieved the Way, when he was about to enter extinction, he spoke to the great assembly of heavenly and human beings, told all the monks: 'After I pass away, if anybody wants to make offerings to my complete body, they should build one great stupa.'
Normal: "And through that buddha's supernatural power and the power of his vow, throughout all the worlds in the ten directions, wherever, in whatever place, someone is teaching the Dharma Flower Sutra—that jeweled tower of his rises up right there in front of them, with his complete body inside it, and it calls out in praise: 'Excellent! Excellent!'
Normal: "Great Joy in Preaching, right now Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata's tower heard that the Dharma Flower Sutra was being taught, and so it rose up from the ground and is calling out in praise: 'Excellent! Excellent!'"
Normal: At that time Great Joy in Preaching Bodhisattva, through the Buddha's supernatural power, speaks to the Buddha and says:
Normal: "World-Honored One, we all wish we could see that buddha's body."
Normal: The Buddha tells Great Joy in Preaching Bodhisattva Mahāsattva:
Normal: "This Prabhūtaratna Buddha has a deep and weighty vow. He said: 'When my jeweled tower rises up before the buddhas to hear the Dharma Flower Sutra being taught, if somebody wants me to show my body to the four assemblies, then first all that buddha's emanation bodies—all his manifestations teaching the Dharma in the ten directions throughout all the worlds—those must all gather together and return to one place. Only then will my body appear.'
Normal: "Great Joy in Preaching, all my emanation bodies—all my manifestations throughout the worlds in the ten directions teaching the Dharma—they need to gather together now."
Normal: Great Joy in Preaching says to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, we also want to see your emanation bodies, all those World-Honored Ones. We want to bow to them and make offerings to them."
Normal: Right then the Buddha sends out a ray of white light from between his eyebrows, and immediately everyone sees the lands of the eastern direction—five hundred ten thousand billion nayutas of lands, as many as the sands of the Ganges River. And all those lands have lapis lazuli for their ground, adorned with jeweled trees and jeweled clothing. Countless thousands, ten thousands, billions of bodhisattvas fill up those lands. Jeweled canopies are spread everywhere, jeweled nets are draped above.
Normal: And the buddhas in all those lands are teaching the Dharma with great wonderful voices. And everyone sees countless thousands, ten thousands, billions of bodhisattvas filling those lands, teaching the Dharma to the multitudes.
Normal: The southern direction, the western direction, the northern direction, the four intermediate directions, the zenith and the nadir—wherever that white light from between the Buddha's eyebrows shines, it's the same in all those places.
Normal: At that time the buddhas in all ten directions each speak to the assemblies of bodhisattvas:
Normal: "Good sons, now we must go to the Sahā world, to where Śākyamuni Buddha is, and make offerings to Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata's jeweled tower."
Normal: Right then the Sahā world transforms and becomes pure. The ground is made of lapis lazuli, adorned with jeweled trees. Golden ropes mark out eight roads. There are no more villages, towns, cities. No more oceans, rivers, streams, or mountains, forests, thickets. Great precious incense is burning. Mandārava flowers cover the ground everywhere. Jeweled nets and canopies are spread over everything. Jeweled bells are hanging.
Normal: Only this assembly is left here. All the other heavenly and human beings are moved to other lands.
Normal: At that time all the buddhas, each one bringing with them one great bodhisattva as an attendant, come to the Sahā world and arrive at the base of jeweled trees.
Normal: Every one of those jeweled trees is five hundred yojanas tall, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits adorning them in perfect order. Under each jeweled tree there's a lion throne, five yojanas high, also decorated with great precious materials.
Normal: At that time all those buddhas each sit down cross-legged on one of those lion seats.
Normal: And they keep arriving, one after another, filling up the entire three-thousand great thousand-world system. And still all the emanation bodies of Śākyamuni Buddha from just one direction—just the eastern direction—haven't all arrived yet. There's not enough room.
Normal: So Śākyamuni Buddha, wanting to make room for all his emanation bodies to sit down, transforms another two hundred ten thousand billion nayuta lands in each of the eight directions. He makes them all pure—no hells, no hungry ghosts, no animals, no asuras. And he moves all the heavenly and human beings to other lands.
Normal: These newly transformed lands also have lapis lazuli for their ground, adorned with jeweled trees. The trees are five hundred yojanas tall, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits perfectly adorned in order. Under each tree there's a jeweled lion throne, five yojanas high, adorned with various precious materials.
Normal: And there are no more oceans, rivers, or mountains—no Mount Mucilinda, no Great Mount Mucilinda, no Iron Ring Mountains, no Great Iron Ring Mountains, no Mount Sumeru, none of those mountain kings. Everything merges into one buddha-land. The jeweled ground is level and flat. Jeweled canopies cover everything. Banners and flags are hanging. Precious incense is burning. Heavenly jeweled flowers cover the ground.
Normal: Still not enough room!
Normal: So Śākyamuni Buddha transforms another two hundred ten thousand billion nayuta lands in each of the eight directions, all made pure—no hells, no hungry ghosts, no animals, no asuras. All the heavenly and human beings are moved to other lands.
Normal: These newly transformed lands also have lapis lazuli for their ground, adorned with jeweled trees five hundred yojanas tall, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits perfectly adorned. Under each tree there's a jeweled lion throne, five yojanas high, also decorated with great precious materials.
Normal: No oceans, no rivers, no mountains—no Mount Mucilinda, no Great Mount Mucilinda, no Iron Ring Mountains, no Great Iron Ring Mountains, no Mount Sumeru, none of those. Everything merges into one buddha-land. The jeweled ground is level and flat. Jeweled canopies cover everything. Banners and flags are hanging. Precious incense is burning. Heavenly jeweled flowers cover the ground everywhere.
Normal: At that time the emanation bodies of Śākyamuni Buddha from the eastern direction—from hundreds of thousands of tens of thousands of billions of nayutas of lands as numerous as Ganges sands—all those buddhas arrive one after another and gather together here.
Normal: And like this, gradually, the buddhas from all ten directions all arrive and gather, sitting in the eight directions.
Normal: At that time, in each of the eight directions, there are four hundred ten thousand billion nayuta lands filled completely with buddhas, tathāgatas.
Normal: At that time all those buddhas are each sitting under a jeweled tree on a lion throne, and they each send their attendants to go inquire after Śākyamuni Buddha. They each give the attendant a handful of jeweled flowers and tell them:
Normal: "Good son, you go to Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain, to where Śākyamuni Buddha is, and speak to him in our name, saying: 'Are you well? Are you free from illness and trouble? Are your strength and energy comfortable? Are the bodhisattvas and voice-hearers all safe and peaceful?' Then scatter these jeweled flowers before the Buddha as an offering, and say: 'That certain buddha wishes to have this jeweled tower opened.'"
Normal: All the buddhas send their messengers like this.
Normal: At that time Śākyamuni Buddha sees all his emanation bodies—they've all arrived and gathered. Each one is sitting on a lion throne. And he hears all those buddhas saying they want the jeweled tower opened together.
Normal: So right then Śākyamuni Buddha rises up from his seat and stands there in the air, floating in space.
Normal: All the four assemblies stand up too, bringing their palms together, single-mindedly watching the Buddha.
Normal: Then Śākyamuni Buddha uses his right finger to open the door of the seven-jeweled tower. It makes a great sound—a loud sound—like pulling back the bolt and opening the gate of a great city.
Normal: Immediately, right then, everyone in that whole assembly sees Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata sitting on a lion throne inside the jeweled tower, his body complete, not scattered, not decayed, like he's in deep meditation.
Normal: And they hear him say:
Normal: "Excellent! Excellent! Śākyamuni Buddha, you've spoken this Dharma Flower Sutra joyfully, gladly. I came here to listen to this sutra. That's why I'm here."
Normal: At that time the four assemblies—seeing this buddha who passed into extinction countless thousands, ten thousands, billions of eons ago, hearing him speak these words—they're amazed beyond measure, never seen anything like it. They scatter heaps of heavenly jeweled flowers on Prabhūtaratna Buddha and Śākyamuni Buddha.
Normal: Right then Prabhūtaratna Buddha, inside that jeweled tower, moves over and makes half his seat available. Then he speaks to Śākyamuni Buddha, saying:
Normal: "Śākyamuni Buddha, come sit here."
Normal: Immediately Śākyamuni Buddha enters that tower and sits down on half the seat, sitting cross-legged.
Normal: At that time the great assembly sees two tathāgatas inside the seven-jeweled tower sitting together on the lion throne in full lotus position.
Normal: And everyone in the assembly thinks to themselves: "The buddhas are sitting way up high, too far away. We wish the Thus-Come One would use his supernatural power to let all of us be in space too."
Normal: Right then Śākyamuni Buddha, using his supernatural power, lifts the whole great assembly up into the air.
Normal: Then, with a great voice, a mighty voice, Śākyamuni Buddha speaks to all the four assemblies:
Normal: "WHO can teach this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra far and wide in this Sahā world? Now is the time! Now is the moment!
Normal: "The Thus-Come One is about to enter nirvāṇa soon. The Buddha wants to entrust this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra to someone, to put it in someone's hands."
Normal: That holy lord, that world-honored one,
Normal: Though he passed away so long ago,
Normal: He's sitting in this jeweled tower now,
Normal: He came here for the Dharma, you know.
Normal: How can you people not be diligent,
Normal: Not work hard for the sake of the Dharma too?
Normal: This buddha's been extinct for countless eons,
Normal: He goes place to place to hear it taught—that's what he'll do.
Normal: That buddha made a vow when he was alive:
Normal: "After I'm gone from this world here,
Normal: Wherever I go, wherever I travel,
Normal: I'm always going to hear this Dharma, year after year."
Normal: And all my emanation bodies—
Normal: Countless buddhas numerous as Ganges sands—
Normal: They came here to hear the Dharma taught,
Normal: They came to see Many Treasures, left their own lands.
Normal: They each abandoned their wonderful pure lands,
Normal: Left behind their disciples and crowds,
Normal: Left the heavenly dragons, spirits, and gods,
Normal: All the offerings, all the vows.
Normal: They came here to make the Dharma last long,
Normal: That's why they're here now, you see.
Normal: And to seat all these buddhas properly,
Normal: I used supernatural power to move countless beings,
Normal: Made this whole land pure and clean.
Normal: Each buddha went to a jeweled tree,
Normal: Like lotuses adorning a clear pure pond.
Normal: Under each jeweled tree there's a lion throne,
Normal: With the buddhas sitting on them, bright and strong.
Normal: Sitting there, they shine with radiant light,
Normal: Adorning everything all around,
Normal: Like in the dark night when you light a great torch—
Normal: That's how bright these buddhas look, how they sound.
Normal: Their bodies give off wonderful fragrance,
Normal: Filling up the lands in all ten directions,
Normal: Living beings smell that perfume and rejoice,
Normal: Can't control their joy—it's beyond their conceptions.
Normal: It's like a great wind shaking little tree branches—
Normal: That's how I use this skillful device
Normal: To make the Dharma last forever,
Normal: To make it endure, to make it suffice.
Normal: I'm telling all of you in this great assembly:
Normal: After I'm gone from this world here,
Normal: Who can protect, uphold, read, and teach this sutra?
Normal: Come stand before the Buddha now, let me hear!
Normal: That Prabhūtaratna Buddha,
Normal: Though he passed away so long ago,
Normal: Made a great vow and gave a lion's roar—
Normal: He came here to testify, to let you know.
Normal: Many Treasures Thus-Come One
Normal: And me myself, my very own body,
Normal: And all these gathered emanation buddhas—
Normal: You need to understand this intention, you need to see.
Normal: All you children of the Buddha,
Normal: Who among you can protect this Dharma-teaching?
Normal: You should make a great vow right now,
Normal: Make it last forever—that's what I'm beseeching.
Normal: Whoever can protect this sutra,
Normal: This Dharma, this teaching, this precious thing,
Normal: They're making offerings to me
Normal: And to Many Treasures—that's what it will bring.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER ELEVEN: WHEN THE JEWELED TOWER ROSE UP
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter is pure cosmic theater—supernatural testimony, infinite gathering, and prophetic challenge rolled into one spectacular vision. In the blues/gospel tradition, this is revival meeting energy, the testimony of the long-dead rising up to speak truth, the gathering of witnesses from every direction, and then the call: "Who's gonna carry this word forward when I'm gone?" This interpretation tries to capture that drama, that urgency, that cosmic scale.
Normal: Key Interpretive Choices:
Normal: The Rising Tower
Normal: - I kept this concrete and visual: rising from the ground, hanging in the air, covered with jewels, bells ringing, incense pouring out. This is spectacular, impossible, overwhelming.
Normal: The Voice from Inside
Normal: - A dead Buddha speaking from inside his own monument: "What you're teaching is TRUE!" This is testimony from beyond, validation from the other side.
Normal: The Gathering of Infinite Buddhas
Normal: - This is the most spectacular gathering scene in the whole sutra. Buddhas from every direction, so many they fill multiple transformed worlds.
Normal: Two Buddhas Sitting Together
Normal: - This is the theological and visual climax. Prabhūtaratna moves over on his throne: "Come sit here." And Śākyamuni enters the floating tower and sits beside him. This is past and present together, testimony and teaching united.
Normal: The Six Difficulties
Normal: - This is prophetic challenge in full force. The Buddha lists impossible things and says ALL OF THOSE are easier than teaching this sutra after he's gone in an evil age.
Normal: Key Theological Points Preserved:
Normal: Testimony and Witness
Normal: : Prabhūtaratna's whole purpose is to testify that the teaching is true.
Normal: The Vow that Transcends Death
Normal: : Prabhūtaratna died countless eons ago, but his vow is still alive.
Normal: The Unity of All Buddhas
Normal: : The emanation bodies aren't separate beings—they're all Śākyamuni teaching in different places.
Normal: The Prophetic Challenge
Normal: : "Who will carry this forward after I'm gone?"
Normal: The Measurement of Difficulty
Normal: : Teaching truth in an age of lies is harder than any physical impossibility.
Normal: "This sutra is the Buddha's body"
Normal: - This is not metaphor. The teaching IS the teacher.
Normal: This chapter is about the weight of transmission. It's about understanding that carrying truth forward through dark times is the hardest thing there is. It's about the gathering of all the witnesses—across time, across space—to say "This matters. This is real. Someone needs to carry this."
Heading 1: CHAPTER TWELVE: WHEN YOUR ENEMY WAS YOUR TEACHER
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: DEVADATTA
Normal: Right then the Buddha speaks to all the bodhisattvas and the four assemblies—all the heavenly and human beings gathered there. He says:
Normal: "Listen now. Way back in the past, further back than you can count, beyond measureless kalpas, I was searching for this Lotus Sutra teaching. Searching and searching, and I never got tired, never gave up, never said 'I can't do this no more.'
Normal: "For many kalpas—age after age—I was born as a king. A king! Had everything a man could want. But I made a vow, made a promise in my heart: I'm gonna seek the supreme enlightenment, that highest awakening. And my heart never turned back, never said 'Maybe tomorrow,' never said 'This is good enough.'
Normal: "I wanted to fulfill the six perfections—generosity, discipline, patience, effort, meditation, wisdom—all six of them complete. So I practiced giving, practiced it hard. Gave away everything. Didn't hold back nothing. Elephants—gave them away. Horses—gave them away. The seven precious treasures—gave them away. My kingdom—gave it away. My cities—gave them away. My wife, my children—gave them away. My servants, my attendants—gave them away. Even gave away my head, my eyes, my marrow and my brain, my flesh, my hands, my feet. Didn't care about my body, didn't care about my life. Just gave.
Normal: "At that time, people lived long lives, lived for measureless years. But for the sake of the Dharma—for the sake of the truth—I gave up my throne, turned over the government to my son, and I beat a drum and sent out a proclamation to the four directions, calling out: 'Who can teach me the great vehicle? Who's got the real teaching? Whoever can speak the great vehicle for me—the Mahayana—I'll serve you my whole life. I'll be your servant. I'll work for you. I'll run when you say run.'
Normal: "And then this ascetic came. This hermit. He came to the palace and said to the king: 'I've got the great vehicle. I've got a teaching called the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra. But you got to listen to me. If you don't go against me, if you do what I say, I'll teach it to you.'
Normal: "When the king heard what the ascetic said, he was so happy he jumped for joy! Jumped up! Said 'Yes!' Right away he followed that ascetic, attended to him, gave him everything he needed. I went and gathered fruit for him. I drew water from the well for him. I chopped firewood for him. I prepared his food for him. I even used my own body as his bed, as his seat, so he could sit and rest. Laid down flat so he could sit on my back.
Normal: "And my body never got tired. My mind never got tired. I served him like that for a thousand years. One thousand years! All for the sake of the Dharma. Working hard, serving, making sure he never lacked for nothing."
Normal: I remember the old days, long past time,
Normal: When I was seeking the great Dharma in my prime.
Normal: Though I was a king of the world, sitting on a throne,
Normal: I didn't want the five desires—didn't want what I owned.
Normal: I rang the bell, sent word to the four directions wide:
Normal: "Who's got the great Dharma? Come on, step inside.
Normal: Whoever can teach me, explain it to my face,
Normal: I'll be your servant, take the lowest place."
Normal: Then came an ascetic, old hermit man,
Normal: Came to the great king, said "I've got a plan.
Normal: I've got a subtle, wonderful teaching, rare to find,
Normal: The kind of Dharma that blows the worldly mind.
Normal: If you can practice it, if you can walk this road,
Normal: I'll teach it to you, lighten your load."
Normal: When the king heard the ascetic's word,
Normal: His heart filled up with joy—best thing he ever heard!
Normal: Right away he followed that hermit man,
Normal: Gave him everything, did all he can.
Normal: Gathered firewood, picked fruit from the vine,
Normal: Gave it to him respectfully, right on time.
Normal: My body kept the wonderful Dharma close at hand,
Normal: Body and mind never tired, never said "I can't stand."
Normal: I did it for all living beings, every single one,
Normal: Sought the great Dharma for everyone under the sun.
Normal: Didn't do it for myself or the five desires' pleasure,
Normal: Did it as the king of a great country, seeking treasure.
Normal: Sought and got this Dharma, didn't quit the course,
Normal: And that's why I became a buddha, found the source.
Normal: Now I'm telling you this story—here's the force.
Normal: The Buddha tells all the monks:
Normal: "That king back then—that was me. I was that king.
Normal: "And the ascetic, that hermit man—that was Devadatta. That's who he is now.
Normal: "Because Devadatta was a good spiritual friend to me, because he taught me, because he pushed me, I was able to perfect the six perfections. I got compassion perfected. I got loving-kindness perfected. I got sympathetic joy perfected. I got equanimity perfected. I got the thirty-two marks. I got the eighty minor characteristics. I got this purple-golden color. I got the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, the four methods of attraction, the eighteen unique qualities. I got supernatural penetrations and the power of the Way.
Normal: "I became perfectly, completely enlightened. I teach beings far and wide.
Normal: "All because Devadatta was a good spiritual friend."
Normal: The Buddha tells the four assemblies:
Normal: "Devadatta—after incalculable kalpas have passed, he's gonna become a buddha. You hear me? He's gonna be called Heaven-King Tathāgata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.
Normal: "His world will be called Heaven-Way.
Normal: "When Heaven-King Buddha is dwelling in the world, he'll be there for twenty intermediate kalpas, teaching beings the wonderful Dharma. As many beings as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River—that many will attain arhat-fruit. Countless beings will awaken the mind of the pratyekabuddha, the solitary realizer. As many beings as grains of sand in the Ganges will awaken the supreme enlightenment mind, will attain the patience of non-arising, will reach non-regression.
Normal: "After Heaven-King Buddha enters nirvāṇa, the Correct Dharma will remain in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas.
Normal: "His whole-body relics will be in a stupa made of the seven precious treasures—a tower sixty yojanas high, forty yojanas wide on every side. All the devas and human beings will make offerings to it with mixed flowers, powdered incense, burning incense, perfume paste, clothing, necklaces, banners, flags, jeweled canopies, music, and singing. They'll bow down and honor that wonderful seven-jeweled tower.
Normal: "Countless beings will attain arhat-fruit. Countless beings will awaken to the pratyekabuddha way. Inconceivable numbers of beings will bring forth the enlightenment mind and reach non-regression."
Normal: The Buddha tells all the monks:
Normal: "In a future age, if there are good men or good women who hear this Devadatta Chapter of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra, and they believe it with pure hearts, respect it, don't doubt it—they won't fall into hell, won't fall into the realm of hungry ghosts, won't fall into the animal realm.
Normal: "They'll be born right there in front of buddhas in the ten directions. Wherever they're born, they'll always be hearing this sutra.
Normal: "If they're born among humans or devas, they'll receive supremely wonderful happiness.
Normal: "If they're born in the presence of a buddha, they'll be born by transformation from a lotus flower."
Normal: Right then, Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva—the one who came with Many Treasures World-Honored One from below—he says to Many Treasures Buddha:
Normal: "We should return to our homeland now."
Normal: But Śākyamuni Buddha tells Wisdom-Accumulation:
Normal: "Good son, wait a little while, just a little bit. There's a bodhisattva here named Mañjuśrī—Wonderful Virtue. You should meet him. You should talk with him about the wonderful Dharma. Then you can return to your homeland."
Normal: And right at that moment, Mañjuśrī is sitting on a thousand-petaled lotus flower, big as a chariot wheel. And the bodhisattvas who came with him are also sitting on jeweled lotus flowers. They rise up naturally from the great ocean, from the palace of Sāgara the Dragon King. They come up, suspended in empty space. They go to Vulture Peak Mountain. They step down from their lotus flowers and go to where the Buddha is. They bow their heads to the ground, honoring the feet of both World-Honored Ones—both buddhas sitting there. When they finish paying respects, they go to where Wisdom-Accumulation is sitting. They exchange greetings, ask how each other is doing. Then they sit down to one side.
Normal: Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva asks Mañjuśrī:
Normal: "You went to the dragon palace. How many beings did you teach down there? How many did you convert?"
Normal: Mañjuśrī says:
Normal: "The number is immeasurable. Can't count them. Can't calculate them. Can't speak it with the mouth. Can't measure it with the mind. Just wait a little while. You'll have your proof. You'll see for yourself."
Normal: Before he even finishes speaking, countless bodhisattvas sitting on jeweled lotus flowers come rising up from the ocean. They come to Vulture Peak Mountain and stay there, suspended in empty space.
Normal: All these bodhisattvas were taught and transformed by Mañjuśrī. They've all accomplished the bodhisattva practices. They're all discussing the six perfections together.
Normal: The ones who used to be śrāvakas, hearers—they're up there in empty space, but they're teaching the śrāvaka practices. But now they're all practicing the emptiness teaching of the great vehicle.
Normal: Mañjuśrī says to Wisdom-Accumulation:
Normal: "The teaching and transforming I did in the ocean—it went like this. That's what happened."
Normal: Then Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva speaks in verse to praise him:
Normal: You have great wisdom, virtue, courage, strength—
Normal: You've taught and transformed countless beings, great length.
Normal: Now this great assembly and I have all seen
Normal: The real characteristics expounded, what they mean.
Normal: You've revealed the one vehicle Dharma, opened it clear,
Normal: You've guided all living beings, brought them near.
Normal: You help them quickly achieve the enlightenment way—
Normal: That's what you've been doing, night and day.
Normal: Mañjuśrī says:
Normal: "When I was in the ocean, I only kept teaching the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra. Nothing else. Just this."
Normal: Wisdom-Accumulation asks Mañjuśrī:
Normal: "This sutra is so deep, so subtle, so wonderful. It's the treasure of all sutras. It's rare in the world. Is there any living being who practiced this sutra diligently, put real effort into it, and quickly became a buddha? Tell me—did that happen?"
Normal: Mañjuśrī says:
Normal: "There's the daughter of Sāgara the Dragon King. She just turned eight years old. Eight! But she's got sharp wisdom, keen intelligence. She understands all the roots and karmic actions of living beings. She's got dhāraṇī. She can receive and hold all the deep secret treasures taught by the buddhas—every word, she holds it.
Normal: "She's entered deep into meditation. She thoroughly understands all dharmas. In the space of an instant—one moment—she brought forth the enlightenment mind. She reached non-regression. Her eloquence has no obstruction, no barrier.
Normal: "She thinks of living beings with compassion, like they're her own children. Her merit and virtue are complete. When she thinks something in her mind, when she speaks it with her mouth, it's subtle, wonderful, vast, and great. She's compassionate, humane, yielding, gentle. Her will and spirit are harmonious and refined.
Normal: "She can reach enlightenment. She can arrive at bodhi."
Normal: Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva says:
Normal: "I've seen Śākyamuni Tathāgata. For immeasurable kalpas he practiced difficult and bitter practices. He accumulated merit, piled up virtue, seeking the bodhisattva way. He never stopped, not even for a moment. I look at this great thousand-world system—every part of it, down to a space as small as a mustard seed—there's not one spot that's not a place where the Bodhisattva gave up his body and life for the sake of living beings. Only after all that did he achieve the enlightenment way.
Normal: "I don't believe this girl, in just a brief instant, could achieve perfect enlightenment. Can't believe it."
Normal: Before he even finishes speaking, the dragon king's daughter suddenly appears right there in front of them. She bows, touching her head to the ground in respect, then stands to one side. She speaks in verse to praise the Buddha:
Normal: You deeply understand the marks of sin and merit,
Normal: You illuminate the ten directions—all can hear it.
Normal: Your subtle, wonderful, pure dharma body, so sublime,
Normal: Has the thirty-two marks, perfect in every sign.
Normal: The eighty minor characteristics adorn the dharma body bright,
Normal: Honored by devas and humans, worshipped day and night.
Normal: Dragons and spirits all bow down with respect—
Normal: Every kind of living being honors you, every sect.
Normal: I've also heard you've achieved the enlightenment way,
Normal: Only a buddha can bear witness to this, I say.
Normal: I'm revealing the great vehicle teaching, opening it wide,
Normal: To rescue suffering beings on every side.
Normal: Right then, Śāriputra speaks to the dragon girl and says:
Normal: "You say you're about to quickly attain supreme enlightenment? But that's hard to believe. Can't be trusted. Why not?
Normal: "A woman's body is filthy, impure. It's not a vessel for the Dharma. How could you attain supreme enlightenment?
Normal: "The buddha-way is so vast, so far away! You have to practice through immeasurable kalpas, endure bitterness, pile up practices, perfect all the perfections. Only then do you succeed.
Normal: "Plus, a woman's body has five obstacles. What are they?
Normal: "First, she can't become a Brahma Heaven King.
Normal: "Second, she can't become Indra.
Normal: "Third, she can't become Mara, the demon king.
Normal: "Fourth, she can't become a wheel-turning sage king.
Normal: "Fifth, she can't become a buddha.
Normal: "So how could a woman's body quickly achieve buddhahood? Can't happen."
Normal: Right then the dragon girl had a precious jewel, worth as much as a great thousand-world system—worth three thousand great thousand worlds. She held it up and presented it to the Buddha.
Normal: The Buddha received it immediately.
Normal: The dragon girl said to Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva and to the Venerable Śāriputra:
Normal: "I presented a precious jewel, and the World-Honored One accepted it. Was that quick or not?"
Normal: They answered: "Very quick!"
Normal: The girl said:
Normal: "Use your spiritual power. Watch me become a buddha. It's gonna be even faster than that."
Normal: Right at that moment, everyone in the assembly saw the dragon girl suddenly—in an instant—transform into a male. She perfected the bodhisattva practices. Immediately she went south to the Spotless World. She sat down on a jeweled lotus flower and achieved perfect, complete enlightenment. She had the thirty-two marks. She had the eighty minor characteristics. She taught the wonderful Dharma for all living beings throughout the ten directions.
Normal: At that time, in this Saha world—all the bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, the eight classes of devas and dragons, humans and non-humans—they all saw from far away that dragon girl becoming a buddha, teaching the Dharma to all the devas and humans gathered at that time.
Normal: Their hearts filled up with great joy. They all bowed in reverence from a distance.
Normal: Countless living beings heard the Dharma, understood it, awakened to it. They attained non-regression.
Normal: Countless living beings received prophecies of their future enlightenment.
Normal: The Spotless World shook in six ways.
Normal: Three thousand living beings in this Saha world reached the ground of non-regression. Three thousand living beings brought forth the enlightenment mind and received prophecies.
Normal: Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva, the Venerable Śāriputra, and the whole assembly—they all silently believed and accepted this.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER TWELVE: WHEN YOUR ENEMY WAS YOUR TEACHER
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This is Chapter 12 of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra, translated from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese (406 CE) into blues/gospel vernacular English.
Normal: This chapter carries one of the most revolutionary messages in the entire sutra: that enlightenment is immediate and available to all, regardless of social barriers. The Buddha reveals that Devadatta—his cousin who tried to kill him, who split the sangha, who is in hell for his crimes—was actually his greatest teacher. Through opposition and resistance, Devadatta pushed the Buddha toward complete awakening.
Normal: Then comes the dragon princess—an eight-year-old girl, non-human, doubly excluded by the "five obstacles" doctrine—who demonstrates instant enlightenment right there in front of everyone who said it was impossible.
Normal: Key metaphors in this interpretation:
Normal: "Your Enemy Was Your Teacher"
Normal: - The chapter title captures the radical teaching that life's hardest trials and greatest opponents can be our deepest educators. This resonates with the blues tradition's understanding that suffering teaches, that the hard road makes you wise.
Normal: The King Becoming a Servant
Normal: - I rendered the Buddha's past-life story of royal power surrendered for truth as a blues narrative of status reversed: "I was a king / Had everything a man could want." This mirrors the gospel theme of the last being first, the high brought low.
Normal: "Watch how fast this is"
Normal: - The dragon princess's challenge becomes vernacular direct speech, the kind of thing someone would actually say before demonstrating impossible grace.
Normal: Instant transformation
Normal: - The sudden shift from female to male to enlightened buddha happens "right at that moment," "in an instant," "suddenly"—language of the spontaneous grace moment central to gospel testimony, when everything changes in the blink of an eye.
Normal: This chapter is about barriers broken, impossibilities made possible, enemies revealed as friends, and the instantaneous nature of awakening—themes that resonate deeply with the African American spiritual tradition's understanding of liberation, reversal, and sudden grace.
Heading 1: CHAPTER THIRTEEN: WHEN THE ROAD GETS ROUGH, YOU GOTTA KEEP WALKING
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE FIRST VOW - MEDICINE KING AND GREAT JOY STEP FORWARD
Normal: Now at that time, Medicine King Bodhisattva and Great Joy in Preaching Bodhisattva—these two great souls—they stood up together with twenty thousand of their brother and sister bodhisattvas. They all gathered right there in front of the Buddha, and they made a promise, you hear me, they made a VOW:
Normal: "World-Honored One, don't you worry yourself none. Don't let your mind be troubled about what's coming. When you gone from this world, when you passed on to the other shore, WE gonna be here. We gonna hold this teaching. We gonna read it, recite it, explain it, and live it out.
Normal: "Now we know—Lord, we KNOW—that the times coming after you leave gonna be dark times, evil times. The people gonna have less and less good roots growing in their hearts. They gonna be full up with pride, puffed up like balloons thinking they somebody special. They gonna be hungry for profit, greedy for respect, chasing after offerings and honors. They gonna feed the wrong seeds in their souls, and they gonna be far, far away from freedom.
Normal: "Teaching them gonna be like trying to get water from a stone. It's gonna be HARD. But we making a promise right here, right now: We gonna raise up a GREAT PATIENCE inside ourselves. We gonna read this sutra, hold it, speak it, write it down, and honor it every way we can. And we ain't gonna hold back. We ain't gonna spare our bodies. We ain't gonna count the cost. Even if it take our very lives—we gonna carry this teaching forward."
Heading 2: THE SECOND VOW - FIVE HUNDRED ARHATS STAND UP
Normal: Now right then, five hundred arhats in that assembly—these was the ones who already got their prophecy from Buddha, who already been told their names gonna shine—they spoke up to the Buddha, saying:
Normal: "World-Honored One, we making our own vow too. We gonna take this sutra to OTHER LANDS. We gonna go to foreign countries, strange territories, places far from here, and we gonna spread this teaching wide."
Heading 2: THE THIRD VOW - EIGHT THOUSAND DISCIPLES JOIN IN
Normal: And then there was eight thousand more—some still learning, some done with learning, all of them just got their prophecy too. They rose up from their seats, put their palms together in respect, and they said to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, we gonna go to other lands too. We gonna spread this sutra far and wide in those places.
Normal: "And why we doing that? Why we going AWAY from here? Because THIS Sahā world, this endurance-land we standing in right now—Lord have mercy—it's FULL of sorry, trifling people. Full of folks with their chests puffed out, full of arrogance and shallow virtue. Full of anger and corruption, full of crooked hearts and lying tongues. Ain't no truth in them.
Normal: "So we taking this teaching somewhere else, where maybe folks got a chance to hear it clean."
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA'S AUNT GETS HER PROPHECY
Normal: Now at that time, the Buddha's aunt—her name was Mahāprajāpatī, and she was a nun, a bhikṣuṇī—she stood up together with six thousand other nuns, some still learning and some done with learning. They all rose from their seats as one, pressed their palms together, and they looked up at the Blessed One's face. They looked at him with their whole hearts, couldn't take their eyes off him, not even for a second.
Normal: And the World-Honored One, he saw that look on her face and he said to her:
Normal: "Gautamī"—that was her family name, Gautamī—"why you looking at me with such worry in your eyes? Why you gazing at the Tathāgata like your heart about to break? You thinking maybe I ain't said your name? You thinking maybe I ain't given you your prophecy of supreme, perfect enlightenment—anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?"
Normal: And then Buddha said:
Normal: "Gautamī, listen here. When I spoke before about ALL the voice-hearers getting their prophecy, you was INCLUDED in that, you hear me? But now, if you want to know the particulars, if you want to know YOUR specific name and YOUR specific promise, then listen:
Normal: "In the world that's coming, you gonna be a GREAT DHARMA TEACHER in the Dharma of sixty-eight thousand billion Buddhas. Count them—SIXTY-EIGHT THOUSAND BILLION! And these six thousand nuns with you, still learning and done with learning, they gonna be Dharma teachers right alongside you.
Normal: "And you gonna walk that Bodhisattva path step by step, gradually perfecting yourself, until you BECOME a Buddha yourself. And your name gonna be: ALL-BEINGS-REJOICE-TO-SEE TATHĀGATA, ARHAT, PERFECTLY ENLIGHTENED ONE, PERFECT IN KNOWLEDGE AND CONDUCT, WELL-GONE, KNOWER OF THE WORLD, UNSURPASSED ONE, TAMER OF BEINGS, TEACHER OF DEVAS AND HUMANS, BUDDHA, WORLD-HONORED ONE.
Normal: "And Gautamī, when you become that Buddha—All-Beings-Rejoice-to-See Buddha—you and these six thousand bodhisattvas with you, y'all gonna take turns giving prophecies to each other, passing on the promise of supreme, perfect enlightenment from one to the next like a torch that never goes out."
Heading 2: RĀHULA'S MOTHER GETS HER PROPHECY
Normal: Now at that time, Rāhula's mother—her name was Yaśodharā, and she was a nun too—she had a thought in her mind. She thought:
Normal: "The World-Honored One, when he giving out all these prophecies, he ain't said MY name. He ain't called ME out specifically."
Normal: And the Buddha, he knew her heart. He told Yaśodharā:
Normal: "In the world that's coming, in a hundred thousand million billion Buddha-Dharmas, you gonna walk the Bodhisattva path. You gonna be a GREAT DHARMA TEACHER. And gradually, step by step, you gonna complete the Buddha-way.
Normal: "And in a land called Excellent, a GOOD country, you gonna become a Buddha. Your name gonna be: POSSESSING-MYRIAD-LIGHT-MARKS TATHĀGATA, ARHAT, PERFECTLY ENLIGHTENED ONE, PERFECT IN KNOWLEDGE AND CONDUCT, WELL-GONE, KNOWER OF THE WORLD, UNSURPASSED ONE, TAMER OF BEINGS, TEACHER OF DEVAS AND HUMANS, BUDDHA, WORLD-HONORED ONE.
Normal: "And that Buddha's lifespan? It gonna be beyond measure, countless as the grains of sand in the Ganges, lasting through innumerable, incalculable kalpas."
Heading 2: THE NUNS SING THEIR JOY
Normal: At that time, Mahāprajāpatī the nun and Yaśodharā the nun, along with all their companions, they were filled up with joy like they never known before. Their hearts was OVERFLOWING. And right there in front of the Buddha, they sang out in verse:
Normal: World-Honored One, you our guide and teacher,
Normal: You bring peace to all the gods and humans,
Normal: Now we done HEARD our prophecy,
Normal: And our hearts is FULL, our hearts is SATISFIED,
Normal: Our hearts is resting easy, got everything we need.
Normal: And when the nuns finished singing that verse, they said to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, we ready too. We gonna go to other lands, foreign countries, and we gonna spread this sutra far and wide."
Heading 2: THE GREAT VOW - EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION BODHISATTVAS MAKE THE ULTIMATE PROMISE
Normal: Now at that time, the World-Honored One, he looked out over the assembly. He looked at eight hundred million nayutas of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas—count them, EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION NAYUTAS of great beings!
Normal: These wasn't no beginners. These was bodhisattvas who CANNOT FALL BACK—avinivartanīya—they done passed the point of no return. They turn the wheel of no-retreating Dharma. They got all the dhāraṇīs, all the mystical formulas and powers.
Normal: These great souls, they rose up from their seats together and went before the Buddha. They pressed their palms together with one mind, one heart, and they thought to themselves:
Normal: "If the World-Honored One tell us to uphold and teach this sutra, then we gonna follow his instruction. We gonna spread this Dharma wide like he say."
Normal: But then they thought again:
Normal: "But the Buddha, he sitting there SILENT. He ain't saying nothing. He ain't giving us no command. So what we supposed to do?"
Normal: Now these bodhisattvas, they understood the Buddha's mind. They knew his heart. They wanted to RESPECT his intention, and they also wanted to FULFILL their own original vows, the promises they made long, long ago.
Normal: So right there in front of the Buddha, they let out a LION'S ROAR—that's what they call it when you speak with power and authority and ain't scared of nothing—and they made this vow. They said:
Normal: "World-Honored One, after you gone—after the Tathāgata done passed into final nirvāṇa—we gonna travel back and forth through the ten directions, all the worlds everywhere. We gonna make it so beings can WRITE this sutra down, HOLD it in their hearts, READ it with their mouths, RECITE it from memory, UNDERSTAND what it means, and PRACTICE it the right way, keeping it in their minds with right remembrance.
Normal: "All of this gonna happen because of the BUDDHA'S POWER, the Buddha's authority and grace. So we asking you, World-Honored One: When you in other lands far away from here, WATCH OVER US from a distance. Guard us and protect us while we doing this work."
Normal: And then all these bodhisattvas together, with ONE VOICE, they broke out into verse. They sang out their vow, and this is what they sang:
Heading 2: THE GREAT VOW IN VERSE
Normal: World-Honored One, don't you worry,
Normal: Don't let your mind be troubled none,
Normal: After you done passed away,
Normal: In that terrifying, evil age,
Normal: We gonna spread this teaching WIDE.
Normal: There gonna be ignorant folks,
Normal: People with no wisdom in they heads,
Normal: They gonna curse us out with evil mouths,
Normal: They gonna revile us and mock us,
Normal: Some of them gonna come at us with sticks and stones,
Normal: Beat us and try to break us down—
Normal: But we gonna ENDURE it all.
Normal: We gonna bear it with patience.
Normal: In that evil age, some of the monks—
Normal: Supposed to be holy men, supposed to be our brothers—
Normal: They gonna have TWISTED wisdom, deceitful hearts,
Normal: Crooked minds and lying spirits.
Normal: They gonna CLAIM they got what they ain't got,
Normal: Say they achieved enlightenment when they ain't achieved nothing,
Normal: And they hearts gonna be FULL UP with pride,
Normal: Swollen up with arrogance like they somebody special.
Normal: Some of them gonna call themselves forest-dwellers,
Normal: Ascetics living out in the wilderness,
Normal: Wearing patched-up rags like holy men,
Normal: Staying in empty, quiet places,
Normal: CLAIMING they walking the true path,
Normal: Looking DOWN on everybody else,
Normal: Acting like they better than regular folks.
Normal: But you know what they REALLY after?
Normal: They GREEDY for profit and offerings!
Normal: They teach the Dharma to laypeople
Normal: Just to get gain and respect,
Normal: And the world gonna honor them,
Normal: Treat them like they arhats with six spiritual powers,
Normal: Like they got ALL the supernatural abilities.
Normal: These people got EVIL in they hearts,
Normal: Always thinking about worldly things, mundane concerns,
Normal: But they PRETENDING to be forest-dwellers,
Normal: Taking that holy name in vain.
Normal: And they gonna LOVE to point out OUR faults,
Normal: Always looking for something wrong with US,
Normal: Always trying to catch us in some mistake.
Normal: They gonna SAY things like this:
Normal: "These monks here, they just in it for profit,
Normal: They teaching for GAIN,
Normal: They speaking HERETICAL doctrines,
Normal: Non-Buddhist philosophy and lies!
Normal: "They WROTE this sutra themselves!
Normal: Made it up out of whole cloth!
Normal: They doing it to TRICK the world,
Normal: To DECEIVE people,
Normal: 'Cause they hunting for fame and reputation.
Normal: They just trying to make a name for themselves!"
Normal: They gonna stand up in BIG ASSEMBLIES,
Normal: In front of CROWDS of people,
Normal: And they gonna try to SHAME us,
Normal: Try to HUMILIATE us and tear us down.
Normal: They gonna go running to kings and ministers,
Normal: To brahmins and householders,
Normal: To other monks and the whole sangha,
Normal: SLANDERING us, saying evil things about us,
Normal: Calling us "wrong-view people,"
Normal: Saying we teaching "outside-the-way doctrines,"
Normal: Heretical teachings and false philosophy.
Normal: But we gonna RESPECT the Buddha,
Normal: We gonna honor what you taught us,
Normal: So we gonna ENDURE all this evil,
Normal: We gonna bear up under all this persecution.
Normal: Even when they mock us and say—
Normal: And they gonna say it with CONTEMPT in they voices—
Normal: "Oh, Y'ALL gonna be Buddhas? YOU? Ha!"
Normal: Even when they throw that in our faces like an insult,
Normal: We gonna ACCEPT that contempt,
Normal: We gonna RECEIVE that mockery,
Normal: And we gonna keep on walking.
Normal: In the defiled age, the corrupt times,
Normal: The evil world that's coming,
Normal: There gonna be MANY terrifying things,
Normal: Fearful things that try to shake us.
Normal: Evil spirits gonna POSSESS people's bodies,
Normal: Take them over from the inside,
Normal: And they gonna curse us, revile us, disrespect us,
Normal: Say all manner of evil against us.
Normal: But WE believe in the Buddha,
Normal: WE trust in what you taught,
Normal: So we gonna PUT ON the armor of patience,
Normal: We gonna WEAR that armor like a soldier going to war.
Normal: We teaching this sutra,
Normal: And for the sake of teaching this sutra,
Normal: We gonna ENDURE all these hard things,
Normal: We gonna BEAR all these difficult trials.
Normal: We don't love our own lives—
Normal: Listen to me now, we don't love our own LIVES—
Normal: But we CHERISH the unsurpassed way,
Normal: We TREASURE this supreme Dharma
Normal: More than we treasure breathing.
Normal: In the world that's coming,
Normal: We gonna PROTECT what the Buddha entrusted to us,
Normal: We gonna GUARD what you asked us to hold.
Normal: And the World-Honored One,
Normal: You gonna KNOW our hearts,
Normal: You gonna see what we doing,
Normal: You gonna be a witness.
Normal: Those corrupt monks in the defiled age,
Normal: They don't UNDERSTAND the Buddha's skillful means,
Normal: Don't understand how you teach according to what's appropriate,
Normal: How you speak different ways for different people.
Normal: They gonna look at us with EVIL faces,
Normal: Scowl at us and curse us with foul mouths,
Normal: And they gonna kick us OUT again and again,
Normal: Ban us from the assembly over and over,
Normal: Keep us FAR AWAY from the temples and stupas,
Normal: Won't let us near the holy places.
Normal: All these kinds of persecution and trouble,
Normal: All these varieties of evil—
Normal: We gonna remember the Buddha's instruction,
Normal: We gonna think about what you told us,
Normal: And we gonna ENDURE all of it.
Normal: We gonna bear every bit of it with patience.
Normal: In all the villages and cities,
Normal: All the towns and hamlets,
Normal: Wherever there's people SEEKING the Dharma,
Normal: Folks who WANT to hear the teaching,
Normal: We gonna GO to those places.
Normal: We gonna go wherever they at,
Normal: And we gonna teach the Dharma the Buddha entrusted to us,
Normal: The teaching you asked us to carry forward.
Normal: We the WORLD-HONORED ONE'S MESSENGERS,
Normal: We the BUDDHA'S ENVOYS sent out into the world.
Normal: When we standing before the assembly,
Normal: We AIN'T AFRAID of nothing,
Normal: We got NO FEAR in our hearts,
Normal: 'Cause we know who sent us.
Normal: We gonna teach this Dharma WELL,
Normal: We gonna speak it CLEAR and TRUE.
Normal: And we asking you, Buddha:
Normal: Dwell in peace.
Normal: Rest easy.
Normal: Be at ease in your heart.
Normal: Right here before the World-Honored One,
Normal: Here in front of all the Buddhas
Normal: Who done come from the ten directions
Normal: To witness this moment,
Normal: We making this solemn vow.
Normal: We speaking this promise out loud.
Normal: And the Buddha—
Normal: The Buddha KNOWS our hearts.
Normal: The Buddha see what's in us.
Normal: The Buddha understand our commitment.
Normal: This our TESTIMONY,
Normal: And it's TRUE.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER THIRTEEN: WHEN THE ROAD GETS ROUGH, YOU GOTTA KEEP WALKING
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter is pure testimony—a series of sacred vows made by different groups of disciples, each pledging to carry the Dharma forward after Buddha's passing. The structure mirrors the call-and-response pattern of gospel testimony meetings, where individuals and groups stand up to declare their commitment.
Normal: Key Metaphorical Choices:
Normal: "Armor of patience"
Normal: - The Chinese 忍辱鎧 (rěnrù kǎi) becomes the central image of spiritual protection, rendered as something you "put on" like a soldier preparing for battle.
Normal: "Lion's roar"
Normal: - The Sanskrit siṃhanāda becomes "speaking with power and authority, ain't scared of nothing" - the fearless proclamation of truth.
Normal: "We don't love our own lives"
Normal: - This line echoes the martyr tradition in Christianity ("they loved not their lives unto death") while preserving the Buddhist teaching of non-attachment to the physical body.
Normal: "We the Buddha's messengers"
Normal: - This directly parallels the Christian concept of apostleship (Greek: apostolos = "one sent forth") while maintaining fidelity to the Chinese 世尊使 (messenger/envoy of the World-Honored One).
Normal: The verse section maintains the repetitive, rhythmic structure of the Chinese original while using blues-style repetition ("we gonna... we gonna...") to create oral momentum. The confrontation with corrupt monks becomes a classic blues theme: the authentic versus the fake, the true preacher versus the charlatan, those who genuinely suffer for the cause versus those who profit from religion.
Normal: The closing testimony—"The Buddha knows our hearts"—echoes both the Buddhist understanding of Buddha's omniscience and the gospel singer's assurance that "God knows my heart," creating a bridge between traditions without violating either one.
Normal: This interpretation preserves the profound seriousness of these vows while making them accessible through vernacular language that carries its own tradition of suffering, endurance, and sacred commitment.
Heading 1: CHAPTER FOURTEEN: HOW TO KEEP YOUR SOUL CLEAN WHEN THE WORLD'S GONE WRONG
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: MAÑJUŚRĪ ASKS THE HARD QUESTION
Normal: Now at that time, Mañjuśrī—that prince of the Dharma, that great bodhisattva—he stood up and said to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, these bodhisattvas here, they're something rare, you know? They respect you so much they done made a vow—a big vow, a serious vow—that when the evil age comes rolling in, when everything's corrupt and wrong, they gonna protect this Lotus teaching. They gonna read it, study it, teach it out loud.
Normal: But World-Honored One, I got to ask: When that evil age comes—and it's coming—how can these bodhisattvas teach this sutra without losing themselves? How they gonna speak the truth when lies run the world?"
Normal: And the Buddha said to Mañjuśrī:
Normal: "Listen now. If a bodhisattva wants to teach this sutra in the evil age to come, they got to rest themselves in four practices—four ways of being that keep you safe, keep you clean, keep you whole. The first one's about where you stand. The second's about who you stand with. You got to know your ground, and you got to know your company."
Heading 2: FIRST PRACTICE: THE GROUND YOU STAND ON
Normal: "Mañjuśrī, what do I mean by a bodhisattva's ground—their place to stand?
Normal: Listen: If you gonna teach in hard times, you got to dwell on the ground of patience. That means you gentle. You soft. You kind. You don't rush to anger, don't fly off the handle, don't let violence take root in your heart. You can't be jumping at every shadow, can't be scared of your own spirit.
Normal: And here's the deep part—listen close now: You don't cling to no ideas about the Dharma. You don't make the teaching into something you hold tight like property. No action, no grasping when it comes to spiritual things.
Normal: You look at everything according to its true nature. You see things as they really are—not what you want them to be, not what you fear they are, but what they truly are in their essence.
Normal: And you don't discriminate. You don't say 'this one's high, that one's low.' You don't divide reality into pieces and then fight over the pieces.
Normal: That's your ground. That's where you stand. On patience, on seeing clear, on letting things be what they are."
Heading 2: SECOND PRACTICE: WHO YOU DON'T RUN WITH
Normal: "Now Mañjuśrī, what do I mean by who you associate with—who you spend your time around?
Normal: Let me be plain: A bodhisattva teaching in evil times, they got to stay away from certain people. Not because you hate them—you got compassion for everybody—but because their energy will pull you down, will cloud your vision, will compromise your teaching.
Normal: Don't get close with kings and princes, with government officials and ministers, with the powerful and mighty. Power corrupts, and corrupt power corrupts faster. You can teach them if they come to you, but don't seek their favor, don't curry their approval, don't become their pet preacher.
Normal: Don't get tight with heretics and false teachers, with people teaching paths that lead nowhere, with those making up doctrines from their own confusion. Don't study worldly literature just to sound smart, don't get caught up in fancy words and clever arguments that go nowhere.
Normal: Don't go to violent entertainments—no wrestling matches, no fights, no games where people hurt each other for fun. Don't hang around places where violence is entertainment.
Normal: Don't associate with outcasts doing evil work—not the butchers, not the hunters, not the fishermen killing for profit. Not the people raising animals just to slaughter them. Not the people selling sex, selling bodies, selling what shouldn't be sold. These are hard livelihoods, bitter livelihoods, and you can't let that bitterness seep into your teaching.
Normal: And this is important—don't even get close with those monks and nuns who seeking their own little salvation, their own private enlightenment. Those śrāvakas content with their own liberation—don't live with them. If they come to you, teach them without expecting nothing back. But don't take up residence in their small vision.
Normal: Now about women—and this is practical wisdom for those times: Don't look at women with desire, don't smile showing all your teeth, don't display your body, don't get familiar with young women or widows or those confused about their own nature. Not because women are bad—no, no—but because desire will corrupt your teaching, will make people question your motives, will muddy the clear water of the Dharma.
Normal: Don't take on young disciples or little novices who you can't properly guide. Don't share teachers with those who might lead you astray.
Normal: Always love quiet places. Always be meditating, gathering your mind, keeping your spirit collected. Don't let yourself scatter like dust in the wind.
Normal: That's the first part of associations—who you don't run with."
Heading 2: SECOND PRACTICE, SECOND PART: THE GROUND OF EMPTINESS
Normal: "But there's a deeper part to this second practice, Mañjuśrī. It's not just about avoiding people. It's about understanding reality itself.
Normal: View all things—all dharmas, all phenomena—as empty according to their true nature. Empty like space is empty, not because there's nothing there, but because there's no fixed essence, no permanent self.
Normal: Things aren't twisted up wrong, aren't moving toward some goal, aren't retreating from some danger, aren't turning into something else. They just ARE, moment by moment, like space itself—no substance you can grab hold of.
Normal: All our talking about things—all our language and concepts—it all falls short. Nothing is being produced, nothing is arising fresh, nothing is starting up new.
Normal: No names capture it. No forms define it. Truth be told, there ain't nothing there to capture—nothing you can put your finger on and say 'this is it.'
Normal: Limitless it is. Boundless. Without obstacles or barriers.
Normal: We only talk about things because of causes and conditions, because of our confused, upside-down thinking. That's the only reason we say anything at all.
Normal: If you love to contemplate these truths—if you rest your mind in this understanding that everything is empty, fluid, free—that's the second ground for a bodhisattva. That's the second safe place to stand."
Normal: If there's a bodhisattva
Normal: in the evil age to come
Normal: with no fear in their heart
Normal: wanting to teach this sutra,
Normal: They got to enter the right ground,
Normal: got to know the right associations.
Normal: Stay away from kings
Normal: and princes with their schemes,
Normal: From government officials
Normal: and violent entertainers,
Normal: from outcasts doing evil work,
Normal: from heretics preaching confusion.
Normal: Don't get close with prideful people,
Normal: those in love with small teachings,
Normal: those studying just to sound smart,
Normal: those breaking precepts behind closed doors.
Normal: Stay away from monks in name only,
Normal: from nuns who love to play around,
Normal: from laypeople deep in desires
Normal: seeking extinction for themselves.
Normal: If such people come to you
Normal: with good hearts and sincere questions,
Normal: wanting to hear the Buddha's Way,
Normal: then teach them without fear,
Normal: Teach them without hoping for reward,
Normal: without expecting praise or payment.
Normal: But don't seek them out,
Normal: don't make them your companions.
Normal: Stay away from widows and young women,
Normal: from those confused about their nature.
Normal: Don't get close with butchers and hunters,
Normal: with fishermen killing for money,
Normal: With people selling meat for a living,
Normal: selling bodies, selling shame.
Normal: Don't go near violent sports,
Normal: entertainments where people hurt each other,
Normal: Don't associate with prostitutes—
Normal: keep clear of all that.
Normal: Don't teach women alone in secret.
Normal: When you do teach, don't laugh loose and easy.
Normal: When you go to town for alms,
Normal: take another monk along.
Normal: If you got no monk to bring,
Normal: keep your mind on Buddha only.
Normal: These are your ground and your associations—
Normal: these two practices keep you safe,
Normal: Keep you able to teach with peace,
Normal: teach with joy, teach with freedom.
Normal: And beyond that: Don't hold to ideas
Normal: of high teachings or low teachings,
Normal: conditioned or unconditioned,
Normal: real or unreal—
Normal: Don't discriminate between
Normal: male and female in your mind.
Normal: Don't grasp at things as if they're solid,
Normal: don't act like you know when you don't,
Normal: Don't pretend to see what ain't visible.
Normal: That's the bodhisattva's ground.
Normal: All things are empty,
Normal: have no substance you can hold.
Normal: Nothing dwells forever,
Normal: nothing arises or ceases in truth.
Normal: This is what the wise ones know,
Normal: where the wise ones rest their minds.
Normal: Our confused discriminating thinking
Normal: divides things into real and unreal,
Normal: existent and non-existent,
Normal: born and unborn.
Normal: But you—you dwell in quiet places,
Normal: gathering your mind together,
Normal: stable and unmoving
Normal: like a mountain that won't shake.
Normal: View all phenomena
Normal: as having no substance,
Normal: like space itself,
Normal: without anything solid,
Normal: Not born, not emerging,
Normal: not moving, not retreating,
Normal: always abiding in one truth—
Normal: that's where you rest your mind.
Normal: If there's a monk
Normal: after I pass on
Normal: who enters this ground,
Normal: knows these associations,
Normal: When they teach this sutra
Normal: they won't have no fear.
Normal: Sometimes they'll go to a quiet room
Normal: and meditate properly,
Normal: Contemplate the meaning,
Normal: see the Dharma as it is.
Normal: Then they'll come out of meditation
Normal: to teach kings and princes,
Normal: Teach government officials,
Normal: teach priests and common people,
Normal: Opening up and sharing
Normal: this precious sutra,
Normal: Their heart at peace,
Normal: without any fear.
Normal: Mañjuśrī, this is the bodhisattva's
Normal: first peaceful practice—
Normal: Rest in this foundation,
Normal: and you can teach the Lotus
Normal: in the evil age to come
Normal: without losing yourself.
Heading 2: THIRD PRACTICE: HOW TO SPEAK AND WHAT TO HOLD IN YOUR HEART
Normal: "Now, Mañjuśrī, listen: After I'm gone, in the last age when the Dharma's dying out, if you want to teach this Lotus Sutra, you got to dwell in peaceful conduct.
Normal: Whether you're speaking it out loud or reading it quiet, don't talk bad about people and their failings. Don't speak about what's wrong with other sutras.
Normal: Don't look down on other teachers of the Dharma. Don't gossip about people's good points and bad points, their strengths and their shortcomings.
Normal: When it comes to those śrāvakas—those seeking their own enlightenment—don't call them out by name to shame them. Don't name them to praise them either. Don't breed resentment in your heart.
Normal: If you cultivate this peaceful mind, if you practice this kind of speaking, then people who come to hear you won't turn against you. And when they ask you hard questions, don't answer with small teachings—don't give them the little vehicle. Answer with the great vehicle, with the big vision that leads to complete wisdom, to knowing all that can be known."
Normal: The bodhisattva always loves
Normal: to teach in peace and safety.
Normal: They prepare a clean place,
Normal: set up a proper seat,
Normal: Anoint their body with oil,
Normal: wash off the dust and dirt,
Normal: put on fresh clean clothes—
Normal: clean outside and inside both.
Normal: Then they sit on the Dharma seat
Normal: and answer what they're asked.
Normal: If monks or nuns come,
Normal: if laymen or laywomen arrive,
Normal: If kings and princes show up,
Normal: if officials and common people gather,
Normal: They teach with subtle meaning,
Normal: with a gentle face and kind words.
Normal: If someone asks a hard question,
Normal: they answer according to the meaning.
Normal: They use causes and conditions,
Normal: they use parables and stories,
Normal: They explain and distinguish,
Normal: break it down so folks can understand.
Normal: By these skillful means
Normal: everyone's inspired,
Normal: Gradually they increase,
Normal: gradually they enter the Buddha Way.
Normal: Cast off your lazy mind,
Normal: throw away your slacking spirit,
Normal: Let go of your worries,
Normal: teach with a compassionate heart.
Normal: Day and night keep speaking
Normal: this supreme teaching,
Normal: Using countless causes,
Normal: innumerable parables,
Normal: Opening it up for all beings
Normal: so everyone rejoices.
Normal: Clothes and bedding,
Normal: food and medicine—
Normal: don't hope for any of that.
Normal: Just single-mindedly think:
Normal: "I teach for this reason only:
Normal: so I can achieve Buddhahood,
Normal: so all beings can achieve it too."
Normal: That's your great benefit,
Normal: That's your peaceful offering.
Normal: After I pass on,
Normal: if there's a monk who can teach
Normal: this wondrous Lotus Sutra,
Normal: Their heart won't hold jealousy,
Normal: hatred, or afflictions.
Normal: They won't have worries,
Normal: won't be cursed or insulted.
Normal: They won't fear
Normal: swords or sticks or violence.
Normal: They won't be driven out,
Normal: because they rest in patience.
Normal: The wise one practices like this,
Normal: cultivates their heart properly,
Normal: Dwells in peace and safety
Normal: just like I described.
Normal: That person's merit
Normal: over thousands of millions of ages—
Normal: you can't calculate it,
Normal: can't describe it with parables.
Heading 2: FOURTH PRACTICE: GREAT COMPASSION FOR THOSE WHO REJECT YOU
Normal: "Now, Mañjuśrī, there's one more practice—the fourth peaceful practice—for bodhisattvas teaching in the last age when the Dharma's dying out.
Normal: If you're teaching this Lotus Sutra, you got to keep your heart free from jealousy, from deceit, from lying. Don't look down on people learning the Buddha Way. Don't go searching for their faults.
Normal: Whether they're monks or nuns, laypeople, whether they're seeking the śrāvaka vehicle or the pratyekabuddha vehicle or the bodhisattva way—don't trouble them. Don't make them doubt themselves. Don't make them regret their path.
Normal: Don't say to them: 'You're far from the Way. You ain't never gonna reach complete knowledge. Why? Because you're lazy, that's why. Because you slack off on the path.'
Normal: And don't get into debates and arguments about the Dharma, don't get competitive about teaching.
Normal: Instead, toward all beings, generate great compassion. Toward all the Tathāgatas—all the Buddhas—hold them as loving fathers in your mind. Toward all the bodhisattvas, see them as your great teachers.
Normal: Toward the great bodhisattvas in all ten directions, always maintain deep respect in your heart. Bow down to them with reverence.
Normal: When you teach, teach all beings equally. Don't teach more to those who love the Dharma more. Don't measure out your teaching according to people's enthusiasm. Teach according to the Dharma itself—not too much, not too little, just what's right.
Normal: Even toward those who deeply love the teaching, don't give them extra just because they're eager."
Heading 2: THE FOURTH PRACTICE BRINGS PROTECTION AND COMMUNITY
Normal: "Mañjuśrī, if a bodhisattva in the last age—when the Dharma's dying—accomplishes this third peaceful practice, then when they teach this sutra, nobody can trouble them.
Normal: They'll find good companions to read and recite this sutra with them. They'll find large crowds coming to listen. And when people hear it, they'll be able to hold it. When they hold it, they'll be able to recite it. When they recite it, they'll be able to explain it. When they explain it, they'll be able to write it down, or get others to write it.
Normal: They'll make offerings to the sutra scroll, treat it with respect and honor, praise it and treasure it."
Normal: If you want to teach this sutra,
Normal: cast off jealousy and hatred and pride,
Normal: Cast off deceit and lying,
Normal: always practice straight honest conduct.
Normal: Don't look down on people,
Normal: don't argue about the Dharma,
Normal: Don't make others doubt and regret,
Normal: don't tell them they can't reach Buddhahood.
Normal: When this child of Buddha teaches,
Normal: they're always gentle, patient,
Normal: Compassionate to everyone,
Normal: never slacking off.
Normal: The great bodhisattvas of ten directions,
Normal: they practice the Way out of compassion—
Normal: Generate respect for them,
Normal: say "These are my great teachers."
Normal: Toward all the Buddha World-Honored Ones,
Normal: hold them as supreme fathers.
Normal: Break down your prideful heart
Normal: and you'll teach without obstruction.
Normal: This third practice is like this—
Normal: the wise should guard it well.
Normal: Single-heartedly dwell in peaceful practice
Normal: and countless people will respect you.
Heading 2: FOURTH PRACTICE: THE DEEPEST COMPASSION
Normal: "Now, Mañjuśrī, there's more to say about bodhisattvas in the last age when the Dharma's dying, those who hold this Lotus Sutra.
Normal: Toward those who've left home and those still in the household life, generate great compassion. Toward those who aren't bodhisattvas, generate even greater compassion—a vast compassion.
Normal: You should think like this: 'These people, they suffering a great loss. The Tathāgata teaches with skillful means according to what people need, but these folks—they don't hear it, don't know it, don't perceive it. They don't ask about it, don't believe it, don't understand it.
Normal: But even though they don't ask, don't believe, don't understand this sutra, when I reach complete perfect enlightenment, wherever they are, I'm gonna use my spiritual power and my wisdom power to draw them in, lead them here, make them dwell in this teaching.'
Normal: Mañjuśrī, if a bodhisattva after the Tathāgata passes on accomplishes this fourth practice, when they teach this sutra they won't make no mistakes, won't fall into error.
Normal: They'll always be honored by monks and nuns, by laymen and laywomen, by kings and princes, by government officials and common people, by priests and householders. They'll receive offerings, respect, honor, and praise.
Normal: The gods in the sky, wanting to hear the teaching, will constantly attend them. Whether they're in a village or a city or in an empty forest, if someone comes wanting to challenge them with hard questions, the gods day and night will protect them for the sake of the Dharma. They'll make everyone who hears rejoice.
Normal: Why? Because this sutra is protected by the spiritual power of all Buddhas—past, future, and present.
Normal: Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra—in countless lands you can't even hear its name, much less see it, hold it, read it, or recite it!"
Heading 2: THE PARABLE OF THE KING'S CROWN JEWEL
Normal: "Mañjuśrī, let me tell you a story so you understand what I'm saying:
Normal: Imagine a powerful wheel-turning king—a king who rules with righteousness. He wants to bring all the nations under his rule using his authority. But some small kings won't submit to his command.
Normal: So this wheel-turning king raises up an army and goes to war against them. When he sees his soldiers fighting with courage, accomplishing difficult things, he's filled with joy. According to what they've accomplished, he gives rewards.
Normal: He gives them fields and houses, villages and cities. He gives them fine clothes and beautiful ornaments. He gives them all kinds of treasures—gold and silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, coral and amber. He gives them elephants and horses and carriages, slaves and servants, common people to work their lands.
Normal: But there's one thing he doesn't give: the bright jewel in his crown—the pearl on top of his head. Why? Because only the king has this one jewel, this unique treasure at the very crown of his head. If he gave it away, all his retinue would be shocked and amazed.
Normal: Well, Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata is like this. Through the power of meditation and wisdom, he gained the territory of the Dharma. He rules over the three realms. But the demon kings wouldn't submit.
Normal: So the Tathāgata's worthy sages—his spiritual warriors—fought against those demons. When they showed great accomplishment, the Tathāgata's heart was filled with joy.
Normal: In the assembly of the four groups, he taught all kinds of sutras to make their hearts rejoice. He gave them the treasures of meditation and liberation, of undefiled roots and powers, of various dharmas. He also gave them the city of nirvāṇa, telling them they'd reached extinction. He guided their hearts and made them all rejoice.
Normal: But he didn't teach them this Lotus Sutra. Not yet.
Normal: Mañjuśrī, it's like when that wheel-turning king saw soldiers accomplish great things—things hard to believe—he was so joyful that he finally gave them that jewel that's hard to believe in, that pearl he kept so long in his crown, that treasure he never casually gave to anyone. Now he gives it.
Normal: The Tathāgata is like this. In the three realms he's the great Dharma king. With teachings he educates all beings. He sees his army of sages fighting against the five-aggregate demon, the affliction demon, and the death demon. He sees them accomplish great merit—destroying the three poisons, escaping the three realms, breaking through the demon's net.
Normal: At that time the Tathāgata is greatly joyful.
Normal: This Lotus Sutra can lead beings to complete wisdom. All the world finds it hard to believe—full of hatred for it, hard to trust. This is what he never taught before. But now he teaches it.
Normal: Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the first teaching among all the Tathāgatas' teachings. Among all teachings, it's the most profound. At the very end he bestows it, just like that powerful king finally giving up that bright pearl he protected so long.
Normal: Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the secret treasury of all Buddhas and Tathāgatas. Among all sutras, it stands at the very top. Through the long night I've guarded it, never carelessly teaching it. But now today I give it to you all and expound it fully."
Normal: Always practice patience,
Normal: have compassion for everyone—
Normal: Only then can you teach
Normal: this sutra the Buddha praises.
Normal: In the last age,
Normal: those who hold this teaching
Normal: Toward those in homes and those who left them,
Normal: toward those who aren't bodhisattvas,
Normal: Should generate compassion.
Normal: If they don't hear this,
Normal: Don't believe this sutra,
Normal: they're suffering a great loss.
Normal: When I achieve Buddhahood
Normal: I'll use skillful means
Normal: To teach them this dharma,
Normal: make them dwell in it.
Normal: It's like that powerful
Normal: wheel-turning king:
Normal: When soldiers fight with courage
Normal: he rewards them with everything—
Normal: Elephants, horses, carriages,
Normal: beautiful ornaments,
Normal: Fields and houses,
Normal: villages and cities,
Normal: Fine clothes
Normal: and all kinds of treasures,
Normal: Slaves and servants and wealth—
Normal: joyfully he gives it all.
Normal: But when someone shows real courage,
Normal: does something truly difficult,
Normal: The king takes off that crown jewel,
Normal: that bright pearl, and gives it to them.
Normal: The Tathāgata is like this:
Normal: He's king of all the dharmas,
Normal: With the great power of patience,
Normal: with the treasure-house of wisdom,
Normal: With great compassion
Normal: he teaches the world according to truth.
Normal: Seeing all people
Normal: receiving suffering and trouble,
Normal: Wanting to seek liberation,
Normal: fighting against demons,
Normal: For these beings
Normal: he teaches all kinds of dharmas,
Normal: With great skillful means
Normal: he teaches various sutras.
Normal: Once he knows beings
Normal: have gained their power,
Normal: At the very end
Normal: he teaches this Lotus,
Normal: Like that king taking off his crown,
Normal: giving that bright pearl.
Normal: This sutra is most honored,
Normal: highest among all sutras.
Normal: I've always guarded it,
Normal: never carelessly revealed it.
Normal: Now is the right time
Normal: to teach it to you all.
Normal: After I pass on,
Normal: those seeking the Buddha Way,
Normal: Wanting to teach this sutra
Normal: in peace and safety,
Normal: Should draw near
Normal: to these four practices.
Normal: Those who read this sutra
Normal: will always be free from worry,
Normal: Also free from sickness,
Normal: their face bright and fresh.
Normal: They won't be born into poverty,
Normal: lowliness, or ugliness.
Normal: All beings love to see them,
Normal: admire them like sages.
Normal: The children of heaven
Normal: will serve and attend them.
Normal: Swords won't touch them,
Normal: poison can't harm them.
Normal: If someone tries to curse them,
Normal: that person's mouth will close up.
Normal: They'll walk without fear
Normal: like a lion king.
Normal: Their wisdom light will shine
Normal: bright as the sun itself.
Normal: And in their dreams
Normal: they'll see only wonderful things.
Heading 2: THE BEAUTIFUL DREAMS OF THE DHARMA HOLDER
Normal: They'll see the Tathāgatas
Normal: sitting on lion thrones,
Normal: Surrounded by assemblies of monks,
Normal: teaching the Dharma.
Normal: They'll see dragons and spirits,
Normal: asuras and others,
Normal: Numerous as Ganges sands,
Normal: palms joined in respect.
Normal: They'll see themselves
Normal: teaching the Dharma to them all.
Normal: They'll see the Buddhas
Normal: with bodies colored like gold,
Normal: Radiating boundless light,
Normal: illuminating everything,
Normal: With brahma voices
Normal: expounding all the dharmas.
Normal: The Buddha teaching the four groups
Normal: the supreme dharma—
Normal: They'll see themselves standing there,
Normal: palms joined, praising Buddha,
Normal: Hearing the Dharma with joy,
Normal: making offerings,
Normal: Receiving dhāraṇī,
Normal: attaining wisdom that won't retreat.
Normal: The Buddha knows their mind
Normal: has entered deep into the Buddha Way,
Normal: So he gives them a prophecy,
Normal: tells them they'll achieve perfect enlightenment:
Normal: "You, good person,
Normal: in the age to come
Normal: Will gain the boundless wisdom,
Normal: the great Way of Buddha.
Normal: Your land will be pure,
Normal: vast and beyond compare.
Normal: You too will have four groups
Normal: with palms joined, hearing the Dharma."
Normal: They'll also see themselves
Normal: in mountain forests,
Normal: Practicing good dharmas,
Normal: realizing true reality,
Normal: Entering deep into meditation,
Normal: seeing Buddhas in ten directions—
Normal: Those Buddhas with golden bodies,
Normal: adorned with a hundred blessed marks.
Normal: Hearing the Dharma, teaching it to others—
Normal: always having these beautiful dreams.
Normal: They'll also dream they're a king
Normal: who renounces palace and family,
Normal: Gives up the supreme five desires,
Normal: goes to the place of enlightenment,
Normal: Sits under the bodhi tree
Normal: on a lion throne,
Normal: Seeks the Way for seven days,
Normal: obtains the wisdom of all Buddhas.
Normal: Having achieved the supreme Way,
Normal: they rise and turn the Dharma wheel,
Normal: Teaching the four groups
Normal: for thousands of millions of ages,
Normal: Teaching the undefiled wondrous Dharma,
Normal: liberating countless beings.
Normal: Then finally entering nirvāṇa
Normal: like smoke disappearing, like a lamp going out.
Normal: If in the evil age
Normal: you teach this first dharma,
Normal: That person gains great benefit,
Normal: all these merits I've described.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER FOURTEEN: HOW TO KEEP YOUR SOUL CLEAN WHEN THE WORLD'S GONE WRONG
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter is survival wisdom for spiritual teachers in corrupt times. The Buddha ain't talking theory here—he's giving practical instructions for how to keep your soul clean when the world's gone wrong.
Normal: The four practices are like concentric circles of protection:
Normal: Your inner ground (patience, non-grasping, seeing clearly)
Normal: Your outer associations (who you don't run with, what you don't do)
Normal: Your speech and heart (how you talk, what you hold inside)
Normal: Your ultimate compassion (even for those who reject you)
Normal: The crown jewel parable is central: The Lotus Sutra is what the Buddha held back until his spiritual warriors had proven themselves, until they'd fought through their own demons and poisons. It's the final gift, the supreme teaching, given only when folks are ready.
Normal: And the beautiful dreams at the end—that's confirmation. That's how you know you're on the right path. When you hold this teaching right, it holds you back. You walk protected. Your dreams become prophecies. Even sleep becomes teaching.
Normal: This is practical mysticism. This is how you teach the highest truth in the lowest times without becoming what you're fighting against.
Heading 1: CHAPTER FIFTEEN: WHEN THE UNDERGROUND ARMY ROSE UP
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE OFFER THAT GOT TURNED DOWN
Normal: Now at that time, all them bodhisattvas from other worlds—countless worlds beyond counting, more than eight Ganges rivers full of sand—they stood up in that great gathering. They pressed their palms together, bowed down low, and said to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, if you let us—when you gone from this world, after you passed on—we will stay right here in this Śākyamuni realm, this troubled world called Sahā. We will work hard, we will stay diligent, we will protect this sutra, read it, recite it, write it down, make offerings to it. We will teach it far and wide in this land here."
Normal: But then the Buddha, he told all them bodhisattvas—all them great beings from other worlds:
Normal: "Stop. Stop right there, good sons. You don't need to protect this sutra. You don't need to worry yourselves about it.
Normal: Why's that?
Normal: Because my Śākyamuni world—this world right here—it already got 60,000 times the sands of the Ganges River worth of great bodhisattvas. And every single one of them bodhisattvas, they each got their own retinue—60,000 Ganges-sands worth of followers each.
Normal: And these people—all these beings right here—they able to protect this sutra after I'm gone. They can hold it, read it, recite it, teach it wide."
Heading 2: THE EARTH SPLITS WIDE OPEN
Normal: Now when the Buddha spoke them words, the whole Śākyamuni world—all three thousand great thousand realms of it—the ground started shaking and trembling and splitting apart.
Normal: And out from them cracks, out from underneath, there came bursting forth countless thousands, tens of thousands, millions, billions of bodhisattvas—great bodhisattvas, mighty bodhisattvas—all at the same time, all rising up together like a flood, like a army, like the morning breaking.
Normal: And these bodhisattvas, every one of them had bodies of gold—golden like the sunrise, golden like pure truth. They all had the thirty-two marks, they all shining with boundless light, they all radiant beyond measure.
Normal: And all along, all this time before now, they'd been living right underneath this Śākyamuni world—down below in the empty space beneath this realm—just dwelling there, waiting there, ready there.
Normal: These bodhisattvas, they heard Śākyamuni Buddha's voice when he spoke, and they came up from below. They answered the call.
Heading 2: THE VAST NUMBERS THAT NOBODY CAN COUNT
Normal: Now every one of these bodhisattvas, they was leaders—great leaders, mighty leaders—leading the masses, guiding the multitudes.
Normal: And each one was bringing their own followers with them:
Normal: Some had retinues of 60,000 Ganges-sands worth,
Normal: Some had 50,000 Ganges-sands,
Normal: Some 40,000, some 30,000, some 20,000, some 10,000 Ganges-sands of followers.
Normal: And then there was those with one Ganges-sand worth,
Normal: Or half a Ganges-sand,
Normal: Or a quarter, or one-eighth,
Normal: Or down to a thousand million billion nayutas fraction of a Ganges-sand.
Normal: And some had a thousand million billion nayutas of disciples,
Normal: Some had a hundred million or ten million,
Normal: Some had a million, hundred thousand, down to ten thousand.
Normal: Some had a thousand, a hundred, down to ten.
Normal: Some brought five disciples, some four, some three, some two, some just one.
Normal: And some came alone—single and solitary, loving the quiet path, walking the remote road by themselves.
Normal: On and on like this—countless, boundless, beyond all calculation, beyond all comparison, beyond all arithmetic, beyond what numbers can measure or words can tell.
Heading 2: THE GREAT ASSEMBLY AND THE LONG PRAISE
Normal: When all these bodhisattvas came up from the earth, they each went to the jeweled stupa in the sky—to where Abundant Treasures Tathāgata and Śākyamuni Buddha was sitting together.
Normal: When they got there, they bowed down before both World-Honored Ones, touched their heads to the feet of both Buddhas. They went to all the Buddha-copies sitting under the jeweled trees on lion thrones throughout the realms, and they bowed before each one too.
Normal: They circled them three times to the right, then stood with palms pressed together in deep respect. And they praised the Buddhas with all manner of bodhisattva praise-forms—praising and honoring, then standing to one side, gazing up joyfully at the two World-Honored Ones.
Normal: Now these great bodhisattvas, from the time they first burst forth from the earth, they was praising the Buddhas with all kinds of bodhisattva praise-forms. And this praising—this honoring and celebrating—it went on for FIFTY SMALL KALPAS. Fifty ages. Fifty long stretches of time.
Normal: And during all this time, Śākyamuni Buddha sat there silent. And all the four assemblies—they was silent too. Fifty small kalpas they was silent.
Normal: But because of the Buddha's spiritual power, he made it seem to that great assembly like only half a day had passed. Half a day! Time got bent, time got folded, time got compressed by the Buddha's power.
Normal: And also because of the Buddha's spiritual power, the four assemblies could see all them bodhisattvas filling up the empty space of countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of realms—filling it all up, everywhere you looked.
Heading 2: THE FOUR GREAT LEADERS STEP FORWARD
Normal: Now among all that vast bodhisattva multitude, there was four leaders—four chief guides, four head teachers:
Normal: The first was named SUPERIOR PRACTICE (上行 - Viśiṣṭhacāritra),
Normal: The second was named BOUNDLESS PRACTICE (無邊行 - Anantacāritra),
Normal: The third was named PURE PRACTICE (淨行 - Viśuddhacāritra),
Normal: The fourth was named WELL-ESTABLISHED PRACTICE (安立行 - Supratiṣṭhitacāritra).
Normal: These four bodhisattvas—they was the highest leaders, the chief guides among all that crowd.
Normal: They came forward in front of the great assembly. They pressed their palms together, gazed at Śākyamuni Buddha, and asked respectfully:
Normal: "World-Honored One, are you well? Do you have few sicknesses? Few troubles? Are you dwelling in peace and ease? Are the beings you teaching—are they easy to teach? Are they receiving instruction without resistance? We hope you not worn out, not exhausted, not burdened down by the work."
Heading 2: THE FOUR LEADERS SPEAK IN VERSE
Normal: Is the World-Honored One dwelling in peace,
Normal: with few sicknesses, few troubles?
Normal: Teaching all these living beings—
Normal: do you find yourself growing weary?
Normal: And are these living beings
Normal: easy to teach, easy to reach?
Normal: We hope they don't make the World-Honored One
Normal: tired, worn down, heavy-burdened.
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA SAYS: "IT AIN'T BEEN HARD"
Normal: Then the World-Honored One, there in the midst of that vast bodhisattva assembly, he said:
Normal: "Yes, yes, good sons. The Tathāgata is dwelling in peace. I got few sicknesses, few troubles. And these living beings—they easy to teach. There ain't been no weariness, no fatigue.
Normal: Why's that?
Normal: Because these living beings, life after life, world after world, age after age, they been receiving my teaching all along. And also in ages past, under previous Buddhas, they showed respect and reverence, and they planted all kinds of good roots.
Normal: So when these beings first saw my body, when they first heard what I was saying, they believed right away. They received it and entered into the Tathāgata's wisdom—just like that.
Normal: Now there's some exceptions—those who studied the small vehicle before, the lesser teachings. But even those people, I'm making sure they hear this sutra now, so they can enter into the Buddha's wisdom too."
Heading 2: THE GREAT BODHISATTVAS REJOICE
Normal: Then at that time, all them great bodhisattvas spoke in verse, saying:
Normal: Excellent! Excellent!
Normal: Great Hero, World-Honored One,
Normal: All these living beings—
Normal: they easy to teach, easy to guide.
Normal: They able to ask the Buddhas
Normal: about deep wisdom, profound truth.
Normal: Hearing it, they believe and practice—
Normal: and we rejoice along with them!
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA PRAISES HIS STUDENTS
Normal: Then the World-Honored One praised them chief bodhisattvas, saying:
Normal: "Excellent! Excellent, good sons! You able to rejoice along with the Tathāgata—able to be glad in the Tathāgata's work. That's good, that's real good."
Heading 2: MAITREYA'S MIND STARTS SPINNING
Normal: Now at that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva and 8,000 Ganges-sands worth of other bodhisattvas—they all had this thought arise in their minds:
Normal: "All this time up till now—from way back, from the beginning—we never seen, never heard tell of such a vast assembly of great bodhisattvas bursting up from the earth like this, standing before the World-Honored One, palms pressed together, making offerings, asking after the Tathāgata.
Normal: Where did they come from? What is this?"
Heading 2: MAITREYA ASKS THE EXPLOSIVE QUESTION
Normal: So Maitreya Bodhisattva, knowing what was on the minds of them 8,000 Ganges-sands worth of bodhisattvas—and wanting to clear up his own doubts too—he pressed his palms together, faced the Buddha, and asked in verse:
Normal: Countless thousands of millions of billions—
Normal: this vast assembly of bodhisattvas,
Normal: we never seen before, never once.
Normal: Will the Honored One of Two Feet explain:
Normal: Where did they come from?
Normal: What causes and conditions brought them here?
Normal: They got giant bodies, great spiritual powers,
Normal: wisdom that can't be fathomed—
Normal: Their will and intention is rock-solid firm,
Normal: they got the power of great patience and endurance,
Normal: living beings love to see them—
Normal: but where they come from?
Normal: Every single one of these bodhisattvas
Normal: got their own retinue of followers,
Normal: and the numbers got no measure—
Normal: like the sands of the Ganges River.
Normal: Some of these great bodhisattvas
Normal: leading 60,000 Ganges-sands worth,
Normal: and all these vast crowds
Normal: seeking the Buddha-way with one mind.
Normal: These great teachers—
Normal: all 60,000 Ganges-sands of them—
Normal: they come together to make offerings to Buddha
Normal: and to protect and uphold this sutra.
Normal: Some leading 50,000 Ganges-sands,
Normal: and the numbers go even higher than that.
Normal: Some got 40,000, some 30,000,
Normal: some 20,000 down to 10,000,
Normal: Some with a thousand, a hundred,
Normal: down to one Ganges-sand worth,
Normal: or half, or a third or quarter,
Normal: or down to one billion-millionth fraction,
Normal: Thousands of millions of nayutas,
Normal: ten thousands of billions of disciples,
Normal: down to half a billion,
Normal: and the numbers keep going higher still.
Normal: A hundred thousand down to ten thousand,
Normal: a thousand down to a hundred,
Normal: fifty, ten,
Normal: down to three, two, one,
Normal: Or coming alone with no retinue,
Normal: loving the solitary path—
Normal: all coming to the Buddha's place,
Normal: and the numbers beyond even that.
Normal: If someone tried to count this vast assembly,
Normal: using counting-sticks for more than Ganges-sand kalpas,
Normal: they still wouldn't be able to finish knowing—
Normal: couldn't reach the end.
Normal: These great beings of awesome virtue,
Normal: these vigorous bodhisattvas—
Normal: who taught them the Dharma?
Normal: Who educated and perfected them?
Normal: Under whom did they first set their minds on enlightenment?
Normal: What Buddha's teaching did they praise?
Normal: Whose sutras did they receive and uphold?
Normal: What Buddha's way did they practice and study?
Normal: These bodhisattvas
Normal: with spiritual powers and great wisdom-strength—
Normal: the earth in the four directions split open,
Normal: and they all burst forth from the middle.
Normal: World-Honored One, since ancient times till now
Normal: I never seen such a thing.
Normal: Please tell us where they from,
Normal: what country, what land they came from.
Normal: I been traveling through all the nations,
Normal: but I never seen this assembly before.
Normal: In this whole crowd here
Normal: I don't recognize a single person—
Normal: Suddenly they bursting from the earth.
Normal: Please explain the causes and conditions.
Normal: Right now in this great assembly—
Normal: countless hundreds of thousands of billions—
Normal: All these bodhisattvas
Normal: want to know about this matter.
Normal: The root and branch of these bodhisattvas,
Normal: the beginning and end of their causes and conditions—
Normal: World-Honored One of boundless virtue,
Normal: we only asking you: please resolve our doubts.
Heading 2: THE BUDDHAS IN ALL DIRECTIONS WONDER TOO
Normal: Then at that time, all them emanation-bodies of Śākyamuni Buddha—all them Buddha-copies who came from countless thousands of millions of billions of other lands, sitting on lion thrones under jeweled trees throughout the eight directions—each one of their attendants saw this great assembly of bodhisattvas bursting up from the earth in the four directions of the three thousand great thousand worlds, rising up into empty space.
Normal: And each attendant said to their Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, where did all these countless, boundless, innumerable bodhisattvas come from?"
Normal: And each of them Buddhas told their attendant:
Normal: "Good sons, wait just a moment. There's a bodhisattva here named Maitreya, who Śākyamuni Buddha done given a prophecy to—said he gonna be the next Buddha after this one. He already asked about this very matter. The Buddha about to answer him now. You'll hear it yourselves when he explains."
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA TELLS MAITREYA TO GET READY
Normal: Then at that time, Śākyamuni Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva:
Normal: "Excellent! Excellent, Ajita! That you able to ask the Buddha about such a great matter—this is good, this is right.
Normal: Now all of you need to gather yourselves together with one mind. Put on the armor of vigor and diligence. Make your intention firm and solid.
Normal: Because the Tathāgata is about to reveal and display and proclaim:
Normal: The wisdom of all Buddhas,
Normal: The Buddhas' self-mastered spiritual power,
Normal: The Buddhas' lion-like charging forth,
Normal: The Buddhas' awesome and mighty great force."
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA SPEAKS IN VERSE: PAY ATTENTION NOW
Normal: You need to be vigorous with one mind—
Normal: I'm about to explain this matter.
Normal: Don't let yourself have doubts or regrets.
Normal: The Buddha's wisdom can't be thought or measured.
Normal: Now bring forth your power of faith,
Normal: dwell in patience and goodness.
Normal: This Dharma you never heard before—
Normal: today you all gonna hear it.
Normal: I'm comforting you now,
Normal: don't let yourself harbor doubts or fears.
Normal: The Buddha don't speak no falsehoods,
Normal: his wisdom can't be calculated.
Normal: The supreme Dharma he obtained—
Normal: it's deep, can't be discriminated or divided up.
Normal: And now I'm about to speak it,
Normal: so all of you listen with one mind.
Heading 2: THE SHOCKING TRUTH BEGINS TO EMERGE
Normal: Then after the World-Honored One finished speaking this verse, he told Maitreya Bodhisattva:
Normal: "I'm now declaring to all of you in this great assembly—
Normal: Ajita! These great bodhisattvas, these innumerable, uncountable, inconceivable numbers of great beings bursting up from the earth that you never seen before—
Normal: After I attained supreme perfect enlightenment here in this Śākyamuni world, I taught and guided these bodhisattvas. I tamed their minds, caused them to give rise to the intention for the Way.
Normal: All these bodhisattvas have been dwelling right here—underneath this Śākyamuni world, in the empty space below this realm.
Normal: As for the sutras and scriptures, they read them, recite them, understand them thoroughly. They think about them, analyze them, contemplate them correctly and remember them right.
Normal: Ajita, these good sons—they don't love being in crowds with a lot of talking. They always love quiet places where they can practice vigorously without ever resting.
Normal: They don't depend on human or heavenly realms for their dwelling.
Normal: They always love deep wisdom without obstacles or hindrances. And they always love the Dharma of all Buddhas. With single mind and vigorous effort, they seeking supreme wisdom without cease."
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA SPEAKS IN VERSE: THESE ARE MY CHILDREN
Normal: Ajita, you need to know:
Normal: These great bodhisattvas,
Normal: for countless kalpas past,
Normal: been practicing Buddha-wisdom.
Normal: Every one of them is who I taught,
Normal: who I caused to give rise to the great Way-seeking mind.
Normal: These are my children,
Normal: dwelling and depending on this world.
Normal: Always practicing ascetic practices,
Normal: loving quiet places,
Normal: leaving behind the noise and confusion of crowds,
Normal: not loving a lot of talk.
Normal: Children like these,
Normal: they studying and practicing my Way and Dharma.
Normal: Day and night always vigorous,
Normal: for the sake of seeking the Buddha-way.
Normal: They dwelling underneath the Śākyamuni world,
Normal: down in the empty space below,
Normal: their will and mindfulness power rock-solid firm,
Normal: always diligently seeking wisdom,
Normal: Speaking all manner of wonderful Dharma,
Normal: their hearts without any fear.
Normal: I sat underneath the Bodhi tree
Normal: in the city of Gayā,
Normal: Attained the supreme perfect enlightenment,
Normal: turned the unsurpassed Dharma wheel.
Normal: And then I taught and guided them,
Normal: caused them to first give rise to the Way-seeking mind.
Normal: Now they all dwelling in non-retreat,
Normal: and they all gonna attain Buddhahood.
Normal: I'm speaking the real truth now—
Normal: all of you need to believe with one mind:
Normal: From the distant past till now
Normal: I been teaching and guiding this assembly.
Heading 2: MAITREYA'S MIND CAN'T TAKE IT: THE IMPOSSIBLE MATH
Normal: Now at that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva and countless other bodhisattvas—their minds filled up with doubt. They bewildered, amazed, never experienced nothing like this before.
Normal: And they thought:
Normal: "How could the World-Honored One in such a short time teach and guide such countless, boundless, innumerable great bodhisattvas and cause them to dwell in supreme perfect enlightenment?"
Normal: So Maitreya said directly to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, when the Tathāgata was still a prince, he left the palace of the Śākya clan. He went not far from the city of Gayā, sat at the place of enlightenment, and attained supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: From that time till now, it's only been a little more than forty years.
Normal: World-Honored One, how could you in this short time accomplish such a great Buddha-work? How could you, with the Buddha's power and the Buddha's merit, teach and guide such countless great bodhisattvas to the point where they gonna attain supreme perfect enlightenment?
Heading 2: THE STORY NOBODY CAN BELIEVE
Normal: "World-Honored One, this great assembly of bodhisattvas—even if someone spent a thousand million billion kalpas trying to count them, they couldn't finish, couldn't reach the end.
Normal: These beings—from the distant, remote past—they been planting good roots under countless, boundless Buddhas. They done perfected the bodhisattva way. They always been practicing the pure conduct.
Normal: World-Honored One, such a thing as this—the world finds it hard to believe.
Normal: It's like if there was a man with beautiful features and black hair, only twenty-five years old, and he pointed at a hundred-year-old man and said, 'This is my son.' And the hundred-year-old man also pointed at the young one and said, 'This is my father who gave birth to me and raised me.'
Normal: Now that would be hard to believe, wouldn't it?"
Heading 2: THE DEPTH OF THE PROBLEM
Normal: "It's the same with the Buddha. You only attained the Way a short while ago—that's the truth of it.
Normal: But this great assembly of bodhisattvas—they already been practicing for countless thousands of millions of billions of kalpas for the sake of the Buddha-way. They been practicing vigorously, diligently.
Normal: They skilled at entering, leaving, and dwelling in countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of samādhis—deep meditations beyond measure. They obtained great spiritual powers. For a long time they been practicing pure conduct.
Normal: They able to practice good dharmas in proper sequence, step by step. They skillful at questions and answers. They treasures among human beings. They extremely rare in all the worlds.
Normal: And yet today the World-Honored One is saying that when you first attained the Buddha-way, you caused them to first give rise to the aspiration, then taught and guided them, directing them toward supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: World-Honored One, you ain't been Buddha for long—and yet you been able to accomplish this great work of merit!
Normal: Now we do believe in the Buddha. We believe whatever the Buddha says is appropriate to the situation. We know the Buddha's words never empty or false. We know the Buddha's knowledge penetrates everything thoroughly.
Normal: But still—
Normal: Those bodhisattvas who newly given rise to intention, who just starting out—if they hear these words after the Buddha passes away, they might not believe and accept it. And that might cause them to commit the sin of slandering the Dharma, breaking faith with the teaching.
Normal: So please, World-Honored One, explain this for us. Remove our doubts. And also for the good sons and daughters of future ages—when they hear about this matter, let them not have doubts either."
Heading 2: MAITREYA SPEAKS IN VERSE: THIS DON'T ADD UP
Normal: Long ago the Buddha left the Śākya clan,
Normal: went not far from the city of Gayā,
Normal: sat underneath the Bodhi tree—
Normal: and since then it ain't been that long.
Normal: But all these children of the Buddha,
Normal: their numbers beyond all counting—
Normal: they already been walking the Buddha-way for ages,
Normal: dwelling in spiritual powers,
Normal: Well-learned in the bodhisattva path,
Normal: unstained by worldly dharmas,
Normal: like lotus flowers in the water
Normal: bursting up from the earth.
Normal: All of them arising with respectful hearts,
Normal: standing before the World-Honored One.
Normal: This matter is hard to think about—
Normal: how can it be believed?
Normal: The Buddha attained the Way so recently,
Normal: yet what he accomplished is so vast!
Normal: Please remove the doubts of this assembly,
Normal: explain it truly and clearly.
Normal: It's like a young man in his prime,
Normal: only twenty-five years old,
Normal: pointing to people a hundred years old,
Normal: their hair white and faces wrinkled,
Normal: Saying, 'These are the ones I gave birth to.'
Normal: And the sons also saying, 'He is our father.'
Normal: The father young and the sons old—
Normal: the whole world wouldn't believe it.
Normal: The World-Honored One is like that too:
Normal: You attained the Way so recently.
Normal: But these bodhisattvas,
Normal: their will is firm without weakness or cowardice.
Normal: For countless kalpas past
Normal: they been practicing the bodhisattva way.
Normal: They skillful at difficult questions and answers,
Normal: their minds without any fear.
Normal: Their patience-hearts decided and determined,
Normal: dignified and proper with great virtue.
Normal: Praised by Buddhas in the ten directions,
Normal: able to explain distinctions skillfully.
Normal: They don't love being in crowds of people,
Normal: they always prefer deep meditation.
Normal: For the sake of seeking the Buddha-way,
Normal: they dwelling in the empty space below.
Normal: We done heard all this from the Buddha—
Normal: about this matter we got no doubt.
Normal: But we asking Buddha for the sake of future generations:
Normal: Explain it so they can understand.
Normal: If someone has doubts about this sutra,
Normal: doesn't believe it,
Normal: they gonna fall into the evil paths right away.
Normal: So please explain it now:
Normal: How did you, in such a short time,
Normal: teach these countless bodhisattvas,
Normal: cause them to give rise to the aspiration,
Normal: and establish them in the ground of non-retreating?
Normal: END OF CHAPTER FIFTEEN: WHEN THE UNDERGROUND ARMY ROSE UP
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This is the chapter where everything the assembly thought they knew gets turned upside down. They thought Śākyamuni Buddha was a man who lived 80 years ago, who attained enlightenment 40 years back under a tree. But now he's revealing students—vast numbers of students, accomplished students, ancient students—who've been practicing for countless ages.
Normal: The math don't work. The timeline don't work. It's impossible.
Normal: Unless... unless the Buddha is something other than what they thought. Unless his life is deeper than one lifetime. Unless time itself works different when it comes to the Dharma-body of a Buddha.
Normal: That's what Chapter 16 gonna reveal: the Buddha's eternal life, his ancient original enlightenment. But here in Chapter 15, we sitting in the shock of it—in Maitreya's bewildered question, in the image of the 25-year-old father with hundred-year-old sons.
Normal: The four great leaders got names that tell you what practice looks like when it's been going on for ages:
Normal: Superior Practice:
Normal: Not just practicing, but practicing at the highest level
Normal: Boundless Practice:
Normal: Practice without edges, without limits
Normal: Pure Practice:
Normal: Practice that ain't corrupted, ain't compromised
Normal: Well-Established Practice:
Normal: Practice that's rooted deep, that can't be shaken
Normal: They burst from the earth—from underneath, from below, from the hidden places. They been there all along, preparing, waiting, practicing in the dark, in the quiet, in the deep.
Normal: That's the power of this chapter: the revelation that the real work been happening out of sight, beneath the surface, in the underground. And when the time comes, when the call goes out, that hidden strength rises up—a vast army, a golden flood, a force that fills all space.
Normal: The church been praying in the basement all this time. And now it's time to come upstairs.
Heading 1: CHAPTER SIXTEEN: HOW LONG THE TATHĀGATA'S BEEN ALIVE
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE TRIPLE REQUEST—BELIEVE WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU
Normal: At that time, the Buddha spoke to all them bodhisattvas and the whole great assembly. He said:
Normal: "Good sons, y'all need to believe and understand the truthful words of the Tathāgata—the honest-to-God truth I'm speaking."
Normal: And he told that great crowd again:
Normal: "Y'all need to believe and understand the truthful words of the Tathāgata."
Normal: And once more he told that assembly:
Normal: "Y'all need to believe and understand the truthful words of the Tathāgata."
Normal: Now at that time, all them bodhisattvas—that great multitude with Maitreya leading them—they pressed their palms together and said to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, we asking you please—just tell us. We gonna believe what the Buddha says. We gonna receive it and hold it true."
Normal: They said this three times over. Three times they asked. And then they said again:
Normal: "Please, World-Honored One, just tell us. We gonna believe what the Buddha says. We gonna receive it."
Heading 2: THE SECRET THE BUDDHA'S BEEN KEEPING—LISTEN NOW
Normal: Then the World-Honored One, seeing them bodhisattvas ask three times and not stopping, he told them:
Normal: "Y'all listen close now. Listen to the secret spiritual power of the Tathāgata.
Normal: All the world—all the gods, all the humans, all the asuras—everybody thinks the same thing. They say: 'This Śākyamuni Buddha, he left the palace of the Shakya clan. He went not far from the city of Gaya. He sat down at the place of enlightenment and got that supreme perfect enlightenment—that anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.'
Normal: But good sons, listen to what I'm telling you:
Normal: I actually became a Buddha countless, boundless, hundred thousand million billion nayuta uncountable ages ago.
Normal: That's the truth."
Heading 2: THE CALCULATION YOU CAN'T EVEN CALCULATE
Normal: "Let me paint you a picture. Say you took five hundred thousand million billion nayuta asamkhya three-thousand-great-thousand worlds—every single one of them worlds. And say you ground them all down into dust, into powder, into the finest grains you ever saw.
Normal: Then say you started walking east. And after you passed five hundred thousand million billion nayuta asamkhya countries, you put down one single grain of dust. Just one speck.
Normal: And then you kept on walking east like that, passing through all them worlds, dropping one dust grain here, skipping some worlds, dropping one there, walking and walking till every last speck of dust was gone—all used up.
Normal: Now good sons, what you think? Could anybody—any mathematician, any calculator, any scholar with the best mind—could they sit down and figure out how many worlds you passed through? Could they count them up and know the number?"
Normal: Maitreya Bodhisattva and all the others answered the Buddha, saying:
Normal: "World-Honored One, them worlds—they countless, they boundless. They ain't something numbers can know. They ain't something the mind can reach. Even all them voice-hearers and pratyekabuddhas—with all their wisdom free from outflows—they couldn't think their way to knowing that limit, couldn't calculate that number.
Normal: We standing here on the ground of non-backsliding, and even we don't understand this matter.
Normal: World-Honored One, them worlds—they countless, they boundless."
Normal: Then the Buddha told that great bodhisattva assembly:
Normal: "Good sons, I'm gonna tell you clear and plain right now.
Normal: Take all them worlds—the ones where you put down dust and the ones where you didn't—grind them all down into dust. Every single grain of dust, that's one age, one kalpa.
Normal: The time since I became a Buddha is even MORE than that. We talking hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of nayutas of uncountable ages BEYOND all them dust specks.
Normal: And from that time till now, I been constantly here in this Saha world teaching the Dharma, guiding beings. And I also been in hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of nayutas of uncountable other countries, leading and benefiting living beings."
Heading 2: ABOUT THEM OTHER BUDDHAS I TOLD YOU ABOUT
Normal: "Good sons, during all that time—all them ages—I talked about Dipamkara Buddha and others. I said they entered into nirvāṇa, passed away into final rest.
Normal: But all that—all them stories—they was just skillful means, just ways of teaching that fit what folks could understand.
Normal: Good sons, when living beings come to me, I look at them with the Buddha-eye. I see their faith, see their roots—are they sharp or are they dull? Are they ready or not ready?
Normal: And according to what they need to hear—according to how they need to be taught—I show up in different places, call myself by different names, say I'm different ages—young or old, early or late in my teaching career.
Normal: Sometimes I even say: 'I'm about to enter nirvāṇa soon. I'm getting ready to pass on.'
Normal: And I use all kinds of skillful means, all kinds of subtle and wonderful teachings to make living beings feel joy, to help them generate happiness.
Normal: Good sons, the Tathāgata sees that some living beings—they love the small teachings. They got thin virtue and heavy dirt on them. For people like that, I tell them:
Normal: 'When I was young, I left home and got that supreme perfect enlightenment.'
Normal: But the truth is, I been a Buddha for a vast, long time—so long you can't measure it. I just use skillful means to teach living beings, to help them enter the Buddha-path. That's why I say what I say."
Heading 2: EVERYTHING THE BUDDHA SAYS IS TRUE—EVEN WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE A LIE
Normal: "Good sons, all the sutras the Tathāgata speaks—every teaching, every scripture—they all for saving living beings, for setting them free.
Normal: Sometimes I talk about my own life.
Normal: Sometimes I talk about someone else's life.
Normal: Sometimes I show my own body.
Normal: Sometimes I show someone else's body.
Normal: Sometimes I talk about my own affairs.
Normal: Sometimes I talk about someone else's affairs.
Normal: But everything I say—every word spoken—is real. It ain't false. It ain't empty.
Normal: Why's that?
Normal: Because the Tathāgata sees the three worlds just like they really are. He sees them truly, sees them clearly.
Normal: There ain't no birth and death.
Normal: Ain't no retreating, ain't no going forth.
Normal: Ain't nobody really in the world, ain't nobody really passing out of it.
Normal: It ain't real, it ain't false.
Normal: It ain't like this, it ain't like that.
Normal: It ain't the way the three worlds see the three worlds.
Normal: All this—the Tathāgata sees it clearly, sees it plainly, without a single mistake, without one error.
Normal: Living beings got all kinds of natures, all kinds of desires, all kinds of actions, all kinds of thoughts and imaginings running through their minds.
Normal: I want them to plant good roots. So I use all kinds of causes and conditions, all kinds of parables and stories, all kinds of words and ways of speaking. I teach the Dharma in every way you can imagine.
Normal: The Buddha-work I do—it ain't never stopped. It ain't never rested. Not for one single moment.
Normal: And so—I been a Buddha for a vast, great, long time. My lifespan is countless uncountable ages. I'm constantly dwelling here. I don't pass away."
Heading 2: WHY THE BUDDHA PLAYS LIKE HE'S DYING WHEN HE AIN'T
Normal: "Good sons, the lifespan I got—the life I achieved when I first walked the bodhisattva path—that lifespan still ain't finished yet. It's still going. It's twice as long as all them ages I just told you about, and more.
Normal: But even though I ain't really gonna pass into extinction, I announce it anyway. I say: 'I'm about to enter final nirvāṇa.'
Normal: The Tathāgata uses this skillful means to teach living beings.
Normal: Why's that? Why do I do it this way?
Normal: Because if the Buddha stayed in the world a long time—if I was always here, always visible, always present—then people with thin virtue, people who ain't planted good roots yet, people who poor and low-down and greedy and attached to the five desires, people caught up in the net of wrong thoughts and false views—
Normal: If they saw the Tathāgata always here and never passing away, they'd get arrogant. They'd get lazy and complacent. They wouldn't feel that sense of 'This is rare! This is precious! This is hard to meet!'
Normal: They wouldn't have respect. They wouldn't have reverence.
Normal: So the Tathāgata uses skillful means and says to them:
Normal: 'Monks, you should know—it's hard to meet a Buddha in the world. It's a rare thing. It don't happen often.'
Normal: Why's that? Why's it so rare?
Normal: Because people with thin virtue—they can go through countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of ages, and some might see a Buddha, but some won't. They might never see one at all.
Normal: Because of this—because it's so rare—I say to them:
Normal: 'Monks, the Tathāgata is hard to see. It ain't easy to meet the Tathāgata.'
Normal: When living beings hear these words, they bound to feel it—that longing, that sense of how rare it is, how hard it is to meet a Buddha. Their hearts gonna fill up with yearning and longing. They gonna thirst after the Buddha.
Normal: And then they gonna plant good roots.
Normal: That's why the Tathāgata—even though he ain't really passing into extinction—he says he's gonna pass away.
Normal: He says he's dying when he ain't dying.
Normal: This ain't false. This is medicine."
Heading 2: THE PARABLE OF THE GOOD DOCTOR AND HIS POISONED CHILDREN
Normal: "And also, good sons, all the Buddhas and Tathāgatas—their way is just like this. Everything they do is real, ain't nothing false. It's all to save living beings.
Normal: Let me tell you a story:
Normal: Say there was a good doctor—a excellent physician, wise and intelligent, thoroughly understanding medicines and prescriptions, skilled at curing all kinds of sicknesses.
Normal: This man had a lot of sons—maybe ten, maybe twenty, could be a hundred of them.
Normal: One day he had to leave on some business. He traveled far away to another country.
Normal: After the father left, all his children back home—they found some poison and drank it by mistake. They didn't know what they was drinking.
Normal: That poison started working in their bodies. They started rolling on the ground, writhing and crying out, confused and tormented.
Normal: Then the father came back home.
Normal: Some of his sons—the ones who drunk the poison—some of them had completely lost their minds. But some still had a bit of sense left in them, still had some clarity.
Normal: When they saw their father coming from far off, they all felt great joy. They bowed down, they greeted him, they said:
Normal: 'Welcome back safe and sound, father! We been foolish. We drunk poison by mistake. Please heal us! Please give us back our lives! Please don't let us die!'
Normal: The father saw his children suffering like that—in such pain, in such agony. So right away, following all the medical texts and prescriptions, he went and gathered excellent medicinal herbs—herbs with perfect color, perfect fragrance, perfect taste. All the qualities was just right.
Normal: He ground them up, sifted them, mixed them together real fine, and gave the medicine to his children to drink. And he said to them:
Normal: 'This here is excellent medicine. The color is excellent, the fragrance is excellent, the taste is excellent. Y'all take this and drink it down. It's gonna remove your suffering real quick. You won't have no more pain, no more sickness.'"
Heading 2: SOME TAKE THE MEDICINE, SOME DON'T
Normal: "Now among all them children, the ones who ain't completely lost their minds—the ones who still had some sense—when they saw that good medicine, saw the color and smelled the fragrance, they took it right away and drank it down.
Normal: And their sickness was completely healed. All the poison left their bodies.
Normal: But the other children—the ones who had completely lost their minds—when they saw their father come home, they was also happy. They also asked him to heal them, asked for the medicine.
Normal: But when he gave them that medicine, they wouldn't take it. They wouldn't drink it.
Normal: Why not?
Normal: Because the poison had gone so deep. It had messed up their minds so bad, they had lost their original nature. Even though that medicine had perfect color and perfect fragrance, they looked at it and thought it was ugly. They thought it was nasty.
Normal: The father thought to himself:
Normal: 'My poor children. They so pitiful. The poison done made them crazy, done made them insane. Even though they happy to see me, even though they begging me to heal them—when I give them this good medicine, they won't take it.
Normal: I got to set up some skillful means to make them take this medicine.'
Normal: So he said to them:
Normal: 'Y'all need to know something. I'm old now. I'm worn down. My time to die is coming soon.
Normal: This good medicine—this excellent medicine—I'm gonna leave it right here for y'all. Y'all can take it and drink it. Don't worry that it won't heal you. It will.'
Normal: After he gave them these instructions, he left again. He went far away to another country.
Normal: Then he sent a messenger back home with a message:
Normal: 'Your father is dead.'"
Heading 2: THE CHILDREN WAKE UP
Normal: "When them children heard that their father had died—that he was gone, that he'd passed away—their hearts filled up with great sorrow and pain. They thought:
Normal: 'If our father was still alive, he would love us. He would protect us. He would take care of us.
Normal: But now he done left us. He done died far away in another country.
Normal: We orphans now. We ain't got nobody. We alone.'
Normal: Constant grief, constant sadness—that's what they felt. And in that grieving, in that sorrow, their minds finally came back. They woke up. They sobered up.
Normal: They realized that medicine—that medicine their father left—it actually had excellent color, excellent fragrance, excellent taste after all.
Normal: So they took it. They drank it down.
Normal: And all the poison in their bodies—it was healed. It was cured. They was completely well again.
Normal: When the father heard that all his children was healed and cured, he came back right away. He came back home and showed himself to all of them.
Normal: He let them see him alive."
Heading 2: DID THAT DOCTOR LIE? CAN YOU CALL HIM A LIAR?
Normal: "Now good sons, what you think about this?
Normal: Could anybody—could any person—say that good doctor told a lie? Could they accuse him of being false when he said he was dead?"
Normal: "No, World-Honored One. Nobody could say that."
Normal: The Buddha said:
Normal: "I'm the same way. I'm just like that doctor.
Normal: I became a Buddha countless, boundless, hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of nayutas of uncountable ages ago.
Normal: But for the sake of living beings, I use the power of skillful means and say: 'I'm about to enter nirvāṇa. I'm about to pass away.'
Normal: And ain't nobody—ain't no one anywhere—who can truthfully say I'm speaking falsely. Ain't no one can accuse me of lying.
Normal: Because what I'm doing is the Dharma. What I'm doing is the medicine. What I'm doing is truth in the form that can heal."
Normal: Since I became a Buddha,
Normal: The ages I been through—
Normal: Countless hundreds of thousands of millions,
Normal: Billions, uncountable, nayutas too.
Normal: I been constantly teaching the Dharma,
Normal: Teaching countless billions of living souls,
Normal: Leading them into the Buddha-way,
Normal: Helping them reach them spiritual goals.
Normal: For countless ages it's been like this,
Normal: And to save living beings, you know,
Normal: I skillfully appear to enter nirvāṇa—
Normal: But I ain't really going, I don't really go.
Normal: I actually stay right here,
Normal: Constantly teaching this Dharma true,
Normal: I constantly dwelling in this place,
Normal: But with my spiritual power, I do—
Normal: I make the upside-down, confused beings,
Normal: Even though they close, they don't see me near.
Normal: The multitudes see me passing away,
Normal: They make offerings to my relics with many a tear.
Normal: They all cherish me and long for me,
Normal: Their hearts fill up with thirst and desire.
Normal: When living beings believe and submit like that,
Normal: When they honest and gentle, when they aspire—
Normal: When they single-minded, wanting to see the Buddha,
Normal: Not caring even if it cost their life—
Normal: Then I appear with the whole assembly
Normal: On Vulture Peak, free from all strife.
Normal: And I tell them living beings right then:
Normal: "I'm always here, I don't pass away.
Normal: It's just skillful means, the way I appear—
Normal: Sometimes here, sometimes gone—that's my way.
Normal: If beings in other countries
Normal: Are reverent, full of faith and joy,
Normal: Then I appear among them too,
Normal: Teaching the unsurpassed Dharma I employ.
Normal: But y'all don't hear about this,
Normal: Y'all just think I done passed on.
Normal: But I see all them living beings
Normal: Drowning in suffering, alone and forlorn.
Normal: So I don't show my body to them yet,
Normal: I make them long, I make them yearn.
Normal: And when their hearts full up with longing,
Normal: Then I appear—then they learn.
Normal: My spiritual power is like this,
Normal: For uncountable ages, countless time,
Normal: I been constantly on Vulture Peak
Normal: And in every other place of mine.
Normal: When living beings see the age ending,
Normal: See the world burning up in flame,
Normal: My land here—it's peaceful and calm,
Normal: It's full of gods and humans, all the same.
Normal: Gardens and groves, halls and towers,
Normal: Adorned with every kind of jewel and treasure.
Normal: Precious trees full of flowers and fruit,
Normal: Where living beings play at their leisure.
Normal: The gods strike their heavenly drums,
Normal: Always making music, never ending.
Normal: Raining down mandarava flowers,
Normal: On the Buddha and the assembly descending.
Normal: My Pure Land ain't destroyed,
Normal: But living beings see it burned to the ground.
Normal: They see worry, fear, and suffering—
Normal: All kinds of pain and trouble around.
Normal: These sinful living beings,
Normal: Because of their bad karma and evil ways,
Normal: They go through uncountable ages
Normal: Never hearing the names of the Three Jewels, all their days.
Normal: But those who practice merit and virtue,
Normal: Who gentle and honest and upright—
Normal: They all see me right here,
Normal: Teaching the Dharma in their sight.
Normal: Sometimes I tell this assembly:
Normal: 'The Buddha's lifespan is measureless, without end.'
Normal: For those who only see the Buddha rarely,
Normal: I say: 'Buddhas are hard to meet, my friend.'
Normal: My wisdom power is just like this,
Normal: My light of wisdom shining without bound.
Normal: My lifespan is countless ages—
Normal: From long practice of good deeds, this life I found.
Normal: Y'all who got wisdom and intelligence,
Normal: Don't be doubtful about this teaching here.
Normal: Cut off all your doubts forever—
Normal: The Buddha's words are real and true and clear.
Normal: Like that doctor using skillful means,
Normal: To cure his crazy children's suffering plight—
Normal: He really was alive, but said he was dead,
Normal: And nobody can say that wasn't right.
Normal: I'm also the father of the world,
Normal: Saving all them suffering ones from pain.
Normal: Because ordinary people upside-down and confused,
Normal: Though I'm really here, I say I don't remain.
Normal: If they always seeing me here,
Normal: They gonna get arrogant, proud, and loose,
Normal: Selfish and lazy, attached to the five desires,
Normal: Falling down into the evil paths, no use.
Normal: I always know which living beings—
Normal: Which ones walking the path, which ones ain't.
Normal: According to what they need to hear for salvation,
Normal: I teach them all kinds of Dharma, without restraint.
Normal: Every single moment I'm thinking this:
Normal: 'How can I make living beings see—
Normal: How can I help them enter the unsurpassed wisdom,
Normal: And quickly achieve the Buddha-body, free?'"
Normal: END OF CHAPTER SIXTEEN: HOW LONG THE TATHĀGATA'S BEEN ALIVE
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter reveals the most profound teaching in the Lotus Sutra—that Buddha's enlightenment wasn't 40-some years ago near Gaya, but countless eons in the past. He's been here all along, teaching everywhere, appearing and disappearing like a good father who knows when his children need to see him and when they need to miss him.
Normal: The mathematics of time in this chapter defies comprehension—grinding infinite worlds to dust, walking through infinite space, dropping dust grains, then converting every world into an eon, and Buddha's been enlightened LONGER than that. It's Buddhist teaching breaking the mind's ability to calculate, forcing us past numbers into pure mystery.
Normal: The parable of the physician and his children is one of the most beautiful and troubling stories in Buddhist literature. The doctor's "lie" about his death is medicine more powerful than the herbs he left behind. His absence becomes the cure for the poison that made the good medicine look bad. This is upaya—skillful means—at its most sophisticated: truth told through apparent falsehood, healing that comes through absence rather than presence.
Normal: The closing verses reveal Buddha's eternal presence on Vulture Peak, in the Pure Land that exists right here beneath the suffering world we see with our poisoned perception. Those with eyes to see—with merit and virtue—they see gardens and jewels and heavenly music. Those still poisoned see only fire and destruction. Same place, different vision.
Normal: This is the blues truth: God's always been here, never left, but sometimes you can't see Him till you feel His absence so strong it breaks your heart open. Sometimes you gotta lose what you thought you had to find what was always there. Sometimes the truth comes dressed up like a lie because a lie dressed up like truth is all you ready to hear.
Heading 1: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: COUNTING UP THE GRACE
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE INSTANT SALVATION
Normal: Now listen here—when the Buddha finished telling them about his eternal life, about how he been living forever and ain't never gonna die, when he laid that truth down in Chapter 16, something happened right then and there in that assembly. I mean something HAPPENED.
Normal: The World-Honored One turned to Maitreya Bodhisattva and said:
Normal: "Ajita, let me tell you what went down while I was speaking. Let me count it up for you, let me measure out the grace that fell on this congregation:
Normal: Six hundred and eighty million billion times the sands of the Ganges River—that many beings got themselves the patience that don't arise. You hear me? They reached that place where they ain't scared of nothing no more, where the truth of how things really are don't make them flinch. They got that no-fear state, that calm-in-the-storm mind.
Normal: And a thousand times that many Bodhisattvas—a THOUSAND times more—they received the dhāraṇī of perfect hearing. They can hear the Dharma once and hold it forever, won't never forget it.
Normal: And as many Bodhisattvas as there are dust particles in one whole world system—that many got themselves the gift of unobstructed eloquence. They can talk about the truth and the words just flow like water, like honey, like joy pouring out.
Normal: And as many Bodhisattvas as there are dust particles in one whole world—that many received billions and billions of dhāraṇīs, memory powers beyond counting, holding the teachings like treasure in their minds.
Normal: And as many Bodhisattvas as there are dust particles in three thousand great thousand world systems—that vast number can now turn the wheel that don't retreat. They set to rolling and ain't nothing gonna stop them, they ain't never going backward.
Normal: And as many Bodhisattvas as there are dust particles in two middle-sized world systems—that many can turn the pure Dharma wheel.
Normal: And as many Bodhisattvas as there are dust particles in one small world system—that many gonna reach supreme enlightenment within eight lifetimes. Eight births and they're home free!
Normal: And as many Bodhisattvas as there are dust particles in four continents—that many gonna make it in four lifetimes.
Normal: Three continents' worth of dust—that many in three lifetimes.
Normal: Two continents' worth—that many in two lifetimes.
Normal: One continent's worth of dust particles—that many gonna reach enlightenment in just ONE more life. One more turn and they're done!
Normal: And as many beings as there are dust particles in eight whole worlds—that vast multitude of souls set their hearts on supreme enlightenment right then and there. They made the vow, they signed up, they committed."
Heading 2: HEAVEN ITSELF REJOICED
Normal: Now when the Buddha finished telling about all these beings who got blessed, who received the benefit, who caught the grace—
Normal: Heaven couldn't hold it in no more.
Normal: From the empty sky came falling down mandarava flowers and great mandarava flowers, scattering over all the countless jeweled trees where Buddhas were sitting on lion thrones, scattering over the seven-jeweled stupa where Śākyamuni Buddha and long-extinct Many Treasures Tathāgata were seated together, scattering over all the great Bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly.
Normal: And then came raining down fine powdered sandalwood and sinking-in-water aloeswood, drifting through the air like snow, like mercy, like blessing made visible.
Normal: In the empty sky, the heaven drums started playing themselves—nobody beating them, they just spoke out with wonderful sound that went deep and far, echoing through the worlds.
Normal: Then came falling a thousand kinds of heavenly garments, and strings of jewels descending—pearl necklaces, mani gem necklaces, wish-fulfilling jewel necklaces—spreading out through all nine directions.
Normal: Jeweled incense burners appeared, burning priceless incense, moving by themselves through the air, offering themselves to that great assembly.
Normal: Above every single Buddha, Bodhisattvas were holding banners and canopies, raising them up higher and higher until they reached to Brahma Heaven itself.
Normal: And those Bodhisattvas sang with wonderful voices, sang countless verses of praise to all the Buddhas.
Heading 2: MAITREYA SPEAKS THE WONDER
Normal: Right then Maitreya Bodhisattva rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, pressed his palms together toward the Buddha, and spoke in verse:
Normal: The Buddha speaks a rare teaching,
Normal: Something we ain't never heard before.
Normal: The World-Honored One got great power,
Normal: His life can't be measured no more.
Normal: Countless children of the Buddha,
Normal: Hearing the World-Honored One explain,
Normal: Telling who got what benefit—
Normal: Joy filling them up like rain.
Normal: Some standing on ground that don't retreat,
Normal: Some got dhāraṇīs in their mind,
Normal: Some got unobstructed eloquent speech,
Normal: Millions of total-holding of every kind.
Normal: Some—many as the great thousand world's dust—
Normal: Each one of those Bodhisattvas can turn
Normal: The Dharma wheel that don't go backward,
Normal: They rolling forward, they gonna burn.
Normal: And many as the middle thousand world's dust,
Normal: Those Bodhisattvas each can turn
Normal: The pure and clean Dharma wheel,
Normal: They got the teaching, they gonna learn.
Normal: And many as the small thousand world's dust,
Normal: Those Bodhisattvas got eight births remaining,
Normal: Then they gonna reach the Buddha Way,
Normal: They already halfway through the training.
Normal: And then four, three, two continents' worth,
Normal: That many Bodhisattvas in descending number,
Normal: Gonna be born that many times and reach Buddhahood—
Normal: They coming out they spiritual slumber.
Normal: One continent's dust of Bodhisattvas,
Normal: They got just one life left to go,
Normal: Then they gonna reach all-wisdom,
Normal: Next time around they gonna know.
Normal: All these beings,
Normal: Hearing Buddha's life is long,
Normal: They got immeasurable, leakless,
Normal: Pure fruit—everything went from wrong to strong.
Normal: And eight worlds' worth of dust—that many beings,
Normal: Hearing Buddha speak about his lifespan,
Normal: All of them set their hearts on the supreme,
Normal: They joining up with the enlightenment plan.
Normal: The World-Honored One speaks immeasurable truths,
Normal: Inconceivable teachings come out his mouth,
Normal: Bringing vast benefit,
Normal: Boundless as space—north, east, west, and south.
Normal: Raining down heavenly mandarava flowers,
Normal: And the great mandaravas too,
Normal: Indra and Brahma—many as Ganges sands—
Normal: Coming from countless Buddha-lands, coming through.
Normal: Raining sandalwood and aloeswood,
Normal: Swirling and falling in wild disarray,
Normal: Like birds flying down from the sky,
Normal: Scattering offerings on the Buddhas where they stay.
Normal: Heaven drums in the empty air
Normal: Naturally letting out wonderful sound,
Normal: Heavenly garments by the thousands and ten thousands
Normal: Spinning and descending to the ground.
Normal: Jeweled incense burners, wonderful and fragrant,
Normal: Burning priceless incense true,
Normal: Naturally spreading everywhere,
Normal: Making offerings to all the World-Honored Ones come through.
Normal: The great assembly of Bodhisattvas,
Normal: Holding seven-jeweled banners and canopies,
Normal: Wonderful and high—millions and billions of kinds—
Normal: Raising them in sequence up to Brahma's boundaries.
Normal: Before each and every Buddha,
Normal: Jeweled poles hanging victory banners down,
Normal: And with thousands and ten thousands of verses
Normal: They singing the Tathāgatas' renown.
Normal: All these various things,
Normal: Never happened before like this,
Normal: Hearing Buddha's life is limitless,
Normal: Everybody filled with bliss.
Normal: The Buddha's name heard in the ten directions,
Normal: Widely benefiting all living beings,
Normal: Everyone equipped with good roots,
Normal: Helping them toward the supreme, toward what enlightenment means.
Heading 2: THE SHOCKING COMPARISON
Normal: Right then the Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva:
Normal: "Ajita, listen now. If there's beings who hear about the Buddha's lifespan being long like I just explained—if they can, even for one single thought-moment, generate faith and understanding—the merit they gonna get, that merit ain't got no limit. It can't be measured.
Normal: Now suppose there's a good man or a good woman who wants supreme perfect enlightenment, and for that goal they practice the Five Perfections for eighty myriads of millions of billions of nayutas of eons—
Normal: Let me tell you what that looks like:
Normal: GIVING: For all those eons, giving gifts. Giving to Buddhas, giving to solitary realizers, giving to Bodhisattvas. Giving precious and wonderful food and drink. Giving the finest clothes and bedding. Building temples out of sandalwood. Creating parks and gardens to make them beautiful. All kinds of giving, every kind wonderful and fine, through all those countless eons, dedicating it all toward the Buddha Way.
Normal: KEEPING PRECEPTS: Pure ethical conduct, clean and without a crack or leak, seeking the supreme path, the kind of conduct all Buddhas praise.
Normal: PATIENCE: Practicing forbearance, dwelling in that gentle, flexible ground. Even when all kinds of evil people come attacking, adding insults and harm, the mind don't tilt, don't tip over, don't move. Even when people who got a little bit of the Dharma come at you with their arrogance, looking down on you and troubling you—you can bear that too.
Normal: DILIGENT EFFORT: Vigorously progressing, your intention and mindfulness always solid and firm, for immeasurable hundreds of millions of eons, single-minded, never resting, never slacking off even once.
Normal: MEDITATION: Living for countless eons in quiet, empty places, whether sitting or walking, always—except when sleeping—keeping your mind collected and controlled. And because of this, producing all the meditations and concentrations, stable and unshaken in mind for eighty hundreds of millions of eons.
Normal: Taking all this one-pointed meditative merit and using it to seek the supreme path. Getting all the wisdom, mastering all the meditation states.
Normal: For hundreds and thousands of millions and billions of eons, this person practices all these meritorious virtues just like I described.
Normal: But then—
Normal: If there's a good man or good woman who hears me speak about my lifespan and believes it for even ONE SINGLE THOUGHT-MOMENT—
Normal: The blessing they get EXCEEDS all that other merit.
Normal: It ain't even close.
Normal: Not one part in a hundred. Not one part in a thousand. Not one part in hundreds of thousands of millions of billions. Can't even calculate the comparison. Can't make the numbers work. The metaphors fail.
Normal: If a good man or good woman has this kind of merit from believing—
Normal: Impossible they gonna retreat from supreme enlightenment.
Normal: Can't happen.
Normal: No such place exists where that could occur."
Normal: If someone seeking Buddha wisdom
Normal: For eighty myriads of millions of billions
Normal: Of nayuta eons
Normal: Practices the Five Perfections—
Normal: During all those eons,
Normal: Giving offerings to Buddhas,
Normal: To solitary realizers and their disciples,
Normal: And to Bodhisattva assemblies—
Normal: Precious and wonderful food and drink,
Normal: Fine clothing and bedding,
Normal: Building sandalwood temples,
Normal: Decorating them with gardens and groves—
Normal: All this kind of giving,
Normal: Various and wonderful in every way,
Normal: Through all those eons,
Normal: Dedicating it to the Buddha Way—
Normal: If they also keep the precepts,
Normal: Pure and clean, without crack or leak,
Normal: Seeking the supreme path,
Normal: The kind all Buddhas praise and speak—
Normal: If they also practice patience,
Normal: Dwelling on that ground of gentle adjustment,
Normal: Even when crowds of evil come attacking,
Normal: Their mind don't incline, don't make that judgment—
Normal: And when those who got a little Dharma,
Normal: Holding on to their prideful ways,
Normal: Look down and trouble this patient one,
Normal: Still able to endure throughout their days—
Normal: If they also diligently progress,
Normal: Their will and mindfulness constantly firm and strong,
Normal: For immeasurable hundreds of millions of eons
Normal: Single-minded, never lazy for long—
Normal: And for countless eons more,
Normal: Dwelling in quiet and empty places,
Normal: Whether sitting or walking,
Normal: Except for sleep, always gathering their mental spaces—
Normal: And because of this,
Normal: Able to produce all those meditation states,
Normal: For eighty hundreds of millions of eons
Normal: Dwelling in mental stability, mind that concentrates—
Normal: Holding this one-pointed blessing,
Normal: Seeking the supreme Way in their heart,
Normal: Saying: 'I will get all-wisdom,
Normal: Exhaust all meditative arts'—
Normal: This person, for hundreds and thousands
Normal: And millions and billions of eons,
Normal: Practices all these meritorious virtues
Normal: Like I just described with all these reasons—
Normal: But if there's good men or women
Normal: Who hear me speak about my lifespan,
Normal: And believe it even for one thought-moment,
Normal: Their blessing exceeds that other plan.
Normal: If a person completely without
Normal: Any doubt or regret at all,
Normal: Believes with deep mind even briefly,
Normal: Their blessing is like this—so tall.
Normal: Those Bodhisattvas who,
Normal: For immeasurable eons, walked the Way,
Normal: Hearing me speak about my lifespan,
Normal: They can believe and accept what I say.
Normal: People like this
Normal: Receive this scripture on the crown of their head,
Normal: Making this vow: 'In the future,
Normal: May I have long life and leave none unfed.
Normal: Just like the World-Honored One today,
Normal: King among the Shakya clan,
Normal: Lion-roaring in the place of enlightenment,
Normal: Speaking Dharma fearless—that's my plan.
Normal: We, in the worlds to come,
Normal: Honored and respected by everyone there,
Normal: When sitting in the place of enlightenment,
Normal: Will speak about lifespan in the same way—with care.'
Normal: If there are those with deep mind,
Normal: Pure and straightforward and true,
Normal: Much learning and able to retain it,
Normal: Understanding Buddha's words according to their cue—
Normal: People like this
Normal: About this teaching have no doubt."
Heading 2: WHAT DEEP FAITH LOOKS LIKE
Normal: "Furthermore, Ajita, if someone hears about the Buddha's long lifespan and understands what it's getting at, the merit that person gets got no limit. They can arouse the Tathāgata's supreme wisdom.
Normal: How much more so if they widely hear this scripture, or teach others to hear it, or hold it themselves, or teach others to hold it, or write it themselves, or teach others to write it, or make offerings to the scripture scroll with flowers, incense, necklaces, banners, canopies, silk hangings, fragrant oils and butter lamps—that person's merit is immeasurable and boundless. It can produce the wisdom that knows all kinds.
Normal: Ajita, if a good man or good woman hears me speak about my long lifespan and believes it with deep mind and understanding—then they seeing the Buddha constantly present on Vulture Peak Mountain, surrounded by the great Bodhisattvas and the assembly of hearers, speaking the Dharma.
Normal: And more: they seeing this Saha world, how the ground is lapis lazuli, level and even and smooth. The roads marked out with Jambu-river gold in eight directions. Jeweled trees standing in rows. Towers and pavilions all made of jewels. And the assembly of Bodhisattvas dwelling right there in them.
Normal: If someone can see like this, you should know: this is the sign of deep faith and understanding.
Heading 2: EVEN JUST NOT REJECTING IT
Normal: Furthermore, after the Tathāgata passes into extinction, if someone hears this scripture and don't tear it down, don't speak against it, but just feels a little joy rise up in their heart—you should know: this already is the sign of deep faith and understanding.
Normal: How much more so someone who reads and recites it, who receives and holds it—that person carrying the Tathāgata on top of their head.
Normal: Ajita, this good man or good woman don't need to build stupas or temples for me, don't need to construct monks' quarters or make the fourfold offering to the monastic community.
Normal: Why not?
Normal: Because a good man or good woman who receives, holds, reads, and recites this scripture—they already raised up a stupa, already built the monks' quarters, already made offering to the community.
Normal: It means they already raised up a seven-jeweled stupa over the Buddha's relics—tall and wide, tapering smaller as it rises up to Brahma Heaven, with banners and canopies hanging from it and many jeweled bells, with flowers and incense and necklaces, with powdered incense and paste incense and burning incense, with drums and music, with flutes and pipes and harps, with all kinds of dancing and performance, with wonderful sound and voice singing praises—and they already been making this offering for immeasurable thousands and myriads and hundreds of millions of eons.
Heading 2: THE INVISIBLE MONASTERY
Normal: Ajita, if after I pass into extinction, someone hears this scripture and can receive and hold it, whether writing it themselves or teaching others to write it—then they have built a monastery of thirty-two halls made of red sandalwood, each hall eight tala trees tall, high and wide and beautiful, with a hundred thousand monks dwelling there, with gardens and bathing pools, with walking paths and meditation caves, with robes and food and drink, with beds and bedding and medicine, with all kinds of joyful necessities filling it up completely. Monasteries and halls like this—hundreds and thousands and myriads and hundreds of millions of them, uncountably many—appearing right in front of them, making offering to me and to the community of monks.
Normal: So that's why I say: After the Tathāgata passes into extinction, if someone can receive, hold, read, recite, and speak this scripture for others, or write it themselves or teach others to write it, or make offerings to the scripture scroll—they don't need to build stupas or temples or construct monks' quarters or make offerings to the monastic community.
Normal: How much more so if someone can hold this scripture and also practice giving, keeping precepts, patience, diligent effort, single-mindedness, and wisdom—their virtue is supreme, immeasurable, boundless.
Normal: It's like empty space—east, west, south, north, the four intermediate directions, above, below—immeasurable and boundless.
Normal: That person's merit, likewise, is immeasurable and boundless like that.
Normal: They quickly arrive at the wisdom that knows all kinds.
Normal: If someone reads, recites, receives, and holds this scripture, speaks it for others, writes it themselves or teaches others to write it, and also can build stupas and construct monks' quarters, make offerings and praises to the community of hearers, and with hundreds of thousands of myriads of hundreds of millions of praising methods praise the merit of Bodhisattvas, and for other people, according to various causes and conditions, explains this Dharma Flower Scripture following its meanings, and also can purely keep the precepts, dwelling together with gentle and flexible people, patient and without anger, with firm will and mindfulness, always valuing sitting meditation and attaining deep meditations, vigorously brave and gathering in all good dharmas, with sharp faculties and wisdom, good at answering difficult questions—
Heading 2: ALREADY AT THE TREE
Normal: Ajita, if after I pass into extinction, good men and good women who receive, hold, read, and recite this scripture also have these kinds of good meritorious virtues—you should know: this person already proceeding to the place of enlightenment, drawing near to supreme perfect enlightenment, sitting under the tree of the Way.
Normal: Ajita, wherever that good man or good woman sits, stands, or walks—right there a stupa should be built. All the gods and humans should make offerings to it like it's the Buddha's stupa."
Normal: If after I pass into extinction,
Normal: Someone can respectfully hold this scripture,
Normal: That person's blessing is immeasurable,
Normal: Like I explained up there for sure.
Normal: This means they completely fulfilled
Normal: All the various offerings made,
Normal: Raising up a stupa with relics,
Normal: Adorned with seven jewels displayed—
Normal: The pole reaching high and wide,
Normal: Tapering smaller up to Brahma's place,
Normal: Jeweled bells by the thousands and myriads of hundreds of millions,
Normal: Wind moving them with wonderful sound and grace.
Normal: And for immeasurable eons
Normal: Making offerings to this stupa tall,
Normal: With flowers and incense and many necklaces,
Normal: Heavenly clothes and music for all,
Normal: Burning fragrant oil and butter lamps,
Normal: Constantly illuminating all around.
Normal: In the evil age when Dharma's ending,
Normal: If someone can hold this scripture found—
Normal: It means they already, like I said above,
Normal: Completely fulfilled all the offerings made.
Normal: If someone can hold this scripture,
Normal: It's like the Buddha's still here, not yet decayed.
Normal: With ox-head sandalwood
Normal: Building monks' quarters as an offering place,
Normal: With thirty-two halls,
Normal: Each one eight tala trees high, full of grace—
Normal: Fine food and wonderful clothing,
Normal: Beds and bedding all fulfilled,
Normal: Hundreds and thousands dwelling there,
Normal: Gardens and bathing pools all built,
Normal: Walking paths and meditation caves,
Normal: Everything beautiful in various ways.
Normal: If someone with faithful, understanding mind
Normal: Receives, holds, reads, recites through their days,
Normal: Or also teaches others to write it,
Normal: And makes offerings to the scripture scroll,
Normal: Scattering flowers, incense, powdered incense,
Normal: With sumanas, champaka from the soul,
Normal: Atimuktaka flowers and fragrant oils
Normal: Constantly burning them bright—
Normal: One who makes offerings like this
Normal: Gets immeasurable merit and light.
Normal: Boundless as empty space,
Normal: So is their blessing likewise.
Normal: How much more so holding this scripture
Normal: While also giving, that's twice as wise—
Normal: And keeping precepts, patient, loving meditation,
Normal: Not angry, not speaking evil or mean,
Normal: Respectful toward stupas and temples,
Normal: Humble toward all monks seen,
Normal: Far away from prideful mind,
Normal: Always contemplating wisdom's way,
Normal: When questioned and challenged, not getting angry,
Normal: Following along to explain, to say—
Normal: If someone can practice this practice,
Normal: Their merit can't be measured.
Normal: If you see this Dharma teacher
Normal: Accomplished in virtue to be treasured,
Normal: You should scatter heavenly flowers on them,
Normal: Cover their body with heavenly clothes,
Normal: Touch your head to the ground at their feet,
Normal: Think of them as the Buddha—that's how it goes.
Normal: You should also make this thought:
Normal: 'Before long they'll proceed to the place of the Way,
Normal: Attaining leakless and unconditioned truth,
Normal: Widely benefiting people and gods—both night and day.'
Normal: The place where they dwell and stay,
Normal: Where they walk or sit or lie,
Normal: Even if they speak just one verse there,
Normal: In that spot a stupa should rise high,
Normal: Adorned and made beautiful,
Normal: Offered to in various ways.
Normal: A child of Buddha dwelling on this ground—
Normal: This is the Buddha's place for all his days,
Normal: Constantly present right there within,
Normal: Walking around and sitting and lying down."
Normal: END OF CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: COUNTING UP THE GRACE
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter is about the mathematics of grace—the impossible calculation that one moment of faith outweighs eons of effort. It's the scandal at the heart of the Dharma: you can work for billions of lifetimes doing everything right, or you can simply believe for one instant what the Buddha revealed in Chapter 16 (his eternal life), and that one instant of faith generates more merit.
Normal: The blues/gospel tradition knows this paradox well—salvation by grace, not by works; the last made first; the thief on the cross entering paradise that very day. The structure of this chapter—the counting, the comparison, the shock, the celebration—mirrors revival meeting testimonies where people try to count up what God has done and the numbers just keep climbing until words fail.
Normal: Key metaphors preserved:
Normal: Dust particles
Normal: : The traditional Buddhist way of counting the uncountable, here rendered plainly to let the accumulation itself create wonder.
Normal: The invisible monastery
Normal: : What faith builds spiritually is more real than what hands build physically—a pure blues theology move.
Normal: The stupa wherever they stand
Normal: : Sacred ground is made by sacred presence, not by construction projects.
Normal: One thought-moment of faith
Normal: : The instant of belief that changes everything—conversion experience, moment of grace.
Normal: The repetition of "as many as dust particles" functions like the repetitive counting in spirituals and gospel songs—"ten thousand angels," "million years," "all God's children"—where the piling up of large numbers creates a sense of abundance beyond grasping, grace beyond measuring.
Heading 1: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN: THE JOY THAT MULTIPLIES
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE QUESTION ABOUT PASSING IT ON
Normal: Right then, Maitreya Bodhisattva stood up and asked the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, if there's a good man or a good woman who hears this Lotus Sutra and their heart just REJOICES—I mean really rejoices, gets happy about it, feels that joy rise up in them—how much blessing they gonna get? What kind of merit comes from that simple joy?"
Normal: And then he spoke it in verse:
Normal: After the World-Honored One passes on,
Normal: If someone hears this teaching here,
Normal: And they can just rejoice in it—
Normal: How much blessing does that bring near?
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA'S ANSWER: THE CHAIN OF TRANSMISSION
Normal: The Buddha turned to Maitreya and said:
Normal: "Ajita, listen here. After I'm gone—after the Tathāgata passes into extinction—if a monk or a nun, if a laywoman or a layman, if somebody with wisdom whether they old or they young, if they hear this sutra and they REJOICE in it, and then they leave that dharma assembly and go somewhere else—
Normal: Maybe they go to a monastery, maybe they go to some quiet empty place, maybe they in the city streets or the back alleys, maybe they in a village or out in the fields—
Normal: And they tell it. They tell what they heard.
Normal: They tell their mama and their daddy, they tell their kinfolk, they tell their friends and the people they know. They use whatever words they got, whatever strength they got, and they PASS IT ON.
Normal: And those people hear it and they rejoice too. And what do they do? They go and tell somebody else.
Normal: And that person hears it and rejoices, and they tell somebody else.
Normal: And it goes on like that, passing from hand to hand, from mouth to mouth, from heart to heart—
Normal: It keeps going, keeps spreading, keeps multiplying—
Normal: Until it reaches the FIFTIETH person in that chain.
Normal: Now Ajita, let me tell you about that fiftieth good man or good woman—the one at the end of that long line of telling. Let me tell you about the merit they get just from hearing and rejoicing.
Normal: Listen good to what I'm about to say."
Heading 2: THE GREAT BENEFACTOR (THE COMPARISON)
Normal: "Imagine this:
Normal: Imagine there's four hundred million billion countless world systems. You can't even count that many worlds—more worlds than you got numbers for.
Normal: And in all those worlds, there's beings in the six realms—gods and humans, asuras and animals, hungry ghosts and hell-dwellers.
Normal: Every kind of birth: egg-born, womb-born, moisture-born, transformation-born.
Normal: Every kind of form: got form, don't got form.
Normal: Every kind of consciousness: got consciousness, don't got consciousness, got neither and got both.
Normal: Every kind of body: no feet, two feet, four feet, many feet.
Normal: All the beings there are—every single one that counts as a living creature—
Normal: Now imagine a person who wants to do good, who wants to create blessing. And they go to all those beings and they say: 'What you want? What brings you joy? What makes you happy?'
Normal: And whatever entertainment those beings desire, whatever pleasure items they want, this benefactor GIVES IT TO THEM. Gives it all.
Normal: And to each single being—every last one—they give gold and silver, lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl, agate and coral and amber. All kinds of wonderful precious treasures.
Normal: And elephants. And horses. And carriages. And precious palanquins to ride in.
Normal: And palaces made of seven kinds of jewels. And towers. And pavilions.
Normal: To EACH being, they give enough to fill the whole continent of Jambudvīpa—that's this whole earth we're standing on. Each one gets that much treasure.
Normal: And this great benefactor keeps giving like this for EIGHTY YEARS.
Normal: Eighty years of constant giving.
Normal: Then after eighty years, that benefactor looks at all those beings and thinks:
Normal: 'I done gave them everything for pleasure and entertainment, everything their hearts desired. But look at them now—they getting old. Already past eighty years old themselves, hair gone white, faces all wrinkled. They gonna die soon. Won't be long now.
Normal: I better teach them the Buddha's Dharma. I better train them in the truth before they go.'
Normal: So that benefactor gathers all those countless beings together and proclaims the Dharma to them. Teaches them, instructs them, benefits them, brings them joy.
Normal: And right then—all at one time—every single one of them attains the Way:
Normal: Some become stream-enterers (Śrotāpanna)—first step on the path.
Normal: Some become once-returners (Sakṛdāgāmin)—just one more birth to go.
Normal: Some become non-returners (Anāgāmin)—ain't coming back to this world no more.
Normal: Some become Arhats (Arahant)—completely done, fully free.
Normal: All of them eliminate every outflow, every leak of defilement.
Normal: All of them become masters of deep meditation, dwelling in profound samādhi.
Normal: All of them gain the eight liberations—free in every way there is to be free.
Normal: Now Ajita—what you think? You think that great benefactor got a lot of merit? You think they accumulated some blessings or what?"
Heading 2: MAITREYA'S ANSWER
Normal: Maitreya said to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, that person got merit beyond measure! Can't even count it, can't even number it.
Normal: I mean, if that benefactor had just GIVEN all those beings the pleasure items, the entertainment and joy—that alone would be merit without measure.
Normal: But you talking about they also led every single one of them to become an Arhat! That's merit on top of merit, blessing piled on blessing!"
Heading 2: THE SHOCKING TRUTH
Normal: The Buddha said to Maitreya:
Normal: "Let me tell you straight and clear now. Let me break it down so there ain't no confusion:
Normal: That person who gave all those pleasure items to beings in four hundred million billion countless world systems—
Normal: Who gave to beings in all six realms of existence—
Normal: Who gave for eighty solid years—
Normal: And then led every single one of them to become Arhats, to attain complete liberation—
Normal: All that merit, all that blessing, all that good karma—
Normal: Don't equal the merit of that FIFTIETH person who heard just ONE VERSE of the Lotus Sutra and rejoiced.
Normal: You hear me?
Normal: The fiftieth person in the chain.
Normal: The one at the very end.
Normal: The last one to hear it.
Normal: Who just heard ONE VERSE.
Normal: And just REJOICED.
Normal: That person's merit is GREATER.
Normal: Not equal. GREATER.
Normal: The great benefactor's merit ain't even one hundredth part.
Normal: Not one thousandth part.
Normal: Not one hundred thousand million billionth part.
Normal: You can't calculate it. You can't number it. You can't use arithmetic to figure it. You can't use analogies to explain it.
Normal: There ain't no comparison.
Normal: Now Ajita, think about this:
Normal: If that fiftieth person—the LAST one in the chain, the one who heard it from someone who heard it from someone who heard it from someone forty-eight times removed from the source—
Normal: If THAT person's merit from just hearing one verse and rejoicing is already beyond measure, already infinite, already countless—
Normal: What about the forty-ninth person who told them?
Normal: What about the forty-eighth?
Normal: What about the person earlier in the chain?
Normal: What about the person earlier than that?
Normal: And what about the FIRST person—the one who heard it right there in the dharma assembly and rejoiced?
Normal: That person's blessing is even MORE beyond compare. More infinite than infinite. More countless than countless.
Normal: Can't be measured at all."
Heading 2: THE BLESSINGS OF SMALL ACTS
Normal: "And listen, Ajita—let me tell you more:
Normal: If someone goes to a monastery to hear this sutra—
Normal: Even if they just SIT there for a moment—
Normal: Even if they just STAND there for a moment—
Normal: Even if they only listen for a brief instant—
Normal: Because of that merit, in their next life they gonna be born and receive:
Normal: Fine excellent elephants, fine excellent horses, fine excellent carriages, precious jeweled palanquins to ride in. They gonna even ride in heavenly palaces up in the god realms.
Normal: And if someone's at a place where this Dharma is being taught, and they're sitting down listening—
Normal: And another person comes along—
Normal: And the first person encourages that newcomer: 'Sit down and listen!'
Normal: Or maybe they share their own seat, move over to make room so the other person can sit and listen—
Normal: Because of that merit, in their next life they gonna be born and receive:
Normal: The seat of Indra, king of the gods.
Normal: Or the seat of Brahma, lord of this world.
Normal: Or the seat of a wheel-turning sacred king, ruler of the four continents.
Normal: Just from offering a seat. Just from making room. Just from saying 'Sit down, listen here.'"
Heading 2: THE BEAUTIFUL MOUTH THAT SPEAKS DHARMA
Normal: "And Ajita, if someone says to another person:
Normal: 'There's a sutra called the Lotus Dharma. Let's go listen to it together.'
Normal: And that person receives the teaching, accepts the invitation, and goes with them—
Normal: And they listen together, even if just for a brief moment—
Normal: Because of that merit, in their next life they gonna be born together with Dhāraṇī Bodhisattvas—wisdom-keepers, truth-holders.
Normal: And they gonna have:
Normal: Sharp faculties.
Normal: Keen wisdom.
Normal: For a hundred thousand million lifetimes, they won't never be mute. They won't never be dumb-struck. They gonna have speech.
Normal: Their mouth breath won't never stink.
Normal: Their tongue won't never be sick.
Normal: Their mouth won't never be diseased.
Normal: Their teeth won't be dirty.
Normal: Won't be black.
Normal: Won't be yellow.
Normal: Won't be sparse or missing teeth.
Normal: Won't have gaps.
Normal: Won't be crooked.
Normal: Won't be broken.
Normal: Their lips won't hang down low.
Normal: Won't be shriveled up.
Normal: Won't be thick and rough.
Normal: Won't have sores or blemishes.
Normal: Won't be damaged.
Normal: Won't be twisted to the side.
Normal: Won't be thick.
Normal: Won't be too big.
Normal: Won't be dark.
Normal: Won't have anything ugly about them.
Normal: Their nose won't be flat.
Normal: Won't be crooked.
Normal: Their face won't be dark-colored.
Normal: Won't be too long and narrow.
Normal: Won't be sunken in or twisted.
Normal: Won't have a single feature that ain't pleasant to look at.
Normal: Their lips, tongue, and teeth gonna be perfectly beautiful.
Normal: Their nose gonna be refined, high, and straight.
Normal: Their face gonna be round and full.
Normal: Their eyebrows gonna be high and long.
Normal: Their forehead gonna be broad, flat, and perfectly proportioned.
Normal: All their human features gonna be complete and perfect.
Normal: Life after life, wherever they born, they gonna see Buddhas and hear the Dharma and receive the teaching with faith."
Heading 2: THE ESCALATION OF MERIT
Normal: "Now Ajita, just LOOK at this:
Normal: Just from encouraging ONE person to go listen to the Dharma—the merit is already like this, already beyond measure.
Normal: So what about someone who listens with a whole mind, with full attention?
Normal: What about someone who not only listens but EXPLAINS it, TEACHES it, interprets it and breaks it down for other people?
Normal: What about someone who not only hears it and teaches it but PRACTICES it, LIVES it, does exactly what it says?
Normal: That merit can't be measured at all. Can't even begin to calculate it."
Normal: If someone at a dharma gathering
Normal: Hears this sutra here,
Normal: Even just one single verse,
Normal: And rejoices when they hear,
Normal: Then goes and teaches it to others,
Normal: Passes it on down the line,
Normal: Until it reaches the fiftieth person—
Normal: That last person's merit gonna shine.
Normal: Now let me break down and distinguish
Normal: What that last person gonna receive:
Normal: Imagine a great benefactor giving—
Normal: More than your mind can conceive.
Normal: They supply countless multitudes,
Normal: Give them everything they desire,
Normal: Keep on giving eighty years—
Normal: Never let that charity tire.
Normal: Then seeing those people getting old,
Normal: Hair white and faces all creased,
Normal: Teeth sparse and bodies dried up,
Normal: Death approaching from the east,
Normal: That benefactor thinks: 'Right now
Normal: I better teach them truth that's pure,
Normal: I better give them the Way to freedom,
Normal: Help them find what will endure.'
Normal: So they teach them the dharma skillfully,
Normal: Teach them about nirvāṇa's real law,
Normal: Say: 'This world ain't solid at all,
Normal: Like water bubbles, foam, and straw—
Normal: Like flames flickering, shadows passing—
Normal: Y'all better develop detachment quick,
Normal: Better grow that mind that sees through illusion,
Normal: Before time runs out and you caught in the trick.'
Normal: All those people hearing this teaching
Normal: Every one becomes an Arhat true,
Normal: Possessing six spiritual powers,
Normal: Three knowledges and eight liberations too.
Normal: But that fiftieth person in the chain
Normal: Who just heard one verse and felt joy—
Normal: THAT person's blessing exceeds all that giving,
Normal: Can't be compared, can't be measured by no ploy.
Normal: So if the person at the END of the chain
Normal: Gets merit beyond all measuring—
Normal: What about those earlier in the line?
Normal: What about the FIRST person rejoicing and believing?
Heading 2: THE SPECIFIC BLESSINGS OF INVITATION
Normal: If someone encourages just one person,
Normal: Brings them along to hear the Lotus taught,
Normal: Saying 'This sutra is deep and wonderful,
Normal: Hard to encounter in a thousand million ages' worth of thought—
Normal: And that person receives the teaching,
Normal: Accepts the invitation to come hear,
Normal: Even if they only listen a moment—
Normal: Let me tell you the blessings that appear:
Normal: Life after life, no trouble with their mouth,
Normal: Teeth won't be sparse or yellow or black,
Normal: Lips won't be thick or shriveled or damaged,
Normal: Nothing ugly, nothing that others would attack.
Normal: Tongue won't be dry or black or short,
Normal: Nose gonna be high and refined and straight,
Normal: Forehead broad and perfectly level,
Normal: Face and features handsome and great.
Normal: They gonna be somebody people love to see,
Normal: Mouth breath won't never be foul,
Normal: The fragrance of the blue lotus flower
Normal: Gonna come out their mouth right now.
Heading 2: THE BLESSINGS OF SIMPLY SHOWING UP
Normal: If they deliberately go to the monastery
Normal: Wanting to hear the Lotus Sutra read,
Normal: And they listen even a moment with joy—
Normal: Let me tell you where that blessing gonna lead:
Normal: Next life they born among gods and humans,
Normal: They gonna receive wonderful elephant, horse, and cart,
Normal: Precious jeweled palanquins to ride in,
Normal: Even riding in the heavenly palace to take part.
Normal: If at a place where Dharma's being taught
Normal: They encourage someone to sit and hear,
Normal: Because of that blessed connection—
Normal: Indra's seat, Brahma's seat, or the wheel-king's gonna appear.
Heading 2: THE FINAL QUESTION
Normal: So what about someone who listens with whole mind,
Normal: Who explains the meaning and the sense,
Normal: Who practices exactly what it teaches?
Normal: THAT blessing is beyond immense!
Normal: END OF CHAPTER EIGHTEEN: THE JOY THAT MULTIPLIES
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter is about viral transmission before there was such a thing—about how truth spreads from person to person like fire, like news, like a song everybody needs to hear. The Buddha's teaching here is mathematical and mystical at once: merit doesn't just add, it MULTIPLIES. It grows exponentially with each telling.
Normal: The shocking comparison is the heart of it: the greatest material generosity in the universe (giving everything to everyone for eighty years PLUS leading them all to Arhat-hood) is LESS than the merit of the fiftieth person who just heard a verse and rejoiced. Why? Because the Lotus Sutra itself IS the teaching that leads to Buddhahood—not just to Arhat-hood. It's the higher truth, the bigger vehicle. One verse of it carries more potential than all the arhats in all the worlds.
Normal: And notice the progression of blessings:
Normal: Just show up to listen → you get treasure in the next life
Normal: Give someone a seat → you get a throne in the next life
Normal: Invite someone to come hear it → you get a beautiful body and you meet Buddhas forever
Normal: The "beautiful mouth" passage is profound: the mouth that speaks Dharma becomes beautiful because it's doing what mouths were made for—speaking truth, passing on liberation. Form follows function. The body that serves the teaching is perfected by that service.
Normal: This is word-of-mouth gospel. This is "each one teach one." This is the mathematics of grace: one person tells one person tells one person, and fifty tellings later, the last person in the chain has more blessing than the richest philanthropist who ever lived.
Normal: Pass it on.
Heading 1: CHAPTER NINETEEN: WHEN YOUR SENSES WAKE UP
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA SPEAKS TO CONSTANT EXERTION
Normal: Right then, the Buddha turned to Constant-Exertion Bodhisattva and said:
Normal: "Listen here now. If there's a good man or a good woman who holds this Lotus Sutra—I mean really holds it, reads it out loud, recites it, explains it to folks, or writes it down with their own hand—
Normal: That person gonna get EIGHT HUNDRED eye-merits.
Normal: They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED ear-merits.
Normal: They gonna get EIGHT HUNDRED nose-merits.
Normal: They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED tongue-merits.
Normal: They gonna get EIGHT HUNDRED body-merits.
Normal: They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED mind-merits.
Normal: And all these merits gonna PURIFY their six senses—gonna make them clean and clear and new.
Normal: Now this good person—their eyes, just the plain eyes their mama and daddy gave them, their regular flesh-and-blood eyes—they gonna see clear through the whole three-thousand-world system:
Normal: All the mountains inside and mountains outside,
Normal: All the forests, all the rivers, all the seas,
Normal: Down to the deepest hell (that's Avīci, the pit of no-interval suffering),
Normal: Up to the highest heaven (that's the Peak of Existence, where being goes as far as being goes).
Normal: And they gonna see all the beings in between.
Normal: They gonna see the karma that brought folks here.
Normal: They gonna see the causes and the effects.
Normal: They gonna see where beings gonna be born next and why.
Normal: They gonna see EVERYTHING. Know EVERYTHING.
Normal: All with the regular eyes they was born with."
Heading 2: VERSE: SEEING WITH NEW EYES
Normal: If in a great assembly,
Normal: With a heart that ain't afraid,
Normal: You speak this Lotus Sutra—
Normal: Listen to the merit you done made.
Normal: That person gets eight hundred
Normal: Superior merits for the eye,
Normal: And with this decoration,
Normal: Their vision's purified.

Normal: Everything there is, they knows.
Normal: Though they ain't got the heavenly eye yet,
Normal: Their flesh-eye power's just like this—
Normal: Seeing clear through everything,
Normal: Nothing that their vision gonna miss.
Heading 2: EARS THAT HEAR EVERYTHING
Normal: "Now listen, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down—
Normal: They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED ear-merits.
Normal: And with those purified ears, they gonna hear EVERY SOUND in the three-thousand-world system:

Normal: Even though they ain't got the heavenly ear yet, just with the regular ears their mama and daddy gave them, the clean natural ears they was born with—
Normal: They hear it ALL.
Normal: They can tell one sound from another.
Normal: They understand what everything means.
Normal: And their ears don't break. Don't get damaged. Don't go deaf from all that listening.

Normal: END OF CHAPTER NINETEEN: WHEN YOUR SENSES WAKE UP
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter is about TRANSFIGURATION OF THE SENSES. It ain't talking about gaining supernatural powers that separate you from ordinary life—it's talking about what happens when ordinary perception gets purified by holding the truth.
Normal: The blues has always known this: When you see clear, you see EVERYTHING. When you hear true, you hear EVERY VOICE—the suffering and the joy all mixed together. When you taste life after you've tasted grace, even the bitter turns to something you can swallow.
Normal: This chapter saying: The dharma don't take you OUT of the body—it wakes the body UP. It makes your eyes into telescopes, your ears into receivers, your nose into a compass, your tongue into a bell, your body into a mirror, your mind into a lamp.
Normal: You still using what your mama gave you. You still got the same flesh-and-blood senses you was born with. But now they PURIFIED. Now they AWAKE. Now they tell you the truth about what's really going on in this whole vast world.

Normal: Then hold this dharma. Hold it close. Hold it true.
Normal: And your senses gonna wake up and tell you what's real.
Heading 1: CHAPTER TWENTY: THE BODHISATTVA WHO NEVER LOOKED DOWN
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA'S WORD TO GREAT POWER
Normal: Now the Buddha, he turned to that Bodhisattva Great Power - you know that Great Power, that Mahāsattva - and the Buddha said:
Normal: "Listen here now, you got to know this thing: When a monk or a nun, when a brother or a sister who holds fast to this Lotus teaching, when somebody come at them with a evil mouth, cursing them out, talking bad about them, slandering their name - oh, that somebody gonna reap a terrible harvest, like I done told you before. But the one who holds this teaching? They gonna gain merit, like I said - they gonna get them eyes cleaned up, ears purified, nose, tongue, body, mind all made clear and clean.
Normal: "Now Great Power, I'm gonna tell you about the ancient days. I'm talking way back, past counting, past measuring, past thinking about - we talking inconceivable, immeasurable ages ago, ages beyond ages. Back then there was a Buddha, and his name was King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory, the Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the One of Perfect Knowledge, Perfect in Understanding and Walking, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed Teacher, Tamer of Strong Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.
Normal: "That age was called the Age-Without-Decline. That country was called the Land of Great Achievement.
Normal: "That Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory, he taught the Dharma in that world to the gods and humans and the fighting demons. For them that was seeking to be disciples, he taught the Four Noble Truths - you know, about birth and old age and sickness and death, and how to cross over to final nirvāṇa. For them seeking to be solitary realizers, he taught the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising. For them Bodhisattvas seeking that supreme perfect enlightenment - that anuttara-samyak-sambodhi - he taught the Six Ways of Going to the Other Shore, the Six Perfections, so they could reach the Buddha's wisdom complete.
Normal: "Now Great Power, that Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory, he lived for four hundred thousand million billion nayutas of Ganges River sands of ages. And the True Dharma stood in that world for ages like the dust particles in one Jambudvipa world. And the Imitation Dharma stood for ages like the dust particles in all four continents put together.
Normal: "After that Buddha had done good for all living beings, he passed into extinction. And after both the True Dharma and the Imitation Dharma had done passed away, in that same country another Buddha appeared, and his name was King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory too - the Tathāgata, Worthy One, One of Perfect Knowledge, Perfect in Understanding and Walking, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed Teacher, Tamer of Strong Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.
Normal: "And like this, one after another, there came twenty thousand million Buddhas, all with that same name."
Heading 2: THE STORY OF NEVER LOOKED DOWN
Normal: "Now after that first Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory had passed into extinction, after the True Dharma had done gone, in the time of the Imitation Dharma, there was monks full up with arrogance and pride, and they had great power in that world.
Normal: "And in that time there was one Bodhisattva monk, and his name was Never Looked Down.
Normal: "Now Great Power, you might be wondering: Why they call him Never Looked Down? Well, I'm gonna tell you. This monk, every single person he seen - whether it was a monk or a nun, whether it was a brother or a sister - he would bow down low to every one of them, bow down deep and praise them, and he would say these words:
Normal: "'I respect you deeply. I wouldn't dare look down on you. Why? Because all of you are walking the Bodhisattva way. Every one of you is gonna become a Buddha.'
Normal: "Now this monk, he didn't spend his time studying scriptures and chanting texts. All he did was bow down and praise folks. Even when he seen the four kinds of people way off in the distance, he would go out of his way to get to them, bow down deep, praise them, and say:
Normal: "'I wouldn't dare look down on you. All of you are gonna become Buddhas.'
Normal: "But among them four kinds of people, there was some who had angry hearts, hearts that wasn't clean. They would curse him out with evil mouths, saying: 'This ignorant monk! Where he come from? Going around saying he don't look down on us, giving us prophecies that we gonna become Buddhas! We don't need no false prophecies like that! We don't want nothing to do with your empty predictions!'
Normal: "This went on for many years. He was constantly being cursed at and abused. But he never got angry. He just kept saying: 'You gonna become a Buddha.'
Normal: "And when he would say these words, sometimes folks would take up sticks and clubs, tiles and stones, and throw them at him, beat on him. He would run away and stand at a distance. But even then, he would lift up his voice high and call out loud:
Normal: "'I wouldn't dare look down on you! All of you are gonna become Buddhas!'
Normal: "Because he kept on saying these words all the time, them arrogant monks and nuns and brothers and sisters, they gave him the name Never Looked Down."
Heading 2: DEATH AND RESURRECTION THROUGH THE WORD
Normal: "Now when this monk was about to die, right there in the sky, in the empty air, he heard all twenty thousand myriads of millions of verses of the Lotus Sutra that Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory had taught before. He was able to receive and hold every verse. Right then and there, he got them purified eye-roots like I described before - his ears purified, nose, tongue, body, and mind-roots all purified.
Normal: "After he got them six roots cleaned up like that, his life was extended - extended by two hundred million billion nayutas of years. And he went everywhere teaching this Lotus Sutra to the people.
Normal: "Now them four kinds of arrogant folks - them monks and nuns and brothers and sisters who had looked down on him, who had given him that name Never Looked Down - when they seen that he had obtained great supernatural powers, great eloquence in teaching, great power of good stillness, when they heard what he was saying, every one of them came to believe, came to submit, came to follow him.
Normal: "And this Bodhisattva went on to convert thousands of myriads of millions of living beings, causing them to dwell in that supreme perfect enlightenment, that anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.
Normal: "After his life ended, he met two thousand million Buddhas, all named Sun-Moon-Lamp-Light. In their Dharma, he taught this Lotus Sutra. Because of this cause and condition, he met another two thousand million Buddhas, all named Cloud-Sovereign-Lamp-King. In all these Buddhas' Dharma, he received, held, recited, and taught this sutra to the four kinds of people. And because of this, he got them constantly purified eyes, purified ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind-roots. When he taught the Dharma among them four kinds of people, his heart had no fear at all."
Heading 2: THE REVELATION - THAT WAS ME
Normal: "Great Power, this Bodhisattva Never Looked Down, he made offerings to so many Buddhas like this - respecting them, honoring them, praising them, planting all kinds of good roots. And after that, he met thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas. And in all them Buddhas' Dharma, he taught this sutra. His merit was accomplished, and he became a Buddha.
Normal: "Now Great Power, what do you think? That Bodhisattva Never Looked Down back in them days - you think he was somebody else? That was me. That was my own self.
Normal: "If I hadn't received, held, recited, and taught this sutra to others in them past lives, I wouldn't have been able to quickly attain this supreme perfect enlightenment, this anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Because I received, held, recited, and taught this sutra to people in the presence of them former Buddhas, I was able to quickly attain this supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: "Now Great Power, them four kinds of people back then - them monks and nuns and brothers and sisters who despised me with angry hearts, who looked down on me - because of that, for two hundred million ages they never met a Buddha, never heard the Dharma, never seen the Sangha. For a thousand ages they suffered great torment in the Avīci Hell, the Hell of No Interruption.
Normal: "But when that punishment was done, they met up with that Bodhisattva Never Looked Down again, and he taught them toward that supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: "Now Great Power, what do you think? Them four kinds of people who constantly looked down on that Bodhisattva back then - you think they was somebody else? Right here in this assembly now, there's five hundred Bodhisattvas like Bhadrapāla and others, five hundred monks like Lion-Moon and others, five hundred lay brothers like Thought-of-Buddha and others - all of them who will never turn back from supreme perfect enlightenment - that's who they are.
Normal: "Great Power, you got to know: This Lotus Sutra brings great benefit to all them Bodhisattvas and Mahāsattvas. It can cause them to reach that supreme perfect enlightenment. That's why, after the Tathāgata has passed into extinction, all them Bodhisattvas and Mahāsattvas should constantly receive, hold, recite, explain, and copy out this sutra."
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA SINGS IT IN VERSE
Normal: In the ancient days there was a Buddha,
Normal: Name of King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory,
Normal: His spirit-wisdom was beyond all measure,
Normal: He guided everything that lives -
Normal: Gods and humans, dragons and spirits,
Normal: All of them made offerings to him.
Normal: After that Buddha passed into extinction,
Normal: When the Dharma was about to end,
Normal: There was one Bodhisattva
Normal: Whose name was Never Looked Down.
Normal: Now at that time them four kinds of people,
Normal: They was holding on tight to doctrines,
Normal: Clinging to their understanding of the law.
Normal: Never Looked Down Bodhisattva,
Normal: He went right up to where they was,
Normal: And he spoke these words to them:
Normal: "I wouldn't dare look down on you -
Normal: All of you are walking the way,
Normal: Every one of you gonna become a Buddha."
Normal: When the people heard this,
Normal: They looked down on him, they cursed him out,
Normal: They talked bad about him, reviled his name.
Normal: But Never Looked Down Bodhisattva,
Normal: He was able to bear it, able to endure.
Normal: When his punishment was finished,
Normal: When his life was about to end,
Normal: He heard this sutra,
Normal: And his six roots was purified.
Normal: Because of his supernatural powers,
Normal: His life was extended and increased.
Normal: He taught this sutra again
Normal: To all them people far and wide.
Normal: All them people who was clinging to doctrines,
Normal: Every one of them received teaching
Normal: From this Bodhisattva,
Normal: Was brought to accomplishment,
Normal: Was caused to dwell in the Buddha-way.
Normal: When Never Looked Down's life ended,
Normal: He met countless Buddhas.
Normal: Because he taught this sutra,
Normal: He gained immeasurable blessings,
Normal: Gradually perfected his merit,
Normal: And quickly accomplished the Buddha-way.
Normal: That Never Looked Down back then -
Normal: That was my own self.
Normal: Them four kinds of people at that time,
Normal: The ones who was clinging to doctrines,
Normal: Who heard Never Looked Down say
Normal: "You gonna become a Buddha" -
Normal: Because of that cause and condition,
Normal: They met countless Buddhas.
Normal: These Bodhisattvas in this assembly,
Normal: Five hundred of them,
Normal: And also them four kinds -
Normal: Monks and nuns, believing laymen and laywomen,
Normal: The ones now standing before me
Normal: Listening to the Dharma - that's who they are.
Normal: In my former lives,
Normal: I urged all these people
Normal: To listen and receive this sutra,
Normal: This foremost teaching among teachings.
Normal: I opened it up and showed them,
Normal: I taught them the way,
Normal: I caused them to dwell in nirvāṇa.
Normal: Life after life they received and held
Normal: A sutra like this one.
Normal: For billions and billions of myriads of ages,
Normal: So many you can't even think about it,
Normal: Only then do you get to hear
Normal: This Lotus Sutra.
Normal: For billions and billions of myriads of ages,
Normal: So many you can't even think about it,
Normal: The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones,
Normal: Only once in a while teach this sutra.
Normal: Therefore, you practitioners,
Normal: After the Buddha has passed into extinction,
Normal: When you hear a sutra like this,
Normal: Don't let doubt arise in your hearts.
Normal: You should with single mind
Normal: Teach this sutra far and wide.
Normal: Life after life you'll meet Buddhas,
Normal: And quickly accomplish the Buddha-way.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY: THE BODHISATTVA WHO NEVER LOOKED DOWN
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter is pure blues architecture. The Never Looked Down Bodhisattva is the archetypal blues hero - maintaining dignity, faith, and prophetic voice in the face of relentless persecution. The repetitive structure mirrors both the repetition in blues music and the call-and-response tradition.
Normal: The interpretation uses vernacular English to convey deep theological concepts. For example, "You gonna become a Buddha" is not just a prediction but a prophetic declaration of an ontological truth that exists independent of current appearances. This resonates with the African American prophetic tradition where "gonna" is used to declare certain futures against present evidence.
Normal: The story of Never Looked Down teaches that you can remove yourself from immediate danger (running from the stones) while still maintaining your prophetic witness (shouting from a distance). It's a survival strategy and spiritual practice combined.
Normal: The ultimate revelation is that the persecutors, after suffering the consequences of their actions, are met again by Never Looked Down and finally receive the teaching. This is not revenge, but transformation—the ultimate blues vision of justice where even the oppressor is liberated.
Heading 1: CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE: WHEN THE LORD SHOWED HIS HAND
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: PART ONE: THE VOW TO WITNESS
Normal: Now listen here—at that time, all them Bodhisattvas what come up from the earth, countless as dust motes in a thousand worlds, they all standing there before the Buddha, hands pressed together, gazing up at that holy face, and they speaking out their hearts:
Normal: "World-Honored One, after you done gone on from this world, wherever your presence still abiding—in all them lands where your manifested bodies been teaching, in every place where you entered into rest—we gonna spread this sutra far and wide.
Normal: Why we saying this? Because we ourselves want to get hold of this true and pure Great Law, want to keep it, read it, recite it, explain it, write it down, and make offerings to it."
Heading 2: PART TWO: THE GREAT REVEALING
Normal: Now at that time the World-Honored One, right there before Mañjuśrī and all them countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of Bodhisattvas what been dwelling in this Saha world from way back, and before all the monks and nuns, the laymen and laywomen, the devas and dragons and yakshas and gandharvas and asuras and garudas and kinnaras and mahoragas, before humans and non-humans alike—before EVERY LIVING THING THAT EVER WAS—the Buddha showed forth his great supernatural power.
Normal: And what he do?
Normal: He put out his broad long tongue, and it reached straight up to the Brahma heaven.
Normal: From every pore of his body he released immeasurable, numberless colored lights, and they shone everywhere throughout the ten directions.
Normal: And all them other Buddhas sitting on lion thrones under jeweled trees, they did the same thing—put out they broad long tongues and released immeasurable light.
Normal: When Śākyamuni Buddha and all them Buddhas under the jeweled trees was showing forth they supernatural power, it lasted for a hundred thousand years.
Normal: Then they drew back they tongue-signs.
Normal: And then—oh, then!—they coughed once, ALL TOGETHER, and snapped they fingers, ALL AT THE SAME TIME.
Normal: And them two sounds—that cough and that finger-snap—they traveled to all the Buddha-worlds in the ten directions.
Normal: And the earth, she shook six ways.
Heading 2: PART THREE: THE UNIVERSAL WITNESS
Normal: Now all the living beings in them worlds—the devas and dragons and yakshas and gandharvas and asuras and garudas and kinnaras and mahoragas, humans and non-humans—through the Buddha's supernatural power, they ALL SAW this Saha world.
Normal: They saw immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas sitting on lion thrones under jeweled trees.
Normal: They saw Śākyamuni Buddha sitting together with Many Treasures Tathāgata on the lion throne inside that jeweled stupa.
Normal: They saw immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of Bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly respectfully surrounding Śākyamuni Buddha.
Normal: When they seen all this, they was filled with great joy—they got something they never had before!
Heading 2: PART FOUR: THE CALL AND THE RESPONSE
Normal: Right then and there, the devas in empty space, they raised up they voices high and made this proclamation:
Normal: "Beyond these immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of asamkhyeya worlds, there's a land called Saha. In that land there's a Buddha called Śākyamuni. Right now he teaching the great vehicle sutra to the Bodhisattvas—it called the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower, the teaching for Bodhisattvas, the one the Buddha guards and keeps in mind.
Normal: Y'all should rejoice from the bottom of your hearts! You should bow down and make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha!"
Normal: When all them beings heard that voice from empty space, they pressed they palms together, turned toward the Saha world, and said:
Normal: "Glory to Śākyamuni Buddha! Glory to Śākyamuni Buddha!"
Normal: They took all kinds of flowers and incense and necklaces, banners and canopies, jewels and precious ornaments for adorning the body, and they scattered them from afar toward the Saha world.
Normal: All them scattered things coming from the ten directions, they gathered like clouds, transformed into jeweled canopies, and spread out covering all the Buddhas there.
Normal: And in that time, the worlds of the ten directions was completely open and unobstructed, like one Buddha land.
Heading 2: PART FIVE: THE ENTRUSTMENT
Normal: At that time the Buddha told Superior Practices and all them other Bodhisattvas:
Normal: "The supernatural powers of the Buddhas—they just like this: immeasurable, boundless, inconceivable. Even if I was to use these supernatural powers for immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of asamkhyeya kalpas, talking about the merit and virtue of this sutra for the sake of entrusting it to y'all, I still couldn't finish telling it.
Normal: Let me sum it up for you:
Normal: All the Dharmas the Tathāgata possesses,
Normal: All the sovereign supernatural powers of the Tathāgata,
Normal: All the storehouse of profound essentials of the Tathāgata,
Normal: All the most deep matters of the Tathāgata—
Normal: ALL OF IT is proclaimed and revealed and demonstrated in this sutra.
Normal: Therefore, after the Tathāgata done passed on into extinction, y'all should single-mindedly receive and keep, read and recite, explain and expound, transcribe and practice according to what it says.
Normal: In whatever land you find yourself, if someone receives and keeps, reads and recites, explains and expounds, transcribes and practices according to what this sutra says—or if there's a place where a sutra scroll dwells, whether in a garden, or in a grove, or under a tree, or in a monk's dwelling, or in a white-clothed person's house, or in a hall or palace, or in a mountain valley or wilderness—in that place you should build a stupa and make offerings.
Normal: Why is that? You should know: THAT PLACE IS THE SITE OF ENLIGHTENMENT.
Normal: The Buddhas attained anuttara-samyak-sambodhi at that place.
Normal: The Buddhas turned the Dharma wheel at that place.
Normal: The Buddhas entered nirvāṇa at that place."
Heading 2: PART SIX: THE SUTRA IN VERSE
Normal: The Buddhas, saviors of the world,
Normal: Dwelling in great supernatural penetrations,
Normal: In order to gladden living beings,
Normal: Display immeasurable supernatural powers.
Normal: They tongues reaching to the Brahma heaven,
Normal: They bodies releasing numberless lights—
Normal: For them seeking the Buddha Way,
Normal: They manifest these rare occurrences.
Normal: The sound of the Buddhas coughing,
Normal: The sound of they fingers snapping,
Normal: Heard throughout the lands in ten directions,
Normal: The earth shaking six ways everywhere.
Normal: Because after the Buddha's extinction
Normal: Someone able to uphold this sutra,
Normal: All the Buddhas rejoicing,
Normal: Display immeasurable supernatural powers.
Normal: For the sake of entrusting this sutra,
Normal: Praising those who receive and keep it,
Normal: Even through immeasurable kalpas
Normal: They still can't come to the end of it.
Normal: The merit and virtue of such a person—
Normal: Boundless, without limit,
Normal: Like the empty space of ten directions,
Normal: You can't find no edge to it.
Normal: One who able to uphold this sutra,
Normal: That person already seen me,
Normal: Already seen Many Treasures Buddha
Normal: And all the manifested body Buddhas.
Normal: They also seen me today
Normal: Teaching and transforming the Bodhisattvas.
Normal: One who able to uphold this sutra
Normal: Makes me and my manifested bodies,
Normal: Makes Many Treasures Buddha now extinct,
Normal: Makes ALL OF THEM rejoice.
Normal: The Buddhas existing now in ten directions,
Normal: The Buddhas of past and future too—
Normal: They also gonna see them, gonna make offerings to them,
Normal: Gonna make them rejoice as well.
Normal: The secret essential Dharma
Normal: The Buddhas attained sitting at the place of enlightenment—
Normal: One who able to uphold this sutra
Normal: Gonna get it before too long.
Normal: One who able to uphold this sutra—
Normal: When it come to the meaning of all dharmas,
Normal: The names and the words,
Normal: They gonna preach with inexhaustible joy,
Normal: Like wind in empty space
Normal: That ain't got no obstruction nowhere.
Normal: After the Tathāgata's extinction,
Normal: They gonna know the sutras the Buddha taught,
Normal: The causes and conditions and the sequence,
Normal: And teach them according to the true meaning,
Normal: Like the light of sun and moon
Normal: That removes all darkness—
Normal: This person walking through the world
Normal: Able to destroy the darkness of living beings,
Normal: Teaching immeasurable Bodhisattvas,
Normal: Finally causing them to dwell in the One Vehicle.
Normal: Therefore, if you got wisdom,
Normal: Hearing these benefits and merits,
Normal: After my extinction
Normal: You should receive and uphold this sutra.
Normal: Such a person, on the Buddha Way,
Normal: Decidedly ain't got no doubt.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE: WHEN THE LORD SHOWED HIS HAND
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter operates at the highest register in the entire Lotus Sutra—this is the moment when the Buddha "shows his hand," reveals the full scope of his power, and the entire universe bears witness. The challenge in a blues/gospel interpretation is to maintain both the vernacular authenticity AND the sense of cosmic scale.
Normal: The chapter is built on a call-and-response structure. The Buddha displays supernatural powers (the call), and all of creation responds with witness and praise. This is the ultimate revival meeting, where the congregation is the entire cosmos.
Normal: The Buddha's supernatural display here is not arbitrary showing-off—it's maximum communication. He's using every available channel to broadcast the truth: visual (tongue extending, light radiating), auditory (coughing, finger-snapping), and kinesthetic (earth shaking). This is multimedia theophany, truth that overflows every boundary.
Normal: The teaching that any place where the sutra dwells becomes a holy site—"THAT PLACE IS THE SITE OF ENLIGHTENMENT"—is a radical democratization of sacred space. The sacred isn't far away; it's right here, right now, wherever the Word is present.
Normal: The verse section makes an extraordinary claim: "One who able to uphold this sutra, / That person already seen me." To hold the sutra is to see the Buddha. The teaching and the teacher are not separate. This is the Lotus Sutra's core soteriology in a nutshell: to encounter the teaching is to encounter the teacher.
Heading 1: CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO: THE PASSING ON
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE LAYING ON OF HANDS
Normal: Now you got to see this right—
Normal: The Buddha, Śākyamuni himself,
Normal: He rise up from that teaching seat,
Normal: And he show forth great spiritual power.
Normal: He reach out with his right hand,
Normal: And he touch the heads
Normal: Of them countless Bodhisattvas,
Normal: Every blessed one,
Normal: And when his hand come down on them,
Normal: He speak these words:
Normal: "I been working at this
Normal: For more ages than you can count—
Normal: Hundred thousand million billion
Normal: Uncountable ages—
Normal: Working and struggling
Normal: To get this hard-to-get thing,
Normal: This supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: Now I'm putting it in your hands.
Normal: I'm entrusting it to you.
Normal: You got to take this teaching,
Normal: Spread it out with one mind,
Normal: Make it grow far and wide."
Heading 2: THE SECOND TIME
Normal: And he do it again—
Normal: Three times he touch them heads,
Normal: Three times he lay his hand down,
Normal: Three times he speak the word:
Normal: "I been working at this
Normal: For more ages than you can count—
Normal: Hundred thousand million billion
Normal: Uncountable ages—
Normal: Working and struggling
Normal: To get this hard-to-get thing,
Normal: This supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: Now I'm putting it in your hands.
Normal: I'm entrusting it to you.
Normal: You got to receive it,
Normal: Hold it,
Normal: Read it,
Normal: Recite it,
Normal: Spread it abroad,
Normal: Make sure all living beings
Normal: Everywhere hear it and know it.
Normal: Why I'm telling you this?
Normal: Because the Tathāgata got great compassion—
Normal: He ain't stingy,
Normal: He ain't holding back,
Normal: He ain't afraid.
Normal: He give to living beings
Normal: The Buddha's wisdom,

Normal: To all living beings.
Heading 2: YOUR CALLING
Normal: Now you got to follow his example,
Normal: Learn the Tathāgata's way,
Normal: Don't be holding back,

Normal: Who believe in the Tathāgata's wisdom,
Normal: You got to preach this Lotus Teaching to them,
Normal: Make sure they hear it and know it,
Normal: So they can get the Buddha's wisdom.
Normal: But if there be living beings
Normal: Who don't believe it,
Normal: Who can't receive it—
Normal: Then you show them some other deep teaching
Normal: That the Tathāgata left,
Normal: Teach them,
Normal: Guide them,
Normal: Benefit them,
Normal: Make them glad.
Normal: You do this,
Normal: You be repaying
Normal: What all the Buddhas done for you.
Normal: You be answering grace with grace."
Heading 2: THE TRIPLE AFFIRMATION
Normal: Now when them Bodhisattvas
Normal: Heard the Buddha say all this,
Normal: Great joy fill them up,
Normal: Joy running all through their bodies.
Normal: They bow down even deeper,
Normal: They bend low,
Normal: They drop their heads,
Normal: They put their palms together,
Normal: And they lift up their voice as one:
Normal: "As the World-Honored One command,
Normal: We will do it all—

Normal: They hear what the Buddha said,
Normal: And great joy fill them up,

Normal: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO: THE PASSING ON
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter contains the most physically intimate moment in the entire Lotus Sutra. After twenty-one chapters of cosmic visions, parables, prophecies, and supernatural displays, we arrive at a simple human gesture: the Buddha rises from his seat and puts his hand on people's heads. Three times.
Normal: This is transmission through touch. Not through doctrine, not through vision, but through the laying on of hands—a gesture that runs deep in both Buddhist and Christian ritual practice. When the Buddha's hand comes down on those Bodhisattvas' heads, something passes. Not just information, but authorization. Not just teaching, but succession. Not just wisdom, but responsibility.
Normal: The threefold repetition is crucial. In both Buddhist and gospel traditions, three is the number of confirmation. When the Buddha lays his hand on their heads three times and speaks the commission three times, he's making it stick. He's sealing it in the body, in the memory, in the muscle.
Normal: The practical wisdom in this chapter is beautiful: "If they believe, teach them the Lotus. If they don't believe, teach them something else from the Buddha's deep teachings that they can receive." This is the opposite of rigidity. The point is liberation, not orthodoxy.
Normal: The chapter ends with a quiet dismissal. The cosmic drama is over. The work of transmission has been done. Now it's time to go home and get to work. The joy at the end is the joy of knowing what you're supposed to do.
Heading 1: CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE: MEDICINE KING BODHISATTVA - THE STORY OF HOW HE GAVE IT ALL
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: PART ONE: THE QUESTION
Normal: Now at that time, Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva stood up and said to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, how does Medicine King Bodhisattva walk through this suffering world of ours? World-Honored One, this Medicine King Bodhisattva—he done how many hundred thousand million billion impossible hard practices? Tell us, World-Honored One! We want to know a little bit about this story."
Normal: And all the gods in heaven, all the dragons, all the spirits, all the night-wanderers, the music-makers, the jealous fighting gods, the great bird-kings, the half-human singers, the great serpent spirits, the humans and the not-quite-humans, and all the bodhisattvas come from other Buddha-lands, and all the disciples gathered there—they all wanted to hear it too, and they were glad in their hearts.
Heading 2: PART TWO: THE OLD STORY - A LONG TIME BACK
Normal: Then the Buddha said to Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva:
Normal: "Listen now. A long time back—we talking about more ages past than there's grains of sand in the Ganges River—there was a Buddha called Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Thus Come One. He had all ten titles: Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened in Right Knowledge, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.
Normal: "That Buddha, he had eighty billion great bodhisattvas—great beings, every one—and seventy-two times the sands of the Ganges River worth of great disciples who heard his teaching. That Buddha lived for forty-two thousand ages, and the bodhisattvas lived just as long.
Normal: "In that Buddha-land, there wasn't no women, no hell realms, no hungry ghost realms, no animal realms, no jealous fighting gods, none of that suffering business. The ground was flat and smooth as the palm of your hand, made of lapis lazuli stone—pure blue jewel-ground. Treasure trees stood everywhere for beauty, treasure canopies spread overhead, treasure flower banners hanging down. Treasure bottles and incense burners everywhere you looked, all through that land. Seven kinds of precious things made up the platforms, and every tree had its platform—each tree standing just one arrow-shot away from its platform.
Normal: "Under all them treasure trees, bodhisattvas and disciples sat in meditation. And up on all them treasure platforms, there was hundreds of billions of gods making heavenly music, singing praises to that Buddha, making offerings with their songs."
Heading 2: PART THREE: THE BODHISATTVA WHO EVERYBODY LOVED TO SEE
Normal: "Now at that time, that Buddha was preaching the Lotus Sutra to a bodhisattva called Gladly Seen by All Living Beings—yeah, 'Gladly Seen by All Living Beings,' that's his name—and to all the other bodhisattvas and disciples gathered there.
Normal: "This Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva, he loved to practice hard things. In the Dharma of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, he practiced with intensity, walking meditation with his whole heart, seeking Buddhahood with everything he had. For twelve thousand full years he did this.
Normal: "Then he attained it—he got the samādhi called 'Manifestation of All Physical Forms.' Got that samādhi, and his heart was filled with great joy.
Normal: "He thought to himself: 'I got this Manifestation of All Physical Forms samādhi because I heard the Lotus Sutra. That's the power that did it. Now I got to make an offering to Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha and to the Lotus Sutra.'
Normal: "Right then and there he entered that samādhi, and up in the empty sky he rained down mandarava flowers and great mandarava flowers. He rained down fine powdered hard black sandalwood—filled up the whole sky like clouds coming down. And he rained down sandalwood from the shore of the ocean—this sandalwood so precious that six ounces of it worth a whole world like ours—making offerings to that Buddha."
Heading 2: PART FOUR: WHEN THINGS AIN'T ENOUGH
Normal: "After making that offering, he came out of his samādhi and thought to himself:
Normal: 'Even though I made offerings to the Buddha with supernatural power, that ain't enough. I got to make an offering with my body.'
Normal: "So he started drinking fragrant oils—sandalwood oil, frankincense oil, turpentine oil, sweet-smelling oils, camphor oil, and all kinds of oils. He drank oils made from jasmine and all kinds of fragrant flower oils. He did this for one thousand two hundred years.
Normal: "After one thousand two hundred years, his whole body was saturated with fragrant oils. He rubbed more fragrant oils all over his body. Then, in front of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, he wrapped himself in heavenly treasure cloth, poured more fragrant oils all over himself, and by the power of his supernatural vow, he set his own body on fire.
Normal: "The light from his burning body lit up eighty billion times the sands of the Ganges River worth of worlds.
Normal: "In all those worlds, the Buddhas all praised him at the same time, saying:
Normal: 'GOOD! GOOD! GOOD, good son! THIS is true intensity! THIS is what we call true Dharma-offering to the Thus Come One! Even if you make offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, burning incense, powdered incense, anointing incense, heavenly silk banners and canopies, even sandalwood from the ocean shore—all kinds of things like that—can't match this. Even if you give away countries and cities, wives and children—can't match this. Good son, THIS is the first among all givings, the most honored, the most supreme among all offerings, because this is making Dharma-offerings to all the Thus Come Ones!'
Normal: "They said all that, then they fell silent.
Normal: "His body burned for one thousand two hundred years. After that time passed, his body was finally consumed."
Heading 2: PART FIVE: HE CAME BACK
Normal: "After Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva made that Dharma-offering, his life ended. But after his life ended, he was born again in the land of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, in the house of Pure Virtue King. Sitting in full lotus position, he suddenly appeared—born by transformation.
Normal: "Right away he spoke a verse to his father:
Normal: Great King, you should know this now:
Normal: I walked in practice in that place,
Normal: And right away I got the samādhi
Normal: Called Manifestation of All Physical Forms.
Normal: I practiced with great intensity,
Normal: Gave up my beloved body,
Normal: Made offerings to the World-Honored One,
Normal: Seeking that supreme wisdom.
Normal: "After speaking that verse, he said to his father:
Normal: 'Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha is still present right now. Before, I made offerings to that Buddha, and I gained the dhāraṇī for understanding the languages of all living beings. Plus, I heard this Lotus Sutra—eight hundred thousand million billion nayuta koṭi vimbaras and aśaṅkhyeya verses of it.
Normal: 'Great King, now I got to go back and make offerings to that Buddha again.'
Normal: "Soon as he said that, he sat himself on a seven-treasure platform and rose up into empty space—rose up high as seven tāla trees—and went to where that Buddha was. He bowed his head to the Buddha's feet, put his ten fingertips together, and praised the Buddha with a verse:
Normal: Your face is wonderfully strange and fine,
Normal: Your light shines through the ten directions,
Normal: I made offerings once before,
Normal: Now I come again to see you face to face.
Heading 2: PART SIX: THE BUDDHA'S PASSING - THE TRUST HANDED DOWN
Normal: "After Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva spoke that verse, he said to the Buddha:
Normal: 'World-Honored One, the World-Honored One is still present in the world!'
Normal: "Then Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha said to Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva:
Normal: 'Good son, the time for my nirvāṇa has come. The time for extinction has arrived. You can prepare the bed and seat. Tonight, in the middle watch of the night, I will enter nirvāṇa.'
Normal: "And he charged Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva:
Normal: 'Good son, I entrust the Buddha-Dharma to you—to you and to all the bodhisattvas and great disciples, and also the Dharma of supreme perfect enlightenment. I also entrust to you the three-thousand great thousandfold seven-treasure world—all the treasure trees, treasure platforms, and the serving gods—I hand all of it over to you. After I pass into extinction, my relics—I entrust them to you too. You should distribute them widely, set up offerings far and wide. You should build several thousand stupas.'
Normal: "After Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha charged Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva like that, in the last watch of the night, he entered nirvāṇa."
Heading 2: PART SEVEN: GRIEF AND THE FUNERAL FIRE
Normal: "When Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva saw the Buddha pass into extinction, he was struck with grief, brokenhearted, filled with longing for the Buddha.
Normal: "So he took sandalwood from the ocean shore and made a funeral pyre to honor the Buddha's body, and burned it.
Normal: "After the fire went out, he gathered the relics and made eighty-four thousand treasure urns. With those, he built eighty-four thousand stupas—high as three worlds, decorated with banners and flags, adorned with hanging canopies, with all kinds of treasure bells hanging down."
Heading 2: PART EIGHT: THE BURNING OF THE ARMS - WHEN THE BODY AIN'T COMPLETE NO MORE
Normal: "Then Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva thought to himself again:
Normal: 'Even though I made these offerings, my heart still ain't satisfied. I got to make more offerings to the relics.'
Normal: "So he said to all the bodhisattvas and great disciples and to the gods, dragons, night-wanderers, and all the great assembly:
Normal: 'Y'all should focus your hearts and minds. I'm about to make offerings now to the relics of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha.'
Normal: "After he said that, right there in front of those eighty-four thousand stupas, he burned his two arms—adorned with a hundred blessings, those arms were—and he burned them for seventy-two thousand years, making offerings.
Normal: "This caused countless people seeking to be disciples, and measureless uncountable people beyond measure, to bring forth the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment. And they all attained dwelling in the samādhi of Manifestation of All Physical Forms."
Heading 2: PART NINE: THE WITNESSES CRY OUT - THE BODY AIN'T WHOLE NO MORE
Normal: "Now when all them bodhisattvas, gods, humans, jealous fighting gods, and the rest saw he didn't have no arms, they were distressed and sorrowful and grief-struck, and they said:
Normal: 'This Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva is our teacher, the one who taught us and guided us. But now he burned his arms, and his body ain't complete no more!'
Heading 2: PART TEN: THE VOW - IF THIS IS REAL, LET IT RESTORE
Normal: "Right then, Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva stood there in the midst of that great assembly and made this vow:
Normal: 'I gave up both my arms. I WILL attain the Buddha's golden body. If that's real and not empty words, if that's true and not a lie, then let my two arms come back just like they were!'
Normal: "Soon as he made that vow, his arms naturally restored themselves—came back just like they were.
Normal: "This happened because of the deep merit, the thick virtue, the profound wisdom of that bodhisattva.
Normal: "Right at that time, the three-thousand great thousandfold world shook six ways. Heaven rained down treasure flowers. All the humans and gods experienced what they'd never experienced before."
Heading 2: PART ELEVEN: WHO HE IS NOW
Normal: The Buddha said to Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva:
Normal: "What do you think? Was Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva some other person? No sir! Right now, it's Medicine King Bodhisattva. He gave up his body and made offerings like that—countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions beyond counting, that's how many times he gave.
Normal: "Constellation King Flower, if someone brings forth the mind seeking supreme perfect enlightenment, and they can burn even just one finger, or even just one toe, as an offering to a Buddha stupa—that's worth more than giving away countries, cities, wives, children, or even all the mountains, forests, rivers, and pools and precious treasures in a three-thousand great thousandfold world.
Normal: "And if someone fills up a three-thousand great thousandfold world with the seven treasures and makes offerings to the Buddha and to great bodhisattvas and to pratyekabuddhas and to arhats—the merit that person gets don't compare to someone who receives and keeps this Lotus Sutra, even just one four-line verse of it. THAT blessing is the greatest."
Heading 2: PART TWELVE: THE PRAISES - THIS SUTRA IS SUPREME
Normal: "Constellation King Flower, listen:
Normal: "Just like among all the flowing streams and rivers, among all waters, the ocean is first—this Lotus Sutra is like that. Among all the sutras preached by the Thus Come Ones, it's the deepest and the greatest.
Normal: "And just like among earth mountains, black mountains, small iron-ring mountains, great iron-ring mountains, and the ten treasure mountains—among all mountains, Mount Sumeru is first—this Lotus Sutra is like that. Among all sutras, it's the highest.
Normal: "And just like among all the stars, the moon-child is first—this Lotus Sutra is like that. Among thousands of millions of billions of kinds of sutra-dharmas, it's the most illuminating.
Normal: "And just like the sun-child can drive out all darkness—this sutra is like that. It can break all the darkness of what ain't good.
Normal: "And just like among all the little kings, the Wheel-Turning Sacred King is first—this sutra is like that. Among all sutras, it's the most honored.
Normal: "And just like Indra is king among the thirty-three gods—this sutra is like that. It's king among all sutras.
Normal: "And just like Great Brahma Heaven King is the father of all living beings—this sutra is like that. It's the father of all worthy saints, all learners, all who completed learning, and all who brought forth the bodhisattva mind.
Normal: "And just like among all ordinary people, the stream-enterer, the once-returner, the non-returner, the arhat, and the pratyekabuddha are first—this sutra is like that. Among all sutras preached by Thus Come Ones, or preached by bodhisattvas, or preached by disciples—among all sutra-dharmas, it's the very first.
Normal: "If someone can receive and keep this sutra, they're like that too—among all living beings, they're the very first.
Normal: "Among all disciples and pratyekabuddhas, the bodhisattvas are first. This sutra is like that—among all sutra-dharmas, it's the very first.
Normal: "Just like the Buddha is king of all dharmas, this sutra is like that—it's king among all sutras."
Heading 2: PART THIRTEEN: THE MEDICINE FOR EVERYTHING
Normal: "Constellation King Flower, this sutra can rescue all living beings. This sutra can cause all living beings to leave all suffering and distress. This sutra can greatly benefit all living beings, filling up their wishes.
Normal: "It's like a clear cool pool that can satisfy all those who thirsty and parched.
Normal: "Like someone cold getting fire.
Normal: "Like someone naked getting clothes.
Normal: "Like a merchant caravan finding a leader.
Normal: "Like a child finding its mother.
Normal: "Like someone crossing water finding a boat.
Normal: "Like someone sick finding a doctor.
Normal: "Like someone in darkness finding a lamp.
Normal: "Like someone poor finding treasure.
Normal: "Like people finding a king.
Normal: "Like a merchant ship reaching the sea.
Normal: "Like a torch driving out darkness.
Normal: "This Lotus Sutra is like that. It can cause living beings to leave all suffering, all sickness and pain. It can loosen all the bonds of birth and death.
Normal: "If a person gets to hear this Lotus Sutra—whether they copy it themselves or have someone else copy it—the merit they get, even if you measure it with the Buddha's wisdom, you can't find the edge of it.
Normal: "If someone copies this sutra scroll and makes offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, burning incense, powdered incense, anointing incense, banners, canopies, robes, and all kinds of lamps—butter lamps, oil lamps, all kinds of fragrant oil lamps, jasmine oil lamps, sumana flower oil lamps, pāṭala oil lamps, vārṣika oil lamps, navamallikā oil lamps—making offerings like that, the merit they get is also measureless."
Heading 2: PART FOURTEEN: THE PROMISE TO WOMEN - YOU WON'T BE WOMEN NO MORE
Normal: "Constellation King Flower, if someone hears this Chapter on the Past Deeds of Medicine King Bodhisattva, they also get measureless, boundless merit.
Normal: "If a WOMAN hears this Chapter on the Past Deeds of Medicine King Bodhisattva and can receive and keep it—when she finishes this female body, she won't receive a female body ever again.
Normal: "If, after the Thus Come One's extinction, in the last five hundred years, if a woman hears this sutra and practices according to what it says—when this life ends, she'll go straight to the Land of Peace and Joy, to where Amitābha Buddha and the great bodhisattvas surround and dwell. She'll be born in a lotus flower, on a jeweled seat.
Normal: "She won't be troubled no more by greed and desire.
Normal: "She won't be troubled no more by anger and stupidity.
Normal: "She won't be troubled no more by arrogance, jealousy, and all the other defilements.
Normal: "She'll get the bodhisattvas' supernatural powers and the Tolerance of Non-arising of Dharmas.
Normal: "Once she gets that tolerance, her eye-faculty will become pure. With that pure eye-faculty, she'll see seven hundred twenty billion nayuta times the sands of the Ganges River worth of Thus Come One Buddhas.
Heading 2: PART FIFTEEN: ALL THE BUDDHAS PRAISE HER FROM FAR AWAY
Normal: "At that time, all those Buddhas will praise her from far away, saying:
Normal: 'GOOD! GOOD! GOOD, good son! You were able to receive and keep and read and recite and think about this sutra in the Dharma of Śākyamuni Buddha, and you explained it to others. The merit you got—measureless, boundless. Fire can't burn it. Water can't wash it away. Your merit—a thousand Buddhas speaking together couldn't finish telling it.
Normal: 'You already broke all the demon thieves. You destroyed the army of birth and death. All the other enemies—you smashed every one.
Normal: 'Good son, hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, with their supernatural power, together guard and protect you. In all the worlds, among gods and humans, there's nobody like you. Except for the Thus Come One himself, among all the disciples, all the pratyekabuddhas, even among the bodhisattvas—in wisdom and meditation concentration, nobody equals you.'
Normal: "Constellation King Flower, this bodhisattva accomplished the power of merit and wisdom just like that."
Heading 2: PART SIXTEEN: THE FRAGRANCE THEY CARRY
Normal: "If someone hears this Chapter on the Past Deeds of Medicine King Bodhisattva and can rejoice and praise it—from that person's mouth will constantly come the fragrance of blue lotus flowers. From their body's pores will constantly come the fragrance of ox-head sandalwood. The merit they get is like what I already said.
Normal: "That's why, Constellation King Flower, I'm entrusting this Chapter on the Past Deeds of Medicine King Bodhisattva to you. After my extinction, in the last five hundred years, you should spread it widely throughout this southern continent. Don't let it get cut off. Don't let evil demons, demon people, gods, dragons, night-wanderers, or kumbhāṇḍa spirits get their chance at it."
Heading 2: PART SEVENTEEN: THIS SUTRA IS MEDICINE - DON'T GET OLD, DON'T DIE
Normal: "Constellation King Flower, you should use your supernatural powers to guard and protect this sutra. Why? Because this sutra is good medicine for the people of this southern continent when they sick.
Normal: "If a person has a disease and gets to hear this sutra, their disease will disappear and be gone. They won't get old. They won't die.
Heading 2: PART EIGHTEEN: WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE KEEPING THIS SUTRA
Normal: "Constellation King Flower, if you see someone who receives and keeps this sutra, you should take blue lotus flowers, fill them with powdered incense, and scatter them over that person. After you scatter them, you should think like this:
Normal: 'This person before long—won't be long now—they gonna take the grass and sit down at the place of enlightenment. They gonna break all the demon armies. They gonna blow the Dharma conch. They gonna beat the great Dharma drum. They gonna ferry across all living beings from the ocean of old age, sickness, and death.'
Normal: "That's why—anyone seeking the Buddha Way, when they see someone receiving and keeping this sutra, they should bring forth a respectful mind just like that toward them."
Heading 2: PART NINETEEN: WHAT HAPPENED WHEN HE TOLD THIS STORY
Normal: When the Buddha told this Chapter on the Past Deeds of Medicine King Bodhisattva, eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas attained the dhāraṇī for understanding the languages of all living beings.
Normal: Many Treasures Thus Come One, there in his treasure stupa, praised Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva, saying:
Normal: "GOOD! GOOD! Constellation King Flower, you accomplished inconceivable merit. You were able to ask Śākyamuni Buddha about matters like this, benefiting measureless, all living beings."
Normal: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE: MEDICINE KING BODHISATTVA - THE STORY OF HOW HE GAVE IT ALL
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter contains some of the most extreme imagery in all of Buddhist literature: a bodhisattva who saturates his body with fragrant oils for 1,200 years, then sets himself on fire and burns for another 1,200 years. Later, he burns both his arms for 72,000 years.
Normal: In the Buddhist context, this represents
Normal: total self-offering
Normal: as the ultimate form of generosity (dāna-pāramitā). The burning body produces
Normal: light
Normal: that illuminates eighty billion worlds. This transforms the act from destruction into illumination. The bodhisattva becomes a lamp, a torch that lights up reality for countless beings. His sacrifice becomes revelation.
Normal: The most dramatic moment is when Medicine King, after burning his arms, makes a vow: "If it's true I will attain the Buddha's golden body, let my arms be restored." And they are. This is about the power of vow (praṇidhāna) and the indestructibility of the Dharma-body. What is given fully for the sake of truth is never truly lost.
Normal: The chapter also contains a radical promise of liberation for women, stating that any woman who hears and keeps this chapter will not be reborn in a female body. This challenges the patriarchal context of its time, suggesting that ultimate commitment to the Dharma transcends all social and physical limitations.
Normal: Finally, the theme of fragrance—saturating the body with it, emanating it—symbolizes virtue that arises naturally from practice. The practitioner doesn't just *make* offerings; they *become* an offering, their very presence a benefit to the world.
Heading 1: CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR: WONDERFUL SOUND BODHISATTVA
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE SIGNAL ACROSS THE DISTANCE
Normal: Now listen here. The Buddha Śākyamuni, he let loose a light—
Normal: not just any light, but the light from the mark between his eyes,
Normal: that white hair curl that shines like truth itself,
Normal: and the light from the crown of his head, that bump of wisdom.
Normal: And that light, it didn't just shine local, you understand,
Normal: it went traveling east across one hundred and eight million billion
Normal: countless worlds,
Normal: crossing distances that ain't got no names,
Normal: reaching further than numbers can count,
Normal: further than the mind can follow.
Normal: That light traveled and traveled until it reached a world
Normal: called Pure Light Adorned,
Normal: and in that world there was a Buddha named
Normal: Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Tathāgata—
Normal: all them ten names: the One Who Comes, the Worthy One,
Normal: the Perfectly Awakened, the one who knows and walks right,
Normal: the one who went well, the one who understands this world,
Normal: the supreme one, the tamer of beings,
Normal: teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.
Normal: And he was teaching countless bodhisattvas,
Normal: all them beings gathered round respectful,
Normal: and Śākyamuni's white light came flooding through that world.
Heading 2: THE CALL
Normal: Now in that Pure Light Adorned world,
Normal: there was a bodhisattva named Wonderful Sound—
Normal: and brother, that name ain't just decoration.
Normal: He'd been planting good roots for a long, long time,
Normal: serving and learning from countless hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas,
Normal: and he'd achieved deep wisdom, you hear me?
Normal: He had samādhi like you wouldn't believe:
Normal: the Wonderful Banner samādhi, the Lotus Flower samādhi,
Normal: the Pure Virtue samādhi, the Constellation King Play samādhi,
Normal: the samādhi of No Conditions, the Wisdom Seal samādhi,
Normal: the samādhi that understands every language every being speaks,
Normal: the samādhi that gathers all merit together,
Normal: the Pure samādhi, the Spiritual Powers Play samādhi,
Normal: the Wisdom Torch samādhi, the Adorning King samādhi,
Normal: the Pure Light samādhi, the Pure Storehouse samādhi,
Normal: the Uncommon samādhi, the Sun Rotation samādhi—
Normal: hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of samādhis
Normal: like grains of sand in the Ganges River.
Normal: And when Śākyamuni Buddha's light touched his body,
Normal: Wonderful Sound felt it.
Normal: He felt that call reaching across all them worlds.
Normal: And he turned to his own Buddha, Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom,
Normal: and he said: "World-Honored One,
Normal: I got to go to that Saha world.
Normal: I got to pay my respects to Śākyamuni Buddha,
Normal: I got to draw near and make offerings.
Normal: I got to see Mañjuśrī, that Dharma Prince,
Normal: and Medicine King Bodhisattva, and Brave Giving Bodhisattva,
Normal: and Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva,
Normal: and Superior Practice Bodhisattva, and Adorning King Bodhisattva,
Normal: and Superior Medicine Bodhisattva.
Normal: I got to go, Lord. That light is calling me."
Heading 2: THE WARNING
Normal: Now Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha,
Normal: he looked at Wonderful Sound with love and concern,
Normal: and he said: "Son, don't you look down on that world.
Normal: Don't you go developing no inferior thoughts about it.
Normal: Good man, listen to me:
Normal: that Saha world, it's rough.
Normal: It ain't level—it's got high places and low places,
Normal: mountains of dirt and stone,
Normal: filled up with pollution and trouble.
Normal: The Buddha there, his body looks small.
Normal: The bodhisattvas there, their forms look small too.
Normal: But you, your body is forty-two thousand yojanas tall.
Normal: Me, my body is six million eight hundred thousand yojanas tall.
Normal: Your body is beautiful, you understand—
Normal: adorned with hundreds of thousands of millions of blessings,
Normal: your light especially wonderful.
Normal: So when you go—don't you look down on that country,
Normal: don't you look down on that Buddha or them bodhisattvas,
Normal: don't you look down on that land and develop inferior thoughts."
Heading 2: THE PILGRIM'S FAITH
Normal: Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva, he bowed to his Buddha and said:
Normal: "World-Honored One, when I go to that Saha world,
Normal: it's all the Tathāgata's power that sends me.
Normal: It's the Tathāgata's spiritual powers at play.
Normal: It's the Tathāgata's merit, wisdom, and adornment
Normal: that makes this journey possible.
Normal: I ain't going on my own strength, Lord.
Normal: This is all you."
Normal: TRAVELING WITHOUT MOVING
Normal: And then, right there,
Normal: Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva didn't rise from his seat.
Normal: His body didn't shake, didn't move.
Normal: But he entered into samādhi,
Normal: and by the power of that samādhi,
Normal: over there at Vulture Peak Mountain,
Normal: not far from where the Buddha was sitting on his Dharma seat,
Normal: there appeared eighty-four thousand jeweled lotus flowers—
Normal: gold from the Jambu River for the stems,
Normal: white silver for the leaves,
Normal: diamond for the stamens,
Normal: and manikya jewels for the platforms.
Normal: You see, he sent his calling card ahead.
Normal: He announced himself through beauty.
Normal: The flowers arrived before the man,
Normal: preparing the way.
Heading 2: THE QUESTION
Normal: Now Mañjuśrī, that Dharma Prince,
Normal: he saw them lotus flowers appear,
Normal: and he said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One,
Normal: what's the cause and condition for this?
Normal: Why we seeing this auspicious sign first—
Normal: all these thousands and tens of thousands of lotus flowers,
Normal: gold stems and silver leaves,
Normal: diamond stamens and jewel platforms?"
Normal: And Śākyamuni Buddha told Mañjuśrī:
Normal: "This is Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva Mahasattva.
Normal: He wants to come from Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha's country,
Normal: bringing eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas with him,
Normal: coming here to this Saha world
Normal: to make offerings to me, to draw near, to pay respects,
Normal: and also to make offerings to and hear the Lotus Sutra."
Heading 2: THE DESIRE TO SEE
Normal: Mañjuśrī said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One,
Normal: what good roots did this bodhisattva plant?
Normal: What merit did he cultivate
Normal: that he got this kind of great spiritual power?
Normal: What samādhi does he practice?
Normal: Please tell us the name of this samādhi—
Normal: we want to practice it diligently too.
Normal: By practicing this samādhi,
Normal: we'll be able to see this bodhisattva's form and appearance,
Normal: large or small, his bearing and deportment, his way of moving.
Normal: We pray that the World-Honored One, by your spiritual power,
Normal: will let that bodhisattva come so we can see him."
Normal: Śākyamuni Buddha told Mañjuśrī:
Normal: "That Tathāgata who passed into extinction long ago, Many Treasures,
Normal: he'll make this happen for you,
Normal: he'll show you what you need to see."
Heading 2: THE INVITATION
Normal: And Many Treasures Buddha, from inside that treasure tower,
Normal: he called out to that bodhisattva:
Normal: "Good man, come on!
Normal: Mañjuśrī, that Dharma Prince, he wants to see you."
Heading 2: THE ARRIVAL
Normal: And right then, Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva,
Normal: he vanished from that other country,
Normal: and he set out with eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas together.
Normal: And in every country they passed through,
Normal: the earth shook six ways—
Normal: it trembled and quaked, it swayed and rocked,
Normal: it pounded and crashed.
Normal: And in every place, seven-jeweled lotus flowers rained down,
Normal: and hundreds of thousands of heavenly music
Normal: started playing without nobody touching them—
Normal: instruments sounding all by themselves,
Normal: heaven itself making music for this pilgrim.
Normal: And this bodhisattva—
Normal: his eyes were like the leaves of great blue lotus flowers,
Normal: and even if you combined the beauty of a hundred thousand million moons,
Normal: his face was more perfect than that.
Normal: His body was the color of true gold,
Normal: adorned with countless hundreds of thousands of merits,
Normal: his awesome virtue blazing,
Normal: his light shining and glowing,
Normal: all his marks complete,
Normal: his body strong and firm like Narayana's adamantine body.
Normal: He entered a seven-jeweled platform
Normal: that rose up into space,
Normal: seven tala trees high above the ground.
Normal: And surrounded respectfully by all them bodhisattvas,
Normal: he came to this Saha world,
Normal: to Vulture Peak Mountain.
Heading 2: THE OFFERING AND THE QUESTIONS
Normal: When he arrived, he came down from that seven-jeweled platform,
Normal: and he took necklaces worth hundreds of thousands
Normal: and went to where Śākyamuni Buddha was.
Normal: He bowed his head to the Buddha's feet,
Normal: he offered up them necklaces,
Normal: and he said: "World-Honored One,
Normal: Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha
Normal: sends his greetings to the World-Honored One.
Normal: He asks: Are you free from illness and troubles?
Normal: Are you dwelling at ease?
Normal: Are you able to move about lightly?
Normal: Are you practicing joyfully?
Normal: Are the four elements in harmony?
Normal: Are worldly affairs bearable?
Normal: Are living beings easy to save?
Normal: Are they without much greed, anger, ignorance, jealousy, and stinginess?
Normal: Are they without disrespect to parents, without disrespect to monks,
Normal: without wrong views, without unwholesome minds,
Normal: without failure to control the five sense faculties?
Normal: World-Honored One, are living beings able to conquer
Normal: the demon enemies?
Normal: And Many Treasures Tathāgata, who passed into extinction long ago—
Normal: is he in that seven-jeweled tower, coming to hear the Dharma?
Normal: My Buddha also sends greetings to Many Treasures Tathāgata:
Normal: Is he peaceful and free from troubles?
Normal: Can he endure and remain long?
Normal: World-Honored One, I want now to see Many Treasures Buddha's body.
Normal: I pray the World-Honored One will show him to me."
Normal: And Śākyamuni Buddha spoke to Many Treasures Buddha:
Normal: "This Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva wants to see you."
Normal: And Many Treasures Buddha told Wonderful Sound:
Normal: "Excellent, excellent!
Normal: You've come here to make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha,
Normal: to hear the Lotus Flower Sutra,
Normal: and to see Mañjuśrī and the others.
Normal: This is good, good."
Heading 2: THE PAST CAUSE
Normal: Now Flower Virtue Bodhisattva, he asked the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, what good roots did Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva plant?
Normal: What merit did he cultivate that he got this spiritual power?"
Normal: The Buddha told Flower Virtue Bodhisattva:
Normal: "In the past, there was a Buddha named
Normal: Cloud Thunder Sound King Tathāgata, Arhat,
Normal: Perfectly Enlightened One.
Normal: His country was called Manifesting All Worlds.
Normal: The kalpa was called Joyfully Seen.
Normal: Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva, for twelve thousand years,
Normal: he made offerings to Cloud Thunder Sound King Buddha
Normal: with a hundred thousand kinds of music,
Normal: and he also presented eighty-four thousand seven-jeweled bowls.
Normal: Because of this cause and condition, this karmic result,
Normal: he's now born in Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha's country,
Normal: and he has this spiritual power.
Normal: Flower Virtue, what do you think?
Normal: That Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva back then,
Normal: who made offerings with music and presented jeweled vessels
Normal: to Cloud Thunder Sound King Buddha—
Normal: was that somebody else?
Normal: No, that was this Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva Mahasattva right here.
Normal: Flower Virtue, this Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva
Normal: has already made offerings to and drawn near countless Buddhas.
Normal: He's been planting roots of virtue for a long, long time.
Normal: And he's met hundreds of thousands of millions of billions
Normal: of countless Buddhas,
Normal: as many as grains of sand in the Ganges River."
Heading 2: THE POWER TO MANIFEST IN ALL FORMS
Normal: "Flower Virtue, you just seeing Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva's body here,
Normal: but this bodhisattva, he manifests all kinds of bodies,
Normal: appearing everywhere to teach this sutra to all living beings.
Normal: Sometimes he manifests as Brahma King,
Normal: sometimes as Shakra,
Normal: sometimes as Ishvara Deva,
Normal: sometimes as Mahesvara Deva,
Normal: sometimes as a great heavenly general,
Normal: sometimes as Vaishravana Heavenly King,
Normal: sometimes as a wheel-turning sage king,
Normal: sometimes as various lesser kings,
Normal: sometimes as an elder,
Normal: sometimes as a householder,
Normal: sometimes as a chief minister,
Normal: sometimes as a brahman,
Normal: sometimes as a bhikshu, bhikshuni, upasaka, or upasika,
Normal: sometimes as an elder or householder's wife,
Normal: sometimes as a chief minister's wife,
Normal: sometimes as a brahman woman,
Normal: sometimes as a boy or girl,
Normal: sometimes as a deva, dragon, yaksha, gandharva,

Normal: human or nonhuman being—
Normal: and in all these forms, he teaches this sutra.
Normal: To those in the hells, the hungry ghosts, the animals,
Normal: and all the difficult places—he can bring salvation.
Normal: Even in the inner palaces of kings,
Normal: he transforms into a woman's body to teach this sutra."
Heading 2: THE SCOPE OF THE WORK
Normal: "Flower Virtue, this Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva
Normal: can protect and save all living beings in the Saha world.
Normal: This Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva manifests and transforms like this,
Normal: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR: WONDERFUL SOUND BODHISATTVA
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter is a pilgrimage story—a narrative about answering a call, making a sacred journey, and returning home transformed and transformative. It's structured like a classic hero's journey, but the hero here is already enlightened. He ain't going to learn something; he's going to witness something and to serve.
Normal: The Warning About Looking Down:
Normal: The Buddha's warning to Wonderful Sound not to look down on the "rough" Saha world is a crucial teaching on respect and not confusing appearance with essence. The Saha world may look small and troubled, but it's where the work is, where beings need saving.
Normal: Traveling Without Moving:
Normal: Wonderful Sound doesn't physically leave his seat but enters samādhi, and by that power, he appears at Vulture Peak. This is a teaching on the nature of spiritual travel and the power of a concentrated mind to transcend physical distance.
Normal: The Power to Manifest in All Forms:
Normal: The heart of this chapter is the list of forms that Wonderful Sound can take to teach the Dharma. He becomes whatever form people need to see in order to hear the teaching. This is radical adaptability in the service of truth, the ultimate expression of skillful means. The samādhi that allows this is called "Manifesting All Bodies."
Normal: The chapter follows the classic structure of a spiritual journey: The call is heard, the journey is made in faith, respect is paid, the teaching is received and given, and the pilgrim returns to share the fruits of the journey, transforming others in the process.
Heading 1: CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE: THE ONE WHO HEARS THE WORLD CRYING
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE QUESTION
Normal: Right then, the Bodhisattva named Inexhaustible Intention - he rose up from his seat, bared his right shoulder in that ancient way of showing respect, pressed his palms together before the Buddha, and said:
Normal: "World-Honored One, I got to ask you something. This Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara - Observer of the World's Sounds - why she called that? What's the reason, what's the cause behind that name?"
Normal: And the Buddha told Inexhaustible Intention:
Normal: "Good friend, listen now. If countless suffering beings - we talking hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of people hurting - if they hear about this Bodhisattva called Observer of Sounds, and they call her name with a whole heart, with their one true mind, she gonna HEAR them. She gonna observe the very sound of their crying. And every single one gonna find liberation, gonna get free.
Heading 2: THE LITANY OF DELIVERANCE
Normal: "Listen to what I'm telling you:
Normal: If someone holding onto her name falls into great fire -
Normal: The fire can't burn them.
Normal: That's her mighty spiritual power working.
Normal: If the great waters come to drown you and you call her name -
Normal: You gonna reach shallow ground.
Normal: You gonna find your footing.
Normal: If hundreds of thousands of millions of beings go out seeking treasure -
Normal: Seeking gold and silver and lapis lazuli,
Normal: Seeking agate and coral and amber and pearls,
Normal: And they sailing the great sea,
Normal: And the black wind comes howling,
Normal: And it blows their ship off course into the demon lands,
Normal: Into the country of the flesh-eating rakshasas -
Normal: If even just ONE person on that ship calls her name,
Normal: Every person there gonna be delivered.
Normal: Every soul gonna be saved from the demon danger.
Normal: THAT'S why she called Observer of Sounds.
Normal: "If someone about to be killed, about to be murdered,
Normal: And they call on Avalokiteśvara,
Normal: The knife gonna break.
Normal: The weapon gonna shatter into pieces.
Normal: They gonna walk free.
Normal: "If the whole three-thousand-great-thousand world system was FILLED with demons -
Normal: Filled with yakshas and rakshasas wanting to hurt people -
Normal: Soon as they hear someone calling her name,
Normal: Those evil spirits can't even LOOK at that person with hate in their eyes,
Normal: Let alone do them harm.
Normal: "If someone bound in chains - guilty or innocent, don't matter -
Normal: Locked in shackles, cangue and fetters binding their body,
Normal: Soon as they call on Avalokiteśvara,
Normal: Every chain gonna break.
Normal: Every lock gonna snap.
Normal: They walking out free.
Normal: "If the whole world filled with bandits and thieves,
Normal: And a merchant leader taking his people down a dangerous road,
Normal: Carrying precious goods through dangerous country,
Normal: And one person says:
Normal: 'Good people, don't be afraid!
Normal: You need to call with one mind on Avalokiteśvara.
Normal: This Bodhisattva gives the gift of fearlessness to all beings.
Normal: If you call her name, you gonna be delivered from these bandits.'
Normal: "When all those merchants hear this, they cry out together:
Normal: 'NAMO AVALOKITESHVARA!'
Normal: Homage to the Observer of Sounds!
Normal: "And because they called her name, they delivered right there.
Heading 2: FREEDOM FROM WHAT BINDS YOU
Normal: "Inexhaustible Intention, this Great Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara -
Normal: Her spiritual power is mighty, mighty like this:
Normal: If beings got too much lust pulling at them,
Normal: But they constantly remember her with reverence,
Normal: They gonna get free from desire.
Normal: If they got too much anger burning in them,
Normal: But they constantly remember her with reverence,
Normal: They gonna get free from rage.
Normal: If they got too much ignorance clouding their minds,
Normal: But they constantly remember her with reverence,
Normal: They gonna get free from delusion.
Normal: "Inexhaustible Intention, Observer of Sounds got this kind of great spiritual power.
Normal: She benefits so many beings.
Normal: That's why all beings should keep her in their hearts always.
Heading 2: THE PROMISE TO WOMEN
Normal: "If a woman wants a son,
Normal: And she honors and makes offerings to Avalokiteśvara,
Normal: She gonna give birth to a son full of virtue and wisdom.
Normal: If she wants a daughter,
Normal: She gonna give birth to a daughter beautiful and well-formed,
Normal: Who planted good roots in past lives,
Normal: Who everyone loves and respects.
Normal: "Inexhaustible Intention, Observer of Sounds got power like this.
Normal: If beings honor and bow to her with reverence,
Normal: Their blessings ain't wasted.
Normal: Not one bit goes for nothing.
Normal: That's why all beings should uphold the name of Avalokiteśvara.
Heading 2: THE COMPARISON
Normal: "Inexhaustible Intention, suppose someone upholds the names of sixty-two billion Bodhisattvas -
Normal: That's as many as the sands of sixty-two billion Ganges Rivers -
Normal: And they spend their whole life making offerings:
Normal: Food and drink, clothing, bedding, medicine.
Normal: What you think? That person's merit - is it great or not?"
Normal: Inexhaustible Intention said: "Very great, World-Honored One."
Normal: The Buddha said: "But if someone else just upholds the name of Avalokiteśvara,
Normal: Even just bows and makes offerings one single time,
Normal: These two people's blessings are EXACTLY EQUAL.
Normal: No different at all.
Normal: And that merit can't be exhausted in hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of eons.
Normal: "Inexhaustible Intention, upholding the name of Observer of Sounds -
Normal: You receive blessings and benefits immeasurable, without boundaries."
Heading 2: SHE COMES IN WHATEVER FORM YOU NEED
Normal: Inexhaustible Intention asked the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, how does Avalokiteśvara travel through this suffering world?
Normal: How does she teach the Dharma to beings?
Normal: How does her skillful power work?"
Normal: The Buddha told Inexhaustible Intention:
Normal: "Good brother, listen now to how she manifests:
Normal: If beings in some land need a Buddha to free them,
Normal: She appears as a Buddha and teaches.
Normal: If they need a solitary realizer to free them,
Normal: She appears as a solitary realizer and teaches.
Normal: If they need a disciple of the voice to free them,
Normal: She appears in that body and teaches.

Normal: She appears in all those forms and teaches.
Normal: If they need a vajra-wielding guardian spirit,
Normal: She appears as that and teaches.
Normal: "Inexhaustible Intention, this Observer of Sounds accomplished merit like this.
Normal: She travels through all lands in various forms,
Normal: Liberating beings everywhere.
Normal: "That's why you all should wholeheartedly honor and make offerings to Avalokiteśvara.
Normal: "This Great Bodhisattva Observer of Sounds -
Normal: In times of fear and danger and emergency,
Normal: She gives the gift of fearlessness.
Normal: "That's why in this suffering world,
Normal: Everyone calls her the Giver of Fearlessness."
Heading 2: THE GIFT REFUSED, THE GIFT ACCEPTED
Normal: Inexhaustible Intention said to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, I want to make an offering to Avalokiteśvara right now."
Normal: He took off the precious jeweled necklace from around his neck -
Normal: Worth hundreds of thousands of ounces of gold -
Normal: And offered it to her, saying:
Normal: "Compassionate one, receive this Dharma gift, this precious necklace."
Normal: But Observer of Sounds wouldn't take it.
Normal: So Inexhaustible Intention said again:
Normal: "Compassionate one, out of pity for us, receive this necklace."
Normal: Then the Buddha told Avalokiteśvara:
Normal: "You should have compassion for this Inexhaustible Intention,
Normal: And for the four assemblies,
Normal: And for the gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas,
Normal: For humans and non-humans.
Normal: For their sake, receive this necklace."
Normal: Right then, out of compassion for all those beings,
Normal: Avalokiteśvara received the necklace.
Normal: She divided it into two parts:
Normal: One part she offered to Śākyamuni Buddha,
Normal: One part she offered to the stupa of Many Treasures Buddha.
Normal: "Inexhaustible Intention, Observer of Sounds has sovereign spiritual power like this.
Normal: This is how she travels through the suffering world."
Normal: World-Honored One of wonderful marks complete,
Normal: I ask you now again about this one:
Normal: Why is this child of Buddha
Normal: Called Observer of the World's Sounds?
Normal: The Honored One of wonderful marks complete
Normal: Answered Inexhaustible Intention in verse:
Normal: Listen now to how Observer of Sounds acts,
Normal: How well she responds in every direction.
Normal: Her vow is deep as the ocean,
Normal: Through countless eons beyond thought,
Normal: Serving thousands of billions of Buddhas,
Normal: She made great pure vows.
Normal: Let me tell you briefly:
Normal: Hearing her name, seeing her body,
Normal: Holding her in mind - it don't go to waste.
Normal: She can destroy the sufferings of all existence.
Normal: Suppose someone means to harm you,
Normal: Push you in a pit of fire -
Normal: Call on the power of Observer of Sounds:
Normal: The fire pit turns into a pool.
Normal: Or you drifting in the vast ocean,
Normal: Dangers of dragons, fish, and demons -

Heading 2: THE TESTIMONY
Normal: Right then, Earth-Holding Bodhisattva stood up from his seat,
Normal: Came forward and said to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, if beings hear this chapter about Avalokiteśvara -
Normal: About her sovereign works,
Normal: About her universal door manifesting spiritual powers -
Normal: Know that such a person's merit ain't small."
Normal: When the Buddha taught this Universal Door chapter,
Normal: Eighty-four thousand beings in the assembly
Normal: All raised the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment -
Normal: The anuttara-samyak-sambodhi heart.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE: THE ONE WHO HEARS THE WORLD CRYING
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: For sixteen hundred years, this chapter has been the most beloved, most memorized, most chanted part of the entire Lotus Sutra across East Asia. This ain't abstract philosophy - this is practical theology for people who are drowning, people in chains, people facing the fire.
Normal: The structure is pure call-and-response. The litany of dangers and deliverances builds a rhythm of faith. The core teaching is that Avalokiteśvara, the Observer of the World's Sounds, doesn't have one fixed form. She appears as whatever you need: a Buddha, a priest, a woman, a child, even a demon-king. This is the Incarnation principle taken universal. The Word becomes flesh—not just once, but everywhere, all the time, in whatever flesh is needed.
Normal: The chapter's power lies in its promise of immediate response. She doesn't judge; she HEARS and RESPONDS. In blues terms: she hears the blue note in your voice, the bent note that means pain, and she answers it. This is the gospel promise of a God who HEARS and ANSWERS. Not a distant philosophical principle, but an intimate responding presence.
Heading 1: CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX: THE PROTECTION SONGS
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: WHEN MEDICINE KING STEPS UP
Normal: Now right then, Medicine King Bodhisattva—you remember him, the one who burned his own body to show his devotion—he stood up from his seat, put his robe over one shoulder the way you do when you're about to say something serious, pressed his palms together, and spoke to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, listen now. If there's a good man or a good woman—I'm talking about anybody who's got the heart—if they can hold on to this Lotus teaching, if they can read it and speak it and know it through and through, if they can write it down with their own hand, tell me: How much blessing does that soul receive?"
Normal: And the Buddha said to Medicine King: "Let me ask you something first. If there was a good man or a good woman, and they made offerings to eight hundred myriads of millions of nayutas of Buddhas—as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River—what you think? Would their blessing be great, or would it be small?"
Normal: "It would be great, World-Honored One. Lord, it would be mighty great."
Normal: The Buddha said: "Now let me tell you something. If a good man or a good woman can hold on to even one four-line verse of this teaching—just four lines!—if they can read it and speak it and understand what it means, if they can practice what it says, their merit is GREATER THAN THAT. You hear what I'm saying? Greater than all that other merit combined."
Normal: Right then Medicine King said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I'm about to give a protection song—a dhāraṇī—to those who teach this Dharma. I'm gonna stand guard over them."
Normal: And he spoke the powerful words:
Normal: ANYE MANYE MANE MAMANE CHITE CHARITE
Normal: SHAME SHAMITARE SHANTE MUKTE MUKTAME
Normal: SAME AVISAME SAMASAME JAYE KSHAYE
Normal: AKSHINE SHANTE SHAME DHĀRAṆĪ
Normal: ALOKABHASHA PRATYAVEKSHANI NIDHIRU
Normal: ABHYANTARANIVISHTE ABHYANTARA PARI SHUDHI
Normal: UKKULE MUKKULE ARADE PARADE SUKAKSHI
Normal: ASAMASAME BUDDHAVILOKITE DHARMAPARIKSHITE
Normal: SANGHANIRGHOSHANI BHASHYA BHASHYA SHUHDI
Normal: MANTRA MANTRAAKSHAYATE RUTE RUTA KAUSHALYA
Normal: AKSHARA AKSHARA TYAYANTE ABHYAVAKARA AVALOKANI
Normal: "World-Honored One," Medicine King said, "this protection song, this powerful dhāraṇī, has been spoken by six hundred and twenty million Buddhas—as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges. Listen here: If anybody harms a teacher of this Dharma, they have harmed ALL THOSE BUDDHAS. You understand what I'm saying? You touch one of ours, you touch the whole family."
Heading 2: THE BUDDHA SAYS AMEN
Normal: Then Śākyamuni Buddha praised Medicine King, saying: "Good, good! Medicine King, you done right. Because you have compassion for these Dharma teachers, because you want to protect them, you spoke this dhāraṇī. And it's gonna bring great benefit to all living beings. Great benefit indeed."
Heading 2: WHEN BRAVE GIVER ADDS HIS VOICE
Normal: Right then, Brave Giver Bodhisattva spoke up to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I'm gonna add my protection too. I'm gonna give a dhāraṇī to guard those who read and recite and hold on to the Lotus teaching. If a Dharma teacher has this protection song, then listen:
Normal: "If a yaksha comes looking for trouble—can't touch 'em.
Normal: If a rakshasa demon comes sniffing around—can't touch 'em.
Normal: If a putana spirit comes hunting—can't touch 'em.
Normal: If a krtya curse comes creeping—can't touch 'em.
Normal: If a kumbhanda goblin comes prowling—can't touch 'em.
Normal: If a hungry ghost comes seeking—can't touch 'em.
Normal: "They'll be looking for a weak spot, but they won't find one. No sir, they won't find one."
Normal: And right there before the Buddha, he spoke the powerful words:
Normal: JVALE MAHAJVALE UKKE MUKKE ADE
Normal: ADAVATI NRTYE NRTYAVATI ITTINI
Normal: VITTINI CHITTINI NRTYANI NRTYAVATI
Normal: "World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī protection song has been spoken by as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. And all of them rejoiced in it. Listen here: If anybody harms a teacher of this Dharma, they have harmed ALL THOSE BUDDHAS. You hear what I'm saying?"
Heading 2: WHEN THE DEMON KINGS START PROTECTING
Normal: Right then, Vaishravana—that's the Heavenly King, the Guardian of the North, the Protector of the World—he spoke to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, I too have compassion for living beings. I too want to protect these Dharma teachers. So I'm gonna speak this dhāraṇī."
Normal: And he spoke the powerful words:
Normal: ATYE NATYE VANATYE ANADA NADI KUNADI
Normal: "World-Honored One, with this powerful protection song I'm gonna guard these Dharma teachers. I myself will protect those who hold this teaching. For a hundred yojanas around them—that's a mighty long distance—there will be NO TROUBLE. No sickness, no disaster, no harm. I'm watching."
Heading 2: WHEN THE GUARDIAN OF THE EAST JOINS IN
Normal: Right then, Dhrtarashtra—that's the Heavenly King who Guards the East—he was in that assembly with ten thousand million nayutas of gandharva musicians all around him, showing respect. He came forward to where the Buddha was, pressed his palms together, and said:
Normal: "World-Honored One, I too will protect those who hold the Lotus teaching with a dhāraṇī protection song."
Normal: And he spoke the powerful words:
Normal: AGANE GANE GAURI GANDHARA CHANDALI
Normal: MATANGI JANGULE VRUSE PUKKASI BHARYE
Normal: "World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī protection song has been spoken by four hundred and twenty million Buddhas. If anybody harms a teacher of this Dharma, they have harmed ALL THOSE BUDDHAS. That's what I'm telling you."
Heading 2: WHEN THE YAKSHA GODDESSES SWEAR THEIR OATH
Normal: Right then there were ten yaksha goddesses—now these are fierce female spirits, you understand—and their names were:
Normal: Lambā (That means "Hanging Down")
Normal: Vilambā (That means "Hanging Way Down")
Normal: Crooked Teeth
Normal: Flower Teeth
Normal: Black Teeth
Normal: Many Locks
Normal: Never Satisfied
Normal: Wearing Necklaces
Normal: Kuntī
Normal: And the one called Stealer of the Life Force of All Living Beings
Normal: These ten yaksha goddesses came together with Hariti—that's the Mother of Demons herself, the one who used to eat children until the Buddha converted her—and they brought her children and all her attendants. They all came to where the Buddha was, and together, in one voice, they said:
Normal: "World-Honored One, we too want to protect those who read and recite and hold on to the Lotus teaching. We want to remove their troubles. If anyone is looking for a way to harm a Dharma teacher, they won't find it. We won't let them find it."
Normal: And right there before the Buddha, they spoke the powerful words:
Normal: ITTI MINI ITTI VINI ITTI VAINI CHITI VAINI NIVRI
Normal: NIVRI NIVRI NIVRI NIVRI
Normal: RUHE RUHE RUHE RUHE
Normal: TAHE TAHE TAHE
Normal: TUHE STUHE
Normal: And then they said—listen to this oath now, this is serious:
Normal: "Better they should walk on our heads—that's right, trample us down—than that they should trouble a Dharma teacher.
Normal: "If a yaksha comes—we're watching.
Normal: If a rakshasa comes—we're watching.
Normal: If a hungry ghost comes—we're watching.
Normal: If a putana comes—we're watching.
Normal: If a krtya comes—we're watching.
Normal: If a vetala corpse-demon comes—we're watching.
Normal: If a skandha child-demon comes—we're watching.
Normal: If an unmada madness-demon comes—we're watching.
Normal: If an apasmara epilepsy-demon comes—we're watching.
Normal: If a yaksha-krtya comes—we're watching.
Normal: If a human-krtya comes—we're watching.
Normal: If a fever comes—whether it's a one-day fever, or a two-day fever, or a three-day fever, or a four-day fever, all the way up to a seven-day fever, or even a constant fever—we're watching.
Normal: Whether the demon takes a man's form, or a woman's form, or a boy's form, or a girl's form—even in dreams, we say DON'T YOU TROUBLE THEM."
Normal: And right there before the Buddha, they spoke a verse:
Normal: If you don't respect our protection song,
Normal: If you trouble those who teach the Dharma,
Normal: Your head will split into seven pieces
Normal: Like branches breaking off the Arjaka tree.
Normal: Like the sin of killing your father and mother,
Normal: Like the disaster of pressing out oil with false measures,
Normal: Like cheating people with crooked scales,
Normal: Like Devadatta breaking up the Sangha—
Normal: That's the kind of disaster you'll bring on yourself
Normal: If you harm a teacher of this Dharma.
Heading 2: THE YAKSHA GODDESSES MAKE THEIR PROMISE
Normal: When those yaksha goddesses had spoken this verse, they said to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, we ourselves will personally protect those who hold and read and recite and practice this teaching. We'll give them peace and security. We'll keep all troubles away. We'll neutralize all poisons."
Normal: And the Buddha said to those yaksha goddesses: "Good, good! Listen now: If you all can protect even someone who just holds on to the NAME of the Lotus teaching—just the name!—your merit is beyond measure. How much more if you protect someone who fully holds on to this teaching, who makes offerings to these written scrolls with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, with banners and canopies, with music, with all kinds of lamps—butter lamps, oil lamps, fragrant oil lamps, jasmine oil lamps, champaka flower oil lamps, varshika flower oil lamps, utpala water lily oil lamps—with these hundred thousand kinds of offerings!
Normal: "Kuntī, you and all your attendants should protect such teachers of the Dharma. You hear what I'm saying? Protect them."
Heading 2: WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY HEARD THIS
Normal: When this Protection Songs chapter was spoken, sixty-eight thousand people—that's right, sixty-eight thousand souls—attained the patience of non-arising. That means they reached the place where they knew: Nothing is born, nothing dies, it all just keeps flowing. They got free right then, just from hearing about this protection.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX: THE PROTECTION SONGS
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter reveals the other face of compassion: FIERCE PROTECTION. This is the love that says, "You will not harm my children." The dhāraṇī, or protection songs, are not translated because they are sounds of power, meant to be uttered, not intellectually understood. Their power is in the sound itself.
Normal: The key principle is cosmic justice: "If you harm a teacher of this Dharma, you have harmed all those Buddhas." It's a declaration that those who speak truth are BACKED UP by the entire cosmos. Even former demons like the yaksha goddesses and Hariti become protectors, showing that the Dharma is so universal it can transform even the wildest forces to serve the good.
Normal: The oaths and curses sworn by the yaksha goddesses are not petty threats but a form of sacred covenant, demonstrating the profound seriousness of protecting the Dharma. This chapter is permission to stand up and speak truth without fear, knowing that the universe itself stands guard.
Heading 1: CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN: THE BEAUTIFUL KING AND HIS GOOD FRIENDS
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: A STORY ABOUT LOVE THAT WON'T LET YOU STAY LOST
Normal: Listen now, the Buddha stood before that great crowd and he told them straight:
Normal: "Way back, so far back you can't count it—more lifetimes ago than there are grains of sand in all the rivers that ever run—there was a Buddha named Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened One. His land was called Light-Bright-Adorned, and that age, that time, they called it the Age of Joy-Seeing.
Normal: "Now in that Buddha's teaching, there was a king. They called him Beautiful King. And his queen, she went by the name Pure Virtue. They had two boys—one named Pure Storehouse, the other called Pure Eye. And listen here, these two boys, they weren't no ordinary children. No sir. They had great spiritual power. They had merit and wisdom built up deep. They'd been walking that Bodhisattva road for a long, long time, you understand? They knew all about giving and virtue and patience and effort and meditation and wisdom. They knew about skillful means. They understood compassion and joy and equanimity—all thirty-seven paths that help you along the way, they had those down cold. They could enter all kinds of deep meditation states—the Pure Samadhi, the Sun-Star-Dwelling Samadhi, the Pure Light Samadhi, the Pure Color Samadhi, the Pure Illuminating Samadhi, the Long-Adorning Samadhi, the Great-Mighty-Virtue-Treasury Samadhi. All these deep stillnesses, they knew them through and through.
Normal: "Now that Buddha, Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom, he wanted to guide that Beautiful King onto the right path. He had compassion for all living beings, you see. So he preached this Lotus Sutra, this very teaching right here.
Normal: "And when he did, those two boys—Pure Storehouse and Pure Eye—they went to their mama. They put their palms together, fingers all joined up respectful-like, and they said: 'Mama, we wish you would go see that Buddha, Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom. We want to go with you, serve him, honor him, bow down before him. You know why? Because this Buddha, he's teaching this Lotus Sutra right now to all the heavenly beings and all the human folks. We need to hear it. We got to receive it.'
Normal: "Their mama, she looked at them boys and said: 'Your daddy, he believes in outside teachings. He's deep into that Brahmin religion, got it in his bones. Y'all need to go talk to your father, see if he'll come along with us.'
Normal: "Pure Storehouse and Pure Eye, they put their hands together again and said to their mama: 'Mama, we are sons of the Dharma King. But we been born into this house of wrong views.'
Normal: "Their mother said: 'You boys need to think about your father. You need to show him some supernatural signs, some wonders. If he can see something that shakes him, his heart might get clear. His mind might get pure. Then maybe he'll let us go to where that Buddha is.'
Normal: "So those two sons, thinking about their daddy, they rose up into the air. They went up high—seven palm-tree heights into the sky. And then they started showing all kinds of miraculous transformations. Up there in space, they walked and they stood and they sat and they lay down. Water poured out the top of their bodies while fire blazed from their feet. Then water poured from their feet while fire blazed from their heads. One minute they got huge, filling up the whole sky. Next minute they got tiny as a mustard seed. Then huge again. Then small. They disappeared in the air and suddenly showed up on the ground. They walked into earth like it was water. They walked on water like it was solid ground. They showed all manner of supernatural wonders like this, trying to make their father's heart clean, trying to make his mind believe.
Normal: "When that father-king saw what his sons could do, his heart filled up with joy—great joy he'd never felt before. He put his palms together toward his boys and said: 'Who is your teacher? Whose disciples are you?'
Normal: "The two sons answered: 'Great King, that Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom—right now he's sitting under the seven-jeweled enlightenment tree on the Dharma seat, and he's teaching this Lotus Sutra to all the gods and humans gathered there. He is our teacher. We are his students.'
Normal: "The father said to his sons: 'I want to see your teacher too. Let's all go together.'
Normal: "So those two boys came down from the sky and went to their mother. They put their palms together and said: 'Mama, Daddy's heart is open now. He's ready to awaken to supreme perfect enlightenment. We've done the Buddha's work for our father. Now please, Mama, let us leave home and practice the way under that Buddha.'
Normal: Mama, please let us go,
Normal: Let us leave this home, become monks on the road,
Normal: Buddhas are hard to find, Mama, harder than you know,
Normal: We gonna follow this Buddha wherever he goes.
Normal: Like that udumbara flower—you might wait forever,
Normal: Meeting a Buddha is rarer than rare, now or never,
Normal: Getting free from suffering, that's hard too,
Normal: Mama, please let us go, let us walk this path through.
Normal: "Their mother said right away: 'I'll let you leave home. You know why? Because Buddhas are hard to meet, that's why.'
Normal: "Then the two boys spoke to both their parents: 'Good! Good, Father! Good, Mother! Please, let's go right now to see Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom Buddha. Let's get close to him, serve him, honor him. You know why we're saying this? Because a Buddha is hard to meet—rare as the udumbara flower that blooms once in forever. Rare as a one-eyed turtle swimming in the ocean who happens to stick his head up through the hole in a floating log. But we got deep blessings from past lives, and we been born in a time when Buddha-teaching is alive. So Father, Mother, you got to let us leave home. Why? Because Buddhas are hard to meet, and the time when they're here don't come around often.'
Normal: "Now at that time, Beautiful King had eighty-four thousand women in his palace, and every single one of them was ready to receive and hold this Lotus Sutra. Pure Eye Bodhisattva had long been deep in the Lotus Samadhi. Pure Storehouse Bodhisattva had, for countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of lifetimes, been deep in the Samadhi of Leaving All Evil Destinies—he wanted to help all beings escape suffering, you see. And the king's wife, Pure Virtue, she had the Samadhi Where All Buddhas Gather. She could know the secret treasuries of all the Buddhas.
Normal: "So those two sons used skillful means. They taught their father well. They made his heart believe. They made him love the Buddha's way.
Normal: "Then Beautiful King, along with all his ministers and attendants, and Pure Virtue the queen, along with all the palace women, and the king's two sons, along with forty-two thousand people—all of them together, at the same time, went to where the Buddha was. When they got there, they bowed their heads to his feet, walked around him three times to the right, then stood to one side.
Normal: "That Buddha preached the Dharma to the king. He showed him, taught him, benefited him, gladdened him. The king's heart filled up with joy.
Normal: "Then Beautiful King and his wife took off the pearl necklaces from around their necks—worth a hundred thousand in value—and scattered them over the Buddha. Up there in space, those necklaces turned into a four-pillared jeweled pavilion. Inside that pavilion was a great jeweled bed covered with hundreds of thousands of millions of heavenly cloths. On top of that bed sat a Buddha in full lotus position, shining great light.
Normal: "Beautiful King thought to himself: 'The Buddha's body—it's so rare, so dignified, so special. It's accomplished the most subtle and wonderful form there is.'
Normal: "Then Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom Buddha said to the four assemblies: 'Y'all see this Beautiful King standing here before me with his palms together? This king is gonna practice as a monk in my teaching. He's gonna work hard, gonna help the Buddha way. And he's gonna become a Buddha called Sal-Tree King. His land will be called Great Light, and that age will be called Great High King. That Sal-Tree King Buddha will have countless Bodhisattvas and countless disciples. His land will be level and straight. His merit will be like this.'
Normal: "Right then and there, the king handed his kingdom over to his younger brother. Then he and his wife and his two sons and all his relatives left home in the Buddha's teaching to practice the way.
Normal: "After the king left home, for eighty-four thousand years he kept at it, steady and hard, practicing this Wonderful Lotus Sutra. After that time passed, he gained the Samadhi of All Pure Merit Adornment. He rose up into space, seven palm-tree heights high, and said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, these two sons of mine have done the Buddha's work. Through supernatural transformations, they turned my wrong-headed mind around. They helped me settle down safe in the Buddha's teaching. They helped me see the World-Honored One. These two sons are my good spiritual friends. They wanted to wake up the good roots I'd planted in past lives. They wanted to benefit me. So they came and were born into my house.'
Normal: "Then Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom Buddha said to Beautiful King: 'That's right. That's exactly right. Just like you said. When good men and good women plant good roots, life after life they meet good spiritual friends. And those good spiritual friends do the Buddha's work—they show, they teach, they benefit, they gladden, they help folks enter supreme perfect enlightenment. Great King, you need to know: good spiritual friends are the great cause, the great condition. They guide you, they help you see a Buddha, they help you awaken the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment.
Normal: "'Great King, you see these two sons of yours? These two sons have already served and honored sixty-five hundred thousand million billion nayuta Ganges-sands of Buddhas. They've been close to all those Buddhas, respectful to all those Buddhas. In all those Buddha-places, they've received and held this Lotus Sutra. They have compassion for beings trapped in wrong views. They want to help people dwell in right seeing.'
Normal: "Beautiful King came down from space and said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the Tathāgata is so rare. Because of your merit and wisdom, the flesh-bump on top of your head shines bright. Your eyes are long and wide and deep blue. The mark between your eyebrows is white like the bright moon. Your teeth are white and even and always shining. Your lips are red and beautiful like the bimba fruit.'
Normal: "Then Beautiful King praised the Buddha's countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of virtues like this. Standing before the Tathāgata, with his palms joined together as one, he said again: 'World-Honored One, this has never happened before. The Tathāgata's teaching is complete, accomplished with inconceivable subtle and wonderful merit. The precepts and training you give—they're safe, they're peaceful, they're good. From this day forward, I will not follow my own mind's desires. I will not give birth to wrong views, arrogance, anger, or any evil thoughts.'
Normal: "When he finished saying this, he bowed to the Buddha and left.
Normal: The Buddha told the great assembly:
Normal: "What do y'all think? Was Beautiful King some other person? No. He is now Flower Virtue Bodhisattva right here. And Pure Virtue, his wife—she is now the Bodhisattva Light-Shining-Adornment-Mark who's here before this Buddha. Out of compassion for Beautiful King and all his relatives, she was born into that world then.
Normal: "And those two sons? They are now Medicine King Bodhisattva and Medicine Superior Bodhisattva. These two Bodhisattvas—Medicine King and Medicine Superior—have accomplished great merit like this. They have planted roots of virtue under countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas. They have accomplished inconceivable good merits.
Normal: "If anyone knows the names of these two Bodhisattvas, all the gods and humans in all the worlds should bow down to them in respect."
Normal: When the Buddha finished speaking this chapter about the past deeds of Beautiful King, eighty-four thousand people brushed off the dust, left the dirt behind, and gained the pure Dharma eye in all teachings.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN: THE BEAUTIFUL KING AND HIS GOOD FRIENDS
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This chapter's teaching that "good spiritual friends are the great cause" is pure blues theology. We don't wake up alone. We wake up because somebody loved us enough to not let us sleep through our lives. The teaching comes from the most intimate place possible—from family. The two sons, who are revealed to be Medicine King and Medicine Superior, are willing to be born into a household of "wrong views" to save their father.
Normal: The supernatural displays are not about intimidation; they are about breaking the king's frame of what he thinks is possible, to make him receptive to the Dharma. The story teaches that love is persistent, and that grace can show up in the form of your own children, your spouse, or your friends, working patiently to guide you home.
Normal: The final revelation—that these figures from the past are bodhisattvas present in the assembly now—reinforces the Lotus Sutra's theme that the help you need is already here, and that compassion operates across countless lifetimes.
Heading 1: CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT: UNIVERSAL WORTHY COMES TO ENCOURAGE YOU
Normal: A Blues Interpretation from the Classical Chinese
Heading 2: THE FINAL WORD: YOU ARE NOT ALONE, YOU WILL AWAKEN
Normal: Listen now to how it all ends, how the whole teaching comes to its close:
Normal: At that time, Universal Worthy Bodhisattva—riding on his own sovereign supernatural power, carried by his mighty virtue and his name that's known throughout all worlds—he came from the East with countless, boundless, can't-be-numbered great Bodhisattvas. And listen, everywhere those beings passed through on their journey, all those countries shook and trembled. Jeweled lotus flowers rained down from the sky. A hundred thousand million billion kinds of music played—not human music, understand, but cosmic music, the sound the universe makes when grace is moving.
Normal: And he didn't come alone. No sir. He brought with him numberless gods, dragons, night-wanderers, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans—all of them surrounding him, every one of them showing their own power and virtue and supernatural might. They all came to this Saha world, to Vulture Peak Mountain. When they got there, they bowed their heads to the ground before Śākyamuni Buddha. They walked around him seven times to the right, and then Universal Worthy said to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, I was in the land of Precious Majesty Superior King Buddha, and way over there I heard that in this Saha world you were preaching this Lotus Sutra. So I came with these countless, boundless, hundred thousand million billion Bodhisattvas to listen and receive it. I'm asking you, World-Honored One—please tell us: After the Tathāgata passes away, when you're gone from this world, how can good men and good women get hold of this Lotus Sutra? How do they receive it?"
Normal: The Buddha told Universal Worthy Bodhisattva:
Normal: "If good men and good women accomplish four things, then after the Tathāgata passes away, they WILL get this Lotus Sutra. Listen to what these four things are:
Normal: "First: They're protected and kept in mind by all the Buddhas.
Normal: "Second: They've planted roots of virtue, built up good deep in themselves.
Normal: "Third: They've entered the company of those who are fixed on the right path, who are determined, who won't turn back.
Normal: "Fourth: They've aroused the mind that wants to save ALL living beings—every last one.
Normal: "Good men and good women who accomplish these four things—after the Tathāgata passes away, they WILL get this sutra. Count on it. It's guaranteed."
Normal: Then Universal Worthy Bodhisattva said to the Buddha:
Normal: "World-Honored One, in the last five hundred years, in that polluted evil age that's coming, whoever receives and holds this sutra—I WILL guard them. I will protect them. I will remove their troubles and their dangers. I will give them peace and safety. I will make sure that nothing—NOTHING—can find a way to harm them.
Normal: "No demons, no demons' sons, no demons' daughters, no demon-followers, no demon-possessed people. No night-wanderers, no rakshasas, no kumbhandas, no pishachas, no krityas, no putanas, no vetadas—none of these beings that trouble people will be able to take advantage of them.
Normal: "Whether that person is walking or standing still, whether they're reading this sutra or reciting it—at that time I will ride my six-tusked white elephant king. I will come with a great company of Bodhisattvas to where that person is. I will show myself to them. I will make offerings to them. I will guard them. I will comfort their hearts. You know why I'll do all this? Because I'm also making offerings to the Lotus Sutra itself.
Normal: "And if that person is sitting down, thinking about this sutra, meditating on it—at that time I will ride that white elephant king again and appear before them. If they forget even one sentence, one verse of the Lotus Sutra, I WILL teach it to them. I will recite it together with them. I will help them understand it thoroughly.
Normal: "And when that person who receives and holds and reads and recites the Lotus Sutra sees me, they will be filled with great joy—the kind of joy that makes you want to keep going. And because they see me, right then and there they will gain samādhis and dhāraṇīs. They'll gain the Revolving Dharani, the Hundred Thousand Million Billion Revolving Dharani, the Dharani of Skillful Means in the Sound of the Teaching. They'll get dhāraṇīs like these."
Normal: "World-Honored One, in that later age, in the last five hundred years, in that polluted evil world—if there are monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen who seek this teaching, who receive it, who read it, who recite it, who copy it down, if they want to practice this Lotus Sutra—they should focus themselves single-mindedly for three weeks. Twenty-one days.
Normal: "When those three weeks are completed, I will ride my six-tusked white elephant. I will come with countless Bodhisattvas surrounding me. I will appear to that person in a body that all beings love to see. I will preach the Dharma to them. I will show them. I will teach them. I will benefit them. I will make them glad. And I will also give them dhāraṇī-mantras.
Normal: "And when they get these dhāraṇīs, no non-human being will be able to break them. No woman will be able to lead them astray. I myself will always guard that person.
Normal: "So World-Honored One, please let me speak this dhāraṇī-mantra."
Normal: Then right there, standing before the Buddha, he spoke the mantra:
Normal: Atandi / Tandavabha-di / Tandavabha-te / Tanda-kusalai / Tanda-sudalai / Sudalai / Sudara-vabha-te-buddha-pashane / Sarva-dhāraṇī-avabha-tani / Sarva-bhasha-avabha-tani / Shu-avabha-tani / Sengha-pariksha-ni / Sengha-nirgha-tani / Asengi / Sengha-bhaga-di / Taile-ayuta-sengha-dutale / Arati-barati / Sarva-sengha-samadi-galan-di / Sarva-dharma-shubha-lishate / Sarva-sattva-rutaka-ushalya-anumga-di / Shen-avi-kilidi-te
Normal: "World-Honored One, if any Bodhisattva hears this dhāraṇī, they should know it's the supernatural power of Universal Worthy at work. If this Lotus Sutra circulates in this Jambudvipa world, if anyone receives and holds it, they should think: 'This is ALL because of Universal Worthy's mighty spiritual power.'
Normal: "If anyone receives it, reads it, recites it, keeps it correctly in mind, understands its meaning, practices according to what it says—know that such a person is doing Universal Worthy's practice. They've planted deep roots of goodness before countless, boundless Buddhas. The Tathāgatas themselves have put their hands on that person's head.
Normal: "If someone just copies this sutra down, writes it out—when that person dies, they will be born in the Trayastrimsha Heaven. At that time, eighty-four thousand heavenly women will come to greet them, playing all kinds of music. That person will wear a crown made of seven jewels, and there among those palace women they will experience joy and happiness. How much more so for those who receive it, hold it, read it, recite it, keep it correctly in mind, and practice according to what it says!
Normal: "If anyone receives and holds this teaching, reads and recites it, understands its meaning—when that person's life ends, a thousand Buddhas will reach out their hands to them. They won't be afraid. They won't fall into evil destinies. They will go straight to Tushita Heaven, to where Maitreya Bodhisattva is. Maitreya Bodhisattva has the thirty-two marks of a great being. He's surrounded by a great assembly of Bodhisattvas. He's attended by hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of heavenly women. That person will be born right there in that company. These are the kinds of merits and benefits they'll receive.
Normal: "So if you're wise, you should single-mindedly copy this sutra yourself, or have someone else copy it. You should receive it, hold it, read it, recite it, keep it correctly in mind, and practice according to what it says.
Normal: "World-Honored One, I will now use my supernatural powers to guard this sutra. After the Tathāgata passes away, I will cause it to spread widely throughout this Jambudvipa. I will make sure it never dies out."
Normal: At that time Śākyamuni Buddha praised him, saying:
Normal: "Excellent! Excellent, Universal Worthy! You can protect and help this sutra, causing many beings to gain peace, benefit, and happiness. You have already accomplished inconceivable merit and deep great compassion. From the distant past you have aroused the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment, and now you are able to make this supernatural vow to guard this sutra.
Normal: "I will use my own supernatural power to guard and protect anyone who can receive and hold the name of Bodhisattva Universal Worthy."
Normal: "Universal Worthy, if anyone receives, holds, reads, recites, keeps correctly in mind, practices, and copies this Lotus Sutra—know that such a person SEES Śākyamuni Buddha. It's as if they hear this sutra directly from the Buddha's mouth.
Normal: "Know that such a person is MAKING OFFERINGS to Śākyamuni Buddha.
Normal: "Know that the Buddha is saying to them: 'Excellent! Well done!'
Normal: "Know that Śākyamuni Buddha is placing his hand on that person's head.
Normal: "Know that Śākyamuni Buddha's robe is covering them, protecting them.
Normal: "Such a person will no longer be greedy for worldly pleasures. They won't like the scriptures or writings of non-Buddhist paths. They won't take pleasure in getting close to such people or to those who do evil—butchers, those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens, or dogs, hunters, those who sell sex.
Normal: "That person's mind and intentions will be straight and true. They will have right mindfulness. They will have the power of merit and virtue.
Normal: "That person will not be troubled by the three poisons. They also will not be troubled by jealousy, arrogance, self-deception, or inflated pride.
Normal: "That person will have few desires. They will know contentment. They will be able to practice Universal Worthy's way."
Normal: "Universal Worthy, after the Tathāgata passes away, in the last five hundred years—if anyone sees someone who receives, holds, reads, and recites the Lotus Sutra, they should think:
Normal: 'This person will not be long in going to the place of enlightenment. This person is about to break through all the demon armies. This person is about to attain supreme perfect enlightenment. This person is about to turn the Dharma wheel, beat the Dharma drum, blow the Dharma conch, rain down the Dharma rain. This person is about to sit on the lion throne of Dharma in the great assembly of gods and humans.'
Normal: "Universal Worthy, if in later ages anyone receives, holds, reads, and recites this sutra—that person will no longer be greedy for clothes, bedding, food, drink, or the things that sustain life. Their wishes will not be empty. Even in this present life they will receive the rewards of blessing.
Normal: "If anyone slights and insults them, saying 'You're just a crazy person! You do this practice for nothing! In the end you'll gain nothing!'—the karmic retribution for speaking like that is this: that person will be eyeless, blind, world after world after world.
Normal: "But if anyone makes offerings to them and praises them, they will see the fruit of that reward in this very life.
Normal: "If anyone sees someone who receives and holds this sutra and exposes their faults—whether those faults are real or made up—that person in this present life will get white leprosy.
Normal: "If anyone mocks and laughs at them, that person world after world will have gapped and broken teeth, ugly lips, a flat nose, twisted hands and feet, squinting eyes, a body that stinks, evil sores, pus and blood, bloated belly, short breath, and all kinds of severe and evil diseases.
Normal: "Therefore, Universal Worthy, if you see anyone who receives and holds this sutra, you should rise up and go meet them from far away. You should respect them just as you would respect a Buddha."
Normal: When the Buddha spoke this Chapter of Universal Worthy's Encouragement, Bodhisattvas countless as the sands of the Ganges River gained hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Revolving Dharanis. Bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust motes in a great thousand-fold world system fully accomplished Universal Worthy's Way.
Normal: When the Buddha was speaking this sutra, Universal Worthy and all the other Bodhisattvas, Śāriputra and all the other disciples, and the gods, dragons, humans, non-humans, and everyone in that entire great assembly—they all received it with great joy. They accepted and held the Buddha's words. They bowed in respect and departed.
Normal: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT: UNIVERSAL WORTHY COMES TO ENCOURAGE YOU
Heading 2: INTERPRETATION NOTES:
Normal: This final chapter is the ultimate encouragement. After all the teachings, parables, and cosmic displays, Universal Worthy Bodhisattva arrives from the East to make a personal promise: he will protect anyone who holds this sutra in the difficult ages to come. He is the guarantor, the protector, the one who ensures the teaching will not be lost.
Normal: The four conditions for receiving the sutra are a summary of the path: 1) Be mindful of the Buddhas, 2) Plant good roots, 3) Enter the correct concentration, and 4) Arouse the mind to save all beings. This isn't a passive reception; it's an active state of being.
Normal: Universal Worthy's vow to appear on his six-tusked white elephant to any practitioner who is struggling, who forgets a line, or who needs encouragement is one of the most intimate and comforting promises in the sutra. It says: you are not alone in your practice. When you sincerely engage with this teaching, help will come.
Normal: The chapter ends with a stark warning about the karmic consequences of slandering those who uphold the sutra (blindness, leprosy, etc.) and the immediate rewards for honoring them. This final section underscores the sutra's ultimate point: the teaching is not an abstract text, but a living reality embodied in the people who hold it. To honor them is to honor the Buddha himself.
