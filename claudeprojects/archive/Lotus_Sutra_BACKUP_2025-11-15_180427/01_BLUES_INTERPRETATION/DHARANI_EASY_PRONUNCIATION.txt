GENERAL DELIVERY NOTES
================================================================================

PACING:
- Slower than normal speech—deliberate and intentional
- Each dharani is a complete thought/utterance
- Take a breath before starting each dharani
- Slight pause between different dharanis
- No rushing

TONE:
- Authoritative and grounded
- Sacred and serious—like a powerful prayer
- Not mystical or ethereal—keep it real and human
- Think "power prayer" not "alien incantation"
- Firm, clear, confident

EMOTION:
- These are DECLARATIONS of protection
- The speaker is speaking cosmic truth into reality
- Feel the power behind the words
- This is not casual—this is serious spiritual work

REPETITIONS:
- When you repeat (like "nivri nivri nivri"), each one should sound the same
- But each repetition lands more deeply
- First: establishing the sound
- Middle ones: deepening the power
- Last: sealing it in place

================================================================================

PRONUNCIATION TIPS
================================================================================

VOWEL SOUNDS:
- A = "ah" (like in "father")
- E = "eh" (like in "bed")
- I = "ee" (like in "tree")
- O = "oh" (like in "go")
- U = "oo" (like in "zoo")

CONSONANTS:
- Roll R very slightly (not like Spanish, just a light roll)
- K, G, T, P: Make them crisp and clear
- CH: Like in "chop"
- TH: Both letters pronounced (like "the" but slightly more breath)
- V: Like "vee"
- J: Like in "judge"
- SH: Like in "ship"
- ST: Both letters pronounced together (like "study")

EMPHASIS:
- Usually the first syllable of each word gets slight emphasis
- But don't make it jerky—keep it flowing
- These are utterances, not robotic syllables

================================================================================

PRACTICE SEQUENCE
================================================================================

1. Read each dharani out loud slowly, getting familiar with the sounds
2. Read them at normal pace
3. Read them with authority and conviction
4. Record yourself and listen back
5. Adjust any sounds that don't feel natural
6. Record the final version

That's it. You've got this.

================================================================================

FINAL NOTES
================================================================================

Don't overthink this. These are SOUNDS OF POWER. Just speak them clearly,
firmly, and with conviction. The meaning is in the sound, the breath, the
resonance.

These dharanis have been spoken for over 2,000 years. They carry that weight.
Speak them like they matter. Because they do.

You're not pronouncing Sanskrit for scholars. You're voicing cosmic protection
for everyone who hears this audiobook. That's the real work.
