POST 2: THE STORY BEHIND IT (LONGER, PERSONAL)
================================================================================

COPY:
Why I Translated the Lotus Sutra into Blues

The blues and the Lotus Sutra come from the same place.

Both speak to suffering and transformation. Both celebrate human dignity in the
face of adversity. Both say: your journey matters, and you are worthy of freedom.

For over four decades, I've been bringing this ancient Buddhist text into the spiritual
language of African American blues and gospel tradition—not as appropriation, but
as deep respect for two wisdom traditions that deserve to speak to each other.

The result? A complete, 28-chapter translation that maintains Buddhist doctrinal
accuracy while being accessible, beautiful, and TRUE to the blues spirit.

Now you can HEAR it. Soon.

The audiobook is coming. 🎵🌸

Are you ready to listen?

Quick question for my community:

What drew YOU to Buddhist teachings?

For me, it was recognizing that the blues and the dharma are speaking the same
truth about suffering, transformation, and freedom.

I'm bringing these two traditions together in an audiobook that launches soon.

POST 7: FOR SPIRITUAL SEEKERS (TARGETED MESSAGE)
================================================================================

COPY:
Seeking Buddhism Beyond Academia?

The Lotus Sutra is often taught in formal, academic language.

But what if you could hear it in a way that SPEAKS to your soul?

In blues vernacular. In the spiritual language of struggle, redemption, and
transcendence. In the voice of African American wisdom tradition.

The Lotus Sutra: A Blues Interpretation brings this ancient text into
contemporary, accessible language—without losing a shred of its spiritual power.

28 chapters. Complete teaching. Pure wisdom.

Coming to audio soon. 🌸🎵

POST 8: FOR BLUES LOVERS (DIFFERENT ANGLE)
================================================================================

COPY:
If You Love Blues, You'll Love This

The blues isn't just music. It's a spiritual practice.

It's about looking at suffering head-on and finding freedom anyway. It's about
dignity, community, and transformation.

Sound familiar? It's also the Lotus Sutra.

For over four decades, I've been exploring the deep connection between blues tradition
and Buddhist wisdom. Now you can hear the entire Lotus Sutra presented through
the spiritual language of the blues.

This is dharma for the soul. 🎵🌸

Coming Soon.

POST 10: GRATITUDE/SHARING (HEARTFELT)
================================================================================

COPY:
To everyone who's been part of this journey:

Thank you.

Four decades ago, I started translating the Lotus Sutra into the spiritual language
of blues and gospel. Many of you encouraged me. Many of you asked when it would
be available. Many of you said, "This needs to exist."

Now it does.

The audiobook is coming. Soon you'll be able to listen to all 28 chapters of
this sacred text in a way that speaks to your heart and your culture.

This is a labor of love. This is dharma for everyone. This is blues and Buddha
together at last.

Thank you for believing in this work. 🙏🌸

✅ Be Authentic
The best posts are heartfelt. Share your genuine passion for this work.

✅ Be Consistent
Post regularly so people know to expect updates from you.

✅ Engage Genuinely
Build community, not just broadcast. Respond to people. Have conversations.

✅ Use Visuals
Posts with images get 3-4x more engagement than text-only.

✅ Tell Stories
People connect with stories more than facts. Share the WHY behind your work.

✅ Make it Easy to Share
"Tag someone who needs this" invites people to share with their networks.

✅ Be Patient
Build momentum gradually. Audiobook launches often take 2-3 months of
promotion to build awareness.

✅ Have Fun
This is exciting work! Let that excitement show in your posts.
