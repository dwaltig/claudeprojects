Why I Translated the Lotus Sutra into Blues

The blues and the Lotus Sutra come from the same place.

Both speak to suffering and transformation. Both celebrate human dignity in the
face of adversity. Both say: your journey matters, and you are worthy of freedom.

For 10+ years, I've been bringing this ancient Buddhist text into the spiritual
language of African American blues and gospel tradition—not as appropriation, but
as deep respect for two wisdom traditions that deserve to speak to each other.

The result? A complete, 28-chapter translation that maintains Buddhist doctrinal
accuracy while being accessible, beautiful, and TRUE to the blues spirit.

Now you can HEAR it. Soon.

The audiobook is coming. 🎵🌸

Are you ready to listen?
