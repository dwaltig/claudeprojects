    <h1>The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma</h1>
    <h2>A Blues Translation from the Classical Chinese</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Translated and Adapted by<br>William Altig<br>Houston, Texas</p>

    <div class="introduction">
        <h3>INTRODUCTION TO THE BLUES VERSION OF THE LOTUS SUTRA</h3>
        <h4>A Gender-Inclusive Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese</h4>
        
        <p><strong>WHAT IS THIS TRANSLATION?</strong></p>
        <p>This is a blues and gospel-inflected English translation of the Lotus Sutra (Saddharma-puṇḍarīka-sūtra), one of the most revolutionary and influential Buddhist texts. Rather than offering a literal or scholarly translation, this version channels the wisdom of the Lotus Sutra through the spiritual, rhythmic, and deeply human language of the African American blues and gospel tradition.</p>
        <p>The source text is Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese version (406 CE), a translation that itself was revolutionary in making Buddhist teachings accessible to common people. This blues version continues that democratizing tradition—bringing the Dharma into living, breathing language that speaks to the soul.</p>

        <p><strong>WHY BLUES?</strong></p>
        <p>The blues and the Lotus Sutra share a profound spiritual sensibility:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Both speak to suffering and its transformation</li>
            <li>Both celebrate human dignity in the face of adversity</li>
            <li>Both offer a way out: through music/Dharma, through community, through trust</li>
            <li>Both are rooted in African American/Buddhist wisdom traditions that center on justice, compassion, and the liberation of ALL beings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The blues doesn't shy away from pain. Neither does the Lotus Sutra. But both offer redemption, not escape. Both say: your suffering matters, your journey matters, and you are worthy of enlightenment/freedom.</p>

        <p><strong>GENDER-INCLUSIVE APPROACH</strong></p>
        <p>This translation is fully gender-inclusive while maintaining theological depth. The original Lotus Sutra was revolutionary for its time in affirming that women could achieve Buddhahood. This version amplifies that revolutionary message by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using inclusive language ("brothers and sisters") in universal teachings</li>
            <li>Maintaining male narrative where it provides contrast for women's paradigm-shifting appearances (especially the dragon princess in Chapter 12)</li>
            <li>Centering women bodhisattvas (Avalokiteśvara, Mahāprajāpatī, the queen) as agents of compassion and power</li>
            <li>Honoring the text's original radical stance: women are not obstacles to enlightenment—they are its agents</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Translator's Note: The Dharma and the Blues</h3>
        <p>This translation takes Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese text of the Lotus Sutra and pours it through the blues—that great river of African American spiritual and musical expression that has always known how to carry deep wisdom in everyday language.</p>
        <p>Some might ask: Why?</p>
        <p>The answer is that these two great traditions, born worlds apart, share a spiritual DNA...</p>

<h2>CHAPTER ONE: THE OPENING</h2>
<h3>PART ONE: THE GATHERING</h3>
<p>Listen now, this is what I heard with my own ears.</p>
<p>One time—and ain't it always one time when truth comes calling—the Buddha was staying up on Vulture Peak Mountain, right outside the city called King's House (Rajagriha). And he wasn't alone, no sir. He had twelve thousand monks with him, every last one of them a brother who'd made it through to the other side.</p>

<div class="verse">
    <p>Mañjuśrī, tell me why—<br>
    Why the Teacher's shining bright<br>
    From that white hair between his eyes,<br>
    Pouring out that great big light?</p>
</div>

<h2>CHAPTER TWO: THE LOVING TRICKS</h2>
<h3>PART ONE: THE BUDDHA SPEAKS OF DEEP WISDOM</h3>
<p>Now at that time, you see, the World-Honored One—he rose up from his meditation, rose up calm and peaceful-like, and he turned to Śāriputra and said:</p>
<p>"Listen here, Śāriputra. The wisdom of the Buddhas—it goes down deep, deeper than any well you ever tried to draw from. It's measureless, you hear me? Can't nobody measure how deep it goes. The door to that wisdom, now—it's hard to understand, hard to get through. All them disciples and solitary-walkers, all them learned folks who think they got it figured—they can't know this thing."</p>

<div class="verse">
    <p>The Hero of the World—can't measure him,<br>
    All them heavenly beings and worldly folk,<br>
    Every kind of living creature there is—<br>
    Ain't nobody can know the Buddha's truth.</p>
</div>

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHT: WHEN THE FIVE HUNDRED FINALLY HEARD THEIR NAMES CALLED</h2>

<p>Listen now, this is the story of how five hundred disciples found out they'd been carrying diamonds in their pockets all along.</p>

<h3>THE PREACHER MAN FINALLY UNDERSTANDS</h3>

<p>Now when Full Son heard all this - Full Son, that's Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra, best preacher man in the whole congregation - when he heard the Buddha laying out that wisdom, talking about how you got to meet folks where they are, speaking their language, teaching by whatever means it takes... and when he heard how the big-time disciples were getting their names called, getting told they gonna be Buddhas themselves someday... and when he heard about all the old-time connections, all that history stretching way back... and when he heard about how the Buddhas got more power and freedom than you can shake a stick at...</p>

<p>Man, something he never felt before washed over him. His heart got clean and jumped up in his chest. He rose right up from his seat, walked straight to the Buddha, bowed down low - put his whole face to the Buddha's feet, you know - then stepped back to one side. And he stood there looking at the Buddha's face, couldn't take his eyes off him for nothing. And he thought to himself:</p>

<p>"Lord have mercy, this World-Honored One is something else entirely. What he does is rare as hen's teeth. He knows how to reach all kinds of different folks, all their different ways of being. He's got this skillful knowing, this way of seeing, and he teaches to match it. He pulls people out of all the places they get stuck, all the things they grasp onto that keep 'em trapped. We can't even put words to all the Buddha's done. Only the Buddha himself knows what we been carrying deep down in our hearts all along, what we been wishing for since before we can remember."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER NINE: WHEN THE FAITHFUL GET THEIR DUE</h2>
<h3>(Prophecies for the Learners and the Learned)</h3>

<p>Now Ānanda and Rāhula, they been sitting there watching all these prophecies going out, and something starts stirring in their hearts. They thinking to themselves: "We been here all along, ain't we? Don't we get a word too? Wouldn't that be something—wouldn't that be sweet?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TEN: HONOR THE WORD-CARRIERS</h2>
<h3>(The Teachers of the Dharma)</h3>

<p>Now at that time, the World-Honored One, he turns to Medicine King Bodhisattva, and through him he's talking to eighty thousand great beings, and he says:</p>

<p>"Medicine King, you see this great crowd gathered here? You see all these countless heavenly beings, dragon-kings, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas? You see the human folks and the non-human folks? You see the monks and nuns, the lay brothers and lay sisters? You see those seeking to be voice-hearers, those seeking solitary enlightenment, those seeking the Buddha-way?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER ELEVEN: WHEN THE JEWELED TOWER ROSE UP</h2>
<h3>(Seeing the Jeweled Stupa)</h3>

<p>Now at that time, right there in front of the Buddha, a tower made of seven kinds of precious jewels comes rising up out of the ground. A tower! Five hundred yojanas tall—that's so high you can't even see the top—and two hundred and fifty yojanas wide. Coming up from under the earth, rising, rising, until it's hanging there in the middle of the air, just floating in space.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWELVE: WHEN YOUR ENEMY WAS YOUR TEACHER</h2>
<h3>(Devadatta)</h3>

<p>Right then the Buddha speaks to all the bodhisattvas and the four assemblies—all the heavenly and human beings gathered there. He says:</p>

<p>"Listen now. Way back in the past, further back than you can count, beyond measureless kalpas, I was searching for this Lotus Sutra teaching. Searching and searching, and I never got tired, never gave up, never said 'I can't do this no more.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THIRTEEN: WHEN THE ROAD GETS ROUGH, YOU GOTTA KEEP WALKING</h2>
<h3>勸持品第十三 (Exhortation to Maintain)</h3>

<p>Now at that time, Medicine King Bodhisattva and Great Joy in Preaching Bodhisattva—these two great souls—they stood up together with twenty thousand of their brother and sister bodhisattvas. They all gathered right there in front of the Buddha, and they made a promise, you hear me, they made a VOW:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOURTEEN: HOW TO KEEP YOUR SOUL CLEAN WHEN THE WORLD'S GONE WRONG</h2>
<h3>(安樂行品 - The Peaceful Practices)</h3>

<p>Now at that time, Mañjuśrī—that prince of the Dharma, that great bodhisattva—he stood up and said to the Buddha:</p>

<p>"World-Honored One, these bodhisattvas here, they're something rare, you know? They respect you so much they done made a vow—a big vow, a serious vow—that when the evil age comes rolling in, when everything's corrupt and wrong, they gonna protect this Lotus teaching. They gonna read it, study it, teach it out loud.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIFTEEN: WHEN THE UNDERGROUND ARMY ROSE UP</h2>
<h3>(從地湧出品 - Springing Up from the Earth)</h3>

<p>Now at that time, all them bodhisattvas from other worlds—countless worlds beyond counting, more than eight Ganges rivers full of sand—they stood up in that great gathering. They pressed their palms together, bowed down low, and said to the Buddha:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIXTEEN: HOW LONG THE TATHĀGATA'S BEEN ALIVE</h2>
<h3>A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese</h3>

<p>At that time, the Buddha spoke to all them bodhisattvas and the whole great assembly. He said:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: COUNTING UP THE GRACE</h2>
<h3>(分別功德品第十七 - Distinguishing the Merits)</h3>

<p>Now listen here—when the Buddha finished telling them about his eternal life, about how he been living forever and ain't never gonna die, when he laid that truth down in Chapter 16, something happened right then and there in that assembly. I mean something HAPPENED.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN: THE JOY THAT MULTIPLIES</h2>
<h3>(隨喜功德品第十八 - The Merit of Rejoicing and Passing It On)</h3>

<p>Right then, Maitreya Bodhisattva stood up and asked the Buddha:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER NINETEEN: WHEN YOUR SENSES WAKE UP</h2>
<h3>(法師功德品第十九 - The Merit of the Dharma Teacher)</h3>

<p>Right then, the Buddha turned to Constant-Exertion Bodhisattva and said:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY: THE BODHISATTVA WHO NEVER LOOKED DOWN</h2>
<h3>(常不輕菩薩品第二十)</h3>

<p>Now the Buddha, he turned to that Bodhisattva Great Power - you know that Great Power, that Mahāsattva - and the Buddha said:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE: WHEN THE LORD SHOWED HIS HAND</h2>
<h3>(The Buddha's Supernatural Powers / 如來神力品第二十一)</h3>

<p>Now listen here—at that time, all them Bodhisattvas what come up from the earth, countless as dust motes in a thousand worlds, they all standing there before the Buddha, hands pressed together, gazing up at that holy face, and they speaking out their hearts:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO: THE PASSING ON</h2>
<h3>(Entrustment - 囑累品第二十二)</h3>

<p>Now you got to see this right—
The Buddha, Śākyamuni himself,
He rise up from that teaching seat,
And he show forth great spiritual power.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE: MEDICINE KING BODHISATTVA - THE STORY OF HOW HE GAVE IT ALL</h2>
<h3>藥王菩薩本事品第二十三</h3>

<p>Now at that time, Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva stood up and said to the Buddha:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR: WONDERFUL SOUND BODHISATTVA</h2>
<h3>A Blues Translation from the Classical Chinese</h3>

<p>Now listen here. The Buddha Śākyamuni, he let loose a light—</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE: THE ONE WHO HEARS THE WORLD CRYING</h2>
<h3>Avalokiteśvara's Universal Door</h3>

<p>Right then, the Bodhisattva named Inexhaustible Intention - he rose up from his seat, bared his right shoulder in that ancient way of showing respect, pressed his palms together before the Buddha, and said:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX: THE PROTECTION SONGS</h2>
<h3>(陀羅尼品第二十六)</h3>

<p>Now right then, Medicine King Bodhisattva—you remember him, the one who burned his own body to show his devotion—he stood up from his seat, put his robe over one shoulder the way you do when you're about to say something serious, pressed his palms together, and spoke to the Buddha:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN: THE BEAUTIFUL KING AND HIS GOOD FRIENDS</h2>
<h3>(A Story About Love That Won't Let You Stay Lost)</h3>

<p>Listen now, the Buddha stood before that great crowd and he told them straight:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT: UNIVERSAL WORTHY COMES TO ENCOURAGE YOU</h2>
<h3>(The Final Word: You Are Not Alone, You WILL Awaken)</h3>

<p>Listen now to how it all ends, how the whole teaching comes to its close:</p>
