Chapter Twelve: Devadatta

At that time, the Buddha addressed all the bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly of devas and humans, saying: "In past kalpas immeasurable, I sought the Lotus Sutra without slackening or wearying. Throughout many kalpas I constantly served as a king, making vows to seek the unsurpassed bodhi, my mind never retreating or turning back. Wishing to fulfill the six pāramitās, I diligently practiced giving, my mind without stinginess—elephants, horses, the seven precious things, my kingdom, cities, wife and children, servants and attendants, head, eyes, marrow and brain, body, flesh, hands and feet—I did not spare even my own life. At that time, the people's lifespans were immeasurable. For the sake of the Dharma, I renounced my royal position, entrusted governance to the crown prince, struck the drum and issued a proclamation throughout the four directions, seeking the Dharma: 'Whoever can expound the Mahāyāna to me, I shall serve and attend throughout my life.' At that time, there was a seer who came and addressed the king, saying: 'I possess the Mahāyāna, named the Lotus Sutra. If you do not disobey me, I shall expound it for you.' The king, hearing the seer's words, rejoiced and leaped with joy, immediately following the seer and providing all that he needed—gathering fruit, drawing water, collecting firewood, preparing food—even using his own body as a seat, his body and mind without weariness. Thus he served for a thousand years, all for the sake of the Dharma, diligently attending and serving so that nothing was lacking."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"I recall past kalpas
When, seeking the Great Dharma,
Though I served as world-king,
I coveted not the pleasures of the five desires.

"I struck the bell, announcing to the four directions:
'Who possesses the Great Dharma?
If one can expound it for me,
My body shall serve as slave and servant.'

"At that time, there was the seer Asita
Who came and addressed the great king:
'I possess the subtle, wondrous Dharma,
Rare in this world.

"'If one can cultivate and practice it,
I shall expound it for you.'
The king, hearing the seer's words,
In his mind arose great joy and delight.

"Immediately he followed the seer,
Providing all that he needed—
Gathering firewood and fruits,
Respectfully offering them at the proper times.

"For the sake of cherishing the wondrous Dharma,
Body and mind were without slackening or wearying.
Universally for the sake of all beings,
He diligently sought the Great Dharma—

"Not for his own body
Or for the pleasures of the five desires.
Thus, as the great king of a nation,
Through diligent seeking he obtained this Dharma,

"And thereby achieved Buddhahood—
Now I expound it for you."

The Buddha told the bhikṣus: "At that time, the king was none other than myself. The seer was the present Devadatta. Through Devadatta as a good spiritual friend, I was able to fulfill the six pāramitās—loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity, the thirty-two marks, the eighty secondary characteristics, the purple-golden hue, the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, the four methods of gathering, the eighteen dharmas exclusive to Buddhas, spiritual penetrations and the power of the Way. Having achieved perfect enlightenment and broadly saving beings—all this was due to Devadatta as a good spiritual friend."

The Buddha addressed the fourfold assembly: "Devadatta, after immeasurable kalpas have passed, shall attain Buddhahood. His name shall be Devarāja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Humans, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His world shall be named Devaloka. At that time, Devarāja Buddha shall abide in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas, broadly expounding the wondrous Dharma for beings. Beings numerous as the sands of the Ganges shall attain the fruit of arhatship. Immeasurable beings shall awaken to the mind of pratyekabuddhas. Beings numerous as the sands of the Ganges shall generate the mind of the unsurpassed Way, attain the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas, and reach the stage of non-retrogression."

"When Devarāja Buddha enters parinirvāṇa, the True Dharma shall abide in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas. His complete bodily relics shall be enshrined in a stūpa of the seven precious things, sixty yojanas in height and forty yojanas in breadth. All devas and humans shall make offerings with various flowers, powdered incense, burning incense, paste incense, garments, necklaces, banners, canopies, music and songs, worshiping and making offerings to this stūpa of the seven precious things. Immeasurable beings shall attain the fruit of arhatship. Immeasurable beings shall awaken to pratyekabuddhahood. Inconceivable numbers of beings shall generate the mind of bodhi and reach the stage of non-retrogression."

The Buddha told the bhikṣus: "In a future age, should there be good men and good women who, hearing the Devadatta Chapter of the Lotus Sutra, believe and revere it with pure minds without generating doubts, they shall not fall into the hells, the realm of hungry ghosts, or the realm of animals, but shall be born before Buddhas of the ten directions. In whatever place they are born, they shall constantly hear this sutra. If born among humans or devas, they shall receive supremely wondrous pleasures. If in the presence of a Buddha, they shall be born by transformation from lotus flowers."

At that time, from below, a bodhisattva who had accompanied the World-Honored Prabhūtaratna, named Prajñākūṭa, addressed Prabhūtaratna Buddha: "We should return to our original land." Śākyamuni Buddha said to Prajñākūṭa: "Good man, wait a moment. There is here a bodhisattva named Mañjuśrī. You may meet with him and discuss the wondrous Dharma, then return to your original land."

At that time, Mañjuśrī was seated upon a thousand-petaled lotus flower, large as a cart-wheel. The bodhisattvas who had accompanied him were also seated upon jeweled lotus flowers. They arose naturally from the palace of Sāgara, the dragon-king, in the great ocean, abiding in empty space. They proceeded to Vulture Peak Mountain, descended from their lotus flowers, and approached the Buddha. They bowed their heads to the ground, paying homage to the feet of the two World-Honored Ones. Having completed these courtesies, they went to Prajñākūṭa, exchanged greetings with each other, and withdrew to sit to one side.

Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva asked Mañjuśrī: "When you went to the dragon palace, how many beings did you convert?" Mañjuśrī said: "Their number is immeasurable, incalculable, beyond what words can declare or the mind can fathom. Wait but a moment and evidence shall naturally appear." Before his words were finished, innumerable bodhisattvas seated upon jeweled lotus flowers surged forth from the sea, proceeded to Vulture Peak Mountain, and abided in empty space. These bodhisattvas had all been converted by Mañjuśrī. They had perfected the bodhisattva practices and all discoursed together on the six pāramitās. Those who had originally been śrāvakas discoursed in empty space on śrāvaka practices, but now all cultivated the practice of the Mahāyāna's emptiness teaching. Mañjuśrī said to Prajñākūṭa: "The work of teaching and conversion in the sea was thus." At that time, Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva spoke in verse in praise:

"O Great One of wisdom, virtue, valor, and strength,
Who has converted immeasurable multitudes—
This great assembly here
And I have all now seen.

"You have proclaimed the meaning of true reality,
Opened and revealed the One Vehicle Dharma,
Broadly guiding all beings
To swiftly achieve bodhi."

Mañjuśrī said: "While in the sea, I constantly expounded only the Lotus Sutra." Prajñākūṭa asked Mañjuśrī, saying: "This sutra is profoundly subtle and wondrous, a jewel among sutras, rare in the world. Are there any beings who, through diligent and vigorous practice of this sutra, have swiftly attained Buddhahood?" Mañjuśrī said: "There is the daughter of Sāgara, the dragon-king. She has just reached the age of eight years. Her wisdom is sharp and keen. She well knows the roots, conduct, and karma of all beings. She has attained dhāraṇī. All the profoundly secret treasuries expounded by the Buddhas she can fully receive and uphold. She has deeply entered meditative concentration and thoroughly comprehends all dharmas. In the space of an instant, she generated the mind of bodhi, attained the stage of non-retrogression, and her eloquence is unobstructed. Compassionately mindful of beings as though they were her own infants, her merit is complete. What her mind conceives and her mouth proclaims is subtle, wondrous, vast, and great. Compassionate, benevolent, and yielding, her intent and spirit are harmonious and refined. She is able to reach bodhi."

Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva said: "I have seen Śākyamuni Tathāgata throughout immeasurable kalpas practicing difficult and painful austerities, accumulating merit and amassing virtue, seeking the bodhisattva path without ever ceasing. Observing the great trichiliocosm, there is not even a spot the size of a mustard seed that was not a place where the Bodhisattva cast aside body and life for the sake of beings. Only thereafter did he attain the bodhi Way. I do not believe that this girl could, in the space of an instant, achieve perfect enlightenment." Before his words were finished, the dragon-king's daughter suddenly appeared before them, bowed her head to the ground in reverence, and then withdrew to stand to one side. She spoke in verse in praise:

"Deeply penetrating the marks of crime and merit,
Illuminating universally the ten directions,
The subtle, wondrous, pure Dharma-body
Is endowed with the thirty-two marks.

"With the eighty secondary characteristics
Adorning the Dharma-body,
Revered and looked up to by devas and humans,
Dragons and spirits all pay homage with respect.

"Among all categories of beings,
There are none who do not honor and serve.
Again I have heard that in achieving bodhi,
Only Buddha can bear witness and know.

"I expound the teaching of the Mahāyāna,
Delivering beings from suffering."

At that time, Śāriputra addressed the dragon-girl, saying: "You say that in no long time you shall attain the unsurpassed Way. This is difficult to believe. Why is this? A woman's body is filthy and defiled, not a vessel for the Dharma. How could you attain unsurpassed bodhi? The Buddha-Way is vast and remote. Throughout immeasurable kalpas, through diligent and painful practice of various austerities and the complete cultivation of the pāramitās—only thereafter can one succeed. Moreover, a woman's body still has five obstructions: first, she cannot become a Brahmā god-king; second, Śakra; third, Māra-king; fourth, a wheel-turning sage-king; fifth, a Buddha-body. How could a woman's body swiftly attain Buddhahood?"

At that time, the dragon-girl possessed a precious jewel worth an entire great trichiliocosm. She held it up and presented it to the Buddha. The Buddha immediately received it. The dragon-girl addressed Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva and the Venerable Śāriputra, saying: "I offered the precious jewel and the World-Honored One accepted it. Was this matter swift or not?" They answered: "Very swift." The girl said: "Through your spiritual power, observe my attainment of Buddhahood—it shall be even swifter than this." At that moment, the entire assembly beheld the dragon-girl suddenly transform into a male body, perfect the bodhisattva practices, immediately proceed to the Vimalā world in the southern direction, sit upon a jeweled lotus flower, and achieve perfect enlightenment. With the thirty-two marks and the eighty secondary characteristics, she universally expounded the wondrous Dharma for all beings throughout the ten directions. At that time, in the Sahā world, bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, the eight classes of dragons and spirits, humans and non-humans all beheld from afar that dragon-girl attain Buddhahood and universally expound the Dharma for the assembly of devas and humans at that time. Their minds rejoiced greatly and all made obeisance from afar. Immeasurable beings heard the Dharma, awakened understanding, and attained the stage of non-retrogression. Immeasurable beings received predictions of the Way. The Vimalā world trembled and quaked in six ways. In the Sahā world, three thousand beings abided on the stage of non-retrogression. Three thousand beings generated the mind of bodhi and received predictions. Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva, Śāriputra, and the entire assembly all silently believed and accepted.


Chapter Thirteen: Exhortation to Uphold

At that time, Bhaiṣajyarāja Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva and Mahāpratibhāna Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva, together with twenty thousand bodhisattvas as their retinue, all made this vow before the Buddha: "We only pray that the World-Honored One will not be troubled. After the Buddha's extinction, we shall receive, uphold, read, recite, and expound this sutra. In the future evil age, beings' wholesome roots shall diminish and many shall increase in arrogance, coveting offerings and increasing unwholesome roots, becoming far removed from liberation. Though they shall be difficult to teach and convert, we shall summon up great powers of patient acceptance to read, recite, uphold, expound, write, and make various offerings to this sutra, not sparing body or life."

At that time, the five hundred arhats in the assembly who had received predictions addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we also make this vow ourselves: we shall broadly expound this sutra in other lands." Again, there were eight thousand learning and post-learning persons who had received predictions. They arose from their seats, pressed their palms together toward the Buddha, and made this vow: "World-Honored One, we also shall broadly expound this sutra in other lands. Why is this? In this Sahā land, people are many, evil, and corrupt, harboring arrogance. Their merit is shallow and slight. They are wrathful, turbid, flattering, and crooked, their minds insincere."

At that time, the Buddha's maternal aunt, Mahāprajāpatī Bhikṣuṇī, together with six thousand learning and post-learning bhikṣuṇīs, arose from their seats, single-mindedly pressed their palms together, gazed up at the Honored Countenance, and their eyes did not leave him for an instant. At that time, the World-Honored One addressed Gautamī: "Why do you gaze at the Tathāgata with a troubled expression? Does your mind perhaps think that I have not spoken your name and bestowed upon you the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi?"

"Gautamī, previously when I spoke in general that all śrāvakas have already received predictions, if now you wish to know your prediction: in the future age, you shall become a great Dharma teacher among the Dharma teachings of sixty-eight thousand koṭis of Buddhas, and the six thousand learning and post-learning bhikṣuṇīs shall also be Dharma teachers. Thus shall you gradually perfect the bodhisattva path. You shall attain Buddhahood with the name Sarvasattvapriyadarśana Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Humans, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. Gautamī, this Sarvasattvapriyadarśana Buddha and the six thousand bodhisattvas shall in turn receive predictions and attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

At that time, Yaśodharā Bhikṣuṇī, the mother of Rāhula, thought thus: "The World-Honored One in bestowing predictions has alone not spoken my name." The Buddha addressed Yaśodharā: "In a future age, among the Dharma teachings of hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, you shall cultivate the bodhisattva practices and be a great Dharma teacher, gradually perfecting the Buddha-Way. In the good land you shall attain Buddhahood with the name Raśmiśatasahasraparipūrṇadhvaja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Humans, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The Buddha's lifespan shall be immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas."

At that time, Mahāprajāpatī Bhikṣuṇī and Yaśodharā Bhikṣuṇī, together with their retinues, all rejoiced greatly, having gained what they had never had before. Immediately before the Buddha they spoke in verse:

"World-Honored One, our guide,
Who brings peace to devas and humans—
We, hearing this prediction,
Have peace of mind and complete fulfillment."

When the bhikṣuṇīs had spoken this verse, they addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we also are able to broadly proclaim this sutra in other lands." At that time, the World-Honored One gazed upon the eighty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas. These bodhisattvas were all avaivartika, who turn the irreversible Dharma-wheel and who had attained the various dhāraṇīs. They immediately arose from their seats, approached the Buddha, single-mindedly pressed their palms together, and thought thus: "If the World-Honored One commands us to uphold and expound this sutra, we shall do as the Buddha teaches and broadly proclaim this Dharma." They thought again: "The Buddha now remains silent and does not command us. What should we do?"

At that time, these bodhisattvas, reverently following the Buddha's intention and also wishing to fulfill their original vows, made a lion's roar before the Buddha and uttered this vow: "World-Honored One, after the Tathāgata's extinction, we shall travel back and forth throughout the worlds of the ten directions, enabling beings to write out this sutra, receive, uphold, read, recite it, explain its meaning, practice according to the Dharma, and maintain correct mindfulness—all through the Buddha's awesome power. We only pray that the World-Honored One, abiding in other regions, will watch over and protect us from afar." At that moment, the bodhisattvas all raised their voices in unison and spoke in verse:

"We only pray that you will not be troubled.
After the Buddha's extinction,
In the frightful and evil age,
We shall broadly proclaim.

"There shall be ignorant people
Who speak evil words of abuse
And who threaten us with swords and staves—
All these we shall patiently endure.

"In the evil age, bhikṣus
Of deviant wisdom, with minds flattering and crooked,
Who have not attained yet claim attainment,
Their minds filled with arrogance—

"Or forest-dwelling hermits
Wearing ragged robes in secluded places,
Claiming to practice the true Way
While despising those in the world—

"Greedy for gain and offerings,
They expound the Dharma to the white-robed
And are revered by the world
As though they were six-powered arhats.

"These persons harbor evil minds,
Always thinking worldly thoughts.
Borrowing the name of forest-dwellers,
They delight in proclaiming our faults,

"Speaking words such as these:
'These bhikṣus,
For the sake of greed for gain and offerings,
Expound the doctrines of non-Buddhists

"'And themselves compose these sutras
To delude the people of the world.
Seeking fame and renown,
They discriminatingly expound this sutra.'

"Always amidst great assemblies,
Wishing to defame us,
Before kings and great ministers,
Brahmins and householders,

"And other assemblies of bhikṣus,
They slander and speak evil of us,
Saying we are persons of deviant views
Who expound the doctrines of non-Buddhists.

"Out of reverence for the Buddha,
We shall patiently endure all these evils.
Those who speak contemptuously, saying:
'You are all Buddhas'—

"Such words of contempt
We shall all patiently accept.
In the turbid kalpa and evil age,
There shall be many things to fear.

"Evil spirits shall enter their bodies,
Reviling and defaming us.
We, revering and believing in the Buddha,
Shall don the armor of patient acceptance.

"For the sake of expounding this sutra,
We shall endure these difficulties.
We love not body or life,
But cherish only the unsurpassed Way.

"We, in the future age,
Shall protect what the Buddha has entrusted.
The World-Honored One himself should know:
The evil bhikṣus of the turbid world

"Know not the Buddha's expedient means,
The Dharma expounded according to circumstances.
With evil words and frowning faces,
They shall repeatedly expel us,

"Banishing us far from stūpas and monasteries.
All such various evils,
Mindful of the Buddha's commands,
We shall patiently endure all these things.

"In various villages and cities,
Should there be those seeking the Dharma,
We shall go to wherever they are
And expound the Dharma the Buddha has entrusted.

"We are the World-Honored One's emissaries,
Dwelling among assemblies without fear.
We shall skillfully expound the Dharma—
May the Buddha abide in peace.

"Before the World-Honored One
And the Buddhas who have come from the ten directions,
We make such vows as these—
The Buddha himself knows our minds."


Chapter Fourteen: Peaceful Practices

At that time, Mañjuśrī, Dharma-Prince Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva, addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, these bodhisattvas are extremely rare, for out of reverence for the Buddha they have made great vows that in the future evil age they shall protect, read, and expound this Lotus Sutra. World-Honored One, how should bodhisattva-mahāsattvas be able to expound this sutra in the future evil age?" The Buddha told Mañjuśrī: "If bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in the future evil age wish to expound this sutra, they should abide in four dharmas. First, they should abide in the sphere of practice of bodhisattvas and the sphere of intimacy, and thus be able to expound this sutra for beings."

"Mañjuśrī, what is called the sphere of practice of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas? If bodhisattva-mahāsattvas abide on the ground of patient acceptance, are gentle, agreeable, and compliant, neither hasty nor violent, their minds also unperturbed; moreover, regarding dharmas they practice non-practice while contemplating all dharmas according to their true marks—also neither practicing nor discriminating—this is called the sphere of practice of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas."

"What is called the sphere of intimacy of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas? Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas do not intimately associate with kings, princes of royal blood, great ministers, or officials. They do not intimately associate with various non-Buddhist brahmins, nirgranthas, or those who compose worldly writings, compose poetry, or write in praise of external writings. Nor do they associate with Lokāyata or anti-Lokāyata thinkers. They also do not intimately associate with those engaged in violent sports, wrestling matches, nāṭya performances, or various illusory transformations and theatrical displays. They do not intimately associate with caṇḍālas or with those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens, or dogs, or who hunt, fish, or trap, or with any who practice evil livelihoods. Should such persons occasionally come, they shall expound the Dharma for them, seeking nothing in return. Moreover, they do not intimately associate with bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, or upāsikās who seek the śrāvaka path, nor do they inquire after them. Whether in private chambers, in walking meditation areas, or in lecture halls, they do not dwell together with them. Should such persons occasionally come, they expound the Dharma for them according to circumstances, seeking nothing in return."

"Mañjuśrī, moreover, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas should not, with regard to women's bodies, take the marks that can generate desire and expound the Dharma for them, nor should they delight in seeing them. If entering another's home, they should not converse with young girls, maidens, or widows. They also should not approach the five kinds of paṇḍakas to form close friendships. They should not enter another's home alone. If there are causes and conditions requiring them to enter alone, they should single-mindedly recollect the Buddha. When expounding the Dharma for women, they should not display their teeth in laughter or expose their chest. Even for the sake of the Dharma, they should not form close friendships, how much less for other matters. They should not delight in keeping young disciples, śrāmaṇeras, or small children, nor should they delight in sharing the same teacher. They should constantly delight in sitting in meditation, dwelling in secluded places and regulating their minds. Mañjuśrī, this is called the first sphere of intimacy."

"Furthermore, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas contemplate all dharmas as empty, according to their true mark—not inverted, not moving, not retreating, not revolving, like empty space, having the nature of non-existence. All verbal paths are cut off. Not born, not emerging, not arising. Without name, without mark, truly non-existent. Without measure, without boundary. Without obstruction, without hindrance. But only existing through causes and conditions, arising from inverted views—therefore we speak of them. Always delighting in contemplating the marks of dharmas in this way—this is called the second sphere of intimacy of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If there are bodhisattvas
In the future evil age
With minds free from fear
Who wish to expound this sutra,

"They should enter the sphere of practice
And the sphere of intimacy,
Always keeping far from kings
And princes of royal blood,

"Great ministers and officials,
Those engaged in violent sports,
Caṇḍālas,
And non-Buddhist brahmins.

"Nor should they intimately associate
With those of increased arrogance,
Those greedy for and attached to the Lesser Vehicle,
Scholars of the Three Baskets,

"Bhikṣus who violate the precepts,
Arhats in name only,
Bhikṣuṇīs
Who delight in jesting and laughter,

"Who are deeply attached to the five desires,
Who seek present extinction,
Or upāsikās—
From all these they should not draw near.

"If such persons
Come with good minds
To the bodhisattva's place
To hear the Buddha-Way,

"The bodhisattva then, with
Fearless mind,
Not harboring expectations,
Expounds the Dharma for them.

"Widows, maidens,
Or the various paṇḍakas—
From all these they should not draw near
To form close friendships.

"Nor should they approach
Butchers, executioners,
Hunters and fishermen,
Those who kill for profit,

"Who sell meat for their livelihood,
Who display and sell women—
From all such persons
They should not draw near.

"Violent wrestling,
Various kinds of amusements,
Prostitutes and others—
From all these they should completely avoid intimacy.

"They should not teach the Dharma
To women in solitary places.
When expounding the Dharma,
They should not engage in jesting and laughter.

"Entering villages to beg for food,
They should take along one bhikṣu.
If there is no bhikṣu available,
They should single-mindedly recollect the Buddha.

"These, then, are called
The sphere of practice and sphere of intimacy.
Through these two spheres,
They can expound peacefully and joyfully.

"Moreover, they do not practice
Superior, middling, or inferior dharmas,
Conditioned or unconditioned,
Real or unreal dharmas.

"Nor do they discriminate
Between male and female.
Not obtaining any dharmas,
Not knowing, not seeing—

"This, then, is called
The sphere of practice of bodhisattvas.
All dharmas
Are empty and non-existent,

"Without permanence or abiding,
Also without arising or perishing.
This is called what the wise
Intimately associate with.

"Inverted discrimination
That dharmas exist or do not exist,
Are real or not real,
Are born or not born—

"Dwelling in secluded places,
Regulating their minds,
Abiding motionless
Like Mount Sumeru,

"Contemplating all dharmas
As entirely non-existent,
Like empty space—
Without solidity,

"Not born, not emerging,
Not moving, not retreating,
Always abiding in the single mark—
This is called the sphere of intimacy.

"If there are bhikṣus
After my extinction
Who enter this sphere of practice
And sphere of intimacy,

"When they expound this sutra,
They shall have no timidity or weakness.
When bodhisattvas at times
Enter quiet chambers,

"With correct mindfulness
They contemplate dharmas according to their meaning.
Arising from meditative concentration,
They expound for various kings,

"Princes, ministers, and people,
Brahmins, and others,
Expounding and proclaiming
This sutra,

"Their minds peaceful and secure,
Without timidity or weakness.
Mañjuśrī,
This is called the bodhisattva

"Abiding in the first dharma,
Able in the future age
To expound the Lotus Sutra."

"Again, Mañjuśrī, after the Tathāgata's extinction, in the Dharma-ending age, those who wish to expound this sutra—whether proclaiming orally or reading the sutra—should not delight in speaking of people's or sutras' faults. They should also not slight or disparage other Dharma teachers. They should not speak of other people's good or bad qualities or faults. Regarding śrāvaka persons, they should also not call them by name to speak of their faults, nor should they call them by name to praise their virtues. Moreover, they should not generate resentful or disaffected minds. Through skillfully cultivating such a mind of peace and joy, those who listen shall not oppose their intentions. When questioned with difficulties, they should not answer with the Dharma of the Lesser Vehicle, but only explain with the Mahāyāna, enabling them to attain the wisdom of all modes."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Bodhisattvas always delight
In expounding the Dharma peacefully and securely.
On pure ground
They establish seats,

"Anoint their bodies with oil,
Bathe away dust and defilement,
Don fresh, clean robes—
Pure within and without.

"Peacefully taking their Dharma-seat,
They answer questions as asked.
If there are bhikṣus
And bhikṣuṇīs,

"Upāsakas
And upāsikās,
Kings, princes,
Ministers, officers, and people,

"With subtle and wondrous meaning,
They expound with pleasant countenance.
When questioned with difficulties,
They answer according to the meaning,

"Through causes, conditions, and parables,
Expounding and discriminating,
By these expedient means
Causing all to generate the aspiration,

"Gradually increasing and advancing,
Entering upon the Buddha-Way,
Removing thoughts of laziness
And slackness,

"Abandoning all sorrows and troubles,
Compassionately expounding the Dharma.
Day and night, constantly expounding
The teaching of the unsurpassed Way,

"Through various causes and conditions
And immeasurable parables,
They enlighten beings,
Causing all to rejoice.

"Concerning garments, bedding,
Food and medicine,
They harbor no expectations
Among these things,

"But single-mindedly recollect
The causes and conditions for expounding the Dharma,
Wishing to achieve the Buddha-Way
And cause others to be thus as well.

"This, then, is great benefit,
The offering of peace and joy.
After my extinction,
If there are bhikṣus

"Able to proclaim
This Lotus Sutra,
Their minds without jealousy, anger,
Or various troubling obstructions,

"Also without sorrows, troubles,
Or those who revile and curse,
Also without fear
Of swords, staves, or the like,

"Also without expulsion—
Abiding in patient acceptance.
The wise, in this way,
Skillfully regulate their minds,

"Able to abide peacefully and joyfully
As I have explained above.
The merit of such persons,
Throughout thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas,

"Through calculations or parables,
Cannot be exhaustively explained."

"Again, Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in the future final age, when the Dharma is about to perish, who receive, uphold, read, and recite this sutra should not harbor jealous, deceitful, or flattering minds. Nor should they slight or revile those who study the Buddha-Way or seek out their faults. Whether bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, or upāsikās—whether they seek to be śrāvakas, seek to be pratyekabuddhas, or seek the bodhisattva path—one should not trouble them or cause them doubt or regret, saying to such persons: 'You are far from the Way and shall never attain the wisdom of all modes. Why is this? Because you are lazy and lax persons, negligent regarding the Way.' Moreover, they should not engage in frivolous discussions about dharmas or disputes and contentions. They should generate thoughts of great compassion toward all beings, thoughts of compassionate fathers toward all Tathāgatas, and thoughts of great teachers toward all bodhisattvas. Regarding the great bodhisattvas of the ten directions, they should always deeply and reverently worship them. Toward all beings they should expound the Dharma equally. According to the Dharma, they do not speak much or little. Even to those who deeply love the Dharma, they should not speak excessively."

"Mañjuśrī, if bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in the future final age when the Dharma is about to perish achieve this third practice of peace and joy, when expounding this Dharma, none shall be able to trouble or disturb them. They shall gain good companions to read and recite this sutra together. They shall also gain great assemblies who come to listen and receive. Having listened, they can uphold. Having upheld, they can recite. Having recited, they can expound. Having expounded, they can write or cause others to write. They shall make offerings to the sutra scrolls, revering, honoring, and praising them."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If one wishes to expound this sutra,
One should abandon jealousy, anger, arrogance,
Flattery, deceit, and devious minds,
Constantly cultivating straightforward conduct.

"Not slighting or despising people,
Nor frivolously discussing the Dharma,
Not causing others doubt or regret,
Saying: 'You shall not attain Buddhahood.'

"When this Buddha-son expounds the Dharma,
He is always gentle and patient,
Compassionate toward all,
Not generating a mind of slackness.

"Toward the great bodhisattvas of the ten directions
Who practice the Way out of pity for multitudes,
He should generate a mind of reverence:
'These are my great teachers.'

"Toward the Buddhas, World-Honored Ones,
He generates thoughts of unsurpassed fathers.
Breaking the mind of arrogance,
He expounds the Dharma without obstruction.

"Such is this third dharma—
The wise should guard and protect it.
Single-mindedly practicing peacefully and joyfully,
He is revered by immeasurable multitudes."

"Again, Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in the future final age when the Dharma is about to perish, who uphold this Lotus Sutra, should generate minds of great compassion toward both householders and renunciants. Toward those who are not bodhisattvas, they should generate minds of great pity, thinking thus: 'Such persons have suffered great loss. For though the Tathāgata through expedient means expounds the Dharma according to circumstances, they do not hear, do not know, do not awaken, do not inquire, do not believe, and do not understand. Though such persons do not inquire about, believe in, or understand this sutra, when I attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, wherever they may be, through spiritual penetration powers and wisdom powers, I shall draw them in and cause them to abide in this Dharma.' Mañjuśrī, if bodhisattva-mahāsattvas after the Tathāgata's extinction achieve this fourth dharma, when expounding this Dharma they shall be without faults, constantly receiving offerings, reverence, honor, and praise from bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, kings, princes, great ministers, people, brahmins, and householders. The devas in empty space, for the sake of hearing the Dharma, shall also constantly attend upon them. Whether in villages, cities, or secluded forests, should anyone come wishing to raise difficult questions, the devas day and night, constantly for the sake of the Dharma, shall guard and protect them, enabling all who listen to rejoice. Why is this? Because this sutra is protected by the spiritual powers of all past, future, and present Buddhas. Mañjuśrī, in immeasurable lands, this Lotus Sutra cannot even be heard by name, how much less seen, received, upheld, or recited!"

"Mañjuśrī, suppose there were a powerful wheel-turning sage-king who wished to subdue various nations through his majestic authority, but the various petty kings do not obey his command. At that time, the wheel-turning king raises various troops and goes forth to punish them. When the king sees that his troops have fought with merit, he greatly rejoices and according to their merit bestows rewards—perhaps granting fields, houses, villages, cities, or garments and personal adornments, or various precious things—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, coral, amber, elephants, horses, carriages, servants, and people. Only the bright pearl in his topknot he does not give. Why is this? Only on the king's crown is this one pearl. Were he to give it, the king's retinue would surely be greatly astonished."

"Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata is also like this. Through the power of meditative concentration and wisdom, he has obtained the land of the Dharma and reigns over the triple realm. Yet the various Māra-kings are unwilling to submit. The Tathāgata's worthy and sage generals do battle with them. To those who have merit, his mind also rejoices. In the midst of the fourfold assembly, he expounds various sutras, causing their minds to rejoice, bestowing meditative concentration, liberation, the faculties and powers of the undefiled root, and the wealth of various dharmas. Moreover, he bestows the city of nirvāṇa, declaring that they attain extinction. He guides their minds, causing all to rejoice—yet he does not expound this Lotus Sutra for them."

"Mañjuśrī, just as the wheel-turning king, seeing his troops possessing great merit, his mind greatly rejoicing, finally gives this pearl that is difficult to believe in, which has long been in his topknot and which he does not casually give to people—and now gives it to them—the Tathāgata is also like this. In the triple realm, he is the great Dharma-king, teaching and converting all beings through the Dharma. Seeing the worthy and sage army doing battle with the five-aggregate demons, the affliction demons, and the death demon, achieving great merit and glory, destroying the three poisons, emerging from the triple realm, and breaking the nets of Māra—at this time, the Tathāgata also greatly rejoices. This Lotus Sutra can enable beings to reach the wisdom of all modes. It is greatly resented and difficult to believe in by all the world. Previously it had not been expounded—yet now he expounds it."

"Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the foremost teaching of all Tathāgatas. Among all teachings, it is the most profound. Bestowed at the very end, it is like that powerful king who long protected the bright pearl and now finally gives it. Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the secret treasury of all Buddhas and Tathāgatas. Among all sutras, it is supreme above all. Long protected throughout the night, it has not been rashly expounded. Only today do I give it to you and others, expounding it widely."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Always practicing patient acceptance,
Pitying all,
One is then able to proclaim
The sutra praised by the Buddha.

"In the future final age,
Those who uphold this sutra
Should generate compassion
Toward householders, renunciants, and non-bodhisattvas.

"These who do not hear
Or believe in this sutra
Suffer a great loss.

"When I attain the Buddha-Way,
Through various expedient means,
I shall expound this Dharma for them,
Causing them to abide within it.

"Suppose there were a powerful
Wheel-turning king
Who, when troops fight with merit,
Rewards various things—

"Elephants, horses, carriages,
Personal adornments,
And various fields, houses,
Villages, and cities,

"Or grants garments,
Various precious things,
Servants and wealth,
Joyfully bestowing them.

"If there are valiant and strong ones
Able to perform difficult deeds,
The king removes from his topknot
The bright pearl and bestows it on them.

"The Tathāgata is also thus—
The king of all dharmas,
Possessing great powers of patient acceptance
And the treasure-house of wisdom.

"With great compassion,
According to the Dharma, he transforms the world.
Seeing all people
Receiving various sufferings and troubles,

"Seeking liberation,
They do battle with the demons.
For the sake of these beings
He expounds various dharmas.

"With great expedient means
He expounds these sutras.
Once he knows that beings
Have obtained their strength,

"Finally, at the very end,
He expounds this Lotus Sutra,
Like the king who removes from his topknot
The bright pearl and gives it to them.

"This sutra is most honored,
Supreme among sutras.
I constantly guard and protect it,
Not rashly revealing it.

"Now is precisely the time
To expound it for you and others.
After my extinction,
Those who seek the Buddha-Way

"And wish to attain peace and security
In proclaiming this sutra
Should draw near
Such four dharmas as these.

"Readers of this sutra
Shall constantly be without sorrows or troubles,
Also without sicknesses or pains,
Their complexions fresh and fair.

"Not born into poverty,
Baseness, or ugliness,
Beings delight in seeing them,
As they would admire worthy sages.

"The various sons of devas
Shall serve as their attendants.
Swords and staves shall not strike them;
Poisons cannot harm them.

"If people speak evil words of abuse,
Their mouths shall close and seal.
They shall travel without fear,
Like the lion king.

"The brilliance of their wisdom
Shall be like the shining of the sun.
If in dreams,
They shall see only wondrous things:

"They shall see all Tathāgatas
Seated upon lion thrones,
Surrounded by assemblies of bhikṣus,
Expounding the Dharma.

"Also seeing dragons, spirits,
Asuras, and others,
Numerous as Ganges' sands,
Reverently pressing palms together.

"They shall see themselves
Expounding the Dharma for them.
Also seeing various Buddhas,
Their bodies the color of gold,

"Emitting immeasurable light,
Illuminating all,
With Brahma-voiced sounds
Proclaiming all dharmas.

"The Buddha, for the fourfold assembly,
Expounds the unsurpassed Dharma.
They see themselves in the midst,
Palms pressed together, praising the Buddha.

"Hearing the Dharma and rejoicing,
They make offerings.
They attain dhāraṇī
And realize irreversible wisdom.

"The Buddha, knowing their minds
Have deeply entered the Buddha-Way,
Immediately bestows upon them predictions
Of achieving perfect enlightenment:

"'Good man,
In a future age
You shall obtain immeasurable wisdom—
The great Way of the Buddha.

"'Your land shall be adorned and pure,
Vast, great, and incomparable.
There shall also be a fourfold assembly
With palms pressed together, listening to the Dharma.'

"They also see themselves
In mountain forests,
Cultivating wholesome dharmas,
Realizing all true marks,

"Deeply entering meditative concentration,
Beholding Buddhas of the ten directions."

"The Buddhas' bodies are golden-hued,
Adorned with a hundred marks of merit.
Hearing the Dharma and expounding it for others—
They constantly have such excellent dreams.

"They also dream of becoming kings,
Abandoning palaces, retinues,
And supremely wondrous sensual pleasures,
Proceeding to the place of the Way.

"Under the bodhi tree,
Taking their place upon the lion seat,
Seeking the Way for seven days,
They attain the wisdom of all Buddhas.

"Having achieved the unsurpassed Way,
They arise and turn the Dharma-wheel.
For the fourfold assembly expounding the Dharma
Throughout thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas,

"Expounding the undefiled, wondrous Dharma,
Saving immeasurable beings.
Thereafter they enter nirvāṇa,
Like smoke exhausted and lamps extinguished.

"If, in the future evil age,
One expounds this foremost Dharma,
Such persons shall gain great benefit—
The merit and virtue described above."


Chapter Fifteen: Emerging from the Earth

At that time, the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas who had come from other lands, exceeding the sands of eight Ganges Rivers in number, arose in the great assembly, pressed their palms together, made obeisance, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, if you permit us, after the Buddha's extinction, in this Sahā world, to diligently and vigorously protect, read, recite, write out, and make offerings to this sutra, we shall broadly expound it in this land." At that time, the Buddha told the assembly of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas: "Stop, good men. There is no need for you to protect this sutra. Why is this? In my Sahā world, there are already bodhisattva-mahāsattvas equal to the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers. Each bodhisattva has a retinue equal to the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers. After my extinction, these persons shall be able to protect, read, recite, and broadly expound this sutra."

When the Buddha spoke these words, throughout the Sahā world's great trichiliocosm, the earth everywhere split open and from within it, immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas simultaneously surged forth. The bodies of these bodhisattvas were all golden-hued, with the thirty-two marks and immeasurable brilliance. Previously they had all been dwelling below this Sahā world, in the empty space beneath this realm. These bodhisattvas, hearing the sound of Śākyamuni Buddha's voice, arose from below. Each bodhisattva was the foremost leader among the great multitude, each leading retinues equal to the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers—not to mention those leading retinues equal to fifty thousand, forty thousand, thirty thousand, twenty thousand, or ten thousand Ganges' sands. Not to mention those leading retinues equal to one Ganges' sands, half a Ganges' sands, one quarter, or even one out of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas. Not to mention those with thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of retinues. Not to mention those with koṭis of myriads of retinues. Not to mention those with thousands of myriads, hundreds of thousands, or even ten thousand. Not to mention those with one thousand, one hundred, or even ten. Not to mention those leading five, four, three, two, or one disciple. Not to mention those alone, delighting in solitary practice. Such as these and more, immeasurable and boundless, beyond what calculations or parables can know.

When these bodhisattvas had emerged from the earth, they each proceeded to the jeweled stūpa in empty space where Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata and Śākyamuni Buddha were. Having arrived, they bowed their heads to the ground, paying homage to the feet of the two World-Honored Ones. They also went to the Buddhas beneath the jeweled trees on lion thrones and likewise made obeisance, circumambulating them three times to the right, pressing their palms together in reverence. With various bodhisattva methods of praise, they offered praise and then stood to one side, joyfully gazing up at the two World-Honored Ones. These bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, from their initial emergence, offered praise to the Buddhas with various bodhisattva methods of praise. The time that passed was fifty minor kalpas. At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha sat in silence, and the fourfold assembly likewise sat in silence for fifty minor kalpas. Through the Buddha's spiritual power, he caused the great assembly to perceive it as if only half a day. At that time, through the Buddha's spiritual power, the fourfold assembly also saw the bodhisattvas filling the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of lands' empty space.

Among this assembly of bodhisattvas were four leaders. The first was named Viśiṣṭacāritra, the second named Anantacāritra, the third named Viśuddhacāritra, and the fourth named Supratiṣṭhitacāritra. These four bodhisattvas were the foremost leaders and teachers among the multitude. Before the great assembly, they each pressed their palms together, gazed upon Śākyamuni Buddha, and inquired, saying: "World-Honored One, are you in good health, with few ailments and few troubles? Do you dwell at ease? Are those who are to be saved receiving your teachings easily? Do they not cause the World-Honored One to become weary and tired?"

At that time, the four great bodhisattvas spoke in verse:

"Is the World-Honored One at ease,
With few ailments and few troubles?
In teaching and converting beings,
Are you without weariness?

"And do the various beings
Receive the teaching easily?
Do they not cause the World-Honored One
To become weary and tired?"

At that time, the World-Honored One, in the midst of the great assembly of bodhisattvas, spoke thus: "Just so, just so, good men. The Tathāgata is at ease, with few ailments and few troubles. The various beings are easy to convert and save, without causing weariness. Why is this? These various beings, life after life since time without beginning, have constantly received my teaching and conversion. They have also revered and honored past Buddhas, planting various wholesome roots. When these various beings first saw my body and heard what I expounded, they all immediately believed and accepted, entering into the Tathāgata's wisdom—except for those who previously cultivated and studied the Lesser Vehicle. Even such persons as these I now also cause to hear this sutra and enter into the Buddha's wisdom." At that time, the various great bodhisattvas spoke in verse:

"Excellent, excellent!
Great Hero, World-Honored One—
The various beings
Are easy to convert and save.

"Able to inquire about
The profoundly deep wisdom of the Buddhas,
Having heard, they believe and practice—
We rejoice along with them."

At that time, the World-Honored One praised the foremost great bodhisattvas: "Excellent, excellent, good men! You are able to rejoice along with the Tathāgata." At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva and the assembly of bodhisattvas numbering as the sands of eight thousand Ganges Rivers all thought thus: "From time immemorial until now, we have never seen or heard of such a great assembly of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas emerging from the earth, standing before the World-Honored One with palms pressed together, making offerings and inquiring after the Tathāgata."

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva, knowing the thoughts in the minds of the bodhisattvas numbering as the sands of eight thousand Ganges Rivers, and also wishing to resolve his own doubts, pressed his palms together toward the Buddha and inquired in verse:

"Immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis—
A great multitude of bodhisattvas
Such as has never before been seen—
We pray the Two-Footed Honored One will explain:

"From where have they come?
For what causes and conditions have they assembled?
With gigantic bodies and great spiritual powers,
Wisdom inconceivable,

"Their resolute wills firm,
Possessing great powers of patient acceptance—
Beings delight in seeing them.
From where have they come?

"Each of these bodhisattvas
Leads retinues
Whose number is immeasurable,
Like Ganges' sands.

"Some great bodhisattvas
Lead retinues of sixty thousand Ganges' sands.
Such great multitudes as these,
Single-mindedly seeking the Buddha-Way.

"These great teachers,
Numbering sixty thousand Ganges' sands,
Have all come to make offerings to the Buddha
And to protect this sutra.

"Those leading fifty thousand Ganges' sands—
Their numbers exceed even these.
Those leading forty thousand, thirty thousand,
Twenty thousand, down to ten thousand,

"One thousand, one hundred, and so on,
Down to one Ganges' sands,
Half, and three-quarters,
One out of myriads of koṭis—

"Thousands of myriads of nayutas,
Myriads of koṭis of disciples,
Down to half a koṭi—
Their numbers further exceed the above.

"From hundreds of thousands down to ten thousand,
One thousand and one hundred,
Fifty and down to ten,
Down to three, two, or one—

"Alone, without retinues,
Delighting in solitary dwelling,
All have come to the Buddha's presence—
Their numbers further exceed the above.

"Of such great multitudes as these,
If a person were to calculate with counting-rods
For kalpas exceeding Ganges' sands,
Still they could not fully know them.

"This great assembly
Of bodhisattvas of majestic virtue and vigor—
Who expounded the Dharma for them,
Teaching and perfecting them?

"Under whom did they first generate the aspiration?
What Buddha-Dharma did they praise?
Whose sutras did they receive and uphold?
What Buddha-Way did they cultivate?

"Such bodhisattvas as these,
With spiritual powers and great wisdom-power—
The earth in the four directions split open
And all surged forth from within.

"World-Honored One, from times past until now,
I have never seen such a thing.
We pray you will explain from where they came—
The name of their land.

"I constantly travel throughout various lands,
Yet never have I seen this assembly.
Among this multitude,
I do not recognize a single person.

"Suddenly they have emerged from the earth—
We pray you will explain the causes and conditions.
In this great assembly now,
Immeasurable hundreds of thousands of koṭis—

"All these bodhisattvas
Wish to know about this matter.
Concerning the original causes and conditions
Of this assembly of bodhisattvas,

"O World-Honored One of immeasurable virtue,
We only pray you will resolve the assembly's doubts."

At that time, the emanation Buddhas of Śākyamuni who had come from immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of other lands were seated in cross-legged posture upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees in the eight directions. The attendants of those Buddhas each saw this great assembly of bodhisattvas emerging from the earth in the four directions of the great trichiliocosm and abiding in empty space. Each addressed their Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, from where has this immeasurable, boundless, asaṃkhyeya great assembly of bodhisattvas come?" At that time, the various Buddhas each told their attendants: "Good men, wait a moment. There is a bodhisattva-mahāsattva named Maitreya, to whom Śākyamuni Buddha has bestowed a prediction that he shall next become a Buddha. He has already inquired about this matter, and the Buddha is now answering him. You should all hear it through this."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva: "Excellent, excellent, Ajita! You are able to inquire of the Buddha about such a great matter. You should all single-mindedly don the armor of vigor and generate firm resolve. The Tathāgata now wishes to display and proclaim the wisdom of the Buddhas, the Buddhas' self-mastered spiritual power, the Buddhas' lion-like vigorous power, and the Buddhas' awesome and mighty power of great authority."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Be vigorous and single-minded—
I wish to expound this matter.
Do not harbor doubts or regrets;
The Buddha's wisdom is inconceivable.

"Now put forth the power of faith,
Abiding in patience and goodness.
The Dharma you have never heard before,
You shall now all be able to hear.

"I now give you comfort;
Do not harbor doubts or fears.
The Buddha speaks no false words;
His wisdom is immeasurable.

"The foremost Dharma he has obtained
Is profoundly deep and difficult to discern.
As it is, I shall now expound it—
All of you, listen with single minds."

When the World-Honored One had spoken this verse, he addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva: "I now proclaim to you and this great assembly: Ajita, these great bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, immeasurable and countless asaṃkhyeyas, who have emerged from the earth and whom you have never seen before—after I attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi in this Sahā world, I taught, converted, guided, and led these bodhisattvas, tamed their minds, and caused them to generate the aspiration for the Way. These bodhisattvas all dwell in the empty space beneath this Sahā world. Regarding the various sutras, they read, recite, penetrate, and comprehend them, contemplate and discriminate them, and correctly keep them in mind. Ajita, these good men do not delight in dwelling among multitudes or in speaking much. They constantly delight in quiet places, diligently practicing with vigor, never resting. Nor do they abide relying upon humans or devas. They constantly delight in profound wisdom, without any obstructions. They also constantly delight in the Dharmas of all Buddhas, single-mindedly and vigorously seeking the unsurpassed wisdom."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Ajita, you should know:
These great bodhisattvas,
From immeasurable kalpas past,
Have cultivated the Buddha's wisdom.

"They are all those I have converted,
Causing them to generate the aspiration for the great Way.
These are my sons,
Relying upon and abiding in this world.

"They constantly practice dhūta austerities,
Delighting in quiet places,
Abandoning the clamor of great multitudes,
Not delighting in much speaking.

"Sons such as these
Study and practice my Way and Dharma,
Day and night constantly vigorous,
For the sake of seeking the Buddha-Way.

"They dwell in the empty space
Below the Sahā world.
Firm in will and mindfulness-power,
They constantly, diligently seek wisdom,

"Expounding various wondrous dharmas,
Their minds without any fear.
At Gayā city,
Seated beneath the bodhi tree,

"I achieved perfect enlightenment
And turned the unsurpassed Dharma-wheel.
Then I taught and converted them,
Causing them first to generate the aspiration for the Way.

"Now they all abide in non-retrogression;
All shall achieve Buddhahood.
I now speak true words—
All of you, believe with single minds:

"From the long and distant past,
I have taught and converted this multitude."

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva and the immeasurable assembly of bodhisattvas gave rise to doubt in their minds—a strange and unprecedented occurrence—and they thought thus: "How could the World-Honored One in such a short time have taught and converted such an immeasurable, boundless, asaṃkhyeya great assembly of bodhisattvas, causing them to abide in anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi?" They immediately addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, when the Tathāgata was a crown prince, he departed from the Śākya palace. Not far from Gayā city, he sat at the place of the Way and attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. From that time until now, only slightly more than forty years have passed. World-Honored One, how, in this short time, could you have accomplished such great Buddha-work? Through the Buddha's power and the Buddha's merit, how could you have taught and converted such an immeasurable great assembly of bodhisattvas to attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi?"

"World-Honored One, this great assembly of bodhisattvas—even if a person were to count them for thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas, they could not exhaust their number or reach their limit. These have, from the distant past, planted wholesome roots in the presence of immeasurable, boundless Buddhas, perfected the bodhisattva path, and constantly cultivated pure conduct. World-Honored One, such matters as these are difficult for the world to believe. It is as if there were a person, youthful in appearance with black hair, twenty-five years of age, who pointed to a hundred-year-old person and said, 'This is my son.' And the hundred-year-old person also pointed to the youth and said, 'This is my father who gave birth to and raised me.' Such a matter would be difficult to believe."

"The Buddha is also like this. Having attained the Way, in truth it has not been long. Yet this great assembly of bodhisattvas have, for immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas, for the sake of the Buddha-Way, diligently practiced with vigor, skillfully entering, emerging from, and abiding in immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of samādhis, attaining great spiritual powers, cultivating pure conduct for a long time, skillfully and in proper sequence practicing various wholesome dharmas, skillful in questions and answers—precious among people, extremely rare in all the world. Today the World-Honored One merely says that when he attained the Buddha-Way, he first caused them to generate the aspiration, taught, converted, guided, and directed them toward anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. The World-Honored One attained Buddhahood not long ago, yet he has been able to accomplish such great meritorious works. Though we believe that what the Buddha says accords with circumstances and that the words spoken by the Buddha are never false, and that the Buddha's knowledge penetrates all—nevertheless, newly-aspiring bodhisattvas, after the Buddha's extinction, if they hear such words, perhaps will not believe or accept them and shall thereby generate the karmic causes and conditions for breaking the Dharma. Therefore, World-Honored One, we pray you will explain and remove our doubts. And in future ages, when good men hear of this matter, they also shall not generate doubts."

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"In the past, the Buddha departed from the Śākya clan,
Left home near Gayā,
And sat beneath the bodhi tree—
From then until now, not long ago.

"These sons of the Buddha,
Whose number is immeasurable,
Have long practiced the Buddha-Way,
Abiding in spiritual powers.

"They have skillfully studied the bodhisattva path,
Unstained by worldly dharmas,
Like lotuses in water.
They have emerged from the earth,

"All generating minds of reverence,
Standing before the World-Honored One.
Such matters are difficult to conceive—
How can they be believed?

"The Buddha attained the Way very recently,
Yet his accomplishments are very many.
We pray you will remove the assembly's doubts
And explain according to reality.

"Suppose there were a youthful person,
Just twenty-five years of age,
Who pointed to a hundred-year-old child,
With white hair and wrinkled face,

"Saying: 'These are born of me.'
And the child also said: 'This is my father.'
Father young and child old—
This is not believed by the whole world.

"The World-Honored One is also like this—
He attained the Way very recently.
Yet these bodhisattvas,
Firm in will, without timidity,

"From immeasurable kalpas past
Have practiced the bodhisattva path,
Skillful in difficult questions and answers,
Their minds without any fear.

"Patient and accepting, minds determined,
Upright, possessed of awesome virtue,
Praised by Buddhas of the ten directions,
Able to discriminate skillfully in expounding.

"Not delighting in dwelling among people,
Always preferring meditative concentration,
For the sake of seeking the Buddha-Way,
They dwell in the empty space below.

"We, hearing from the Buddha,
Have no doubts about this matter.
We pray the Buddha, for the sake of the future,
Will expound so they may understand.

"If there are those who, regarding this sutra,
Generate doubts and do not believe,
They shall immediately fall into evil paths.
We pray you will now explain:

"These immeasurable bodhisattvas—
How, in such a short time,
Were they taught and converted, causing them to generate the aspiration
And abide on the stage of non-retrogression?"


Chapter Sixteen: The Lifespan of the Tathāgata

At that time, the Buddha addressed the bodhisattvas and the entire great assembly: "Good men, you should believe and understand the Tathāgata's true and honest words." Again he addressed the great assembly: "You should believe and understand the Tathāgata's true and honest words." And again he addressed the various great assemblies: "You should believe and understand the Tathāgata's true and honest words." At that time, the great assembly of bodhisattvas, with Maitreya as their head, pressed their palms together and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we only pray you will expound. We shall believe and accept the Buddha's words." Having thus spoken three times, they again said: "We only pray you will expound. We shall believe and accept the Buddha's words."

At that time, the World-Honored One, knowing that the bodhisattvas' three requests would not cease, addressed them, saying: "All of you, listen carefully to the Tathāgata's secret spiritual powers. All the worlds—devas, humans, and asuras—all say that the present Śākyamuni Buddha departed from the Śākya palace, and not far from Gayā city, sat at the place of the Way and attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. However, good men, in truth, since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kalpas."

"Suppose there were a person who ground into dust five hundred thousand myriad koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeyas of great trichiliocosms. Passing eastward through five hundred thousand myriad koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeya lands, he deposits one mote of dust. Proceeding eastward in this way until all the dust-motes are exhausted. Good men, what is your opinion? Can these worlds be conceived of, calculated, and their number known?"

Maitreya Bodhisattva and the others all addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, these worlds are immeasurable and boundless, beyond what calculations can know or the power of mind can reach. All śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, with their undefiled wisdom, cannot conceive of or know their numerical limit. Though we abide on the stage of avaivartika, regarding this matter we also cannot comprehend it. World-Honored One, such worlds as these are immeasurable and boundless."

At that time, the Buddha addressed the great assembly of bodhisattvas: "Good men, I shall now clearly proclaim to you: All these worlds, whether or not they received a dust-mote—take them all and reduce them to dust. One dust-mote equals one kalpa. Since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been more than this by hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeya kalpas. From that time onward, I have constantly been in this Sahā world expounding the Dharma and teaching. Also in other places, in hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeya lands, I have guided and benefited beings."

"Good men, during this intermediate period, I have spoken of Dīpaṅkara Buddha and others, and moreover said that they entered nirvāṇa. All this was discriminated through expedient means. Good men, when beings come to me, with the Buddha-eye I observe whether their faith and other faculties are sharp or dull. According to what is appropriate for their salvation, I declare in various places my name to be different, my age to be greater or smaller, and also indicate that I shall enter nirvāṇa. Moreover, through various expedient means, I expound the subtle and wondrous Dharma, able to cause beings to generate joyful minds. Good men, when the Tathāgata sees beings who delight in lesser dharmas, who possess scant virtue and heavy defilement, for such persons I say that when young I left home and attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. However, in truth, since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been as long and distant as this. But through expedient means, I teach and convert beings, causing them to enter the Buddha-Way, and thus I speak."

"Good men, the sutras expounded by the Tathāgata are all for the sake of saving and liberating beings. Whether speaking of my own body or others' bodies, whether revealing my own body or others' bodies, whether revealing my own affairs or others' affairs—all that is said is true and not false. Why is this? The Tathāgata knows and sees the marks of the triple realm according to reality. There is no birth or death, no retreating or emerging. There is neither existence in the world nor extinction. Neither real nor unreal, neither thus nor otherwise. Not as the triple realm sees the triple realm. In such matters as these, the Tathāgata sees clearly without error or delusion. Because beings have various natures, various desires, various conduct, and various thoughts and discriminations, wishing to cause them to generate wholesome roots, through various causes and conditions, parables, words, and phrases, and various expounding of the Dharma, the Buddha-work I perform has never ceased for even a moment. Thus, since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been extremely long and distant. My lifespan is immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, constantly abiding and never extinguished."

"Good men, the lifespan I originally achieved through practicing the bodhisattva path has not yet been exhausted and is still double the above number. However, though now I do not truly enter extinction, I nevertheless proclaim that I shall enter extinction. The Tathāgata uses this expedient means to teach and convert beings. Why is this? If the Buddha abides in the world for a long time, persons of scant virtue will not plant wholesome roots. Poor, lowly, and greedy for and attached to the five desires, they shall enter into the nets of false thoughts and inverted views. If they see that the Tathāgata constantly abides without extinction, they shall become arrogant, self-indulgent, weary, and lazy, unable to generate thoughts of difficulty in encountering him or minds of reverence. Therefore, the Tathāgata uses expedient means to speak, saying: 'Bhikṣus, you should know that encountering the emergence of Buddhas in the world is difficult.' Why is this? Throughout immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas, persons of scant virtue may see a Buddha, or may not. For this reason, I speak thus: 'Bhikṣus, the Tathāgata is difficult to encounter and see.' When these beings hear such words, they shall certainly generate thoughts of the difficulty of encountering, their minds harboring longing and thirst for the Buddha. They shall then plant wholesome roots. Therefore, though the Tathāgata does not truly enter extinction, he speaks of entering extinction."

"Moreover, good men, the Dharmas of all Buddhas and Tathāgatas are all thus—for the sake of saving beings, all are true and not false. Suppose there were a skilled physician, wise and intelligent, thoroughly versed in medicinal formulas, skillful in curing all illnesses. This person has many sons—perhaps ten, twenty, or even a hundred. Due to certain matters, he travels afar to another land. After his departure, his sons drink other people's poison. When the poison takes effect, they writhe in confusion and agony upon the ground. At that time, their father returns home. Among the sons who have drunk the poison, some have lost their original minds, while others have not. Seeing their father from afar, they all greatly rejoice, kneel down, bow, and inquire: 'How excellent that you have returned safely! We were foolish and mistakenly took poison. We pray you will save and heal us, restoring our lifespans.' The father, seeing his sons suffering thus, according to various medical texts seeks fine medicinal herbs, perfect in color, fragrance, and flavor, grinds, sifts, and mixes them together, and gives them to his sons to take, speaking these words: 'This great fine medicine possesses perfect color, fragrance, and flavor. All of you should take it. It shall swiftly remove your suffering and troubles, and you shall have no further afflictions.'"

"Among those sons who have not lost their minds, seeing this fine medicine with its perfect color and fragrance, they immediately take it and are completely cured and healed. The others who have lost their minds, though they also rejoice upon seeing their father and inquire after him, seeking healing for their illness, when they are given the medicine they refuse to take it. Why is this? The poison has deeply entered, causing them to lose their original minds. Regarding this medicine of fine color and fragrance, they consider it unpleasant. The father thinks: 'These sons are pitiable. Poisoned and confused, their minds are all inverted. Though they rejoice upon seeing me and seek salvation and healing, they refuse to take such fine medicine. I should now employ expedient means to cause them to take this medicine.' He immediately speaks these words: 'You should know that I am now aged and decrepit. The time of my death has arrived. This fine medicine I now leave here. You may take it—do not worry that it will not cure you.' Having given these instructions, he again departs to another land and sends a messenger back to announce: 'Your father has died.' At that time, the sons, hearing that their father had died and they were orphaned, feel great sorrow and distress and think thus: 'If our father were alive, he would pity us and be able to save and protect us. Now he has abandoned us and died far away in another land.' They consider themselves solitary and bereft, without anyone to rely upon. Constantly harboring grief and sorrow, their minds finally awaken and they realize that this medicine possesses excellent color, flavor, and fragrance. They immediately take it, and the poison and illness are all cured. Their father, hearing that his sons have all recovered, soon returns home so that all may see him."

"Good men, what is your opinion? Could anyone say that this skilled physician committed the offense of falsehood?" "No, World-Honored One." The Buddha said: "I am also like this. Since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeya kalpas. For the sake of beings, through the power of expedient means, I say that I shall enter extinction. Yet there is no one who could, according to the Dharma, speak of me as committing the offense of falsehood."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Since I attained Buddhahood,
The number of kalpas that have passed
Is immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads
Of koṭis and asaṃkhyeyas.

"I have constantly expounded the Dharma and taught
Immeasurable koṭis of beings,
Causing them to enter the Buddha-Way.
Since then, immeasurable kalpas have passed.

"For the sake of saving beings,
I skillfully manifest nirvāṇa,
Yet in truth I do not become extinct—
I constantly abide here expounding the Dharma.

"I constantly abide here,
Through various spiritual powers
Causing inverted beings,
Though near, not to see me.

"The multitudes, seeing my extinction,
Broadly make offerings to my relics.
All harbor longing and thirst,
Generating minds of yearning.

"When beings have become faithful and compliant,
Upright and gentle in intent,
Single-mindedly wishing to see the Buddha,
Not sparing their own bodies or lives,

"At that time, I and the assembly of monks
All appear on Vulture Peak Mountain.
I then tell the beings
That I constantly abide here without extinction,

"Through the power of expedient means,
I manifest extinction and non-extinction.
In other lands there are beings
Who are reverent, faithful, and joyful—

"Among them also
I expound the unsurpassed Dharma.
You do not hear of this
And merely think that I have entered extinction.

"I see the various beings
Drowning in suffering and trouble.
Therefore I do not manifest my body,
Causing them to generate thirst and yearning.

"When their minds harbor longing and thirst,
I then emerge to expound the Dharma.
My spiritual power is like this:
Throughout asaṃkhyeya kalpas,

"I constantly abide on Vulture Peak Mountain
And in various other dwelling places.
When beings see the kalpa ending,
The great fire burning all,

"My land is peaceful and secure,
Constantly filled with devas and humans.
Gardens, groves, halls, and pavilions,
Adorned with various jewels,

"Jeweled trees full of flowers and fruits—
Beings sport and enjoy themselves there.
The devas strike celestial drums,
Constantly making various kinds of music,

"Raining māndārava flowers,
Scattering them upon the Buddha and the great assembly.
My Pure Land is not destroyed,
Yet the multitudes see it burned to exhaustion,

"Filled with worry, fear,
And various sufferings and troubles.
These various sinful beings,
Through evil karmic causes and conditions,

"Pass asaṃkhyeya kalpas
Without hearing the name of the Three Jewels.
All those who cultivate merit and virtue,
Who are gentle, upright, and honest,

"All see my body
Abiding here expounding the Dharma.
At times, for this multitude,
I expound that the Buddha's lifespan is immeasurable.

"For those who see the Buddha only after a long time,
I explain that encountering the Buddha is difficult.
My wisdom-power is like this—
The light of my wisdom illuminates immeasurably.

"My lifespan is immeasurable kalpas,
Obtained through long cultivation of karma.
You who possess wisdom,
Do not generate doubts about this.

"You should cause them to be forever exhausted—
The Buddha's words are true and not false.
Like a physician using skillful expedients,
To cure his deranged sons,

"Though truly alive, he speaks of death—
None can speak of him as false.
I am also the father of the world,
Saving those with various sufferings and troubles.

"Because ordinary beings are inverted,
Though truly present, I speak of extinction.
Because they constantly see me,
They generate arrogant and self-indulgent minds,

"Unrestrained, attached to the five desires,
They fall into evil paths.
I constantly know all beings—
Whether they practice the Way or not.

"According to what is appropriate for their salvation,
I expound various dharmas for them.
Each time, I think thus:
'How can I cause beings

"'To enter the unsurpassed wisdom
And swiftly achieve the Buddha-body?'"


Chapter Seventeen: Discerning Merit

At that time, the great assembly, hearing the Buddha expound his lifespan in terms of kalpas so long and distant, immeasurable, boundless, asaṃkhyeya beings obtained great benefit. At that time, the World-Honored One addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva: "Ajita, when I spoke of the Tathāgata's long and distant lifespan, beings numbering six hundred and eighty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges' sands attained the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas a thousand times this number attained the dhāraṇī-gate of hearing and upholding. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of one world attained unobstructed eloquence in joyful speaking. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of one world attained hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of immeasurable dhāraṇīs of revolution. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of a great trichiliocosm were able to turn the irreversible Dharma-wheel. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of two middling lands were able to turn the pure Dharma-wheel. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of a small-thousand land shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after eight more births. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of four four-continent worlds shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after four more births. Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of three four-continent worlds shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after three more births. Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of two four-continent worlds shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after two more births. Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of one four-continent world shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after one more birth. Again, beings numbering as the dust-motes of eight worlds all generated the mind of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

When the Buddha spoke of these bodhisattva-mahāsattvas obtaining great Dharma-benefit, from empty space rained māndārava flowers and mahā-māndārava flowers, scattering them upon the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas seated upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees, and also scattering them upon Śākyamuni Buddha and Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata who had long since entered extinction, seated upon lion thrones within the seven-jeweled stūpa, and also scattering them upon all the great bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly. Moreover, it rained finely powdered sandalwood and aloeswood incense. In empty space, heavenly drums sounded of themselves, their wondrous sounds profound and far-reaching. It also rained thousands of kinds of heavenly garments, and there hung various necklaces—pearl necklaces, mani-pearl necklaces, wish-fulfilling pearl necklaces—pervading throughout the nine directions. Jeweled incense burners burned priceless incense, naturally arriving everywhere, making offerings to the great assembly. Above each Buddha were bodhisattvas holding banners and canopies, ascending in succession up to Brahma Heaven. These bodhisattvas, with wondrous voices and sounds, sang immeasurable verses in praise of all Buddhas.

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva arose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, pressed his palms together toward the Buddha, and spoke in verse:

"The Buddha has expounded this rare Dharma,
Never before heard.
The World-Honored One possesses great power—
His lifespan is immeasurable.

"Immeasurable sons of the Buddha,
Hearing the World-Honored One discriminatingly
Explain those who obtain Dharma-benefit,
Are filled throughout their bodies with joy.

"Some abide on the stage of non-retrogression,
Some attain dhāraṇī,
Or unobstructed joyful eloquence,
Myriads of koṭis of revolution in total retention.

"Some, numbering as dust-motes of the great trichiliocosm,
Each able to turn
The irreversible Dharma-wheel.

"Again, those numbering as dust-motes of middling chiliocosms,
Each able to turn
The pure Dharma-wheel.

"Again, those numbering as dust-motes of small chiliocosms,
The remainder each having eight more births,
Shall attain the Buddha-Way.

"Again, those numbering as dust-motes of four, three, and two—
Such four-continent worlds—
Bodhisattvas numbering accordingly
Shall achieve Buddhahood after that many births.

"Or those numbering as dust-motes of one four-continent world,
The remainder having one more birth,
Shall achieve the wisdom of all modes.

"Beings such as these,
Hearing of the Buddha's long lifespan,
Attain immeasurable, undefiled,
Pure fruition and reward.

"Again, those numbering as dust-motes of eight worlds,
Hearing the Buddha expound his lifespan,
All generate the unsurpassed mind.

"The World-Honored One has expounded immeasurable,
Inconceivable dharmas
With much that benefits,
Like empty space without bounds.

"It rains heavenly māndārava
And mahā-māndārava flowers.
Śakras and Brahmas, like Ganges' sands,
Come from immeasurable Buddha-lands.

"It rains sandalwood and aloeswood,
Swirling and falling in confusion,
Like birds flying down from the sky,
Scattering offerings upon all Buddhas.

"In empty space, heavenly drums
Naturally emit wondrous sounds.
Thousands of myriads of kinds of heavenly garments
Whirl and descend,

"Wondrous jeweled incense burners
Burning priceless incense
Naturally arriving everywhere,
Making offerings to all World-Honored Ones.

"The great assemblies of bodhisattvas
Hold seven-jeweled banners and canopies,
Lofty, wondrous, numbering myriads of koṭis,
Ascending in succession to Brahma Heaven.

"Before each Buddha,
Jeweled pennants hang with victorious banners.
Also with thousands of myriads of verses,
They sing in praise of all Tathāgatas.

"Such various matters as these
Have never before occurred.
Hearing that the Buddha's lifespan is immeasurable,
All rejoice.

"The Buddha's name is heard throughout the ten directions,
Broadly benefiting beings.
All possess wholesome roots
To aid the unsurpassed mind."

At that time, the Buddha addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva: "Ajita, should there be beings who, hearing that the Buddha's lifespan is long and distant like this, are able to generate even one thought of faith and understanding, the merit they obtain shall be without limit or measure. If there are good men or good women who, for the sake of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, throughout eighty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kalpas practice the five pāramitās—dāna-pāramitā, śīla-pāramitā, kṣānti-pāramitā, vīrya-pāramitā, dhyāna-pāramitā, excluding prajñā-pāramitā—the merit of this practice compared with the previous merit cannot equal it by a hundredth part, a thousandth part, a hundred-thousandth-myriad-koṭith part—indeed, it cannot be known even through calculation or parable. If good men or good women possess such merit, regarding anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi they cannot possibly regress."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If a person seeks the Buddha's wisdom,
Throughout eighty myriads of koṭis
Of nayutas of kalpas,
Practices the five pāramitās:

"Throughout all these kalpas,
Making offerings to Buddhas
And pratyekabuddha disciples,
And various assemblies of bodhisattvas,

"With precious and rare food and drink,
Fine garments and bedding,
Building monasteries of sandalwood,
Adorned with gardens and groves;

"Gifts such as these,
Various and all subtle and wondrous,
Throughout all these kalpas' duration,
Dedicating them toward the Buddha-Way;

"If one again upholds the precepts,
Pure and without breach or flaw,
Seeking the unsurpassed Way,
Praised by all Buddhas;

"If one again practices patient acceptance,
Abiding on the ground of gentleness and compliance,
When various evils come to assail,
One's mind is not perturbed or moved.

"Also, those who obtain the Dharma
Yet harbor the conceit of superiority—
Being troubled and slighted by them,
One is also able to patiently endure.

"If one is again diligent and vigorous,
Will and mindfulness constantly firm,
Throughout immeasurable koṭis of kalpas
Single-mindedly without slackening;

"Also, throughout immeasurable kalpas,
Dwelling in secluded places,
Whether sitting or walking meditation,
Except for sleep, constantly regulating the mind—

"Through such causes and conditions,
One can generate the various dhyānas.
Throughout eighty koṭis of myriads of kalpas,
Abiding with mind unconfused,

"Upholding the merit of this single-minded concentration,
Vowing to seek the unsurpassed Way,
I attain the wisdom of all modes,
Exhausting all the limits of the dhyānas—

"Such a person, throughout hundreds of thousands
Of myriads of koṭis of kalpas,
Practicing all these merits
As described above.

"If there are good men and women
Who hear me expound my lifespan,
Even believing for a single thought—
Their merit exceeds that.

"If a person is completely without
Any doubts or regrets whatsoever,
And with deep mind believes for even a brief moment—
Their merit is like this.

"Those bodhisattvas
Who have practiced the Way for immeasurable kalpas,
Hearing me expound my lifespan,
Are then able to believe and accept.

"Persons such as these
Shall reverently receive this sutra,
Vowing that in the future
They shall long live to save beings,

"Just as today's World-Honored One,
King of the Śākyas,
With a lion's roar at the place of the Way,
Expounding the Dharma fearlessly.

"We, in future ages,
Shall be universally revered.
When sitting at the place of the Way,
We shall expound lifespans likewise.

"If there are those of deep mind,
Pure and upright,
Much learning, able to retain and uphold,
Understanding the Buddha's words according to their meaning—

"Persons such as these
Shall have no doubts about this."

"Moreover, Ajita, should there be those who hear of the Buddha's long lifespan and understand its meaning and purport, the merit obtained by such persons shall be without limit or measure, able to arouse the Tathāgata's unsurpassed wisdom. How much more so if one broadly hears this sutra, or causes others to hear it; if one upholds it oneself, or causes others to uphold it; if one writes it oneself, or causes others to write it; or if with flowers, incense, necklaces, banners, canopies, fragrant oil, butter lamps, one makes offerings to the sutra scrolls! Such a person's merit shall be immeasurable and boundless, able to generate the wisdom of all modes. Ajita, if good men or good women, hearing me expound my long lifespan, with deep minds believe and understand, they shall see the Buddha constantly abiding on Vulture Peak Mountain, surrounded by great bodhisattvas and assemblies of śrāvakas, expounding the Dharma. They shall also see this Sahā world—its ground of lapis lazuli, level and even, with jambu-river gold marking out the eight paths, jeweled trees in rows, and various towers and pavilions all made of jewels, with assemblies of bodhisattvas all dwelling therein. If one is able to contemplate thus, one should know this is the mark of deep faith and understanding."

"Moreover, after the Tathāgata's extinction, if one hears this sutra and does not slander it but generates a mind of joyful acceptance, one should know this is already the mark of deep faith and understanding—how much more so for one who reads, recites, receives, and upholds it! Such a person shall carry the Tathāgata upon their head. Ajita, such good men and good women need not, for my sake, again erect stūpas and monasteries or build monastic dwellings or make the fourfold offerings to the Saṅgha. Why is this? Such good men and good women who receive, uphold, read, and recite this sutra have already erected stūpas, established monastic dwellings, and made offerings to the Saṅgha. They shall be considered as having erected stūpas of the seven precious things for the Buddha's relics, lofty and broad, gradually tapering up to Brahma Heaven, with various banners, canopies, and numerous jeweled bells hung, with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, numerous drums, music, flutes, pipes, harps, various kinds of dance and entertainment, with wondrous sounds and voices singing praises and eulogies—they shall be considered as having already made such offerings for immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas."

"Ajita, after my extinction, should there be those who hear this sutra and are able to receive and uphold it, whether writing it themselves or causing others to write it, they shall be considered as having erected monastic dwellings, built with red sandalwood various halls and chambers numbering thirty-two, eight tāla trees in height, lofty, broad, adorned, and excellent, with hundreds of thousands of bhikṣus dwelling therein, with gardens, groves, bathing ponds, walking meditation paths, meditation caves, garments, food and drink, bedding, medicines, all pleasurable things filling them completely—such monastic dwellings, halls, and pavilions, numbering in the several hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis, immeasurable in number, presenting them before me and making offerings to me and the Saṅgha of bhikṣus. Therefore I say: After the Tathāgata's extinction, if there are those who receive, uphold, read, recite, or expound for others, whether writing themselves or causing others to write, and make offerings to the sutra scrolls, they need not again erect stūpas and monasteries or build monastic dwellings or make offerings to the Saṅgha. How much more so for those who are able to uphold this sutra and also practice giving, upholding precepts, patient acceptance, vigor, single-mindedness, and wisdom! Their virtue is most supreme, immeasurable and boundless, just as empty space in the east, west, south, north, the four intermediate directions, above, and below is immeasurable and boundless—so too is such a person's merit immeasurable and boundless, swiftly reaching the wisdom of all modes. If one reads, recites, receives, and upholds this sutra, expounds it for others, whether writing it oneself or causing others to write it; moreover, is able to erect stūpas and build monastic dwellings, making offerings to and praising the Saṅgha of śrāvakas; also with hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of methods of praise, praises the merit of bodhisattvas; moreover, for others, through various causes and conditions, explains this Lotus Sutra according to its meaning; again, is able to purely uphold the precepts, dwelling together with those who are gentle and compliant; is patient and accepting without anger, with will and mindfulness firm and solid, constantly valuing sitting in meditation, attaining various deep concentrations; is vigorous and valiant, gathering in all wholesome dharmas; is sharp in faculties and wisdom, skillful in answering difficult questions..."

"Ajita, after my extinction, should there be good men and good women who receive, uphold, read, and recite this sutra, they shall again possess such various wholesome merits. One should know that such persons have already approached the place of the Way, are near to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, and sit beneath the tree of the Way. Ajita, wherever such good men and good women sit, stand, or walk about, there should one erect a stūpa, and all devas and humans should make offerings as they would to a stūpa of the Buddha."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If, after my extinction,
One can reverently uphold this sutra,
Such a person's merit is immeasurable,
As described above.

"They shall be considered as having completely fulfilled
All manner of offerings—
Erecting stūpas with relics,
Adorned with the seven precious things,

"With pennant-poles extremely lofty and broad,
Gradually tapering up to Brahma Heaven,
With jeweled bells by thousands of myriads of koṭis,
Moved by wind, emitting wondrous sounds.

"Also, throughout immeasurable kalpas,
Making offerings to this stūpa
With flowers, incense, various necklaces,
Heavenly garments, and various kinds of music,

"Burning fragrant oil and butter lamps,
Constantly illuminating all around.
In the evil age of the Dharma's ending,
One able to uphold this sutra

"Shall be considered as already, as above,
Completely fulfilling all offerings.
If one is able to uphold this sutra,
It is as if the Buddha were present.

"With ox-head sandalwood,
Building monastic dwellings as offerings,
With halls numbering thirty-two,
Eight tāla trees in height,

"With superior food and wondrous garments,
Bedding all complete,
Hundreds of thousands of dwelling places,
With gardens, groves, and various bathing ponds,

"Walking meditation paths and meditation caves,
Various kinds, all adorned excellently.
If one has the mind of faith and understanding,
Receiving, upholding, reading, reciting, and writing,

"Or again causing others to write,
And making offerings to the sutra scrolls,
Scattering flowers, powdered incense,
Sumanas, campaka,

"Atimuktaka flowers,
Constantly burning fragrant oil—
One who makes offerings thus
Obtains immeasurable merit.

"Like empty space without bounds,
So too is their merit.
How much more so for one who upholds this sutra
While also practicing giving, upholding precepts,

"Patient acceptance, delighting in dhyāna,
Not angry, not speaking evil,
Reverent toward stūpas and monasteries,
Humble toward all bhikṣus,

"Far removed from arrogant minds,
Constantly contemplating wisdom—
When questioned with difficulties, not angered,
Responding in accordance with explanations.

"If one is able to practice such conduct,
Their merit is immeasurable.
If one sees this Dharma teacher
Who has achieved such virtues as these,

"One should scatter heavenly flowers upon them,
Cover their body with heavenly garments,
Bow with head touching their feet,
And in one's mind generate thoughts as of the Buddha.

"One should also think thus:
'It shall not be long before they proceed to the place of the Way,
Attain the undefiled and unconditioned,
Broadly benefiting devas and humans.'

"Wherever they dwell and abide,
Whether walking meditation, sitting, or lying down,
Or even expounding a single verse—
There should one erect a stūpa,

"Adorning it to make it wondrous and excellent,
Making various kinds of offerings.
When a Buddha-son dwells in this place,
It is then a place the Buddha uses.

"Constantly dwelling therein,
Walking meditation, sitting, and lying down."


Chapter Eighteen: The Merit of Joyful Acceptance

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, if there are good men and good women who, hearing this Lotus Sutra, joyfully accept it, how much merit shall they obtain?" And he spoke in verse:

"After the World-Honored One's extinction,
Should there be those who hear this sutra—
If they are able to joyfully accept it,
How much merit shall they obtain?"

At that time, the Buddha addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva: "Ajita, after the Tathāgata's extinction, whether bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, or other wise persons, whether senior or junior, having heard this sutra and joyfully accepted it, depart from the Dharma assembly and go to another place—whether in a monastic dwelling, a secluded place, a city, an alley, a village, or a hamlet—and, as they have heard it, expound it to the utmost of their ability for their parents, relatives, good friends, and acquaintances. These persons, having heard, also joyfully accept it and again go forth to teach others. Those others, having heard, also joyfully accept and teach yet others. Thus, transmitting it in succession unto the fiftieth person—Ajita, I shall now explain to you the merit of joyful acceptance of this fiftieth good man or good woman. Listen well."

"Suppose throughout the six destinies and four modes of birth of beings in four hundred myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya worlds—whether egg-born, womb-born, moisture-born, or transformation-born; whether having form or formless; having thought or thoughtless; neither having thought nor thoughtless; without feet, two-footed, four-footed, or many-footed—all such as these who are numbered among beings: suppose there were a person seeking merit who, according to their desires for pleasurable things, gave to them all, granting to each being all of Jambudvīpa's gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, coral, amber, and various wondrous precious things, as well as elephants, horses, carriages, palaces and towers made of the seven precious things. Having practiced such great giving for eighty full years, this great benefactor then thinks: 'I have already given beings pleasurable things according to their desires. However, these beings are all aged and decrepit, over eighty years old, with white hair and wrinkled faces. They shall die before long. I should now guide and instruct them with the Buddha-Dharma.' He immediately gathers these beings, proclaims and expounds the Dharma's transformation, instructing, benefiting, and delighting them. All at once they attain the path of stream-enterer, the path of once-returner, the path of non-returner, and the path of arhatship. They exhaust all outflows and, in profound dhyāna concentrations, all attain self-mastery, perfecting the eight liberations. What is your opinion? Is the merit obtained by this great benefactor abundant or not?"

Maitreya addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, this person's merit is extremely great, immeasurable and boundless. If this benefactor merely gave beings all pleasurable things, their merit would already be immeasurable. How much more so for causing them to attain arhatship!" The Buddha told Maitreya: "I now speak clearly to you: This person, giving all pleasurable things to beings of the six destinies throughout four hundred myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya worlds, and moreover causing them to attain arhatship—the merit they obtain does not equal that of this fiftieth person who hears one verse of the Lotus Sutra and joyfully accepts it. It cannot equal it by a hundredth part, a thousandth part, a hundred-thousandth-myriad-koṭith part, indeed cannot be known even by calculation or parable. Ajita, the merit of joyful acceptance of the Dharma Flower Sutra by this fiftieth person who has heard it transmitted in succession is already immeasurable, boundless, and asaṃkhyeya. How much more so for the first person in the assembly who hears and joyfully accepts it! Their merit is even more superior—immeasurable, boundless, asaṃkhyeya, incomparable."

"Moreover, Ajita, if a person, for the sake of this sutra, goes to a monastic dwelling and, whether sitting or standing, listens and receives it even briefly, through the merit of this cause and condition, when reborn in their next life, they shall receive supremely fine elephants, horses, carriages, precious palanquins, and shall ride in heavenly palaces. If again there is a person who, at a place where the Dharma is being expounded, sits, and another person comes whom they urge to sit and listen, or if they share their seat to allow them to sit—the merit of this person, when reborn in their next life, shall be to obtain the seat of Śakra, or the seat of a Brahmā king, or the seat of a wheel-turning sage-king."

"Ajita, if again there is a person who says to another: 'There is a sutra named the Lotus Flower; let us go together to hear it'—and they receive the teaching and, even for the briefest moment, hear it—the merit of this person, when reborn in their next life, shall be to be born together with dhāraṇī bodhisattvas. They shall possess sharp faculties and wisdom. Throughout hundreds of thousands of myriads of lives they shall never be mute or dumb. Their breath shall not be foul. Their tongue shall always be without illness. Their mouth also shall be without illness. Their teeth shall not be stained or black, not yellow, not sparse, nor missing, crooked, or asymmetrical. Their lips shall not droop down or curl back, nor be coarse or chapped, nor erupted or broken, nor crooked or distorted, neither thick nor large, neither dark black nor with any distasteful features. Their nose shall not be flat or crooked. Their face's color shall not be black, nor shall it be narrow or long, nor sunken or twisted. They shall have no unpleasant features whatsoever. Their lips, tongue, teeth—all shall be excellent and fine. Their nose long and slender, lofty and straight. Their face shall be full and round. Their eyebrows shall be high and long. Their forehead broad, level, and upright. Human marks shall be complete. In life after life wherever they are born, they shall see the Buddha, hear the Dharma, and believe and receive the teachings."

"Ajita, merely observe this: merely urging one person to go and listen to the Dharma produces such merit as this. How much more so for one who single-mindedly listens, expounds, reads, and recites, and in the midst of great assemblies discriminatingly explains it for others and practices according to what is taught?"

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If a person, at a Dharma assembly,
Hears this sutra,
Even a single verse,
And joyfully accepts it and expounds it for others,

"Thus transmitting and teaching
Unto the fiftieth person,
The merit obtained by this last person
I shall now discriminate:

"Suppose there were a great benefactor
Who provided for immeasurable multitudes,
Fully for eighty years,
According to their desires.

"Seeing their aged and decrepit marks,
White hair and wrinkled faces,
Teeth sparse and form withered,
Mindful that their death is not far off,

"'I should now teach them,
Causing them to obtain the fruits of the Way.'
Immediately, through expedient means, I expound
The true Dharma of nirvāṇa:

"'The world is all impermanent,
Like foam, bubbles, and flames.
All of you should
Swiftly generate minds of renunciation.'

"All the people, hearing this Dharma,
Attain arhatship,
Perfecting the six spiritual powers,
The three sciences and eight liberations.

"This fiftieth person
Who hears one verse and joyfully accepts it—
This person's merit exceeds that
And cannot be compared by parable.

"Thus, hearing it transmitted in succession,
Their merit is still immeasurable.
How much more so for one at the Dharma assembly
Who first hears and joyfully accepts!

"If there is one who urges another person,
Leading and guiding them to hear the Lotus Flower,
Saying: 'This sutra is profoundly wondrous,
Difficult to encounter in thousands of myriads of kalpas,'

"And they receive the teaching and go to listen,
Even hearing it for the briefest moment,
The merit and reward of such a person
I shall now discriminatingly explain:

"Life after life without oral afflictions,
Teeth neither sparse, yellow, nor black;
Lips neither thick, curled, nor missing—
Without any distasteful marks.

"Tongue neither dry, black, nor short;
Nose lofty, long and slender, and straight;
Forehead broad, level, and upright;
Face and eyes all upright and dignified—

"Delightful for people to see.
Breath without foul odor—
The fragrance of utpala flowers
Shall issue from their mouth.

"If one purposely goes to a monastic dwelling
Wishing to hear the Lotus Sutra,
Hearing it briefly and rejoicing,
I shall now explain their merit:

"In future lives, born among devas and humans,
They shall obtain wondrous elephants, horses, carriages,
Precious palanquins,
And ride in heavenly palaces.

"If at a place where Dharma is being expounded
One urges others to sit and listen to the sutra,
Through the merit of these causes and conditions they obtain
The seats of Śakra, Brahmā, and wheel-turning kings.

"How much more so for one who single-mindedly listens,
Explains its meaning and purport,
And practices according to what is taught—
Their merit is immeasurable!"

Chapter Nineteen: The Merits of the Dharma Teacher


At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ever Diligent, saying: "If a good man or good woman receives and upholds this Lotus Sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, that person shall obtain eight hundred merits of the eye faculty, twelve hundred merits of the ear faculty, eight hundred merits of the nose faculty, twelve hundred merits of the tongue faculty, eight hundred merits of the body faculty, and twelve hundred merits of the mind faculty. Through these merits, the six sense faculties shall be adorned and made perfectly pure. This good man or good woman, with the pure physical eyes received from their parents, shall see throughout the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds—all the mountains, forests, rivers, and seas, both within and without. From the Avīci Hell below to the Summit of Existence above, they shall also see all sentient beings therein, as well as their karmic causes and conditions, their karmic recompense, and the places of their rebirth. All this they shall see and all this they shall know."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If one in the great assembly,
With a mind free from fear,
Expounds this Lotus Sutra—
Hear now of such merits.

That person obtains eight hundred
Meritorious and supreme eyes,
And being thus adorned,
Their vision becomes most pure.

With eyes received from parents,
They see the thousand triple cosmos entire—
Mount Sumeru within and without,
Sumeru and the Iron Ring Mountains,

Together with all other mountain forests,
The great seas and the flowing rivers.
From the Avīci Hell below
To the Summit of Existence above,

All sentient beings therein—
These they completely perceive.
Though not yet possessing the divine eye,
The power of the physical eye is thus."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall obtain twelve hundred merits of the ear faculty. With these pure ears, they shall hear throughout the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds, from the Avīci Hell below to the Summit of Existence above, all the various words and sounds within and without: the sounds of elephants, horses, cattle, and carriages; the sounds of weeping and lamentation; the sounds of conches, drums, bells, and chimes; the sounds of laughter and speech; the sounds of men and women, boys and girls; the sounds of Dharma and non-Dharma; the sounds of suffering and joy; the sounds of ordinary beings and noble ones; the sounds of delight and displeasure; the sounds of deities, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas; the sounds of fire, water, and wind; the sounds of hell beings, animals, and hungry ghosts; the sounds of monks and nuns; the sounds of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; the sounds of bodhisattvas and Buddhas. In brief, all sounds whatsoever within and without the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds—though not yet having obtained the divine ear, with the pure ordinary ear received from their parents, they shall hear and know all. Thus distinguishing the various kinds of sounds, their ear faculty shall remain unimpaired."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"The ear received from parents,
Pure and without defilement—
With this ordinary ear they hear
The sounds of the thousand triple worlds.

Sounds of elephants, horses, chariots, and oxen,
Sounds of bells, chimes, conches, and drums,
Sounds of lutes, zithers, and harps,
Sounds of flutes and pipes—

The pure and beautiful sounds of songs
They hear without attachment.
Countless varieties of human speech
They hear and fully comprehend.

They also hear the voices of the deities,
The wondrous sounds of their songs,
And hear the voices of men and women,
The voices of boys and girls.

In mountain ravines and perilous valleys,
The call of the kalaviṅka bird,
The jīvajīvaka and other birds—
All their sounds they hear.

The many suffering torments of hell,
The various anguished cries,
The hungry ghosts oppressed by hunger and thirst,
Their voices seeking food and drink—

The asuras and others
Dwelling at the ocean's edge,
When they converse among themselves,
Emitting great sounds—

Thus does the Dharma teacher,
Abiding safely in this realm,
Hear these many sounds from afar,
Yet their ear faculty remains unimpaired.

In the worlds of the ten directions,
When birds and beasts call to one another,
The person who expounds the Dharma
Hears all of these.

In the Brahma heavens above,
The Ābhāsvara and Śubhakṛtsna realms,
And up to the Summit of Existence,
The sounds of speech—

The Dharma teacher, dwelling here,
Hears them all.
All the assembly of monks
And all the nuns,

Whether reading or reciting scriptures,
Or teaching them to others—
The Dharma teacher, dwelling here,
Hears them all.

Moreover, the bodhisattvas,
Reading and reciting the Dharma of the sutras,
Or teaching it to others,
Compiling commentaries and explaining its meaning—

All such sounds as these
They completely hear.
The Buddhas, Great Holy Honored Ones,
Teachers and transformers of sentient beings,

In the midst of great assemblies,
Expounding the wondrous Dharma—
The upholder of this Lotus Sutra
Hears it all.

Throughout the thousand triple great cosmos,
All sounds within and without,
From the Avīci Hell below
To the Summit of Existence above—

They hear all these sounds
While their ear faculty remains unimpaired.
Because their ears are keen and sharp,
They can distinguish and know all.

The upholder of this Lotus Sutra,
Though not yet having the divine ear,
But using only the ear they were born with—
Such are their merits already."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall perfect eight hundred merits of the nose faculty. With this pure nose faculty, they shall smell all the various fragrances throughout the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds, above and below, within and without: the fragrance of sumanas flowers, jāti flowers, mallikā flowers, campaka flowers, pāṭala flowers, red lotus flowers, blue lotus flowers, white lotus flowers; the fragrance of flowering trees and fruit trees; the fragrance of sandalwood, aloeswood, tamālapattra, and tagara; and thousands upon thousands of kinds of blended incenses, whether powdered, formed into pellets, or prepared as ointments. The upholder of this sutra, dwelling in this realm, shall be able to distinguish them all. Moreover, they shall separately know the fragrances of sentient beings: the scent of elephants, horses, cattle, sheep, and so forth; the scent of men and women, boys and girls; and the scent of grasses, trees, thickets, and forests. Whether near or far, all these fragrances they shall perceive and distinguish without error. Though the upholder of this sutra dwells here, they shall also smell the fragrances of the deities in heaven: the fragrance of the pārijāta and kovidāra trees; the fragrance of mandārava flowers and mahā-mandārava flowers; the fragrance of mañjūṣaka flowers and mahā-mañjūṣaka flowers; sandalwood and aloeswood; various powdered incenses; and the fragrance of various mixed flowers. The fragrances produced by blending all such celestial incenses—none of these shall remain unknown. They shall also smell the bodily fragrances of the deities: the fragrance of Śakra Devānām Indra when in the Hall of Victory, delighting in the five desires and sporting there; his fragrance when in the Hall of Wondrous Dharma, expounding the Dharma to the Trāyastriṃśa deities; his fragrance when roaming in various parks; and the bodily fragrances of other male and female deities—all these they shall smell from afar. Thus continuing upward through the Brahma realms and reaching to the Summit of Existence, the bodily fragrances of all the deities they shall smell. They shall also smell the fragrances of incense burned by the deities, as well as the fragrances of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and the bodily fragrances of Buddhas—all these they shall smell from afar and know where they are. Though smelling these fragrances, their nose faculty shall neither be impaired nor confused. If they wish to distinguish and explain them to others, their recollection shall be without error."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"That person's nose is pure;
In this world,
Whether fragrant or foul things—
All varieties they perceive and know.

Sumanas and jāti,
Tamālapattra and sandalwood,
Aloeswood and cassia fragrance,
Various flower and fruit fragrances,

And they know sentient beings' scents—
The scent of men and women.
The teacher of the Dharma, dwelling far away,
Smells the fragrance and knows their location.

Great wheel-turning kings,
Lesser wheel-turning kings and their sons,
Ministers and palace attendants—
Smelling their fragrance, they know where they are.

The precious jewels adorning their bodies,
And treasures buried in the earth,
The jeweled maidens of wheel-turning kings—
Smelling their fragrance, they know where they are.

The ornaments adorning people's bodies,
Their garments and necklaces,
The various ointments they apply—
Smelling their fragrance, they know whose body.

Whether the deities walk or sit,
Sport or perform spiritual transformations—
The upholder of this Lotus Sutra,
Smelling their fragrance, knows it all.

The flowers, fruits, and seeds of trees,
And the fragrance of ghee and oil—
The sutra upholder, dwelling here,
Knows exactly where they are.

In the deep and perilous places of mountains,
Where sandalwood trees flower in bloom,
And sentient beings dwell therein—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

In the Iron Ring Mountains, the great seas,
And sentient beings within the earth—
The sutra upholder smells their fragrance
And knows exactly where they are.

Male and female asuras
And all their retinues,
When fighting or at play—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

In wilderness and dangerous narrow places,
Lions, elephants, tigers, wolves,
Wild oxen, water buffalo, and so forth—
Smelling their fragrance, they know where they are.

If someone is pregnant,
Before the sex is determined,
Whether lacking faculties or inhuman—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

By the power of smelling fragrance,
They know of the first conception,
Whether it will come to completion or not,
And whether a blessed child will be safely born.

By the power of smelling fragrance,
They know the thoughts of men and women—
Their lustful, deluded, or angry minds,
And also know those who cultivate goodness.

The many hidden treasures in the earth—
Gold, silver, and various jewels
Stored in copper vessels—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

Various kinds of necklaces
Whose value no one can assess—
Smelling their fragrance, they know their worth,
Their origin and location.

The various flowers of heaven—
Mandāravas and mañjūṣakas,
The pārijāta tree—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

The celestial palaces of heaven,
Their superior, middle, and inferior distinctions,
Adorned with multitudes of jewels and flowers—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

The celestial gardens, forests, and splendid halls,
The various towers and Halls of Wondrous Dharma,
Those taking pleasure therein—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

Whether the deities listen to the Dharma
Or receive the five desires,
Coming and going, walking, sitting, or lying—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

The garments worn by celestial maidens,
Beautifully adorned with fine flowers and fragrances,
As they move about at play—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

Thus continuing upward by degrees,
Even to the Brahma realm,
Those entering and emerging from meditative absorption—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

The Ābhāsvara and Śubhakṛtsna heavens,
And up to the Summit of Existence—
Those first born there and those departing—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

The assembly of monks
Ever diligent in the Dharma,
Whether sitting or walking in meditation,
Or reading and reciting scriptures,

Or beneath forest trees,
Concentrating in meditative absorption—
The sutra upholder smells their fragrance
And knows exactly where they are.

Bodhisattvas of firm resolve,
Whether sitting in meditation or reciting,
Or teaching the Dharma to others—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

The World-Honored Ones in all directions,
Revered by all,
Having compassion and teaching the Dharma—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

Sentient beings in the Buddha's presence,
Hearing the sutra, all rejoicing,
Practicing according to the Dharma—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

Though not yet having obtained the bodhisattva's
Undefiled Dharma-born nose,
This sutra upholder
First obtains these nasal characteristics."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall obtain twelve hundred merits of the tongue faculty. Whether good or bad, beautiful or not beautiful, or even bitter and astringent things—when they come to their tongue faculty, all are transformed into supreme flavors, like heavenly ambrosia, with nothing that is not delicious. If, with their tongue faculty, they expound the Dharma before a great assembly, they shall emit profound and wondrous sounds that can penetrate the hearts of all, causing all to rejoice and be delighted. Moreover, the sons and daughters of the deities, Śakra, Brahmā, and the various deities, hearing these profound and wondrous sounds and this orderly exposition and discourse, shall all come to listen. The nāgas and nāga maidens, yakṣas and yakṣa maidens, gandharvas and gandharva maidens, asuras and asura maidens, garuḍas and garuḍa maidens, kinnaras and kinnara maidens, mahoragas and mahoraga maidens—all, for the sake of hearing the Dharma, shall come to draw near, show reverence, and make offerings. Monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, kings, princes, ministers, and retinues, lesser wheel-turning kings, great wheel-turning kings with their seven treasures and thousand sons, and their inner and outer retinues, shall all ride in their palaces and come together to hear the Dharma, because the bodhisattva teaches the Dharma well. Brahmins, householders, and the people of the land shall, for their entire lives, attend and make offerings. Moreover, śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas shall always delight in seeing them. In whatever direction this person dwells, all Buddhas shall turn toward that place and teach the Dharma. They shall be able to receive and uphold all the Buddha's teachings, and also be able to emit profound and wondrous Dharma sounds."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"That person's tongue faculty is pure;
They shall never receive evil flavors.
Whatever they eat
All becomes like ambrosia.

With profound, pure, and wondrous voice,
They teach the Dharma to the great assembly.
Through various causes and parables,
They guide the minds of sentient beings.

All who hear rejoice
And present supreme offerings.
The deities, nāgas, yakṣas,
Asuras, and others—

All with reverent minds
Come together to hear the Dharma.
This teacher of the Dharma,
If wishing with wondrous sounds

To pervade the thousand triple cosmos,
Can accomplish this at will.
Great and lesser wheel-turning kings
And their thousand sons and retinues,

With palms joined and reverent minds,
Always come to hear and receive the Dharma.
The deities, nāgas, yakṣas,
Rākṣasas, and piśācas—

Also with joyful minds,
Always delight in making offerings.
The King of the Brahma Heaven, the King of Māra,
Īśvara and Maheśvara—

Such hosts of deities as these
Always come to that place.
The Buddhas and their disciples,
Hearing the sound of that one's Dharma teaching,

Always think of and protect them,
And sometimes manifest their bodies."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall obtain eight hundred merits of the body faculty. They shall obtain a pure body like pure lapis lazuli, which sentient beings delight to see. Because their body is pure, all sentient beings of the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds—at the time of their birth and death, whether superior or inferior, beautiful or ugly, born in good or evil destinies—all shall be manifested therein. The Iron Ring Mountain, the Great Iron Ring Mountain, Mount Sumeru, Mount Mahāsumeru, and all such mountains, as well as the sentient beings therein, all shall be manifested therein. From the Avīci Hell below to the Summit of Existence above, all that exists and all sentient beings shall be manifested therein. If śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas expound the Dharma, their forms and images shall all be manifested within that body."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If one upholds the Lotus Sutra,
Their body becomes most pure,
Like that pure lapis lazuli—
All sentient beings delight to see them.

And like a pure, bright mirror
That reflects all forms and images,
The bodhisattva, in their pure body,
Sees all that exists in the world,

They alone clearly perceive this;
Others cannot see it.
Throughout the thousand triple cosmos,
All the multitudes of living beings—

Deities, humans, and asuras,
Hell beings, ghosts, and animals—
All such forms and images
Are manifested within their body.

The palaces of the deities and so forth,
Even up to the Summit of Existence,
The Iron Ring and Sumeru Mountains,
Mount Mahāsumeru,

The great seas and waters—
All are manifested within their body.
The Buddhas and the śrāvakas,
The Buddha's sons, the bodhisattvas,

Whether alone or in assemblies,
Teaching the Dharma—all are manifested.
Though not yet having obtained the undefiled
Wondrous body of the Dharma nature,

With their pure ordinary body,
All is manifested therein."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman, after the Tathāgata's parinirvāṇa, receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall obtain twelve hundred merits of the mind faculty. With this pure mind faculty, upon hearing even a single verse or phrase, they shall penetrate limitless and boundless meanings. Having understood these meanings, they shall be able to expound upon a single phrase or verse for one month, four months, or even a full year. All the teachings they expound, in accordance with their meaning and purport, shall never contradict true reality. If they teach worldly classics, governmental discourse, or matters of livelihood and occupation, all shall accord with the correct Dharma. As for the sentient beings of the six destinies throughout the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds—the movements of their minds, the actions of their minds, the conceptual elaborations of their minds—all shall be known. Though not yet having obtained the wisdom free from defilements, yet their mind faculty shall be pure to this extent. Whatever this person thinks, deliberates upon, or speaks about shall all be the Buddha's teaching, without anything false, and shall also be what was spoken by previous Buddhas in the sutras."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"That person's mind is pure,
Bright, sharp, and without defilement.
With this wondrous mind faculty,
They know superior, middling, and inferior teachings.

Upon hearing even a single verse,
They penetrate limitless meanings.
In proper sequence they teach according to the Dharma,
For a month, four months, or up to a year.

Within and without this world,
All sentient beings—
Whether deities, nāgas, or humans,
Yakṣas, ghosts, spirits, and so forth—

Those in the six destinies,
Their various thoughts and intentions—
As recompense for upholding the Lotus Sutra,
They know them all at once.

The countless Buddhas of the ten directions,
With the marks adorned by a hundred merits,
Teaching the Dharma to sentient beings—
They hear all and can receive and uphold it.

They contemplate limitless meanings
And teach the Dharma also without limit,
From beginning to end without forgetting or erring—
Because they uphold the Lotus Sutra.

They fully know the marks of all dharmas,
Understand their sequence according to meaning,
Comprehend names, words, and expressions,
And teach them as they are known.

What this person expounds
Is all the Dharma of previous Buddhas.
Because they expound this Dharma,
Before assemblies they have nothing to fear.

The upholder of the Lotus Sutra
Has a mind faculty pure like this.
Though not yet having the undefiled state,
They first possess these characteristics.

This person upholding this sutra
Abides in a rare and wondrous state,
And for the sake of all sentient beings,
They are joyfully loved and revered.

Able to use thousands upon thousands of kinds
Of skillful expressions,
They distinguish and expound the Dharma—
Because they uphold the Lotus Sutra."

Chapter Twenty: The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging


At that time the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta, saying: "You should now understand that if any bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī, upāsaka, or upāsikā who upholds the Lotus Sutra should be subject to evil speech, reviling, or slander, they will incur great karmic retribution as previously explained. Yet the merit they obtain shall be as has been described—the purity of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, in the ancient past, immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable, incalculable kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Humans and Gods, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa was named離衰 (离衰, Free from Decline), and the land was named Great Achievement. That Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja, in that world, expounded the Dharma for humans, gods, and asuras. For those seeking to be śrāvakas, he taught the Four Noble Truths to transcend birth, old age, sickness, and death, and to attain final nirvāṇa. For those seeking to be pratyekabuddhas, he taught the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. For bodhisattvas seeking anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, he taught the Six Pāramitās to perfect the Buddha's wisdom.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, the lifespan of that Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja was forty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges' sands of kalpas. The True Dharma abided in the world for a number of kalpas equal to the dust motes of one Jambudvīpa. The Semblance Dharma abided in the world for a number of kalpas equal to the dust motes of the four continents. After that Buddha had brought benefit to sentient beings, he then entered parinirvāṇa. After both the True Dharma and the Semblance Dharma had become extinct, in that land another Buddha appeared, also named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Humans and Gods, Buddha, World-Honored One. In this succession there were two myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, all bearing the same name."

"After the first Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata had entered parinirvāṇa, and after the True Dharma had become extinct, during the age of the Semblance Dharma, there were bhikṣus of overweening pride who wielded great influence. At that time there was a bodhisattva-bhikṣu named Sadāparibhūta (Never Disparaging). Mahāsthāmaprāpta, for what reason was he named Never Disparaging? This bhikṣu, whenever he encountered anyone—whether bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī, upāsaka, or upāsikā—would bow in reverence and offer praise, saying: 'I deeply respect you all and dare not treat you with contempt. Why is this so? Because you are all practicing the bodhisattva path and shall attain Buddhahood.'

"This bhikṣu did not devote himself to the recitation of sutras, but only practiced making obeisance. Even when he saw the four assemblies from afar, he would deliberately approach them to bow and offer praise, saying: 'I dare not disparage you, for you shall all become Buddhas.' Among the four assemblies, those who harbored anger and impure minds would revile him with harsh words, saying: 'This ignorant bhikṣu—whence has he come? He claims not to despise us and confers upon us the prediction that we shall attain Buddhahood. We have no use for such false predictions!' Year after year he endured such revilement without giving rise to anger, always proclaiming: 'You shall become Buddhas.' When he spoke thus, some would beat him with sticks, tiles, and stones. Yet even as he fled to a distance, he would still call out in a loud voice: 'I dare not disparage you, for you shall all become Buddhas.' Because he always spoke in this manner, the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās of overweening pride called him Sadāparibhūta (Never Disparaging)."

"When this bhikṣu was approaching death, he heard in the space above him all twenty thousand myriads of koṭis of verses of the Lotus Sutra that had been expounded by the Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja. He was able to receive and uphold them all, and immediately attained purity of the eye faculty as described above, as well as purity of the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind faculties. Having obtained the purity of these six faculties, his lifespan was extended by two hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of years, and he extensively expounded this Lotus Sutra for the people.

"At that time, those of the four assemblies of overweening pride—the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who had treated this person with contempt and given him the name Never Disparaging—saw that he had obtained great supernatural powers, the power of eloquent discourse, and the power of great meditative equipoise. When they heard what he taught, they all came to believe, submit, and follow him. This bodhisattva also converted thousands of myriads of koṭis of beings, causing them to dwell in anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"After his life ended, he encountered two thousand koṭis of Buddhas, all named Sun-Moon-Lamp Radiance. Under their Dharma he expounded this Lotus Sutra. Through this causal connection, he again encountered two thousand koṭis of Buddhas, all named Cloud-Freedom-Lamp King. Under the Dharma of these Buddhas he received, upheld, recited, and expounded this sutra for the four assemblies. Thus he obtained this constant purity of the eye, and purity of the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind faculties. Among the four assemblies he taught the Dharma without fear."

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, this Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Sadāparibhūta made offerings to such numbers of Buddhas, revering, honoring, and praising them, planting roots of virtue. Afterward he encountered thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, and under the Dharma of all these Buddhas he expounded this sutra. His merit perfected, he was destined to attain Buddhahood.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, what do you think? Could that Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta of that time have been another person? He was none other than myself. If in past lives I had not received, upheld, recited, and expounded this sutra for others, I would not have been able to speedily attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. Because at the places of former Buddhas I received, upheld, recited, and expounded this sutra for others, I speedily attained anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, at that time the four assemblies—the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās—who with angry minds treated me with contempt, did not encounter any Buddha for two hundred koṭis of kalpas. They heard no Dharma and saw no Saṅgha. For one thousand kalpas they suffered great anguish in the Avīci Hell. After their offenses were expiated, they again met the Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta, who taught them toward anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, what do you think? Could those four assemblies who constantly disparaged that bodhisattva have been other persons? They are none other than the five hundred bodhisattvas including Bhadrapāla, the five hundred bhikṣus including Lion-Moon, and the five hundred upāsakas including Thoughtful-of-Buddha now in this assembly—all of whom shall never regress from anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, you should understand that this Lotus Sutra greatly benefits all bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and enables them to reach anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. Therefore, after the Tathāgata's parinirvāṇa, all bodhisattva-mahāsattvas should always receive, uphold, recite, expound, and transcribe this sutra."


At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"In the past there was a Buddha
Named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja,
Of measureless spiritual wisdom,
Guiding and leading all beings,

Gods, humans, dragons, and spirits
Together made offerings to him.
After that Buddha's parinirvāṇa,
When the Dharma was about to end,

There was one bodhisattva
Named Never Disparaging.
At that time the four assemblies
Were attached to the Dharma.

The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging
Would approach their presence
And speak these words to them:
'I do not despise you,

For you all practice the Path
And shall all become Buddhas.'
When the people heard this,
They belittled and reviled him.

The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging
Was able to endure this patiently.
When his offenses were exhausted,
At the time of his approaching death,

He heard this sutra
And his six faculties became pure.
Through his supernatural powers
His lifespan was increased,

And again for the people
He widely expounded this sutra.
All those attached to the Dharma
Received the bodhisattva's

Instruction and perfection,
Causing them to dwell in the Buddha Path.
When Never Disparaging's life ended,
He encountered countless Buddhas.

Because he expounded this sutra
He obtained immeasurable merit,
Gradually perfecting merit and virtue,
Speedily achieving the Buddha Path.

That Never Disparaging of former times
Was none other than myself.
The four assemblies at that time—
Those attached to the Dharma—

Who heard Never Disparaging's words,
'You shall all become Buddhas,'
Through this causal condition
Encountered countless Buddhas.

The five hundred bodhisattvas
In this assembly,
Together with the four groups
Of pure believing laymen and laywomen,

Now before me
Listening to the Dharma—these are they.
In past lives I
Exhorted all these people

To hear and receive this sutra,
The foremost of all Dharmas.
I revealed and taught people,
Causing them to dwell in nirvāṇa,

Life after life upholding
Sutras such as this.
Only after koṭis upon koṭis of kalpas,
Inconceivably many,

Does one get to hear
This Lotus Sutra.
Only after koṭis upon koṭis of kalpas,
Inconceivably many,

Do the Buddhas, World-Honored Ones,
Preach this sutra.
Therefore, practitioners,
After the Buddha's parinirvāṇa,

Upon hearing such a sutra,
Should harbor no doubt.
With single-minded devotion
They should widely expound this sutra,

Life after life encountering Buddhas,
Speedily achieving the Buddha Path."

Chapter Twenty-One: The Transcendent Powers of the Tathāgata


At that time, the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas equal in number to the dust particles of a thousand worlds, who had emerged from the earth, all with single-minded concentration joined their palms before the Buddha, gazed reverently upon his countenance, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, after the Buddha's extinction, in all the lands where the World-Honored One's emanation bodies are present, and in the places where he enters into parinirvāṇa, we shall extensively expound this sutra. For what reason? Because we ourselves also wish to obtain this true, pure, and great Dharma, to receive and maintain it, to read and recite it, to expound and explain it, to copy it in writing, and to make offerings to it."

At that time, the World-Honored One, in the presence of Mañjuśrī and the countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas who had long dwelt in the sahā world, as well as the assembly of bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, human and nonhuman beings, and all others, manifested great transcendent powers. He extended his broad and long tongue upward to the Brahma world, and from all his pores emitted countless, immeasurable beams of colored light, which universally illuminated the worlds in all ten directions. The buddhas seated upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees also did likewise, extending their broad and long tongues and emitting immeasurable light. When Śākyamuni Buddha and the buddhas beneath the jeweled trees were manifesting these transcendent powers, a full one hundred thousand years passed. Thereafter, they withdrew their tongues. At the same moment, they cleared their throats and snapped their fingers together. These two sounds reached throughout the buddha-worlds of the ten directions, and the earth in all of them quaked and trembled in six ways. The beings therein—devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, human and nonhuman beings, and others—by virtue of the Buddha's transcendent power, all beheld this sahā world with its immeasurable, limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of buddhas seated upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees, and also beheld Śākyamuni Buddha together with the Tathāgata Many Jewels, both seated upon the lion throne within the jeweled stūpa. Moreover, they beheld the immeasurable, limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and the fourfold assembly reverently surrounding Śākyamuni Buddha. Having beheld all this, they experienced great joy and obtained that which they had never before attained.

At that very moment, the devas in the air proclaimed aloud: "Beyond these immeasurable, limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of asaṃkhyeya worlds, there is a land called Sahā, wherein dwells a buddha named Śākyamuni. Now, for the sake of the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, he expounds the Great Vehicle sutra called the Lotus Blossom of the Sublime Dharma, the Dharma for Teaching Bodhisattvas, the Dharma Cherished and Protected by the Buddhas. You should all rejoice deeply in this, and should also pay reverence and make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha." When those beings heard this voice in the air, they joined their palms toward the sahā world and spoke thus: "Homage to Śākyamuni Buddha! Homage to Śākyamuni Buddha!" With various flowers, incense, necklaces, banners, canopies, and personal adornments, as well as precious and wondrous objects, they all scattered these remotely toward the sahā world. The scattered objects came from the ten directions, gathering like clouds, and were transformed into a jeweled canopy that universally covered all the buddhas assembled there. At that time, the worlds of the ten directions became perfectly penetrable without obstruction, as though they were a single buddha-land.

At that time, the Buddha addressed the great assembly of bodhisattvas led by Superior Conduct and the others: "The transcendent powers of the buddhas are thus immeasurable, limitless, and inconceivable. If I were to employ these transcendent powers to expound the merits and virtues of this sutra for the sake of entrusting it to you, doing so for immeasurable, limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, I still could not exhaust them. To speak concisely: all the dharmas possessed by the Tathāgata, all the sovereign transcendent powers of the Tathāgata, all the storehouse of profound essentials of the Tathāgata, all the most profound matters of the Tathāgata—all are proclaimed, revealed, and expounded in this sutra. Therefore, after the Tathāgata's extinction, you should all single-mindedly receive and maintain it, read and recite it, expound and explain it, copy it in writing, and practice according to the teachings. In whatever land there are those who receive and maintain it, read and recite it, expound and explain it, copy it in writing, and practice according to the teachings; wherever the sutra scrolls are present—whether in a garden, in a forest, beneath a tree, in a monastery, in a layman's dwelling, in a palace hall, or in mountain valleys and wilderness—in all such places, a stūpa should be erected and offerings made. For what reason? You should know that such places are the site of enlightenment, where all buddhas attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, where all buddhas turn the wheel of the Dharma, and where all buddhas enter into parinirvāṇa."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

The buddhas, saviors of the world,
Abiding in great transcendent powers,
To bring joy to all living beings,
Manifest immeasurable divine powers.

Their tongues reach to the Brahma heavens,
Their bodies emit countless rays of light;
For those who seek the Buddha's path,
They manifest these rare occurrences.

The sound of the buddhas clearing their throats
And the sound of their snapping fingers
Are heard throughout the lands of the ten directions,
And the earth everywhere quakes in six ways.

Because after the Buddha's extinction
There will be those able to maintain this sutra,
All the buddhas rejoice
And manifest immeasurable transcendent powers.

In entrusting this sutra to others,
And in praising those who receive and maintain it,
Even throughout immeasurable kalpas,
They still could not exhaust such praise.

The merits and virtues of such persons
Are boundless and without limit,
Like the void in the ten directions—
One cannot find their boundaries.

Those able to maintain this sutra
Are regarded as having already beheld me,
As well as the Buddha Many Jewels
And all the emanation buddhas.

They are also regarded as beholding me now
Teaching and transforming the bodhisattvas.
Those able to maintain this sutra
Cause me and the emanation buddhas,

As well as the extinct Buddha Many Jewels,
All to rejoice.
The buddhas presently dwelling in the ten directions,
And those of the past and future as well,

They shall also behold and make offerings to them,
And also cause them to rejoice.
The secret and essential Dharma
That the buddhas obtained while seated at the place of enlightenment—

Those able to maintain this sutra
Before long shall also obtain it.
Those able to maintain this sutra,
Regarding the meaning of all dharmas,

Names, words, and phrases,
Shall delight in expounding without exhaustion,
Like the wind in the sky
That encounters no obstacles whatsoever.

After the Tathāgata's extinction,
They shall know the sutras expounded by the Buddha,
Their causes and conditions and proper sequence,
And expound them truthfully in accord with their meaning,

Like the light of the sun and moon
That dispels all darkness.
Such persons moving through the world
Are able to extinguish the darkness of living beings,

Teaching immeasurable bodhisattvas
To ultimately abide in the One Vehicle.
Therefore, those possessed of wisdom,
Hearing of these merits and benefits,

After my extinction
Should receive and maintain this sutra.
Such persons, regarding the Buddha path,
Decidedly shall harbor no doubts whatsoever.

Chapter Twenty-Two: Entrustment

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha arose from his Dharma seat and manifested great supernatural power. With his right hand, he rubbed the heads of the immeasurable bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and spoke these words: "Throughout immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, I have cultivated and practiced this Dharma of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, which is difficult to attain. Now I entrust it to you all. You should single-mindedly propagate this Dharma and cause it to increase extensively."

In this manner, three times he rubbed the heads of the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and spoke these words: "Throughout immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, I have cultivated and practiced this Dharma of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, which is difficult to attain. Now I entrust it to you all. You should receive, uphold, recite, and extensively proclaim this Dharma, causing all sentient beings universally to hear and know it. Why is this so? The Tathāgata possesses great compassion. He is without stinginess or parsimony and is also without fear. He is able to bestow upon sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom, the Tathāgata's wisdom, and the self-arising wisdom. The Tathāgata is the great benefactor of all sentient beings. You also should follow and study the Tathāgata's Dharma and not give rise to stinginess. In future ages, if there are good men or good women who have faith in the Tathāgata's wisdom, you should expound this Lotus Sutra for them, enabling them to hear and know it, so as to cause such persons to attain the Buddha's wisdom. If there are sentient beings who do not believe and accept it, then among the Tathāgata's other profound Dharmas you should instruct, benefit, and gladden them. If you are able to do this, then you will have already repaid the kindness of all buddhas."

At that time, when the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas heard what the Buddha had said, they were all filled with great joy throughout their bodies. With ever-increasing reverence, they bent their bodies, lowered their heads, joined their palms toward the Buddha, and with one voice proclaimed: "We shall carry out all that the World-Honored One has commanded. Yes, World-Honored One, may you have no concern." The assembly of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in this manner three times with one voice proclaimed: "We shall carry out all that the World-Honored One has commanded. Yes, World-Honored One, may you have no concern."

Then Śākyamuni Buddha caused the buddhas who were his emanations and had come from the ten directions each to return to their original lands, saying: "May each buddha proceed according to his ease. The stūpa of Many Jewels Buddha may also return to its former state." When he spoke these words, the immeasurable emanation buddhas from the ten directions who were seated upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees, as well as Many Jewels Buddha, and the boundless and asaṃkhyeya great assembly of bodhisattvas such as Superior Conduct, as well as Śāriputra and others of the śrāvaka assembly and the fourfold congregation, together with all the worlds—the gods, humans, asuras, and others—hearing what the Buddha had said, all rejoiced greatly.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Chapter Twenty-Three: The Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King

At that time, the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, how does the Bodhisattva Medicine King travel throughout the sahā world? World-Honored One, this Bodhisattva Medicine King has undergone countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of difficult practices and ascetic disciplines. Excellent, World-Honored One! We pray that you will expound this matter briefly." All the devas, nāgas, spirits, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, beings human and nonhuman, as well as bodhisattvas who had come from other lands, and the assembly of śrāvakas present—all rejoiced to hear this.

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower: "In ages past, immeasurable Ganges sand kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Tathāgata, One Worthy of Offerings, One of Right and Universal Knowledge, One Perfect in Clarity and Conduct, Well Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. That Buddha had eight billion great bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and seventy-two Ganges sands of great śrāvaka disciples. The Buddha's lifespan was forty-two thousand kalpas, and the bodhisattvas' lifespans were equal to that. In that land there were no women, no hells, no hungry ghosts, no animals, no asuras, and none of the various difficulties. The ground was level as a palm, composed of lapis lazuli. Jeweled trees adorned it; jeweled canopies covered it from above; jeweled banners and streamers hung down; jeweled vessels and incense burners filled the entire realm. There were platforms of seven jewels—one tree, one platform—and each tree was the distance of an arrow's flight from its platform. Beneath all these jeweled trees sat bodhisattvas and śrāvakas. Upon each of the jeweled platforms, ten billion devas played celestial music, singing hymns to the Buddha as an offering."

"At that time, that Buddha expounded the Lotus Sutra for the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana, for the assembly of bodhisattvas, and for the śrāvaka disciples. This Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana delighted in practicing ascetic disciplines. Within the Dharma of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, he practiced vigorously, single-mindedly seeking buddhahood. After twelve thousand years had passed, he attained the samādhi of the manifestation of all physical forms. Having attained this samādhi, his heart was greatly joyful, and he immediately thought: 'My attainment of the samādhi of the manifestation of all physical forms has come entirely through the power of hearing the Lotus Sutra. I must now make offerings to Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha and to the Lotus Sutra.' He then entered into this samādhi, and in the空中, he caused mandārava flowers and mahā-mandārava flowers to rain down, along with finely powdered solid black sandalwood, filling the空 and descending like clouds. Moreover, he caused sandalwood from the shores of the sea to rain down—this incense, worth six śu, had the value of an entire sahā world—all as an offering to the Buddha."

"After making this offering, he arose from samādhi and thought to himself: 'Though I have made offerings to the Buddha through supernatural powers, this does not compare to making an offering with my body.' He then ingested various fragrances—sandalwood, frankincense, turushka, pṛkkā, aloeswood, and resin incense—and drank the fragrant oils of campaka and other flowers. After twelve hundred years had passed, he anointed his body with fragrant oils, and in the presence of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, wrapped himself in celestial jeweled garments, poured fragrant oils over himself, and through the power of his supernatural vows, set his own body aflame. The radiance illuminated eighty koṭis of Ganges sand worlds. Within those worlds, all the buddhas simultaneously praised him, saying: 'Excellent, excellent, good man! This is true vigor; this is called the true Dharma offering to the Tathāgata. Though one may make offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, burning incense, powdered incense, paste incense, celestial silks, banners, canopies, and sandalwood from the shores of the sea—all such various things as offerings—none can equal this. Even should one give in charity one's kingdom, cities, wife, and children, still it cannot compare. Good man, this is called the foremost gift, the most honored and supreme among all gifts, for it is a Dharma offering to all the tathāgatas.' Having spoken thus, each fell silent. His body burned with flames for twelve hundred years. After that time had passed, his body was completely consumed. After the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana had made this Dharma offering, his life ended, and he was reborn in the land of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, spontaneously appearing in the household of King Pure Virtue, seated in full lotus posture, suddenly manifesting by transformation. Immediately he spoke a verse for his father:

Great king, you should know this now:
While I practiced walking there,
I straightaway attained the samādhi
Of manifesting all physical forms.

I practiced great vigorous effort,
Abandoned my beloved body,
Made offering to the World-Honored One,
Seeking the supreme wisdom.

"After speaking this verse, he addressed his father: 'Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha still abides in the world at present. Previously, after making offerings to that Buddha, I obtained the dhāraṇī of understanding the languages of all living beings. Moreover, I have heard this Lotus Sutra—eight hundred thousand myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kiṃkaras, viṃvaras, and aupāśas of verses. Great king, I must now return to make offerings to that Buddha.' Having spoken thus, he sat upon a platform of seven jewels, ascended into the空中 to a height of seven tāla trees, went to where the Buddha was, bowed his head to the Buddha's feet, joined his ten fingernails together, and praised the Buddha in verse:

Your countenance is most wondrous and sublime,
Your radiance illuminates the ten directions;
I but recently made offerings to you,
And now I have returned to behold you again.

"At that time, the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana, having spoken this verse, addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the World-Honored One still abides in the world.' Then Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana: 'Good man, the time of my nirvāṇa has arrived; the time of extinction is at hand. You may arrange the bed and seat; tonight I shall enter nirvāṇa.' He further commanded the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana: 'Good man, I entrust to you the Buddha Dharma, as well as all the bodhisattvas and great disciples, together with the Dharma of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. I also entrust to you the great trichiliocosm of seven-jeweled worlds, the jeweled trees, jeweled platforms, and the devas in attendance. After my extinction, my śarīra relics I also entrust to you. You must cause them to be distributed and widely venerated. You should erect many thousands of stūpas.' Having thus commanded the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana, Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha entered nirvāṇa in the latter part of that night."

"At that time, the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana, seeing the Buddha's extinction, felt grief, anguish, and longing for the Buddha. He then used sandalwood from the shores of the sea as fuel for the pyre, made offerings to the Buddha's body, and cremated it. After the fire had died out, he gathered the śarīra relics, made eighty-four thousand jeweled vessels, and erected eighty-four thousand stūpas as tall as three worlds, adorned with towering banners and canopies, and hung with numerous jeweled bells."

"At that time, the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana again thought to himself: 'Though I have made these offerings, my heart is still not satisfied. I must now make further offerings to the śarīra relics.' He then addressed the bodhisattvas, great disciples, as well as the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, and the entire great assembly: 'You should all concentrate your minds. I shall now make offerings to the śarīra relics of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha.' Having spoken thus, he immediately burned his arms adorned with a hundred merits before the eighty-four thousand stūpas for seventy-two thousand years as an offering. This caused innumerable persons seeking the śrāvaka path and immeasurable asaṃkhyeyas of people to generate the mind of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, and all were enabled to abide in the samādhi of the manifestation of all physical forms."

"At that time, the bodhisattvas, devas, humans, asuras, and others, seeing him without arms, became distressed, sorrowful, and grieving, and spoke thus: 'This Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana is our teacher, the one who instructs us, yet now he has burned his arms and his body is incomplete.' At that moment, the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana made this vow before the great assembly: 'Having sacrificed both my arms, I shall certainly attain the Buddha's golden-hued body. If this is truly not false, may my two arms be restored as before.' Having made this vow, they were naturally restored, due to the pure and deep merit, virtue, and wisdom of that bodhisattva. At that time, the great trichiliocosm quaked in six ways, and heaven rained jeweled flowers. All humans and devas experienced what they had never experienced before."

The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower: "What is your opinion? Was the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana some other person? He is none other than the present Bodhisattva Medicine King. The number of times he has sacrificed his body in charity is thus immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas. Constellation King Flower, if there are those who have generated the aspiration to attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi and are able to burn a finger or even a single toe as an offering to a buddha stūpa, this surpasses offering one's kingdom, cities, wife, and children, as well as all the mountains, forests, rivers, ponds, and precious treasures of the great trichiliocosm. Moreover, if someone fills the great trichiliocosm with the seven jewels and makes offerings to the Buddha, to the great bodhisattvas, to the pratyekabuddhas, and to the arhats, the merit that person obtains does not compare to accepting and upholding this Lotus Sutra, even a single four-line verse of it; that merit is greatest of all."

"Constellation King Flower, just as among all streams, rivers, and waters, the ocean is foremost, so too is this Lotus Sutra the most profound and great among all the sutras expounded by the tathāgatas. Just as among all mountains—earth mountains, black mountains, the small Iron Ring Mountains, the great Iron Ring Mountains, and the ten jeweled mountains—Mount Sumeru is foremost, so too is this Lotus Sutra supreme among all sutras. Just as among all the stars, the moon deity is foremost, so too is this Lotus Sutra the most illuminating among thousands of myriads of koṭis of kinds of sutra dharmas. Just as the sun deity can dispel all darkness, so too can this sutra destroy all darkness of unwholesomeness. Just as among all lesser kings, the wheel-turning sage king is foremost, so too is this sutra the most honored among all sutras. Just as Śakra is king among the thirty-three devas, so too is this sutra king among all sutras. Just as the great Brahmā king is father of all living beings, so too is this sutra father of all worthies and sages, learners and non-learners, and those who have generated the bodhisattva mind. Just as among all ordinary persons, the stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, arhat, and pratyekabuddha are foremost, so too is this sutra foremost among all sutras expounded by tathāgatas, bodhisattvas, or śrāvakas. One who is able to accept and uphold this scripture is likewise foremost among all living beings. Among all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, the bodhisattva is foremost; so too is this sutra foremost among all sutra dharmas. Just as the Buddha is king of all dharmas, so too is this sutra king among all sutras."

"Constellation King Flower, this sutra can save all living beings; this sutra can enable all living beings to separate from all sufferings and distress; this sutra can greatly benefit all living beings and fulfill their wishes. Like a cool pond that can satisfy all who are thirsty and parched; like one who is cold obtaining fire; like one who is naked obtaining clothing; like a merchant obtaining a leader; like a child obtaining its mother; like one who would cross over obtaining a boat; like one who is ill obtaining a physician; like one in darkness obtaining a lamp; like one who is poor obtaining treasure; like the people obtaining a king; like a merchant obtaining the sea; like a torch dispelling darkness—so too is this Lotus Sutra able to enable living beings to separate from all suffering and all illness, able to release all the bonds of birth and death. If a person hears this Lotus Sutra and either copies it himself or causes others to copy it, the merit obtained—even were one to measure it with the Buddha's wisdom—could not reach its limit. If one copies this sutra and makes offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, burning incense, powdered incense, paste incense, banners, canopies, garments, and various kinds of lamps—ghee lamps, oil lamps, lamps of various fragrant oils, campaka oil lamps, sumanas oil lamps, pāṭala oil lamps, vārṣika oil lamps, and navamallikā oil lamps—the merit obtained is likewise immeasurable."

"Constellation King Flower, if anyone hears this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King, that person also obtains immeasurable and boundless merit. If any woman hears this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King and is able to accept and uphold it, this shall be the end of her female body, and she shall not receive it again. If, after the extinction of the Tathāgata, in the latter five hundred years, any woman hears this scripture and practices according to its teachings, when her life ends she shall immediately proceed to the Land of Peace and Bliss, where Amitābha Buddha and the assembly of great bodhisattvas dwell, and be born within a lotus flower upon a jeweled throne. She shall no longer be tormented by desire, nor shall she be tormented by anger or delusion, nor shall she be tormented by arrogance, jealousy, or other defilements. She shall obtain the bodhisattva's supernatural powers and the tolerance of the non-arising of dharmas. Having obtained this tolerance, her eye faculty shall become pure. With this pure eye faculty, she shall see seven million two hundred thousand koṭis of nayutas of Ganges sand tathāgatas. At that time, those buddhas shall praise her from afar, saying: 'Excellent, excellent, good man! You have been able to accept, uphold, read, recite, and contemplate this sutra within the Dharma of Śākyamuni Buddha, and expound it for others. The merit you have obtained is immeasurable and boundless. Fire cannot burn it; water cannot sweep it away. Your merit is such that even a thousand buddhas speaking together could not exhaust it. You have now been able to destroy all demonic adversaries and to demolish the army of birth and death; all other enemies have been entirely vanquished. Good man, hundreds of thousands of buddhas, by their supernatural powers, protect you together. Among all in the worlds of devas and humans, there is none like you, except only the Tathāgata. As for the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and even bodhisattvas, in wisdom and meditative concentration, none are equal to you.' Constellation King Flower, this bodhisattva achieves such power of merit, virtue, and wisdom."

"If anyone hears this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King and is able to rejoice and praise it, in the present world that person's mouth shall constantly emit the fragrance of blue lotus flowers, and from the pores of that person's body shall constantly issue the fragrance of ox-head sandalwood. The merit obtained is as described above. Therefore, Constellation King Flower, I entrust this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King to you. After my extinction, in the latter five hundred years, widely proclaim and propagate it throughout Jambudvīpa. Do not allow it to be cut off, lest evil demons, demonic people, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, kumbhāṇḍas, and others gain advantage."

"Constellation King Flower, you must use your supernatural powers to protect this sutra. Why is this so? This sutra is the excellent medicine for the illnesses of the people of Jambudvīpa. If a person is ill and hears this sutra, the illness shall immediately be eliminated, and that person shall not grow old or die. Constellation King Flower, if you see someone who accepts and upholds this sutra, you should take blue lotus flowers filled with powdered incense and scatter them over that person. After scattering them, think thus: 'Before long, this person shall certainly take up grass, sit upon the place of enlightenment, defeat the demonic armies, sound the Dharma conch, strike the great Dharma drum, and ferry all living beings across the sea of old age, sickness, and death.' Therefore, those who seek the Buddha path, upon seeing a person who accepts and upholds this scripture, should thus generate a mind of reverence."

When this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King was expounded, eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas obtained the dhāraṇī of understanding the languages of all living beings. The Tathāgata Many Jewels, from within the jeweled stūpa, praised the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower, saying: "Excellent, excellent, Constellation King Flower! You have achieved inconceivable merit and virtue in being able to question Śākyamuni Buddha about such matters, thereby benefiting immeasurable multitudes of living beings."

Chapter Twenty-Four: The Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha emitted great light from the mark of the fleshy protuberance upon his head, one of the thirty-two major characteristics, and also emitted light from the white tuft between his eyebrows, illuminating throughout the eastern direction one hundred eighty myriads of koṭīs of nayutas of Ganges' sands of buddha-worlds. Beyond this number, there was a world named Pure Light Adorned. In that land there was a buddha named Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Thus Come One, Worthy of Offerings, One of Right and Universal Knowledge, One Perfected in Clarity and Conduct, Well Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Heavenly and Human Beings, Buddha, World-Honored One, who was expounding the Dharma, reverently surrounded by immeasurable and boundless assemblies of bodhisattvas and great multitudes. The white tuft light of Śākyamuni Buddha illuminated throughout that land.

At that time, in the land of Pure Light Adorned, there was a bodhisattva named Wonderful Sound who had long since planted the roots of manifold virtue, made offerings to and drawn near to immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭīs of buddhas, and had fully perfected exceedingly profound wisdom. He had attained the Wonderful Banner Characteristic Samādhi, the Dharma Flower Samādhi, the Pure Virtue Samādhi, the Constellation King Sport Samādhi, the Samādhi Without Conditions, the Wisdom Seal Samādhi, the Samādhi of Understanding All Sentient Beings' Languages, the Samādhi of Assembling All Merit, the Pure Samādhi, the Samādhi of Supernatural Powers' Sport, the Wisdom Torch Samādhi, the King of Adornment Samādhi, the Pure Light Samādhi, the Pure Treasury Samādhi, the Unshared Samādhi, the Sun Rotation Samādhi—he had attained such great samādhis as these, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭīs of Ganges' sands in number. When the light of Śākyamuni Buddha illuminated his body, he forthwith addressed Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I should go to the Sahā world to pay reverence, draw near, and make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha, and also to see Mañjuśrī, Dharma Prince and Son of the Dharma King, the Bodhisattva Medicine King, the Bodhisattva Brave Donation, the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower, the Bodhisattva Superior Conduct and Intent, the Bodhisattva King of Adornment, and the Bodhisattva Superior Medicine."

At that time, Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha spoke to the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound: "You must not slight that land or give rise to thoughts of inferiority. Good man, that Sahā world is uneven and irregular, with earth, stones, and various mountains; it is filled with filth and evil. The Buddha's body is diminutive, and the assembly of bodhisattvas likewise has small forms. Yet your body measures forty-two thousand yojanas in height, while my body measures six million eight hundred thousand yojanas. Your body is supremely handsome, having hundreds of thousands of myriads of blessings, and your radiance is especially wondrous. Therefore, when you go there, you must not slight that land—whether buddha, bodhisattvas, or the land itself—do not give rise to thoughts of inferiority." The Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound addressed his buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, that I now go to the Sahā world is entirely due to the Thus Come One's power, the Thus Come One's supernatural powers' sport, and the Thus Come One's merit, wisdom, and adornment." Thereupon, the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound, without rising from his seat and without his body stirring, entered into samādhi. Through the power of samādhi, at Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain, not far from the Dharma seat, he magically created eighty-four thousand jeweled lotus flowers with stems of Jambūnada gold, leaves of silver, pistils of diamond, and platforms of mahāmaṇi-ratna jewels.

At that time, Mañjuśrī, Dharma Prince and Son of the Dharma King, seeing these lotus flowers, addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, what causes and conditions have brought about this auspicious portent? There are several thousands of myriads of lotus flowers with stems of Jambūnada gold, leaves of silver, pistils of diamond, and platforms of mahāmaṇi-ratna jewels." At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha told Mañjuśrī: "It is the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound who, together with eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas surrounding him, desires to come from the land of Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha to this Sahā world to make offerings, draw near, and pay reverence to me, and also desires to make offerings and hear the Dharma Flower Sutra."

Mañjuśrī addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, what good roots has this bodhisattva planted? What merit has he cultivated to possess such great supernatural powers? What samādhi does he practice? I pray that you will expound for us the name of this samādhi. We also wish to diligently cultivate and practice it. Practicing this samādhi, we shall be able to see this bodhisattva's physical characteristics, his size, his majestic deportment, and his comings and goings. I only pray that the World-Honored One, through supernatural powers, will cause that bodhisattva to come so that we may see him." At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha told Mañjuśrī: "This Tathāgata Many Jewels, who long ago entered extinction, shall manifest his form for you."

At that time, Many Jewels Buddha spoke to that bodhisattva: "Good man, come. Mañjuśrī, Dharma Prince and Son of the Dharma King, desires to see your body." Thereupon, the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound vanished from that land and, together with eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas, set forth to come here. In all the lands through which they passed, there were the six kinds of earthquakes, and jeweled lotus flowers of the seven treasures rained down everywhere; hundreds of thousands of heavenly musical instruments sounded without being struck. The eyes of this bodhisattva were like broad and great blue lotus petals; even if one were to combine the faces of hundreds of thousands of myriads of moons, his countenance was still more handsome than these. His body was the color of true gold, adorned with immeasurable hundreds of thousands of meritorious attributes. His威德 was blazing with intensity, his radiance illuminating all around. He possessed all the bodily characteristics perfectly, like Nārāyaṇa's firm and solid body. He entered a platform of the seven jewels and ascended into the sky to a height of seven tāla trees. Surrounded reverently by the assembly of bodhisattvas, he came to this Sahā world, to Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain.

Having arrived, he descended from the platform of the seven jewels, took a necklace worth hundreds of thousands, brought it before Śākyamuni Buddha, touched his head to the Buddha's feet in reverence, presented the necklace as an offering, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha inquires of the World-Honored One: Are you free from illness and affliction? Are your daily activities light and comfortable? Are you dwelling in peace and happiness? Are the four elements in harmony? Are worldly matters bearable? Are sentient beings easy to save? Do they not have excessive greed, hatred, delusion, jealousy, and arrogant pride? Do they not show disrespect to father and mother or fail to honor śramaṇas? Do they not hold wrong views, unwholesome thoughts, or fail to control the five sense faculties? World-Honored One, are sentient beings able to subdue the enmity of all māras? Has the Tathāgata Many Jewels, who long ago entered extinction, come in his seven-jeweled stūpa to hear the Dharma? He also inquires of the Tathāgata Many Jewels: Is he dwelling peacefully with few afflictions? Can he patiently endure to abide for long? World-Honored One, I now wish to see the body of Many Jewels Buddha. I only pray that the World-Honored One will show him to me so that I may see him."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha spoke to Many Jewels Buddha: "This Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound desires to see you." At that time, Many Jewels Buddha told Wonderful Sound: "Excellent, excellent! You have been able to come here for the sake of making offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha, hearing the Dharma Flower Sutra, and seeing Mañjuśrī and others."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, what good roots has this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound planted? What merit has he cultivated to possess such supernatural powers?" The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue: "In the past there was a buddha named Cloud Thunder Sound King Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-Saṃbuddha. His land was named Manifesting All Worlds. The kalpa was named Joyfully Seen. The Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound, for twelve thousand years, used one hundred thousand kinds of musical performances to make offerings to Cloud Thunder Sound King Buddha, and also presented eighty-four thousand bowls of the seven jewels. As a consequence of these causes and conditions and their karmic rewards, he was now born in the land of Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha and possesses these supernatural powers. Flower Virtue, what do you think? Was the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound who, at that time in the presence of Cloud Thunder Sound King Buddha, made offerings with musical performances and presented jeweled vessels anyone else? It is this present Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound. Flower Virtue, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound has already made offerings to and drawn near to immeasurable buddhas, long ago planted the roots of virtue, and has also encountered hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭīs of nayutas of buddhas equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River."

"Flower Virtue, you merely see the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound with his body present here, yet this bodhisattva manifests various bodies everywhere, expounding this sutra for assemblies of sentient beings. Sometimes he manifests the body of King Brahmā, sometimes the body of Śakra, sometimes the body of the Īśvara deity, sometimes the body of Maheśvara deity, sometimes the body of a great heavenly general, sometimes the body of Vaiśravaṇa Heavenly King, sometimes the body of a wheel-turning sage king, sometimes the bodies of lesser kings, sometimes the body of an elder, sometimes the body of a householder, sometimes the body of a government minister, sometimes the body of a brāhmaṇa, sometimes the bodies of a bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī, upāsaka, or upāsikā, sometimes the body of the wife of an elder or householder, sometimes the body of the wife of a government minister, sometimes the body of the wife of a brāhmaṇa, sometimes the bodies of boys or girls, sometimes the bodies of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and so forth, and expounds this sutra. All those in hells, among hungry ghosts, among animals, and in places of difficulty—he is able to rescue them all. Even in the inner palaces of kings, he transforms into a woman's body and expounds this sutra."

"Flower Virtue, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound is able to rescue and protect the sentient beings of the Sahā world. This Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound manifests transformations of various bodies in this manner throughout the Sahā land, expounding this sutra for assemblies of sentient beings, yet his supernatural powers, transformations, and wisdom suffer no diminishment whatsoever. Through his various kinds of wisdom, this bodhisattva illuminates the Sahā world, causing all sentient beings each to attain what they need to know. And in the worlds throughout the ten directions, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, he likewise does the same. If one should be saved by the form of a śrāvaka, he manifests a śrāvaka's form and expounds the Dharma for them. If one should be saved by the form of a pratyekabuddha, he manifests a pratyekabuddha's form and expounds the Dharma for them. If one should be saved by the form of a bodhisattva, he manifests a bodhisattva's form and expounds the Dharma for them. If one should be saved by the form of a buddha, he immediately manifests a buddha's form and expounds the Dharma for them. In this manner, he variously manifests whatever form is appropriate for saving beings. Even for those who should be saved through extinction, he demonstrates extinction. Flower Virtue, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound has accomplished the power of great supernatural penetrations and wisdom. His deeds are such as these."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound has deeply planted good roots. World-Honored One, in what samādhi does this bodhisattva dwell such that he is able to manifest transformations everywhere in this manner and save sentient beings?" The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue: "Good man, that samādhi is named the Manifestation of All Physical Bodies. The Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound, dwelling in this samādhi, is able to benefit immeasurable multitudes of sentient beings in this manner." When this chapter on the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound was expounded, the eighty-four thousand persons who had come together with the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound all attained the Samādhi of Manifesting All Physical Bodies. The immeasurable bodhisattvas in this Sahā world also attained this samādhi and the dhāraṇīs.

At that time, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound, having made offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha and the stūpa of Many Jewels Buddha, returned to his original land. In all the lands through which he passed, there were the six kinds of earthquakes, jeweled lotus flowers rained down, and hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭīs of varieties of musical performances were played. Upon arriving at his original land, together with the eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas surrounding him, he went before Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I went to the Sahā world and benefited sentient beings. I saw Śākyamuni Buddha and saw the stūpa of Many Jewels Buddha, paid reverence and made offerings. I also saw Mañjuśrī, Dharma Prince and Son of the Dharma King, as well as the Bodhisattva Medicine King, the Bodhisattva Attained Through Diligent Vigorous Effort, the Bodhisattva Brave Donation, and others. I also caused these eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas to attain the Samādhi of Manifesting All Physical Bodies." When this chapter on the comings and goings of the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound was expounded, forty-two thousand sons of heaven attained the Patience of the Non-Arising of Dharmas, and the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue attained the Dharma Flower Samādhi.

Chapter Twenty-Five: The Universal Gateway of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara

At that time, the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati immediately rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, joined his palms toward the Buddha, and spoke these words: "World-Honored One, for what cause and condition is the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara called Avalokiteśvara?"

The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati: "Good son, if there are immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of sentient beings who are suffering various afflictions, and they hear of this Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and single-mindedly call upon his name, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will immediately perceive the sounds of their voices, and they shall all attain deliverance. If there are those who uphold the name of this Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, should they enter into a great fire, the fire will be unable to burn them, by virtue of the majestic spiritual power of this bodhisattva. If they are being swept away by great waters and call upon his name, they will immediately reach the shallows. If there are hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of sentient beings who, seeking for gold, silver, lapis lazuli, giant clam shell, carnelian, coral, amber, pearls, and other treasures, enter upon the great ocean, and even if a black wind should blow their ships and boats, casting them adrift into the lands of the rākṣasa demons—if among them there is even one person who calls upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, all those people shall attain deliverance from the difficulties posed by the rākṣasas. For this cause and condition, he is called Avalokiteśvara."

"If again there are persons who are about to be harmed and they call upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, the swords and staves that their assailants hold will immediately break into pieces, and they shall attain deliverance. If the lands of a great trichiliocosm were filled with yakṣas and rākṣasas who wished to come and torment people, should these people hear them calling upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, these evil demons would not even be able to look upon them with evil eyes, much less cause them harm. If again there are persons, whether guilty or innocent, whose bodies are fettered with stocks, chains, manacles, and bonds, and they call upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, all these restraints shall be severed and broken, and they will immediately attain deliverance. If the lands of a great trichiliocosm were filled with adversaries and bandits, and there was a merchant leader guiding a caravan of merchants, carrying precious treasures and passing through dangerous roads, and if among them one person spoke these words of proclamation: 'Good sons, do not be fearful. You should all single-mindedly call upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. This bodhisattva is able to bestow fearlessness upon sentient beings. If you call upon his name, you shall attain deliverance from these adversaries and bandits.' When the merchants heard this, they raised their voices together, saying: 'Homage to the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara!' Because they called upon his name, they immediately attained deliverance."

"Akṣayamati, the majestic spiritual power of the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is sublime and exalted in this manner. If there are sentient beings who are given to excessive sensual desire, and they constantly recollect and venerate the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with reverence, they will attain freedom from desire. If they are given to excessive anger, and they constantly recollect and venerate the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with reverence, they will attain freedom from anger. If they are given to excessive folly, and they constantly recollect and venerate the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with reverence, they will attain freedom from folly. Akṣayamati, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara possesses such great majestic spiritual power and bestows abundant benefit; therefore, sentient beings should constantly bear him in mind. If there is a woman who wishes to seek a male child, and she worships and makes offerings to the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, she will give birth to a son endowed with merit, virtue, and wisdom. If she wishes to seek a female child, she will give birth to a daughter of upright appearance and auspicious features, one who has planted roots of virtue in past lives and is beloved and respected by all people. Akṣayamati, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara possesses such power. If there are sentient beings who venerate and worship the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with reverence, their merit will not be expended in vain. Therefore, all sentient beings should uphold the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara."

"Akṣayamati, if there is a person who upholds the names of bodhisattvas numbering as many as sixty-two koṭis of Ganges sands, and furthermore exhausts his bodily form in making offerings of food and drink, clothing, bedding, and medicine—what is your opinion? Would the merit and virtue of this good son or good daughter be abundant or not?"

Akṣayamati said: "Extremely abundant, World-Honored One."

The Buddha said: "If again there is a person who upholds the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, and even for but a single moment worships and makes offerings, the merit of these two persons is precisely equal without difference, and cannot be exhausted throughout hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas. Akṣayamati, upholding the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara brings the benefits of such immeasurable and boundless merit and virtue."

The Bodhisattva Akṣayamati addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, how does the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara travel throughout this sahā world? How does he expound the Dharma for sentient beings? What is the nature of his skillful means and power?"

The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati: "Good son, if there are sentient beings in any land who should be saved by means of a buddha body, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara immediately manifests a buddha body and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of a pratyekabuddha body, he immediately manifests a pratyekabuddha body and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of a śrāvaka body, he immediately manifests a śrāvaka body and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of Brahmā, the king of gods, he immediately manifests the body of Brahmā and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of Śakra, he immediately manifests the body of Śakra and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of the Īśvara deity, he immediately manifests the body of the Īśvara deity and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of the Maheśvara deity, he immediately manifests the body of the Maheśvara deity and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a great heavenly general, he immediately manifests the body of a great heavenly general and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of Vaiśravaṇa, he immediately manifests the body of Vaiśravaṇa and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a minor king, he immediately manifests the body of a minor king and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of an elder, he immediately manifests the body of an elder and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a householder, he immediately manifests the body of a householder and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a chief minister, he immediately manifests the body of a chief minister and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a brahman, he immediately manifests the body of a brahman and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the bodies of a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman, he immediately manifests the bodies of a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of the wife of an elder, householder, chief minister, or brahman, he immediately manifests a female body and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a boy or girl, he immediately manifests the body of a boy or girl and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the bodies of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and so forth, he immediately manifests all of them and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a vajra-bearing spirit, he immediately manifests the body of a vajra-bearing spirit and expounds the Dharma for them."

"Akṣayamati, this Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara has accomplished such meritorious virtues, and with various forms travels throughout the lands of all directions, delivering sentient beings. Therefore, you should all single-mindedly make offerings to the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. This Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is able to bestow fearlessness in the midst of terrifying and urgent difficulties. For this reason, all in this sahā world call him the Bestower of Fearlessness."

The Bodhisattva Akṣayamati addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I shall now make an offering to the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara." He then removed from his neck a necklace of precious jeweled beads valued at hundreds of thousands of taels of gold, and presented it to him, saying: "Venerable One, receive this gift of Dharma, this precious jeweled necklace." At that time, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara was unwilling to accept it. Akṣayamati again addressed the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, saying: "Venerable One, out of compassion for us, receive this necklace."

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara: "Out of compassion for this Bodhisattva Akṣayamati and the fourfold assembly—the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and so forth—receive this necklace."

Immediately the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, out of compassion for the fourfold assembly and for the devas, nāgas, humans, non-humans, and so forth, received the necklace and divided it into two portions. One portion he offered to Śākyamuni Buddha, and one portion he offered to the stūpa of the Buddha Many Jewels. "Akṣayamati, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara possesses such sovereign spiritual power in traveling throughout the sahā world."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati posed this question in verse:

     World-Honored One, replete with wondrous features,
     I now ask again of him:
     For what cause and condition
     Is the son of the Buddha called Avalokiteśvara?

The Honored One, replete with wondrous features, answered Akṣayamati in verse:

     Hear now of Avalokiteśvara's conduct,
     How skillfully he responds in all quarters.
     His vast vow is deep as the ocean;
     Throughout kalpas inconceivable, he has
     Attended upon many thousands of koṭis of buddhas,
     And has made great pure vows.

     I shall explain to you in brief:
     Hearing his name and seeing his body,
     Bearing him in mind does not pass in vain,
     For he can extinguish the sufferings of all forms of existence.

     Even if someone with harmful intent
     Should push you into a great pit of fire,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     The pit of fire will transform into a pool.

     Or if you are drifting on the vast ocean,
     With dangers from dragons, fish, and demons,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     The waves will be unable to drown you.

     Or if from the peak of Mount Sumeru
     Someone should push you down,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     You will abide in space like the sun.

     Or if you are pursued by evil persons
     And fall from Diamond Mountain,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     Not a single hair will be harmed.

     Or if you encounter hostile bandits surrounding you,
     Each wielding swords to cause harm,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     All will immediately give rise to compassionate minds.

     Or if you suffer the distress of royal punishment,
     Your life about to end at the execution ground,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     The swords will immediately break into pieces.

     Or if you are imprisoned in cangue and chains,
     Your hands and feet bound in fetters,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     You will be freely released and attain deliverance.

     When mantras, curses, and various poisons
     Are intended to harm your body,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     They will return to afflict the original person.

     Or if you encounter evil rākṣasas,
     Poisonous dragons, demons, and the like,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     At that time none will dare to harm you.

     If you are surrounded by fierce beasts
     With sharp fangs and claws, dreadful to behold,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     They will swiftly flee to the boundless distance.

     When venomous serpents and vipers,
     Their poisonous breath blazing like smoke and fire,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     Will turn back at the sound of his name.

     When clouds thunder with rolling drums and flashing lightning,
     Hail falling and great rains pouring down,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     These will instantly be dispersed and dissipated.

     When sentient beings are oppressed by distress,
     Immeasurable sufferings pressing upon their bodies,
     The power of Avalokiteśvara's wondrous wisdom
     Can rescue the suffering of the world.

     Replete with the power of supernatural penetrations,
     Extensively cultivating wisdom and skillful means,
     In the lands of the ten directions,
     There is no realm where he does not manifest his body.

     The various evil destinies—
     The hells, the realms of hungry ghosts and animals,
     The sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death—
     He gradually causes all to be extinguished.

     True perception, pure perception,
     Perception of vast and great wisdom,
     Perception of compassion and perception of kindness—
     May we constantly vow to venerate and behold them.

     Stainless and pure radiance,
     The sun of wisdom that breaks through all darkness,
     Able to subdue the winds and fires of calamity,
     Universally illuminating the world with brightness.

     The precepts embodying compassion shake like thunder;
     The mind of kindness, a wondrous great cloud,
     Raining down the sweet dew of Dharma rain,
     Extinguishing the flames of afflictions.

     In disputes passing through the courts,
     Or in the terror of battle arrays,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     All enemies will completely withdraw and scatter.

     Wondrous Voice, Avalokiteśvara,
     Voice of Brahmā, Voice of the Ocean Tide,
     Surpassing all worldly voices—
     Therefore one must constantly be mindful of him.

     Moment by moment, give rise to no doubt.
     Avalokiteśvara, pure and sagely,
     In the distress of suffering and the peril of death,
     Is able to serve as a refuge and protection.

     Replete with all meritorious virtues,
     With compassionate eyes beholding sentient beings,
     His accumulation of merit is an immeasurable ocean.
     Therefore, one should bow in reverence to him.

At that time, the Bodhisattva Dharaṇīṃdhara immediately rose from his seat, came forward, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, if there are sentient beings who hear this chapter on the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara—of his sovereign works, his universal gateway manifestations, and his powers of supernatural penetration—it should be known that the merit and virtue of such persons is not small."

When the Buddha expounded this Universal Gateway chapter, eighty-four thousand sentient beings in the assembly all generated the mind set upon anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, the unsurpassed, equal, and perfect enlightenment.

Chapter Twenty-Six: Dhāraṇīs

At that time, Medicine King Bodhisattva immediately arose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, joined his palms toward the Buddha, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, if good men and good women are able to receive and uphold the Lotus Sutra, whether they recite it until they have mastered it, or whether they copy the sūtra scrolls, what measure of merit will they obtain?" The Buddha said to Medicine King: "If there are good men and good women who make offerings to eight hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges sands' worth of buddhas, what is your opinion? Would the merit they obtain be much or not?" "Very much, World-Honored One." The Buddha said: "If good men and good women are able to receive and uphold even a single four-line verse of this sūtra, recite it, understand its meaning, and practice in accordance with what it teaches, their merit will be exceedingly abundant." At that time, Medicine King Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I shall now bestow upon the preachers of the Dharma a dhāraṇī incantation to protect them." Then he spoke the incantation, saying:

an'er man'er moni momanei zhili zhelidei sha□ shalitawei shandi mudi mutuoli suoli aweisafu sangli suoli chaye achaye ajini shandi shalai tuolani alujiaposasuozhe pishani nipiti abiantaoluolieti adantapoluishudie oujuoli moujuoli aluoli poluoli shoujiecha asanmosuanli fotuopijili□di damopolichadei sengqieniejushani posheposhashudi mantaoluao mantaoluochayetuo youloutuao youloutuo jiaoshelüe echachaluao echachaluoyetuoyeo apolu amoruonatuoya

"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī divine incantation has been spoken by sixty-two koṭis of Ganges sands' worth of buddhas. If anyone violates or harms this Dharma teacher, then he violates and harms all these buddhas."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha praised Medicine King Bodhisattva, saying: "Excellent, excellent, Medicine King! Out of compassion, you protect this Dharma teacher and speak this dhāraṇī. It will bring abundant benefit to the multitude of living beings."

At that time, Brave Donor Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I too, for the sake of protecting those who recite, receive, and uphold the Lotus Sutra, shall speak a dhāraṇī. If this Dharma teacher obtains this dhāraṇī, then whether yakṣas, or rākṣasas, or pūtanas, or kṛtyas, or kumbhāṇḍas, or hungry ghosts, or the like seek to find his faults, they will be unable to gain any advantage." Then, in the Buddha's presence, he spoke the incantation, saying:

zhuoli moheizhuoli yuzhi muzhi ali aluopodi nielidi nieliduopodi yizhinei weizhinei zhizhinei nielichi nei nielichi podi

"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī divine incantation has been spoken by Ganges sands' worth of buddhas, and all rejoice in it. If anyone violates or harms this Dharma teacher, then he violates and harms all these buddhas."

At that time, Vaiśravaṇa Heavenly King, protector of the world, addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I too, out of compassion for living beings and for the sake of protecting this Dharma teacher, speak this dhāraṇī." Then he spoke the incantation, saying:

ali nali □nali analü nali junaofu

"World-Honored One, with this divine incantation I protect the Dharma teacher. I myself shall also protect those who uphold this sūtra, so that within a hundred yojanas they will have no decline or suffering."

At that time, Dhṛtarāṣṭra Heavenly King was present in this assembly, together with thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of gandharvas respectfully surrounding him. He proceeded to the place where the Buddha was, joined his palms, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I too, with the divine incantation of the dhāraṇī, shall protect those who uphold the Lotus Sutra." Then he spoke the incantation, saying:

aganei ganei quli qiantuli zhantuli modengqi changqiuli fuloushani edi

"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī divine incantation has been spoken by forty-two koṭis of buddhas. If anyone violates or harms this Dharma teacher, then he violates and harms all these buddhas."

At that time there were rākṣasī demonesses and others—the first named Lambā, the second named Vilambā, the third named Crooked Teeth, the fourth named Flower Teeth, the fifth named Black Teeth, the sixth named Much Hair, the seventh named Insatiable, the eighth named Necklace Holder, the ninth named Hārītī, and the tenth named Stealer of the Vital Essence of All Living Beings. These ten rākṣasī demonesses, together with the Mother of Demon Children, her sons, and her retinue, all proceeded to the place where the Buddha was and with one voice addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we too wish to protect those who recite, receive, and uphold the Lotus Sutra, to eliminate their decline and suffering. If there are any who seek to find the faults of the Dharma teacher, we shall cause them to gain no advantage." Then, in the Buddha's presence, they spoke the incantation, saying:

yitili yitimin yitili aitili yitili neili neili neili neili neili louhei louhei louhei louhei duohei duohei duohei douhei □hei

"Let them rather tread upon our heads than torment the Dharma teacher! Whether yakṣas, or rākṣasas, or hungry ghosts, or pūtanas, or kṛtyas, or vetalas, or kaṇṭhakas, or umarakas, or apasmarakas, or yakṣa kṛtyas, or human kṛtyas, or fevers—whether one-day, or two-day, or three-day, or four-day, up to seven-day, or chronic fevers; whether in male form, or female form, or boy form, or girl form—let them not torment even in dreams!" Then, in the Buddha's presence, they spoke verses, saying:

If they do not obey our incantation
And torment the preacher of the Dharma,
Their heads shall split into seven pieces
Like the branches of the arjaka tree.

As with the sin of killing parents,
Or the calamity of pressing oil,
Or cheating people with false measures,
Or Devadatta's sin of splitting the Saṅgha—

Those who violate this Dharma teacher
Shall obtain such calamities.

After the rākṣasī demonesses spoke these verses, they addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we too shall personally protect those who receive, uphold, recite, and practice this sūtra, causing them to attain peace and be free from all decline and suffering, eliminating all poisonous medicines." The Buddha said to the rākṣasī demonesses: "Excellent, excellent! If you are able to protect those who uphold the name of the Lotus Sutra, your merit will be immeasurable. How much more so if you protect those who perfectly receive and uphold it, making offerings to the sūtra scrolls with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, banners, canopies, music, and lighting various lamps—sesame oil lamps, oil lamps, various fragrant oil lamps, sumanā flower oil lamps, campaka flower oil lamps, vārṣika flower oil lamps, utpala flower oil lamps—with hundreds of thousands of kinds of offerings such as these. Hārītī, you and your retinue should protect such Dharma teachers."

When this Chapter on Dhāraṇīs was preached, sixty-eight thousand persons attained the Patient Acceptance of the Unborn Dharmas.

Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Former Lives of King Wonderful Adornment

At that time, the Buddha addressed the great assembly: "Long ago in the past, beyond immeasurable, boundless, inconceivable, incalculable asamkhyeya kalpas, there was a Buddha named Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom, Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-sambuddha. His land was called Luminous Adornment, and the kalpa was called Joyful Vision."

"In the Dharma of that Buddha, there was a king named Wonderful Adornment. The king's consort was named Lady Pure Virtue. He had two sons: one named Pure Repository and the other named Pure Eye. These two sons possessed great spiritual powers, blessings, virtue, and wisdom. For a long time they had cultivated the bodhisattva path—namely, the perfection of giving, the perfection of moral discipline, the perfection of patience, the perfection of vigor, the perfection of meditation, the perfection of wisdom, and the perfection of skillful means. They had mastered loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity, and even the thirty-seven factors conducive to enlightenment—all these they thoroughly comprehended and penetrated. Moreover, they had attained the bodhisattva's Pure Samādhi, the Constellation Samādhi, the Pure Light Samādhi, the Pure Form Samādhi, the Pure Illumination Samādhi, the Long Adornment Samādhi, and the Great Majestic Virtue Repository Samādhi—in all these samādhis they were thoroughly penetrating."

"At that time, that Buddha, wishing to guide King Wonderful Adornment and out of compassion for all living beings, expounded this Lotus Sutra. Then the two sons, Pure Repository and Pure Eye, went to their mother, pressed their ten fingers together with palms joined, and said: 'We pray that our mother will go to the place where Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha dwells. We too shall attend upon you, draw near, make offerings, and pay reverence. Why is this so? Because this Buddha, in the midst of all the assemblies of gods and humans, expounds the Lotus Sutra. It is fitting that we should listen and receive it.' Their mother told her sons: 'Your father believes in and accepts the heterodox paths, being deeply attached to the Brahmanical teachings. You should go and speak to your father, so that we may all go together.' Pure Repository and Pure Eye pressed their ten fingers together with palms joined and addressed their mother: 'We are sons of the Dharma King, yet we have been born into this household of wrong views.' Their mother told her sons: 'You should be concerned for your father. Manifest spiritual transformations for him. If he is able to see them, his mind will certainly become pure, and he may allow us to go to the Buddha's place.'"

"Thereupon, the two sons, out of concern for their father, rose up into the sky to a height of seven tāla trees and manifested various spiritual transformations. In the sky they walked, stood, sat, and reclined. From the upper part of their bodies they emitted water, and from the lower part they emitted fire. From the lower part of their bodies they emitted water, and from the upper part they emitted fire. Sometimes they manifested great bodies that filled the sky, and then manifested small bodies again; from small bodies they again manifested great bodies. They disappeared in the sky and suddenly appeared on the ground. They entered the earth as if it were water, and walked upon water as if it were earth. Manifesting such various spiritual transformations, they caused their father the king's mind to become pure and to develop faith and understanding. When the father saw the spiritual powers of his sons, his mind was filled with great joy, having obtained what he had never had before. He joined his palms and addressed his sons: 'Who is your teacher? Whose disciples are you?' The two sons replied: 'Great King, that Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha is now seated upon the Dharma seat beneath the jeweled bodhi tree of seven treasures. In the midst of all the assemblies of gods and humans throughout the world, he extensively expounds the Lotus Sutra. He is our teacher, and we are his disciples.' The father said to his sons: 'I too now wish to see your teacher. We may go together.' Thereupon, the two sons descended from the sky and went to their mother. Joining their palms, they addressed their mother: 'Our father the king has now developed faith and understanding and is capable of aspiring to awaken anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. We have accomplished the Buddha's work on behalf of our father. We pray that our mother will grant us permission to leave home and cultivate the Way in the presence of that Buddha.'"

At that time, the two sons, wishing to restate their meaning, spoke in verse to their mother:

We pray our mother will release us
To leave home and become śramaṇas.
Buddhas are exceedingly difficult to encounter;
We shall follow and learn from the Buddha.

Like the udumbara flower,
To encounter a Buddha is even more difficult than this.
To escape from all difficulties is also difficult;
We pray you will allow us to leave home.

"The mother then told them: 'I permit you to leave home. Why is this so? Because Buddhas are difficult to encounter.' Thereupon, the two sons addressed their father and mother: 'Excellent, father and mother! We pray that you will now go to the place where Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha dwells, to draw near and make offerings. Why is this so? Because Buddhas are difficult to encounter, like the udumbara flower, and also like a one-eyed turtle encountering the hole in a floating log. Through our deep and abundant blessings from former lives, we have been born at a time when the Buddha-Dharma exists. Therefore, father and mother should permit us to leave home. Why is this so? Because Buddhas are difficult to encounter, and the time is also difficult to meet.'"

"At that time, the eighty-four thousand persons in the inner palace of King Wonderful Adornment were all capable of upholding this Lotus Sutra. Pure Eye Bodhisattva had long been thoroughly penetrating the Lotus Samādhi. Pure Repository Bodhisattva had, for immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of kalpas, been thoroughly penetrating the Samādhi of Freeing All from Evil Destinies, because he wished to cause all living beings to be freed from the evil destinies. The king's consort had attained the Samādhi of the Assembly of All Buddhas, and was able to know the secret treasury of all Buddhas. The two sons, through such skillful means and power, skillfully converted their father, causing his mind to develop faith and understanding and to delight in the Buddha-Dharma. Then King Wonderful Adornment, together with his ministers and retinue, Lady Pure Virtue together with the women of the inner palace and her retinue, and the king's two sons together with forty-two thousand persons—all at the same time proceeded together to the Buddha's place. Having arrived, they bowed with their heads at his feet, circumambulated the Buddha three times, and withdrew to stand to one side."

"At that time, that Buddha expounded the Dharma for the king, revealing, instructing, benefiting, and gladdening him. The king greatly rejoiced. Then King Wonderful Adornment and his consort removed the pearl necklaces from their necks, worth hundreds of thousands, and scattered them over the Buddha. In the sky the necklaces transformed into a four-pillared jeweled platform. Within the platform was a great jeweled couch, spread with hundreds of thousands of myriads of heavenly garments, and upon it was a Buddha seated in cross-legged position, emitting great radiance. At that time, King Wonderful Adornment had this thought: 'The Buddha's body is rare, dignified, majestic, and distinctive, perfecting the supremely wondrous form.' Then Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha addressed the fourfold assembly: 'Do you see this King Wonderful Adornment standing with palms joined before me? This king, within my Dharma, shall become a monk and diligently cultivate and practice the dharmas that aid the Buddha Way. He shall become a Buddha named Śāla Tree King. His land will be called Great Light, and the kalpa will be called Great Lofty King. That Śāla Tree King Buddha will have immeasurable multitudes of bodhisattvas and immeasurable multitudes of śrāvakas. His land will be level and upright. Such will be his merits and virtues.' The king immediately ceded his kingdom to his younger brother and, together with his consort, his two sons, and all his retinue, left home within the Buddha-Dharma to cultivate the Way. After the king had left home, for eighty-four thousand years he constantly practiced diligently and cultivated the Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra. After this time had passed, he attained the Samādhi of Adornment with All Pure Meritorious Virtues. Immediately he rose into the sky to a height of seven tāla trees and addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, these two sons of mine have accomplished the Buddha's work. Through spiritual powers and transformations, they have turned my mind from wrong views, causing me to abide securely in the Buddha-Dharma and to be able to see the World-Honored One. These two sons are my good spiritual friends. Wishing to awaken the good roots from my past lives and to benefit me, they came to be born in my household.'"

"At that time, Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha addressed King Wonderful Adornment: 'So it is, so it is, just as you say. If good men and good women plant good roots, life after life they will obtain good spiritual friends. These good spiritual friends are able to accomplish the Buddha's work, revealing, instructing, benefiting, and gladdening them, causing them to enter anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Great King, you should know that good spiritual friends are a great causal connection, bringing about transformation and guidance so that one may see the Buddha and awaken the mind of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Great King, do you see these two sons? These two sons have already made offerings to sixty-five hundred thousand myriads of millions of nayutas of Ganges' sands of Buddhas, drawing near and showing reverence. In the presence of all these Buddhas, they upheld the Lotus Sutra. Out of compassion for living beings of wrong views, they cause them to abide in right views.' King Wonderful Adornment then descended from the sky and addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the Tathāgata is extremely rare. Through the power of his meritorious virtues and wisdom, the fleshy protuberance atop his head radiates brilliant light. His eyes are long and broad, of deep blue color. The tuft of white hair between his eyebrows is white as the moon or snow. His teeth are white, even, and close-set, always emitting radiance. His lips are of excellent reddish color, like the bimba fruit.' At that time, King Wonderful Adornment, having thus praised the Buddha's immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of meritorious virtues, with single-minded palms joined before the Tathāgata, again addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, this is unprecedented! The Tathāgata's Dharma is fully perfected with inconceivable, subtle, and wondrous meritorious virtues. The precepts and instructions that guide conduct bring peace, stability, and excellent goodness. From this day forward, I shall no longer willfully follow my mind's impulses, nor shall I give rise to wrong views or to the evil minds of arrogance, anger, or hatred.' Having spoken these words, he paid reverence to the Buddha and departed."

The Buddha addressed the great assembly: "What do you think? Could King Wonderful Adornment be anyone else? He is now Flower Virtue Bodhisattva. Lady Pure Virtue is now the bodhisattva before the Buddha named Radiance Adorning Characteristics, who, out of compassion for King Wonderful Adornment and his retinue, was born in that place. As for those two sons, they are now Medicine King Bodhisattva and Superior Medicine Bodhisattva. These Medicine King and Superior Medicine Bodhisattvas have accomplished such great meritorious virtues as these. Before immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas they have planted roots of virtue and accomplished inconceivable good meritorious virtues. If there are persons who know the names of these two bodhisattvas, all the gods and humans throughout the world should also pay reverence to them." When the Buddha expounded this Chapter on the Former Lives of King Wonderful Adornment, eighty-four thousand persons cast off the dust and defilement from afar, and with regard to all dharmas attained the pure Dharma eye.

Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Encouragement of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra

At that time, the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, through his power of sovereign spiritual penetration, his majestic virtue and renown, together with great bodhisattvas immeasurable, boundless, and beyond reckoning, came from the east. In all the lands through which he passed, the earth universally quaked and trembled, jeweled lotus flowers rained down, and immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kinds of music were played. Moreover, accompanied by innumerable devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans and nonhumans, and others, a great assembly surrounded him, each manifesting the power of majestic virtue and spiritual penetration. Arriving at this Sahā world, at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa, he bowed his head to the feet of Śākyamuni Buddha, circumambulated him seven times to the right, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, from the land of the Buddha Jewel Majestic Virtue Superior King, I heard from afar that in this Sahā world the Dharma Flower Sutra was being expounded. Together with immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of bodhisattvas, I have come to hear and receive it. I only pray that the World-Honored One will expound it for us. If, after the extinction of the Tathāgata, good sons and good daughters wish to obtain this Dharma Flower Sutra, how may they do so?"

The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra: "If good sons and good daughters fulfill four dharmas, after the extinction of the Tathāgata they shall obtain this Dharma Flower Sutra. First, they shall be protected and kept in mind by the buddhas. Second, they shall plant the roots of all virtues. Third, they shall enter the assembly of those fixed in correctness. Fourth, they shall arouse the mind to save all sentient beings. Good sons and good daughters who fulfill these four dharmas in this way shall, after the extinction of the Tathāgata, unfailingly obtain this sutra."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, in the latter five hundred years, in the evil and turbid age, whoever receives and upholds this sutra, I shall guard and protect, removing their decline and afflictions, causing them to obtain peace and stability, making it so that none who seek opportunity to harm them shall succeed—whether māras, māra-sons, māra-daughters, māra-subjects, those possessed by māras, yakṣas, rākṣasas, kumbhāṇḍas, piśācas, kṛtyas, pūtanas, vetāḍas, and others who harass people—none shall gain advantage. When this person, whether walking or standing, recites this sutra, I shall at that time mount my six-tusked white elephant king and, together with the assembly of great bodhisattvas, proceed to that place and manifest my body, making offerings, guarding and protecting them, and comforting their minds, also for the sake of making offerings to the Dharma Flower Sutra. If this person sits and contemplates this sutra, at that time I shall again mount my white elephant king and appear before that person. If that person has forgotten even a single phrase or verse of the Dharma Flower Sutra, I shall teach it to them, reciting it together with them, causing them to become thoroughly proficient again. At that time, those who receive, uphold, recite, and chant the Dharma Flower Sutra shall see my body and experience great joy, and through this shall progress with even greater vigor. Because they see me, they shall immediately attain samādhi and dhāraṇīs—namely, the Revolving Dhāraṇī, the Dhāraṇī of Hundreds of Thousands of Myriads of Koṭis of Revolutions, and the Dhāraṇī of Skillful Means in the Dharma Voice. They shall obtain dhāraṇīs such as these."

"World-Honored One, if in the latter age, in the latter five hundred years, in the evil and turbid age, there are bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, or upāsikās who seek, who uphold, who recite and chant, who copy, and who wish to cultivate this Dharma Flower Sutra, they should, for twenty-one days, single-mindedly advance with vigor. After the full twenty-one days have passed, I shall mount my six-tusked white elephant and, surrounded by immeasurable bodhisattvas, with a body pleasing to the sight of all sentient beings, appear before that person and expound the Dharma for them, showing, teaching, benefiting, and gladdening them. I shall moreover give them dhāraṇī spells. Having obtained this dhāraṇī, no nonhuman shall be able to destroy them, nor shall they be deluded and confused by women. I myself shall also always protect this person. I only pray that the World-Honored One will permit me to speak this dhāraṇī spell."

Then, in the presence of the Buddha, he spoke a spell, saying:

adaṇḍe daṇḍapati daṇḍāvarte daṇḍakuśale daṇḍasudhāri sudhāri sudhārapati buddhapaśyane sarvadhāraṇyāvartani sarvabhāṣyāvartani suāvartani saṃghaparīkṣaṇi saṃghanirghātani asaṃge saṃgāpanate tryadhvasaṃgate ratriprāpte saṃgharahūte ārati pratihate sarvasaṃghasamatikrānte sarvadharmasuparīkṣite sarvasattvarutakauśalyānugate siṃhavikrīḍite

"World-Honored One, if there are bodhisattvas who hear this dhāraṇī, they should know this to be the spiritual power of Samantabhadra. If the Dharma Flower Sutra circulates in Jambudvīpa and there are those who uphold it, they should think thus: 'This is all due to the majestic spiritual power of Samantabhadra.' If there are those who uphold, recite and chant, correctly retain in memory, understand its meaning and purport, and cultivate practice according to what is spoken, know that such persons practice the practices of Samantabhadra. In the presence of immeasurable, boundless buddhas, they have deeply planted roots of goodness, and the Tathāgatas have placed their hands upon their heads. If they merely copy it, when this person's life ends, they shall be born in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven. At that time, eighty-four thousand heavenly maidens, playing all kinds of music, shall come to welcome them. That person shall immediately don a crown of seven treasures and, amidst the palace ladies, experience pleasure and delight. How much more so for those who uphold, recite and chant, correctly retain in memory, understand its meaning and purport, and cultivate practice according to what is spoken! If there are persons who uphold, recite and chant, and understand its meaning and purport, when this person's life ends, they shall be received in the hands of a thousand buddhas, so that they feel no fear and do not fall into the evil destinies. They shall proceed immediately to the Tuṣita Heaven, to the place of the Bodhisattva Maitreya. The Bodhisattva Maitreya possesses the thirty-two marks and is surrounded by a great assembly of bodhisattvas. He has hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of heavenly maiden attendants, and one is born in their midst. Such are the meritorious virtues and beneficial advantages. Therefore, the wise should single-mindedly copy it themselves or cause others to copy it, upholding, reciting and chanting, correctly retaining in memory, and cultivating practice according to what is spoken."

"World-Honored One, I now, through my power of spiritual penetration, guard and protect this sutra so that, after the extinction of the Tathāgata, it may be widely propagated throughout Jambudvīpa and never be cut off."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha spoke words of praise, saying: "Excellent, excellent, Samantabhadra! You are able to protect and assist this sutra, causing multitudes of sentient beings to obtain peace, advantage, and benefit. You have already accomplished inconceivable meritorious virtues and profound great compassion. From the remote past, you aroused the intention toward anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, and you are able to make this vow of spiritual penetration to guard and protect this sutra. I shall, through my power of spiritual penetration, guard and protect those who are able to uphold the name of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra."

"Samantabhadra, if there are those who uphold, recite and chant, correctly retain in memory, cultivate and practice, and copy this Dharma Flower Sutra, know that such persons then see Śākyamuni Buddha. It is as if they heard this sutra from the mouth of the Buddha. Know that such persons make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha. Know that such persons are praised as 'excellent' by the Buddha. Know that such persons have their heads rubbed by the hand of Śākyamuni Buddha. Know that such persons are covered by the robe of Śākyamuni Buddha. Such persons no longer greedily crave worldly pleasures. They do not delight in the scriptures and writings of non-Buddhist paths, nor do they take pleasure in approaching such persons or any who are evil—whether butchers, those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens, or dogs, hunters, or those who peddle feminine charms. The minds and intentions of such persons are upright and honest. They possess correct mindful retention and the power of merit and virtue. Such persons are not afflicted by the three poisons, nor are they afflicted by jealousy, self-conceit, arrogant conceit, or overweening conceit. Such persons have few desires, know contentment, and are able to cultivate the practices of Samantabhadra."

"Samantabhadra, if after the extinction of the Tathāgata, in the latter five hundred years, there are persons who see those who uphold, recite, and chant the Dharma Flower Sutra, they should think thus: 'This person shall before long proceed to the place of enlightenment, defeat the hosts of māras, attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, turn the wheel of the Dharma, beat the drum of the Dharma, blow the conch of the Dharma, rain the rain of the Dharma, and shall sit upon the lion throne of the Dharma amidst the great assembly of devas and humans.'"

"Samantabhadra, if in a latter age there are those who uphold, recite, and chant this sutra, such persons shall no longer greedily crave clothing, bedding, food and drink, or the necessities of life. Their vows shall not be in vain, and they shall moreover obtain their blessed reward in the present world. If there are persons who disparage them, saying, 'You are a madman! You perform these practices in vain and shall ultimately gain nothing'—the karmic retribution for such offense shall be to be without eyes, world after world. If there are those who make offerings and speak their praises, they shall in the present world obtain manifest rewards. If, moreover, one sees those who uphold this sutra and exposes their faults, whether real or unreal, such a person shall in the present world contract white leprosy. If there are those who ridicule them with scorn, such persons shall, world after world, have gaps in their teeth, ugly lips, a flat nose, hands and feet that are twisted and gnarled, eyes that squint, a body that is foul and fetid, evil sores, pus and blood, water belly, shortness of breath, and all manner of severe and evil diseases. Therefore, Samantabhadra, if one sees those who uphold this sutra, one should rise up and go to greet them from afar, and one should revere them as one reveres the Buddha."

When this chapter on the Encouragement of Samantabhadra was spoken, bodhisattvas immeasurable and boundless as the sands of the Ganges River obtained hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of revolving dhāraṇīs, and bodhisattvas equal in number to the dust motes of a great trichiliocosm perfected the practices of Samantabhadra. When the Buddha spoke this sutra, Samantabhadra and other bodhisattvas, Śāriputra and other śrāvakas, as well as the devas, nāgas, humans and nonhumans, and others—the entire great assembly—all rejoiced greatly. Receiving and upholding the Buddha's words, they bowed in reverence and departed.
