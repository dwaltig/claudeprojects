The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 1: Introduction
======================================================================


Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying on Mount Vulture Peak in the city of Rajagriha, together with a great assembly of twelve thousand monks. All were Arhats, their defilements extinguished, their afflictions gone. They had attained their own benefit, cut all bonds of existence, and their minds had achieved liberation. Their names were: Ajñāta-Kauṇḍinya, Mahākāśyapa, Uruvilva-Kāśyapa, Gayā-Kāśyapa, Nadī-Kāśyapa, Śāriputra, Mahāmaudgalyāyana, Mahākātyāyana, Aniruddha, Kapphiṇa, Kauṇḍinya, Revata, Pūrṇa-Maitrāyaṇīputra, Subhūti, Ananda, Rāhula, and other great Arhats well known to the assembly.

“After the Buddha Sun Moon Lamp Light had finished preaching this sutra for sixty minor kalpas, he declared to the assembly of Brahma, Māra, śramaṇas, Brahmins, gods, humans, and asuras that the Tathagata would enter parinirvāṇa at midnight that very day. At that time, there was a Bodhisattva named Virtue-Store. The Buddha Sun Moon Lamp Light immediately gave him a prophecy, saying to the monks: ‘This Virtue-Store Bodhisattva will soon become a Buddha, with the title Pure-Body Tathagata, Arhat, Samyaksambuddha.’ After the Buddha gave this prophecy, he entered parinirvāṇa at midnight. After the Buddha's passing, Wonderful Light Bodhisattva held and taught the Lotus Sutra for a full eighty minor kalpas. The eight sons of the Buddha Sun Moon Lamp Light all took Wonderful Light as their teacher. Wonderful Light taught and transformed them, making them firm in their resolve for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. After these princes had made offerings to countless hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, they all attained the Buddha Way. The last to become a Buddha was named Burning Lamp. Among the eight hundred disciples of Wonderful Light, there was one named Fame-Seeker, who was attached to gain and honor. Although he read and recited many sutras, he did not understand them well and forgot much, which is why he was called Fame-Seeker. Because this person also planted roots of goodness, he was able to meet countless hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, making offerings to them, showing respect, reverence, and praise.”

At that time, Mañjuśrī, wishing to repeat this meaning for the great assembly, spoke in a verse, saying:

At that moment, the Buddha released a ray of light from the white hair between his eyebrows, illuminating eighteen thousand worlds in the east, without missing a single one. This light reached down to the Avīci hell and up to the Akaniṣṭha heaven. In this world, the assembly saw all the sentient beings in the six destinies of those lands, and they also saw the Buddhas who were currently present there. They heard the Dharma that those Buddhas were teaching and saw the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen who were practicing and attaining the Way. They also saw the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas following the Bodhisattva path through various causes, beliefs, and appearances. They saw Buddhas who had entered parinirvāṇa and saw jeweled stupas of seven treasures erected to house their relics.

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Volume One

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva thought: "For what reason is the World-Honored One now displaying this wondrous, supernatural manifestation? The World-Honored One has entered samadhi; this is an inconceivable and rare event. Who should I ask? Who can answer?" He thought again: "Mañjuśrī, the son of the Dharma King, has already served and made offerings to countless Buddhas in the past. He must have seen such a rare sign before. I will ask him now."

“Noble men, in the past, in immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, there was a Buddha named Sun Moon Lamp Light Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. He expounded the true Dharma, which was excellent in the beginning, excellent in the middle, and excellent in the end. Its meaning was profound and far-reaching, its words were skillful and wonderful, pure, unmixed, and complete in the characteristic of pure conduct. For those seeking to become śrāvakas (voice-hearers), he preached the Dharma of the Four Noble Truths to save them from birth, old age, sickness, and death and lead them to ultimate nirvāṇa. For those seeking to become pratyekabuddhas (self-enlightened ones), he preached the Dharma of the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. For the Bodhisattvas, he preached the Dharma of the Six Pāramitās to help them attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi and become an All-Knowing One.”

“At that time, the Buddha Sun Moon Lamp Light preached a Mahayana sutra named the Sutra of Innumerable Meanings, a Dharma for Bodhisattvas protected and remembered by the Buddhas. After he had finished this sutra, he sat in the lotus posture in the midst of the great assembly and entered the samadhi of the station of Innumerable Meanings. His body and mind remained motionless. At that time, heavenly flowers rained down—maṇḍārava, mahāmaṇḍārava, mañjūṣaka, and mahāmañjūṣaka flowers—scattering upon the Buddha and the great assembly. The entire world of the Buddha shook in six ways. At that time, the great assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, as well as minor kings and wheel-turning holy kings—experienced a joy they had never known before. With palms joined, they focused their attention entirely on the Buddha.”

Their names were: Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva, Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, Mahāsthāmaprāpta Bodhisattva, Constant-Progress Bodhisattva, Never-Resting Bodhisattva, Jewel-Hand Bodhisattva, Medicine-King Bodhisattva, Valiant-Giver Bodhisattva, Jewel-Moon Bodhisattva, Moon-Light Bodhisattva, Full-Moon Bodhisattva, Great-Might Bodhisattva, Immeasurable-Might Bodhisattva, Transcending-Three-Worlds Bodhisattva, Bhadrapāla Bodhisattva, Maitreya Bodhisattva, Jewel-Accumulation Bodhisattva, Leader Bodhisattva, and others, numbering eighty thousand great Bodhisattvas.

There were also eighty thousand Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, all of whom had reached the stage of non-retrogression from Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi (supreme, perfect enlightenment). They all possessed dhāranīs and were gifted in joyful speech and eloquence, turning the Dharma wheel of non-retrogression. They had made offerings to countless hundreds of thousands of Buddhas and planted roots of virtue at their feet, always receiving praise from the Buddhas. They cultivated compassion in their conduct, skillfully entering the wisdom of the Buddhas. They had a thorough understanding of great wisdom and had reached the other shore. Their fame was heard throughout immeasurable worlds, and they were able to save countless hundreds of thousands of sentient beings.

At that time, Mañjuśrī said to Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva and the other great beings and noble men: “As I reflect, I believe the World-Honored One is now about to preach the great Dharma, to pour the great Dharma rain, to blow the great Dharma conch, to beat the great Dharma drum, and to expound the great Dharma truth. Noble men, in the past, when I was with other Buddhas, I saw this same auspicious sign. After they emitted this light, they then preached the great Dharma. Therefore, you should know that the Buddha’s manifestation of this light today is also for this reason. He wishes for all sentient beings to hear and know this Dharma which is difficult to believe for the people of this world, and so he reveals this auspicious sign.”

At that time, the great assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, as well as minor kings and wheel-turning holy kings—experienced a joy they had never known before. With palms joined, they focused their attention entirely on the Buddha.

Wishing to repeat this meaning, Maitreya Bodhisattva spoke in a verse, asking:

King Ajātaśatru, the son of Vaidehī, was there with hundreds of thousands of followers. All of them paid homage to the Buddha's feet and then sat down to one side.

    "Mañjuśrī, why has the Great Teacher
Emitted this great light
From the white hair between his eyebrows,
Which illuminates everything?
It rains maṇḍārava and mañjūṣaka flowers,
And a wind of fragrant sandalwood
Delights the hearts of all.
For this reason, the ground is completely pure and adorned,
And this world shakes in six ways.
At that time, the four groups of the assembly
All rejoiced,
Their bodies and minds feeling peace and joy,
A state they had never known."

    "I recall in past ages,
Immeasurable and countless kalpas ago,
There was a Buddha, the Honored One among men,
Named Sun Moon Lamp Light."

There were eight great Dragon Kings: the Dragon Kings Nanda, Upananda, Sagara, Vāsuki, Takṣaka, Anavatapta, Manasvin, and Utpalaka, each with hundreds of thousands of followers. There were four great Kinnara Kings: Dharma-Kinnara, Wonderful-Dharma-Kinnara, Great-Dharma-Kinnara, and Upholder-of-Dharma-Kinnara, each with hundreds of thousands of followers. There were four great Gandharva Kings: Music-Gandharva, Musical-Sound-Gandharva, Beautiful-Gandharva, and Beautiful-Sound-Gandharva, each with hundreds of thousands of followers. There were four great Asura Kings: Valiant-Asura, Kharaskandha-Asura, Vimalacitra-Asura, and Rāhu-Asura, each with hundreds of thousands of followers. There were four great Garuda Kings: Great-Might-Garuda, Great-Body-Garuda, Great-Fullness-Garuda, and As-You-Wish-Garuda, each with hundreds of thousands of followers.

At that time, the monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, and the gods, dragons, and ghost-spirits in the assembly all thought: "This miraculous sign of the Buddha's light—whom should we ask about it now?"

At that time, Śakra, King of the Devas, was there with his retinue of twenty thousand celestial beings. There were also King Moonlight, King All-Fragrance, King Jewel-Light, and the Four Great Heavenly Kings, each with a retinue of ten thousand celestial beings. The Heavenly King of the Pure Abode and the Great Heavenly King of the Pure Abode were there with their retinue of thirty thousand celestial beings. The Brahmā King Śikhin and the Great Brahmā King of Light, rulers of the Saha world, were there with their retinue of twelve thousand celestial beings.

After the Buddha had finished expounding this sutra, he sat in the lotus posture and entered the samadhi of the station of Innumerable Meanings. His body and mind remained motionless. At that moment, heavenly flowers rained down—maṇḍārava, mahāmaṇḍārava, mañjūṣaka, and mahāmañjūṣaka flowers—scattering upon the Buddha and the great assembly. The entire world of the Buddha shook in six ways.

Then, Maitreya Bodhisattva, wishing to resolve his own doubts and observing the thoughts of the four groups of disciples and the gods, dragons, and ghost-spirits in the assembly, asked Mañjuśrī: "For what reason is there this auspicious sign of supernatural power? Why has the Buddha emitted this great light, illuminating eighteen thousand lands in the east and revealing the glorious adornments of those Buddha lands?"

“Maitreya, you should know that the Wonderful Light Bodhisattva of that time—was he anyone other than me? I was that Bodhisattva. And the Fame-Seeker Bodhisattva—was he anyone other than you? You were that Bodhisattva. Now that I see this auspicious sign, it is no different from the one I saw before. Therefore, I believe that today the Tathagata is about to preach the Mahayana sutra named the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a Dharma for Bodhisattvas protected and remembered by the Buddhas.”

At that time, the World-Honored One was surrounded by the four groups of disciples, who were making offerings, showing reverence, respect, and praise. He was expounding a Great Vehicle sutra for the Bodhisattvas, named the Sutra of Innumerable Meanings, which is a teaching for Bodhisattvas and is protected and remembered by the Buddhas.

“After him, there was a Buddha also named Sun Moon Lamp Light. Then again, another Buddha also named Sun Moon Lamp Light. In this way, twenty thousand Buddhas all had the same name, Sun Moon Lamp Light, and all shared the same surname, Bharadvaja. Maitreya, you should know that the first and the last of these Buddhas all had the same name, Sun Moon Lamp Light, and were complete in the ten titles of a Buddha. The Dharma they preached was excellent in the beginning, middle, and end. The last of these Buddhas had eight sons before he renounced his home. Their names were: Intention, Good-Intention, Boundless-Intention, Jewel-Intention, Increasing-Intention, Doubt-Removing-Intention, Directed-Intention, and Dharma-Intention. These eight princes were majestic and at ease, each ruling over one of the four continents. When these princes heard that their father had renounced his home and attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, they all abandoned their royal positions and also renounced their homes. They all conceived the Mahayana resolve and constantly cultivated pure conduct. They all became Dharma teachers, having already planted roots of goodness under millions of Buddhas.”

There were also two thousand people, both those who were still learning and those who had nothing more to learn. Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, the nun, was there with her retinue of six thousand. Yaśodharā, the mother of Rāhula, the nun, was also there with her retinue.

“At that time, the Tathagata released a ray of light from the white hair between his eyebrows, illuminating eighteen thousand Buddha lands in the east, without missing a single one, just as you see these Buddha lands now. Maitreya, you should know that at that time, there were twenty million Bodhisattvas in the assembly who were eager to hear the Dharma. When these Bodhisattvas saw this light illuminating all the Buddha lands, they felt a joy they had never known before and wished to know the cause of this light. At that time, there was a Bodhisattva named Wonderful Light who had eight hundred disciples. When the Buddha Sun Moon Lamp Light arose from his samadhi, he preached a Mahayana sutra named the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a Dharma for Bodhisattvas protected and remembered by the Buddhas. He remained on his seat for sixty minor kalpas. Those in the assembly who were listening also remained in one place for sixty minor kalpas, their bodies and minds motionless, listening to the Buddha’s teaching as if it were only a moment of a meal. At that time, there was not a single person in the assembly whose body or mind felt any weariness.”

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 2: Expedient Means
======================================================================


At that time, Śāriputra, knowing the doubts in the hearts of the four groups of the assembly and not yet understanding himself, said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, for what cause and for what reason are you so earnestly praising the first expedient means of the Buddhas, this profound, subtle, and difficult-to-understand Dharma? Since the past, I have never heard such a teaching from the Buddha. Now, the four groups of the assembly are all in doubt. We only wish the World-Honored One would explain this matter. Why does the World-Honored One so earnestly praise this profound, subtle, and difficult-to-understand Dharma?”

“Such a wonderful Dharma as this is preached by the Buddhas only from time to time, just as the udumbara flower appears only once in a while. Śāriputra, you should believe what the Buddha says, for his words are not empty falsehoods. Śāriputra, the Buddhas preach the Dharma according to what is appropriate, but their intent is difficult to grasp. Why? Because I use countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas. This Dharma cannot be understood by thinking and distinguishing. Only the Buddhas can know it. Why? Because the World-Honored Buddhas appear in the world for only One Great Purpose.

Śāriputra, since I attained Buddhahood, I have used various causes, various parables, and a wide array of teachings and countless expedient means to guide sentient beings, enabling them to leave all attachments. Why is this? The Tathagata's expedient means and wisdom pāramitā (perfection) are all fully complete. Śāriputra, the Tathagata’s wisdom and insight are vast, profound, and far-reaching, immeasurable and unhindered. His powers, fearlessnesses, meditations, liberations, and samadhis have penetrated boundless reaches, and he has perfected all unprecedented Dharmas. Śāriputra, the Tathagata can differentiate and skillfully expound all Dharmas with gentle words that please the hearts of the assembly. Śāriputra, to put it concisely, the Buddha has perfected immeasurable, boundless, and unprecedented Dharmas.”

At that time, Śāriputra, knowing the doubts in the hearts of the four groups of the assembly and not yet understanding himself, said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, for what cause and for what reason are you so earnestly praising the first expedient means of the Buddhas, this profound, subtle, and difficult-to-understand Dharma? Since the past, I have never heard such a teaching from the Buddha. Now, the four groups of the assembly are all in doubt. We only wish the World-Honored One would explain this matter. Why does the World-Honored One so earnestly praise this profound, subtle, and difficult-to-understand Dharma?”

This is the full translation of the second chapter, "Expedient Means," which is a pivotal section of the Lotus Sutra. In this chapter, the Buddha unveils the core teaching of his Dharma and clarifies the purpose behind all his previous teachings.

The Buddha said to Śāriputra:

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Volume Two

At that time, Śāriputra, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

“Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the past used immeasurable, countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas for sentient beings. This Dharma was all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. When these sentient beings heard the Dharma from the Buddhas, they all ultimately attained All-Knowing Wisdom. Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the future who will appear in the world will also use immeasurable, countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas for sentient beings. This Dharma will all be for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. When these sentient beings hear the Dharma from the Buddhas, they will all ultimately attain All-Knowing Wisdom. Śāriputra, the World-Honored Buddhas in the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddha lands in the ten directions today, who bring great benefit and peace to sentient beings, these Buddhas also use immeasurable, countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas for sentient beings. This Dharma is all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. When these sentient beings hear the Dharma from the Buddhas, they all ultimately attain All-Knowing Wisdom. Śāriputra, these Buddhas only teach and convert Bodhisattvas, wishing to show sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom and insight, wishing to awaken sentient beings to the Buddha's wisdom and insight, and wishing to enable sentient beings to enter the Buddha's wisdom and insight. Śāriputra, I am also the same now. I know the various desires of all sentient beings, their deep attachments, and their original nature. I use various causes, parables, and words, and the power of expedient means, to preach the Dharma for them. Śāriputra, all of this is for them to attain the One Buddha Vehicle and All-Knowing Wisdom.”

At that time, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: “Stop, stop, there is no need to speak further. If I were to explain this matter, all the gods and people in the world would be shocked and full of doubt.”

At that time, Śāriputra, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

At that time, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: “Stop, stop, there is no need to speak further. If I were to explain this matter, all the gods and people in the world would be shocked and full of doubt.”

    "The supreme, Double-Footed Honored One,"

The Buddha said to Śāriputra:

When he said this, five thousand people in the assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—immediately rose from their seats, paid reverence to the Buddha, and withdrew. Why? Because these people had deep roots of transgression and were arrogant, claiming to have attained what they had not yet attained, and to have realized what they had not yet realized. Having such faults, they did not stay. The World-Honored One remained silent and did not stop them.

    "The King of Dharma, the Supreme Honored One,"

    "The monks and nuns
Who hold arrogance,
The laymen who are arrogant,
And the laywomen who do not believe—"

At that time, Śāriputra again said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, please speak, please speak. In this assembly, there are hundreds of thousands of millions like us, who from lifetime to lifetime have been converted by the Buddha. Such people will certainly be able to believe with reverence. For a long night, they will be at peace and receive great benefit.”

At that time, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: “Stop, stop, there is no need to speak further. If I were to explain this matter, all the gods and people in the world would be shocked and full of doubt.”

At that time, Śāriputra, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 2: Expedient Means

At that time, the World-Honored One calmly arose from his meditation and said to Śāriputra: "The wisdom of the Buddhas is profoundly immeasurable. The gate to this wisdom is difficult to comprehend and difficult to enter. It is something that no śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha can know. Why is this? The Buddha has served and been close to hundreds of thousands of millions of countless Buddhas, fully practicing their immeasurable path. He has progressed with valor and diligence, and his name is heard everywhere. He has perfected a profound and unprecedented Dharma. The teachings he gives are always appropriate, but their intent is difficult to comprehend.

    "The great sage, the Sun of Wisdom,
Has spoken this Dharma after a long time.
He says that he has attained
This inconceivable Dharma of powers, fearlessness,
Samadhis, and liberation."

Śāriputra said: “Yes, World-Honored One, we joyfully wish to hear.”

When he said this, five thousand people in the assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—immediately rose from their seats, paid reverence to the Buddha, and withdrew. Why? Because these people had deep roots of transgression and were arrogant, claiming to have attained what they had not yet attained, and to have realized what they had not yet realized. Having such faults, they did not stay. The World-Honored One remained silent and did not stop them.

    "The monks and nuns"

“Furthermore, Śāriputra, if these monks and nuns claim that they have already attained arhatship, that this is their last body, and that they have reached ultimate nirvāṇa, and they no longer strive to seek Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, you should know that all these people are arrogant. Why? If a monk truly attains arhatship and does not believe in this Dharma, there is no such thing. This is with the exception of after the Buddha’s passing, when there is no Buddha present. Why? After the Buddha’s passing, those who can uphold, read, recite, and comprehend the meaning of these kinds of sutras are rare. If they were to encounter another Buddha, they would immediately become clear about this Dharma. Śāriputra, you must believe, understand, receive, and uphold the words of the Buddha with a single mind. The words of the Tathagatas are not empty falsehoods. There is no other vehicle, only the One Buddha Vehicle.”

At that time, the World-Honored One calmly arose from his meditation and said to Śāriputra: "The wisdom of the Buddhas is profoundly immeasurable. The gate to this wisdom is difficult to comprehend and difficult to enter. It is something that no śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha can know. Why is this? The Buddha has served and been close to hundreds of thousands of millions of countless Buddhas, fully practicing their immeasurable path. He has progressed with valor and diligence, and his name is heard everywhere. He has perfected a profound and unprecedented Dharma. The teachings he gives are always appropriate, but their intent is difficult to comprehend.

The Buddha said to Śāriputra: “The Tathagatas only teach and convert Bodhisattvas. Everything they do is for a single matter: to show and awaken sentient beings to the Buddha's wisdom and insight. Śāriputra, the Tathagata preaches the Dharma for sentient beings by using only the One Buddha Vehicle; there is no other vehicle, whether two or three. Śāriputra, the Dharma of all the Buddhas in the ten directions is also like this.”

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 2: Expedient Means

At that time, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: “Stop, stop, there is no need to speak further. If I were to explain this matter, all the gods and people in the world would be shocked and full of doubt.”

“Furthermore, Śāriputra, if these monks and nuns claim that they have already attained arhatship, that this is their last body, and that they have reached ultimate nirvāṇa, and they no longer strive to seek Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, you should know that all these people are arrogant. Why? If a monk truly attains arhatship and does not believe in this Dharma, there is no such thing. This is with the exception of after the Buddha’s passing, when there is no Buddha present. Why?

Śāriputra, you must believe, understand, receive, and uphold the words of the Buddha with a single mind. The words of the Tathagatas are not empty falsehoods. There is no other vehicle, only the One Buddha Vehicle.”

The Buddha again stopped Śāriputra: “If I were to explain this matter, all the gods, humans, and asuras in the world would be shocked and full of doubt. The arrogant monks will fall into a great abyss.”

    "The great sage, the Sun of Wisdom,
Has spoken this Dharma after a long time.
He says that he has attained
This inconceivable Dharma of powers, fearlessness,
Samadhis, and liberation."

    "The World Hero is immeasurable;"

When he said this, five thousand people in the assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—immediately rose from their seats, paid reverence to the Buddha, and withdrew. Why? Because these people had deep roots of transgression and were arrogant, claiming to have attained what they had not yet attained, and to have realized what they had not yet realized. Having such faults, they did not stay. The World-Honored One remained silent and did not stop them.

“Such a wonderful Dharma as this is preached by the Buddhas only from time to time, just as the udumbara flower appears only once in a while.

    "The World Hero is immeasurable;"

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Volume Two

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

At that time, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: “This assembly of mine is no longer filled with twigs and leaves; only the pure, true fruit remains. Śāriputra, it is good that these arrogant people have withdrawn. You should now listen well, for I will speak to you.”

At that time, the World-Honored One said to Śāriputra: “Since you have earnestly requested three times, how can I not speak? You should now listen carefully and contemplate it well. I will explain and differentiate it for you.”

The Buddha said to Śāriputra:

Translated by Tripitaka Master Kumarajiva of the Kucha Kingdom in the Later Qin Dynasty, by imperial decree.

    "Stop, stop, there is no need to speak."

Śāriputra again said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, please speak, please speak. Why? The immeasurable, hundreds of thousands of millions of asaṃkhyeya sentient beings in this assembly have previously seen Buddhas. Their faculties are sharp and their wisdom is clear. When they hear what the Buddha says, they will be able to believe it with reverence.”

At that time, Śāriputra again said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, please speak, please speak. In this assembly, there are hundreds of thousands of millions like us, who from lifetime to lifetime have been converted by the Buddha. Such people will certainly be able to believe with reverence. For a long night, they will be at peace and receive great benefit.”

At that time, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: “This assembly of mine is no longer filled with twigs and leaves; only the pure, true fruit remains. Śāriputra, it is good that these arrogant people have withdrawn. You should now listen well, for I will speak to you.”

When he said this, five thousand people in the assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—immediately rose from their seats, paid reverence to the Buddha, and withdrew. Why?

The Buddha again stopped Śāriputra: “If I were to explain this matter, all the gods, humans, and asuras in the world would be shocked and full of doubt. The arrogant monks will fall into a great abyss.”

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

“Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the past used immeasurable, countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas for sentient beings. This Dharma was all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. When these sentient beings heard the Dharma from the Buddhas, they all ultimately attained All-Knowing Wisdom. Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the future who will appear in the world will also use immeasurable, countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas for sentient beings. This Dharma will all be for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. When these sentient beings hear the Dharma from the Buddhas, they will all ultimately attain All-Knowing Wisdom. Śāriputra, the World-Honored Buddhas in the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddha lands in the ten directions today, who bring great benefit and peace to sentient beings, these Buddhas also use immeasurable, countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas for sentient beings. This Dharma is all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. When these sentient beings hear the Dharma from the Buddhas, they all ultimately attain All-Knowing Wisdom. Śāriputra, these Buddhas only teach and convert Bodhisattvas, wishing to show sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom and insight, wishing to awaken sentient beings to the Buddha's wisdom and insight, and wishing to enable sentient beings to enter the Buddha's wisdom and insight. Śāriputra, I am also the same now. I know the various desires of all sentient beings, their deep attachments, and their original nature. I use various causes, parables, and words, and the power of expedient means, to preach the Dharma for them. Śāriputra, all of this is for them to attain the One Buddha Vehicle and All-Knowing Wisdom.”

At that time, the World-Honored One again spoke in verse:

    "The supreme, Double-Footed Honored One,
Please preach the first Dharma.
I am the Buddha’s eldest son;
Please condescend to explain and differentiate it."

    "Stop, stop, there is no need to speak."

“Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the past used immeasurable, countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas for sentient beings. This Dharma was all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. When these sentient beings heard the Dharma from the Buddhas, they all ultimately attained All-Knowing Wisdom.

Śāriputra, the World-Honored Buddhas in the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddha lands in the ten directions today, who bring great benefit and peace to sentient beings, these Buddhas also use immeasurable, countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas for sentient beings. This Dharma is all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. When these sentient beings hear the Dharma from the Buddhas, they all ultimately attain All-Knowing Wisdom. Śāriputra, these Buddhas only teach and convert Bodhisattvas, wishing to show sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom and insight, wishing to awaken sentient beings to the Buddha's wisdom and insight, and wishing to enable sentient beings to enter the Buddha's wisdom and insight. Śāriputra, I am also the same now. I know the various desires of all sentient beings, their deep attachments, and their original nature. I use various causes, parables, and words, and the power of expedient means, to preach the Dharma for them. Śāriputra, all of this is for them to attain the One Buddha Vehicle and All-Knowing Wisdom.”

The Buddha said to Śāriputra: “The Tathagatas only teach and convert Bodhisattvas. Everything they do is for a single matter: to show and awaken sentient beings to the Buddha's wisdom and insight. Śāriputra, the Tathagata preaches the Dharma for sentient beings by using only the One Buddha Vehicle; there is no other vehicle, whether two or three. Śāriputra, the Dharma of all the Buddhas in the ten directions is also like this.”

Śāriputra, since I attained Buddhahood, I have used various causes, various parables, and a wide array of teachings and countless expedient means to guide sentient beings, enabling them to leave all attachments. Why is this? The Tathagata's expedient means and wisdom pāramitā (perfection) are all fully complete. Śāriputra, the Tathagata’s wisdom and insight are vast, profound, and far-reaching, immeasurable and unhindered. His powers, fearlessnesses, meditations, liberations, and samadhis have penetrated boundless reaches, and he has perfected all unprecedented Dharmas. Śāriputra, the Tathagata can differentiate and skillfully expound all Dharmas with gentle words that please the hearts of the assembly. Śāriputra, to put it concisely, the Buddha has perfected immeasurable, boundless, and unprecedented Dharmas.”

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

Śāriputra again said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, please speak, please speak. Why? The immeasurable, hundreds of thousands of millions of asaṃkhyeya sentient beings in this assembly have previously seen Buddhas. Their faculties are sharp and their wisdom is clear. When they hear what the Buddha says, they will be able to believe it with reverence.”

    "The supreme, Double-Footed Honored One,"

The Buddha said to Śāriputra: “The Tathagatas only teach and convert Bodhisattvas. Everything they do is for a single matter: to show and awaken sentient beings to the Buddha's wisdom and insight. Śāriputra, the Tathagata preaches the Dharma for sentient beings by using only the One Buddha Vehicle; there is no other vehicle, whether two or three. Śāriputra, the Dharma of all the Buddhas in the ten directions is also like this.”

    "The King of Dharma, the Supreme Honored One,
Please speak, do not worry.
There are immeasurable beings in this assembly
Who are able to believe it with reverence."

    "The great sage, the Sun of Wisdom,"

The Buddha again stopped Śāriputra: “If I were to explain this matter, all the gods, humans, and asuras in the world would be shocked and full of doubt. The arrogant monks will fall into a great abyss.”

“Furthermore, Śāriputra, if these monks and nuns claim that they have already attained arhatship, that this is their last body, and that they have reached ultimate nirvāṇa, and they no longer strive to seek Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, you should know that all these people are arrogant. Why? If a monk truly attains arhatship and does not believe in this Dharma, there is no such thing. This is with the exception of after the Buddha’s passing, when there is no Buddha present. Why? After the Buddha’s passing, those who can uphold, read, recite, and comprehend the meaning of these kinds of sutras are rare. If they were to encounter another Buddha, they would immediately become clear about this Dharma. Śāriputra, you must believe, understand, receive, and uphold the words of the Buddha with a single mind. The words of the Tathagatas are not empty falsehoods. There is no other vehicle, only the One Buddha Vehicle.”

“Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the past used immeasurable, countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas for sentient beings. This Dharma was all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. When these sentient beings heard the Dharma from the Buddhas, they all ultimately attained All-Knowing Wisdom. Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the future who will appear in the world will also use immeasurable, countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas for sentient beings.

I use various causes, parables, and words, and the power of expedient means, to preach the Dharma for them. Śāriputra, all of this is for them to attain the One Buddha Vehicle and All-Knowing Wisdom.”

    "Stop, stop, there is no need to speak.
My Dharma is subtle and difficult to conceive.
The arrogant ones,
When they hear it, will surely not believe with reverence."

The Buddha said to Śāriputra:

"Stop, Śāriputra, there is no need to speak further. Why? The most rare and difficult-to-comprehend Dharma that the Buddha has perfected can only be fully exhausted by a Buddha together with another Buddha. This is what is meant by the true nature of all phenomena: their suchness of form, suchness of nature, suchness of substance, suchness of power, suchness of function, suchness of cause, suchness of condition, suchness of effect, suchness of retribution, and suchness of how they are all completely alike from beginning to end."

At that time, the World-Honored One said to Śāriputra: “Since you have earnestly requested three times, how can I not speak? You should now listen carefully and contemplate it well. I will explain and differentiate it for you.”

“Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions, there are not even two vehicles, let alone three. Śāriputra, the Buddhas appear in the five turbid and evil ages: the turbidity of the kalpa, the turbidity of defilements, the turbidity of sentient beings, the turbidity of views, and the turbidity of life. Thus, Śāriputra, during the chaos of the kalpa turbidity, sentient beings are heavily polluted, possess avarice and jealousy, and are filled with unwholesome roots. For this reason, the Buddhas use the power of expedient means to differentiate the One Buddha Vehicle and speak of three. Śāriputra, if my disciples call themselves arhats or pratyekabuddhas, and do not hear or know that the Tathagatas only teach and convert Bodhisattvas, these are not my disciples; they are not arhats, and they are not pratyekabuddhas.”

At that time, Śāriputra, knowing the doubts in the hearts of the four groups of the assembly and not yet understanding himself, said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, for what cause and for what reason are you so earnestly praising the first expedient means of the Buddhas, this profound, subtle, and difficult-to-understand Dharma? Since the past, I have never heard such a teaching from the Buddha. Now, the four groups of the assembly are all in doubt. We only wish the World-Honored One would explain this matter. Why does the World-Honored One so earnestly praise this profound, subtle, and difficult-to-understand Dharma?”

The Buddha again stopped Śāriputra: “If I were to explain this matter, all the gods, humans, and asuras in the world would be shocked and full of doubt. The arrogant monks will fall into a great abyss.”

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

    "The King of Dharma, the Supreme Honored One,
Please speak, do not worry.
There are immeasurable beings in this assembly
Who are able to believe it with reverence."

At that time, Śāriputra, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

    "The supreme, Double-Footed Honored One,
Please preach the first Dharma.
I am the Buddha’s eldest son;
Please condescend to explain and differentiate it."

At that time, Śāriputra again said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, please speak, please speak. In this assembly, there are hundreds of thousands of millions like us, who from lifetime to lifetime have been converted by the Buddha. Such people will certainly be able to believe with reverence. For a long night, they will be at peace and receive great benefit.”

“Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions, there are not even two vehicles, let alone three. Śāriputra, the Buddhas appear in the five turbid and evil ages: the turbidity of the kalpa, the turbidity of defilements, the turbidity of sentient beings, the turbidity of views, and the turbidity of life.

Śāriputra, if my disciples call themselves arhats or pratyekabuddhas, and do not hear or know that the Tathagatas only teach and convert Bodhisattvas, these are not my disciples; they are not arhats, and they are not pratyekabuddhas.”

At that time, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: “This assembly of mine is no longer filled with twigs and leaves; only the pure, true fruit remains. Śāriputra, it is good that these arrogant people have withdrawn. You should now listen well, for I will speak to you.”

At that time, Śāriputra, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

Śāriputra said: “Yes, World-Honored One, we joyfully wish to hear.”

At that time, the World-Honored One again spoke in verse:

For a long night, they will be at peace and receive great benefit.”

At that time, among the great assembly, there were twelve hundred śrāvaka arhats who had ended all defilements, such as Ajñāta-Kauṇḍinya and others. Also, monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen who had conceived the mind of a śrāvaka or a pratyekabuddha, each thought to themselves: “For what reason does the World-Honored One so earnestly praise these expedient means, and say that the Dharma the Buddha has attained is so profound and difficult to understand, and that what he has to say is so difficult to grasp, beyond the reach of all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas? The Buddha teaches the meaning of a single liberation, and we have also attained this Dharma and reached nirvāṇa. Yet now, we do not know what this meaning is leading to.”

At that time, Śāriputra, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

At that time, Śāriputra, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

“Such a wonderful Dharma as this is preached by the Buddhas only from time to time, just as the udumbara flower appears only once in a while. Śāriputra, you should believe what the Buddha says, for his words are not empty falsehoods. Śāriputra, the Buddhas preach the Dharma according to what is appropriate, but their intent is difficult to grasp. Why? Because I use countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas. This Dharma cannot be understood by thinking and distinguishing. Only the Buddhas can know it. Why? Because the World-Honored Buddhas appear in the world for only One Great Purpose.

Śāriputra, what is meant by the World-Honored Buddhas appearing in the world for only One Great Purpose? The World-Honored Buddhas appear in the world to enable sentient beings to open the Buddha's wisdom and insight, so they may become pure. They appear in the world to show sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom and insight. They appear in the world to cause sentient beings to awaken to the Buddha's wisdom and insight. They appear in the world to enable sentient beings to enter into the path of the Buddha's wisdom and insight. Śāriputra, this is what is meant by the Buddhas appearing in the world for One Great Purpose.”

At that time, the World-Honored One calmly arose from his meditation and said to Śāriputra: "The wisdom of the Buddhas is profoundly immeasurable. The gate to this wisdom is difficult to comprehend and difficult to enter. It is something that no śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha can know. Why is this? The Buddha has served and been close to hundreds of thousands of millions of countless Buddhas, fully practicing their immeasurable path. He has progressed with valor and diligence, and his name is heard everywhere. He has perfected a profound and unprecedented Dharma. The teachings he gives are always appropriate, but their intent is difficult to comprehend.

Śāriputra, since I attained Buddhahood, I have used various causes, various parables, and a wide array of teachings and countless expedient means to guide sentient beings, enabling them to leave all attachments.

None can measure them.

I completely practiced all the paths.
This profound and subtle Dharma
Is difficult to see and difficult to understand."

At that time, among the great assembly, there were twelve hundred śrāvaka arhats who had ended all defilements, such as Ajñāta-Kauṇḍinya and others. Also, monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen who had conceived the mind of a śrāvaka or a pratyekabuddha, each thought to themselves: “For what reason does the World-Honored One so earnestly praise these expedient means, and say that the Dharma the Buddha has attained is so profound and difficult to understand, and that what he has to say is so difficult to grasp, beyond the reach of all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas?

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 3: A Parable
======================================================================


At that time, Śāriputra was filled with immense joy. He rose, joined his palms, and, looking up at the World-Honored One’s revered face, said to the Buddha: “Having heard this Dharma sound from the World-Honored One today, my heart is filled with unprecedented joy. Why? In the past, when I heard this Dharma from the Buddha and saw the Bodhisattvas receiving prophecies of their future Buddhahood, I was not included in this, and I felt great sadness, as if I had lost the Tathagata’s immeasurable wisdom and insight.

“Śāriputra, imagine a village or town where there is a great elder who is old and frail. He has boundless wealth, many fields, houses, and servants. His house is vast, but it has only one gate. It is home to many people—one hundred, two hundred, even five hundred—who live there. The halls and pavilions are old and decaying, the walls are collapsing, the pillars are rotten at their base, and the beams are dangerously leaning. All around, a great fire suddenly erupts, burning down the house. The elder’s children, whether ten, twenty, or thirty of them, are inside this house. The elder sees this great fire starting on all four sides and is greatly alarmed. He thinks: ‘Although I can escape through this one burning gate in safety, my children, who are inside this burning house, are attached to their games and do not feel or know the danger. They are not alarmed or frightened. The fire is coming closer to their bodies, and the pain is about to reach them, but their hearts do not feel loathing, and they have no intention of getting out.’”

“Śāriputra, when that Buddha appears, although it will not be in an evil age, he will, due to his original vow, preach the Dharma of the three vehicles. That kalpa will be named Great Jewel Adornment. Why is it named Great Jewel Adornment? Because in that land, the Bodhisattvas are the great jewels. Those Bodhisattvas will be immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable, beyond the reach of calculation and parables. Only the power of a Buddha’s wisdom can know them. When they wish to walk, precious flowers will support their feet. These Bodhisattvas will not have just begun to conceive the mind. They will have planted roots of virtue long ago, cultivated pure conduct under immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, and always received praise from the Buddhas. They will constantly cultivate the Buddha’s wisdom, be complete in great supernatural powers, and be skilled in knowing the gateways to all Dharmas. They will be simple and honest, without falseness, and their resolve will be firm. Such Bodhisattvas will fill that land.”

“Śāriputra, what do you think? Was the elder being deceitful when he gave each of his children a single, magnificent, jeweled great cart?”

“Śāriputra, the life span of Flower Light Buddha will be twelve minor kalpas, not including the time before he was a prince and had not yet become a Buddha. The people in his land will live for eight minor kalpas. After Flower Light Tathagata has been in the world for twelve minor kalpas, he will give a prophecy to the Bodhisattva Firm-Fullness for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. He will tell the monks: ‘This Firm-Fullness Bodhisattva will next become a Buddha, with the title Flower-Foot Peaceful-Practice Tathagata, Arhat, Samyaksambuddha, and his Buddha land will also be like this.’ Śāriputra, after the passing of this Flower Light Buddha, his True Dharma will last for thirty-two minor kalpas, and his Dharma-Image will also last for thirty-two minor kalpas.”

    "I have heard this sound of Dharma"

This is a translation of the long, poetic version of the Parable of the Burning House from the Lotus Sutra, a core teaching that you've been bringing to life in your illustrated adaptation. This verse provides a much more detailed and graphic depiction of the suffering within the "burning house" of the three realms.

'When you children come out,
I will give you the three carts
According to your wishes.'
Now is the time,
Please give them to us.""

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 4: Belief and Understanding

“Śāriputra, the Tathagata also thinks: ‘If I were to abandon expedient means and use only my supernatural powers and the power of my wisdom to praise the Tathagata’s wisdom and insight, powers, and fearlessness for sentient beings, they would not be saved by this. Why? These sentient beings have not yet escaped birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, grief, and suffering and are being burned by the fire of the three realms. How could they comprehend the Buddha’s wisdom?’”

At that time, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: “I now declare in the great assembly of gods, humans, śramaṇas, and brahmins that I once, for the sake of the supreme Way, taught and converted you under two hundred thousand millions of Buddhas. You have also followed me and received my teachings for a long night of existence. I used expedient means to guide you, which is why you were born into my Dharma. Śāriputra, in the past, I taught you to aspire to the Buddha Way, but you have now forgotten it completely and instead thought you had attained extinction. I now wish to make you recall your original vow and the path you have traveled. Therefore, I am preaching this Great Vehicle sutra for the śrāvakas, named the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a Dharma for Bodhisattvas protected and remembered by the Buddhas.”

“Śāriputra, the elder then thinks: ‘I am strong and capable, so I will take them out of the house in a basket or on a table.’ But then he thinks again: ‘This house has only one gate, and it is narrow and small. My children are young and ignorant. They are attached to their playthings and might fall and be burned by the fire. I must speak to them of the danger. This house is already on fire. They should quickly get out now, so they will not be burned and harmed by the fire.’ Having thought this, he told his children just as he had planned: ‘You must get out quickly!’ The father, out of compassion, used gentle words and parables to persuade them, but the children were attached to their games and would not believe him. They were not alarmed or afraid and had no intention of getting out. They also did not know what fire was, what the house was, or what a loss it would be. They just ran back and forth, playing, and only looked at their father.”

At that time, Śāriputra, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

The Buddha said to Śāriputra: “Well said, well said. It is just as you have said. Śāriputra, the Tathagata is also like this. He is the father of all the world. He has completely extinguished all fear, decay, worries, and afflictions and has perfected immeasurable wisdom and insight, power, and fearlessness. He has great supernatural powers and the power of wisdom. He is complete in the perfection of expedient means and wisdom, and his great compassion is constant and tireless. He constantly seeks what is good to benefit all.

The Buddha, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

He is born into the decaying, burning house of the three realms to save sentient beings from the fire of birth, old age, sickness, and death, sorrow, grief, suffering, and affliction, ignorance, and the three poisons. He teaches and converts them so they may attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. He sees that all sentient beings are being burned by birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, grief, and suffering. They also receive various sufferings because of the five desires and the pursuit of wealth. Moreover, because of their greedy attachment and pursuit, they receive present sufferings and will later receive the sufferings of the hells, animal realms, and hungry ghosts. Or, if they are born in the heavens or among humans, they suffer from poverty, separation from loved ones, and the pain of meeting those they hate, and so on.

“Śāriputra, just as that elder first used three carts to lure his children and then gave them only one great cart, adorned with treasures, which was the most safe and supreme, that elder was not guilty of a lie. The Tathagata is also like this; he is not guilty of any lie. He first preaches the three vehicles to guide sentient beings, and then he saves and liberates them with only the Great Vehicle. Why? Because the Tathagata has an immeasurable treasury of wisdom, powers, and fearlessness—all the Dharmas—and is able to give the Great Vehicle Dharma to all sentient beings, even if they cannot all receive it completely.”

“Śāriputra, it is like that elder, who, although he had great physical strength, did not use it. Instead, he used earnest expedient means to rescue his children from the danger of the burning house and then gave each of them a great jeweled cart. The Tathagata is also like this. Although he has power and fearlessness, he does not use them. Instead, he uses the wisdom of expedient means to rescue sentient beings from the burning house of the three realms. He preaches the three vehicles—the śrāvaka vehicle, the pratyekabuddha vehicle, and the Buddha vehicle—and says: ‘You should not delight in dwelling in the burning house of the three realms. Do not covet the coarse and broken forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and sensations. If you are greedy and attached to them, you will be burned. You must quickly leave the three realms. You will then attain the three vehicles—the śrāvaka vehicle, the pratyekabuddha vehicle, and the Buddha vehicle. I will guarantee this for you now; it is not a lie. You should only diligently cultivate with vigor.’ The Tathagata uses this expedient means to induce and lead sentient beings. He then says: ‘You should know that these three Dharmas are all praised by the sages. They are free, unattached, and without seeking. By riding in these three vehicles, you will find joy in the unconditioned roots, powers, awakenings, ways, meditation, liberation, and samadhis, and you will attain immeasurable, peaceful, and joyful happiness.’”

At that time, the four groups of the assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen, along with the gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, and mahoragas—seeing Śāriputra receive the prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi directly from the Buddha, were filled with great joy and unbounded delight. They each took off their upper garments to offer them to the Buddha. Śakra, the King of the Devas, the Brahma King, and others, along with countless heavenly beings, also offered wonderful heavenly robes and heavenly maṇḍārava and mahāmaṇḍārava flowers to the Buddha. The heavenly robes they scattered remained in the air and turned by themselves. The heavenly music, of hundreds of thousands of kinds, played all at once in the air, raining down all the heavenly flowers. They said: “The Buddha first turned the Dharma wheel in Benares, and today he turns the supreme and greatest Dharma wheel once more.”

“Śāriputra, if there are sentient beings who have an inner nature of wisdom, who hear the Dharma from the World-Honored Buddha, believe in it, and with earnest diligence wish to quickly leave the three realms to seek their own nirvana, this is called the śrāvaka vehicle, like those children who sought the goat cart and came out of the burning house. If there are sentient beings who hear the Dharma from the World-Honored Buddha, believe in it, and with earnest diligence seek self-enlightened wisdom, delighting in quiet solitude and knowing the causes and conditions of all Dharmas, this is called the pratyekabuddha vehicle, like those children who sought the deer cart and came out of the burning house. If there are sentient beings who hear the Dharma from the World-Honored Buddha, believe in it, and diligently cultivate with vigor, seeking all-knowing wisdom—the Buddha’s wisdom, self-attained wisdom, and the wisdom of a teacherless teacher, as well as the Tathagata’s wisdom, powers, and fearlessness—and who pity and seek to bring peace and joy to immeasurable sentient beings and to benefit gods and humans, saving them all, this is called the Great Vehicle. The Bodhisattvas seek this vehicle, and so they are called Mahāsattvas, like those children who sought the ox cart and came out of the burning house.”

World-Honored One, I often stayed alone in the mountains, forests, or under trees, whether sitting or walking. I would always think: ‘We have entered the same Dharma nature. Why has the Tathagata saved us with the Small Vehicle Dharma?’ This was our own fault, not the World-Honored One’s. Why? If we had waited for the reason to be revealed and then cultivated to attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, we would have certainly been saved by the Great Vehicle. But we did not understand the Buddha’s expedient means and his teachings according to our capacity. When we first heard the Dharma, we met it, believed in it, and sought to realize it with our minds. World-Honored One, since that time, I have constantly reproached myself, day and night.

“At that time, when the children heard their father speak of the precious toys, which suited their desires, their hearts were all filled with courage. They pushed and shoved each other, racing to get out of the burning house. At that moment, the elder saw that all his children had safely escaped. They were all sitting in the open, at the crossroad, with no more danger. Their minds were at ease, and they were filled with boundless joy. Then the children said to their father: ‘Father, you promised us the wonderful toys, the goat carts, the deer carts, and the ox carts. Please give them to us now.’”

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 4: Belief and Understanding

The Buddha, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

    "Śāriputra, in a future life,"

“Śāriputra, in a future lifetime, after immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable kalpas, you will make offerings to a great many millions of Buddhas, uphold the true Dharma, and completely practice the path of a Bodhisattva. You will then attain Buddhahood with the title Flower Light Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land will be named Stainless, and that land will be level, pure, and beautifully adorned, peaceful, prosperous, and teeming with gods and humans. Its ground will be of lapis lazuli, with eight intersecting roads, and golden ropes will line their sides. Beside them, there will be rows of trees of seven treasures, always bearing flowers and fruits. Flower Light Tathagata will also use the three vehicles to teach and convert sentient beings.”

“At that time, the elder thought: ‘This house is now engulfed in a great fire. If I and my children do not get out now, we will surely be burned. I must now devise an expedient means to enable my children to escape this danger.’ The father knew that his children had various things they liked, all sorts of rare and curious toys, and that their hearts were surely attached to them. So he told them: ‘The various rare and wonderful playthings that you love are difficult to get. If you do not take them now, you will surely regret it later. All these different goat carts, deer carts, and ox carts are now outside the gate for you to play with. You should quickly come out of this burning house! Whatever you wish for, I will give it all to you.’”

    "Imagine an elder
Who has a great house,
This house is old and worn out,
And it's completely dilapidated.
The halls and rooms are high and dangerous,
The pillars' roots are rotted and falling,
The beams and ridgepoles are leaning,
And the foundations are crumbling.
The walls are cracked and caved in,
The mud plaster is falling off.
The thatch is scattered and falling,
The rafters and beams are askew.
The fence all around is crooked,
And it is filled with all sorts of filth.
Five hundred people
Live inside it."

“Śāriputra, for this reason, you should know that due to the power of the Buddhas’ expedient means, they differentiate and speak of three vehicles, although there is only One Buddha Vehicle.”

    "In the past, in Benares,"

At that time, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: “Did I not say before that the World-Honored Buddhas use various causes, parables, and words, and expedient means to preach the Dharma, all for the sake of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi? All these teachings were to convert Bodhisattvas. But Śāriputra, I will now use a parable to further clarify this meaning. For all wise people, a parable helps them to understand.”

“Śāriputra, just as that elder saw that all his children had safely escaped the burning house and reached a place of no fear, he thought of his boundless wealth and gave each of them a great cart. The Tathagata is also like this. He is the father of all sentient beings. When he sees countless millions of sentient beings escape the suffering of the three realms and their dangerous path through the gate of the Buddha’s teaching and attain the joy of nirvana, the Tathagata then thinks: ‘I have a treasury of immeasurable and boundless wisdom, powers, and fearlessness, and all the Dharmas of a Buddha. These sentient beings are all my children, and I will give them the Great Vehicle equally. I will not allow anyone to attain extinction alone.’ He saves all of them with the Tathagata’s extinction. Those sentient beings who have escaped the three realms are all given the tools of the Buddhas’ meditation and liberation to enjoy. These are all of one form and one kind, praised by the sages, and can create pure, wonderful, and supreme happiness.”

At that time, Śāriputra said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, I am no longer in doubt, as I have received the prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi directly from the Buddha. But these twelve hundred Arhats who are free in mind, in the past they were still in the stage of learning. The Buddha always taught them, saying, ‘My Dharma can free you from birth, old age, sickness, and death and lead you to ultimate nirvana.’ These learners and non-learners also thought that by freeing themselves from the view of a self and the views of existence and non-existence, they had attained nirvana. But now, in the presence of the World-Honored One, they have heard what they have never heard before and are all in doubt. Please, World-Honored One, we ask that you explain the reason for this for the four groups of the assembly, so they may be freed from their doubts and regrets.”

But today, from the Buddha, I have heard a Dharma I have never heard before, an unprecedented Dharma, which has cut off all my doubts and regrets. My body and mind are at ease and have found true peace. Today I know that I am truly a son of the Buddha, born from the Buddha’s mouth, transformed by the Dharma, and a sharer in the Buddha’s Dharma.”

    "Imagine an elder"

The Parable of the Burning House

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

Śāriputra said: “No, World-Honored One. The elder’s only intention was to get his children out of the fire and save their lives. It was not a lie. Why? By saving their lives, they had already gained the most wonderful treasure. What is more, he used an expedient means to rescue them from the burning house. World-Honored One, even if that elder had not given them a single small cart, it would still not have been a lie. Why? The elder’s first thought was: ‘I will use an expedient means to get my children out.’ For this reason, there was no falsehood. How much more so, when the elder knew his own boundless wealth and, wishing to benefit his children, gave each of them a great cart.”

Sentient beings are sunk in these sufferings but are joyful and play games. They do not feel or know it; they are not alarmed or frightened. They do not feel loathing or seek liberation. They run back and forth in this burning house of the three realms. Although they encounter great suffering, they do not consider it a problem. Śāriputra, when the Buddha sees this, he thinks: ‘I am the father of sentient beings. I should pull them out of this suffering and danger and give them the joy of the Buddha’s boundless and immeasurable wisdom, so they may play happily.’”

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 4: Belief and Understanding
======================================================================


World-Honored One, when the poor son heard his father’s words, he was filled with great joy, gaining what he had never had before. He thought: ‘I originally had no mind to seek anything, but now this treasure has come to me naturally.’”

Translated by Tripitaka Master Kumarajiva of the Kucha Kingdom in the Later Qin Dynasty, by imperial decree.

The two servants then went and found the poor son. When they had found him, they told him all the above. At that time, the poor son first took his wages and then proceeded to remove the dung. The father saw his son and felt pity and a strange joy. On another day, from a window, he saw his son’s body was thin and haggard, covered in dirt and dust, and was filthy and impure. He then took off his pearl necklaces, fine and soft robes, and adornments. He changed into a coarse, dirty, and grimy robe, and covered his body with dust. In his right hand, he held a tool for removing dung, pretending to be afraid of something. He said to the workers: ‘You must all work hard and not be lazy or rest.’ By using this expedient means, he got close to his son.

“At that time, the elder wished to lure his son and devised an expedient means. He secretly sent two servants, who were haggard in appearance and without dignity. He told them: ‘You can go to him and slowly tell the poor son that there is a job here and that you will give him double the usual wage. If the poor son agrees, bring him back to work. If he asks what kind of work it is, you can tell him that you will hire him to remove dung, and that the two of you will work with him.’

“We are the leaders of the monastic community, and our years have passed and our bodies are decaying. We considered ourselves to have attained nirvana and to be no longer capable of anything or needing to seek Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi further. In the past, when the World-Honored One preached the Dharma for a long time, we were in the assembly, but our bodies were tired and lazy. We only thought of emptiness, signlessness, and purposelessness. We did not delight in the Bodhisattva’s Dharmas, their playful supernatural powers, purifying Buddha lands, or saving sentient beings. Why? The World-Honored One caused us to leave the three realms and attain the realization of nirvana. And now that our years have passed and our bodies are decaying, we did not give rise to a single thought of delight in the Buddha’s teaching on the Bodhisattva’s Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.

At that time, the servant ran quickly and grabbed him. The poor son was shocked and cried out in distress: ‘I have not wronged you! Why are you grabbing me?’ The servant held him even tighter and forcibly dragged him back. At that time, the poor son thought to himself that he was innocent, but was being imprisoned. He was sure he would die. He became even more terrified, fainted, and fell to the ground. From a distance, the father saw this and said to the servant: ‘You don’t need this person. Do not bring him back by force. Sprinkle cold water on his face to revive him, and do not speak to him further.’

“At that time, the rich elder, from his lion’s seat, saw his son and immediately recognized him. His heart was filled with great joy. He thought: ‘My wealth and treasury now have someone to entrust to! I have always thought of this son, but have had no way to see him, and now he has come on his own accord. This is a fulfillment of my wish. Although I am old and decaying, I am still greedy for my son.’ He immediately sent a nearby servant to quickly chase him and bring him back.

At that time, the poor son traveled through the villages and passed through the various countries and cities, eventually reaching the city where his father had settled. The father had been thinking of his son and felt heartbroken, as they had been separated for more than fifty years. He had never spoken of this matter to anyone, only contemplating it himself with sorrow and regret. He thought to himself that he was old and decaying, had much wealth, gold, silver, and precious treasures filling his storerooms, but had no child. If he were to die suddenly, his wealth would be scattered, and he would have no one to entrust it to. For this reason, he earnestly and constantly remembered his son. He also thought: ‘If I could find my son and entrust my wealth to him, I would be at ease and happy, without any more worries.’”

“World-Honored One, at that time, the poor son, working as a day laborer, eventually arrived at his father's house and stood outside the gate. From a distance, he saw his father sitting on a lion’s seat, with a jeweled table supporting his feet. All the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and elders respectfully surrounded him. His body was adorned with pearl necklaces, worth tens of millions, and his officials, citizens, and servants held white whisks and waited on him on his right and left. He was covered with a jeweled canopy, with banners of various flowers hanging down. Perfumed water was sprinkled on the ground, and famous flowers were scattered. Precious treasures were arranged in rows, being brought in and out. There were all kinds of such adornments, and his majesty was exceptionally revered.

His father had been searching for his son but could not find him and had stopped in a certain city. His family was very rich with boundless treasures—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, coral, amber, crystal, pearls, and so on. His storerooms were all overflowing. He had many servants, ministers, officials, and citizens, and countless elephants, horses, carriages, and cattle. The profits from his businesses spread throughout other countries, and he had many merchants and traders.

“World-Honored One, at that time, the elder became sick and knew he would not live much longer. He said to the poor son: ‘I now have a lot of gold, silver, and precious treasures, and my storerooms are overflowing. You know the exact amounts that have been brought in and out. This is what is in my heart, and you should understand my intention. Why? From now on, I am no different from you. You must put your heart into this and not allow anything to be lost.’

At that time, Mahākāśyapa, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

Why? Because the father knew that his son’s aspirations were lowly. He knew that his own status as a rich nobleman would be a burden for his son. He knew this was his son, but he used an expedient means and did not tell anyone that this was his son. The servant said to him: ‘I will now let you go. You can go wherever you want.’ The poor son was overjoyed, gaining something he had never had before. He rose from the ground and went to the poor village to seek clothing and food.”

“World-Honored One, we now wish to speak with a parable to make this meaning clear. It is like a person who, when he was young, was foolish and left his father and ran away. He lived in another country for a long time—for ten, twenty, or even fifty years. When he had grown up, he became poor and wandered in all four directions, seeking clothing and food. He gradually traveled and eventually happened to come to his home country.

Now, in the presence of the Buddha, we hear the śrāvakas being given a prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Our hearts are filled with great joy and have gained what we never had. We did not think that today, we would suddenly hear this rare Dharma, and we deeply congratulate ourselves. We have gained a great benefit and immeasurable treasures that we did not even seek.”

The Parable of the Poor Son (Prose)

    "We today,"

Later, he said to him: ‘Hey, my boy! You must always work here and not go anywhere else. I will raise your wages. Whatever you need—bowls, pots, rice, flour, salt, vinegar, and other things—do not hesitate. There will also be older servants to help you. Be at ease, I am like your father; do not worry. Why? Because I am old, and you are young and strong. When you work, you are never deceitful or lazy, nor do you show anger or complain. I have not seen any of these faults in you, unlike in other workers. From now on, I will treat you as my own son.’

At that time, the elder even gave him a new name, calling him ‘son.’ At that time, the poor son, though happy with this new life, still thought of himself as a lowly hired hand. For this reason, for twenty years, he was constantly given the job of removing dung. After this time, they had mutual trust, and he could come and go freely. However, he still lived in his original place.”

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Volume Three

After a short time, the father knew that his son’s mind had gradually opened up and that he had achieved great resolve, no longer holding his former low opinion of himself. When he was about to pass away, he summoned his son and also gathered his relatives, clan members, kings, ministers, Kshatriyas, and elders. When they had all gathered, he publicly declared: ‘Gentlemen, you should know that this is my son, whom I fathered. He left me and ran away from a certain city and wandered and suffered for more than fifty years. His original name was such-and-such, and my name is such-and-such. In the past, in my home city, I worriedly searched for him, and I suddenly met him here. This is truly my son, and I am truly his father. All my wealth and possessions are now his. He knows all that has been brought in and out before.’

At that time, the poor son accepted the instructions and took charge of all the gold, silver, precious treasures, and storerooms, but he did not have a single thought of taking a meal for himself. However, he still lived in his original place and had not yet been able to abandon his lowly mindset.

At that time, the wise Subhūti, Mahākātyāyana, Mahākāśyapa, and Mahāmaudgalyāyana, having heard the unprecedented Dharma from the Buddha and seen the World-Honored One give Śāriputra the prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, were filled with a rare and joyful feeling in their hearts. They immediately rose from their seats, straightened their robes, bared their right shoulders, knelt on their right knees, joined their palms with a single mind, bowed respectfully, and looked up at the Buddha’s revered face. They said to the Buddha:

Mahākāśyapa's Verse

But the World-Honored One knew that our hearts were attached to meager desires and delighted in the small Dharma, so he let us go and did not differentiate for us that we would also have a share in the treasury of the Tathagata’s wisdom and insight. The World-Honored One, with the power of expedient means, preached the Tathagata’s wisdom. We received a single day’s wages of nirvana from the Buddha and thought it was a great gain. For this Great Vehicle, we had no resolve to seek it. And we, using the Tathagata’s wisdom, have revealed and expounded it for the Bodhisattvas, but for ourselves, we had no such aspirations. Why? Because the Buddha knew our hearts delighted in the small Dharma, and with the power of expedient means, he preached for us according to our needs, but we did not know that we were truly sons of the Buddha.

Now we finally know that the World-Honored One is not stingy with the Buddha’s wisdom. Why? We have been true sons of the Buddha since the past, but we only delighted in the small Dharma. If we had the mind to delight in the great, the Buddha would have preached the Great Vehicle Dharma to us. In this sutra, only the One Vehicle is preached, but in the past, in front of the Bodhisattvas, he disparaged the śrāvakas who delighted in the small Dharma. But the Buddha truly converts us with the Great Vehicle. This is why we say we originally had no mind to seek it. But now, the great treasure of the Dharma King has come to us naturally, and we have attained everything that the sons of the Buddha should attain.”

“World-Honored One, the great wealthy elder is the Tathagata. We are all like the sons of the Buddha. The Tathagata always says that we are his children. World-Honored One, we have been tormented by the three sufferings in the cycle of life and death, deluded and ignorant, attached to the small Dharma. Today, the World-Honored One has caused us to contemplate and cast away the dung of all the Dharmas of empty discourse. In this, we have cultivated with diligence and attained the wages of a single day of nirvana. Having gained this, our hearts were filled with great joy and felt content. We thought to ourselves: ‘Because we have diligently cultivated the Buddha’s Dharma, our gains are great and plentiful.’

When the poor son saw his father’s great power and influence, he was filled with fear and regretted coming there. He secretly thought: ‘This must be a king or someone of equal rank. This is not a place where I can earn money with my labor. It is better to go to a poor village, where I can use my strength to work and easily get food and clothing. If I stay here for a long time, I might be forced and compelled to work for him.’ Having thought this, he quickly ran away.”

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 5: A Parable of the Medicinal Herbs
======================================================================


The Tathagata knows the Dharma of one form and one taste, which is the form of liberation, the form of leaving, and the form of extinction, ultimately nirvana, the form of constant stillness and extinction, which ultimately returns to emptiness. When the Buddha knows this, he observes the desires of sentient beings’ hearts and protects them. Therefore, he does not immediately preach All-Knowing Wisdom to them. Kāśyapa, you are truly rare, to be able to know that the Tathagata preaches the Dharma according to what is appropriate, and to be able to believe in and accept it. Why? The World-Honored Buddhas preach the Dharma according to what is appropriate, and it is difficult to comprehend and difficult to know.”

Kāśyapa, you should know that the Tathagata is the King of all Dharmas. Whatever he says is not false. He expounds the Dharma with the wisdom of expedient means for all phenomena, and the Dharma he preaches all reaches the ground of All-Knowing Wisdom. The Tathagata knows and perceives the destination of all phenomena and also knows the deeply held thoughts of all sentient beings. He has a clear and unhindered understanding, and for all phenomena, he has fully and clearly comprehended them, revealing all wisdom to sentient beings.”

The Parable of the Great Cloud

    "The King of Dharma, who breaks through existence,
Appears in the world,
And according to the desires of sentient beings,
He preaches the Dharma in various ways.
The Tathagata is revered,
His wisdom is deep and far-reaching.
He was silent for a long time regarding this essential,
And did not rush to preach it."

At that time, the World-Honored One said to Mahākāśyapa and the other great disciples: “Well said, well said, Kāśyapa! You have spoken well of the Tathagata’s true merits. It is truly as you say. The Tathagata also has immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable merits. If you were to speak of them for immeasurable millions of kalpas, you could not exhaust them.

“Kāśyapa, imagine the great world of three thousand realms, with its mountains, rivers, valleys, and lands. The trees, shrubs, forests, and all the medicinal herbs born there are of different kinds, with various names and forms. A dense cloud spreads out, covering the entire great world of three thousand realms. At the same time, it pours rain equally, and its moisture is spread everywhere. The trees, shrubs, forests, and all the medicinal herbs—those with small roots, small stems, small branches, and small leaves; those with medium roots, medium stems, medium branches, and medium leaves; and those with great roots, great stems, great branches, and great leaves—all the plants, both great and small, receive the rain according to their superior, medium, or inferior capacity. The one cloud pours rain, and according to their kind and nature, they all grow, and their flowers and fruits bloom and mature. Although they are born from the same earth and nourished by the same rain, all the plants have differences.”

“At that time, countless millions of sentient beings came to the Buddha to listen to the Dharma. The Tathagata then observed the sharpness or dullness of the faculties of these sentient beings, their diligence or laziness. According to their capacity, he preached the Dharma to them, in countless ways, causing them all to rejoice and gain great benefit. When these sentient beings hear this Dharma, they find peace and comfort in their present lives, and they will be born in good places in their future lives. They will receive the joy of the Way and will also hear the Dharma. Having heard the Dharma, they are freed from all obstacles. For all phenomena, according to their capacity, they gradually enter the Way. It is like that great cloud that rains upon all the trees, shrubs, forests, and all the medicinal herbs, and according to their kind and nature, they are all fully nourished, and each one is able to grow.”

“Kāśyapa, you should know that the Tathagata is also like this. He appears in the world like a great cloud rising. With a great sound, he reaches universally throughout the worlds of gods, humans, and asuras, just as that great cloud covers the three thousand great worlds. In the great assembly, he proclaims: ‘I am the Tathagata, the Worthy One, the Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. I save those who are unsaved, I enlighten those who are unenlightened, I bring peace to those who are not at peace, and I enable those who have not attained nirvana to attain it. I truly know this world and the world to come. I am the All-Knower, the All-Seer, the one who knows the Way, who opens the Way, and who preaches the Way. All of you—gods, humans, and asuras—should all come here to listen to the Dharma.’”

“The Dharma preached by the Tathagata has one form and one taste, which is the form of liberation, the form of leaving, and the form of extinction, ultimately leading to All-Knowing Wisdom. When a sentient being hears the Dharma of the Tathagata, whether they uphold it, read it, recite it, or practice it as it is taught, they do not realize the merits they gain. Why? Only the Tathagata knows the kind, form, and nature of these sentient beings. He knows what they think, what they contemplate, what they cultivate. He knows how they think, how they contemplate, how they cultivate, and with what Dharma they think, with what Dharma they contemplate, with what Dharma they cultivate, and with what Dharma they attain what Dharma. Sentient beings dwell on various grounds, but only the Tathagata sees them as they truly are, clearly and without hindrance. It is like the trees, shrubs, forests, and all the medicinal herbs, who do not know their superior, medium, or inferior nature.

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

At that time, the World-Honored One, knowing the thoughts in the hearts of his great disciples, said to all the monks: “This Subhūti, in a future lifetime, will serve and see three million million nayuta Buddhas, make offerings to them, show respect, reverence, and praise, and will constantly cultivate pure conduct and be complete in the Bodhisattva Way. In his last body, he will become a Buddha, named Name and Form Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa will be named Having-Treasures, and the land will be named Treasure-Born. His land will be level, with a ground of crystal, and jeweled trees will serve as adornments. There will be no hills, pits, sand, rocks, thorns, or filth. Jeweled flowers will cover the ground, and it will be completely pure. The people of his land will all live in jeweled towers and wonderful mansions. The śrāvaka disciples will be immeasurable and boundless, beyond the reach of calculation and parables. The Bodhisattva assemblies will be countless millions of nayuta. The Buddha’s life span will be twelve minor kalpas. The True Dharma will remain in the world for twenty minor kalpas, and the Dharma-Image will also remain for twenty minor kalpas. That Buddha will always dwell in the air and preach the Dharma for the assembly, saving and liberating immeasurable Bodhisattvas and śrāvaka assemblies.”

At that time, the World-Honored One, having spoken this verse, said to the great assembly, and proclaimed: “My disciple Mahākāśyapa, in a future lifetime, will see and serve three million million Buddhas, make offerings to them, show respect, reverence, and praise, and will widely preach the immeasurable great Dharma of the Buddhas. In his last body, he will become a Buddha, named Light Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land will be named Virtue-Light, and the kalpa will be named Great Adornment. The Buddha's life span will be twelve minor kalpas. The True Dharma will remain in the world for twenty minor kalpas, and the Dharma-Image will also remain for twenty minor kalpas. His land will be adorned, without any filth, rocks, tiles, thorns, or uncleanliness. The land will be level, without any hills, depressions, pits, or mounds. The ground will be of lapis lazuli, with rows of jeweled trees, and golden ropes will line the sides of the roads. Various precious flowers will be scattered everywhere, and it will be completely pure. In his land, the Bodhisattvas will be immeasurable thousands of millions, and the śrāvaka assembly will also be countless. There will be no demonic affairs, and although there will be demons and their followers, they will all protect the Buddha’s Dharma.”

    "Monks,
I now tell you all,
You must all be of one mind
And listen to what I say."

    "My disciple,
This great Mahāmaudgalyāyana,
After leaving this body,
Will see eight thousand"

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

    "The great, valiant, and fierce World-Honored One,
The King of Dharma among all the Śākyas,
Out of compassion for us,
Has given us the voice of a Buddha."

At that time, the World-Honored One again said to the assembly of monks: “I now tell you, this great Mahākātyāyana, in a future lifetime, will use various offerings to serve and make offerings to eight thousand million Buddhas, with reverence and respect. After these Buddhas pass away, he will erect stupas for each of them, a thousand yojanas tall, and five hundred yojanas in both length and width. They will all be made of the seven treasures—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, tridacna, agate, pearls, and rose quartz. He will use all kinds of flowers, garlands, paste incense, powdered incense, burning incense, silken canopies, banners, and streamers to make offerings to the stupas and temples. After this, he will again make offerings to twenty thousand million Buddhas, in the same way. Having made offerings to all these Buddhas, and being complete in the Bodhisattva Way, he will attain Buddhahood, with the title Jambunada Gold Light Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land will be level, with a ground of crystal, and jeweled trees will serve as adornments. Golden ropes will line the sides of the roads, and wonderful flowers will cover the ground. It will be completely pure and those who see it will rejoice. There will be no four evil destinies: hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras. There will be many gods, humans, śrāvaka assemblies, and Bodhisattva assemblies, immeasurable millions, to adorn his land. The Buddha's life span will be twelve minor kalpas. The True Dharma will remain in the world for twenty minor kalpas, and the Dharma-Image will also remain for twenty minor kalpas.”

    "I tell all the monks,
With my Buddha eye,
I see this Kāśyapa.
In a future life,
After countless kalpas,
He will attain Buddhahood.
In a future lifetime,
He will make offerings to and serve,
Three million million
World-Honored Buddhas.
For the sake of the Buddha's wisdom,
He will purely cultivate good conduct."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

    "Monks,
All of you listen with a single mind!
What I am saying
Is the truth and is not different."

At that time, the World-Honored One again said to the great assembly: “I now tell you, this great Mahāmaudgalyāyana, will use various offerings to make offerings to eight thousand Buddhas, with reverence and respect. After these Buddhas pass away, he will erect stupas for each of them, a thousand yojanas tall, and five hundred yojanas in both length and width. They will all be made of the seven treasures—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, tridacna, agate, pearls, and rose quartz. He will use all kinds of flowers, garlands, paste incense, powdered incense, burning incense, silken canopies, banners, and streamers to make offerings. After this, he will again make offerings to two million million Buddhas, in the same way. He will then attain Buddhahood, with the title Tāmalapattra Sandalwood Fragrance Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa will be named Joy-Full, and the land will be named Pleasure-Wished. His land will be level, with a ground of crystal, and jeweled trees will serve as adornments. Pearls will be scattered as flowers, and it will be completely pure and those who see it will rejoice. There will be many gods, humans, Bodhisattvas, and śrāvakas, whose numbers will be immeasurable. The Buddha’s life span will be twenty-four minor kalpas. The True Dharma will remain in the world for forty minor kalpas, and the Dharma-Image will also remain for forty minor kalpas.”

At that time, Mahāmaudgalyāyana, Subhūti, and Mahākātyāyana, were all filled with awe. With a single mind, they joined their palms, looked up at the revered face of the Buddha, and did not take their eyes off him. They spoke together in verse, saying:

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 7: A Parable of the Phantom City
======================================================================


"Furthermore, monks, in the southern five hundred million million countries, the great Brahma Kings each saw their own palaces shining with a light they had never had before. They were overjoyed and filled with a rare feeling. They immediately went to each other and discussed this matter: 'For what reason do our palaces have this light?' In their assembly, there was a great Brahma King named Wonderful-Dharma, who spoke to the assembly of Brahmas in verse, saying:

"At that time, in the eastern five hundred million million countries, the Brahma palaces shone with a light that was double their usual brightness. The Brahma Kings all thought: 'The light of our palaces is something we have never had before. For what reason is this sign appearing?' At that time, all the Brahma Kings went to each other and discussed this matter. In their assembly, there was a great Brahma King named Savior-of-All, who spoke to the assembly of Brahmas in verse, saying:

    "The World Hero is unequaled,
Adorned with a hundred blessings,
He has attained supreme wisdom.
We wish you would preach for the world,"

    "We only wish that the Honored One of gods and humans
Would turn the supreme Dharma wheel,
Beat the great Dharma drum,
And blow the great Dharma conch,"

The Parable of the Phantom City (Prose)

While this sutra was being preached, the sixteen Bodhisattva śrāmaṇeras all believed and accepted it, and among the śrāvaka assembly, some also believed and understood. The rest of the sentient beings, numbering millions of millions, all gave rise to doubt. The Buddha preached this sutra for eight thousand kalpas without ever resting. When he finished this sutra, he immediately entered a quiet room and dwelt in meditation for eighty-four thousand kalpas. At that time, the sixteen Bodhisattva śrāmaṇeras, knowing that the Buddha had entered the room and was dwelling in meditation, each ascended a Dharma seat. They also, for eighty-four thousand kalpas, widely expounded and differentiated the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma for the four groups of the assembly. Each of them saved and converted six hundred million million sentient beings, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, teaching, guiding, benefiting, and filling them with joy, and causing them to conceive the mind of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.

The Buddha said to all the monks: "When Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Buddha attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, the five hundred million million Buddha worlds in each of the ten directions shook in six ways. The dark, remote places in between these lands, which the light and majesty of the sun and moon could not reach, were all brightly illuminated. The sentient beings within them were able to see one another and all said: 'How is it that sentient beings have suddenly appeared here?' And the heavenly palaces in their lands, and even the Brahma palaces, all shook in six ways. A great light universally shone, filling all the worlds, surpassing the light of the gods."

At that time, the Brahma Kings, having praised the Buddha in verse, each said: "We only wish that the World-Honored One would turn the Dharma wheel, so that all the world, gods, Māra, Brahmā, śramaṇas, and brahmins may all gain peace and be liberated." The Brahma Kings, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:

“Monks, when we were śrāmaṇeras, we each converted immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of sentient beings, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, for the sake of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Some of these sentient beings are now dwelling on the śrāvaka ground. I always teach them Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. These people should gradually enter the Buddha Way with this Dharma. Why? Because the Tathagata’s wisdom is difficult to believe and difficult to comprehend. The sentient beings, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, who were converted at that time, are all of you monks and the śrāvaka disciples in the future after my passing away. After my passing away, there will be other disciples who do not hear this sutra and do not know or realize the practices of a Bodhisattva. They will think of the merits they have attained as extinction and will enter nirvana. I will then become a Buddha in another land, with a different name. These people, although they think they have attained extinction and have entered nirvana, will, in that land, seek the Buddha’s wisdom and hear this sutra. It is only with the One Buddha Vehicle that they will attain extinction; there is no other vehicle, except when the Tathagatas preach with expedient means.”

    "World-Honored One, turn the Dharma wheel,
Beat the Dharma drum of sweet dew,
Save the suffering and afflicted sentient beings,
And reveal the Way to nirvana."

The Buddha’s Application of the Parable

The Parable of the Phantom City (Verse)

At that time, the Brahma Kings, having praised the Buddha in verse, each said: "We only wish that the World-Honored One, out of compassion for all, would turn the Dharma wheel and save sentient beings." The Brahma Kings, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:

"No, World-Honored One."

    "I recall a past age,
In immeasurable and boundless kalpas,
There was a Buddha, the Honored One of the two-footed,
Named Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom."

The Brahma Kings then bowed their heads at the Buddha's feet, circled him a hundred thousand times, and then scattered heavenly flowers upon the Buddha. The flowers they scattered were as numerous as Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi tree. After offering the flowers, they each offered their palaces to that Buddha and said: "Please have compassion and benefit us. We wish that you would accept the palaces we have offered." At that time, the Brahma Kings, in the presence of the Buddha, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:

    "For what reason now
Do all our palaces
Have such majestic and brilliant light,
An adornment we have never had before?"

“Monks, if the Tathagata knows that the time of his nirvana is approaching, and the assembly is pure, their belief and understanding are firm, they have realized the Dharma of emptiness, and have entered deep meditation, he then gathers the Bodhisattvas and the śrāvaka assemblies and preaches this sutra. In the world, there are no two vehicles that can attain extinction, only the One Buddha Vehicle can attain extinction. Monks, you should know that the Tathagata, with his expedient means, deeply penetrates the nature of sentient beings. If they delight in the small Dharma and are deeply attached to the five desires, for the sake of these people, he preaches nirvana. When these people hear it, they will then believe and accept it.”

The Brahma Kings then bowed their heads at the Buddha's feet, circled him a hundred thousand times, and then scattered heavenly flowers upon the Buddha. The flowers they scattered were as numerous as Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi tree. After offering the flowers, they each offered their palaces to that Buddha and said: "Please have compassion and benefit us. We wish that you would accept the palaces we have offered." At that time, the Brahma Kings, in the presence of the Buddha, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:

At that time, the five hundred million million Brahma Kings, together with their palaces, each filled their robes with heavenly flowers and went to the nadir to search for the cause of this sign. They saw Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata at the place of enlightenment, under the bodhi tree, sitting on a lion's seat. He was revered and surrounded by gods, dragon kings, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and others. They also saw the sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel.

At that time, Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata silently gave his permission.

The Brahma Kings then bowed their heads at the Buddha's feet, circled him a hundred thousand times, and then scattered heavenly flowers upon the Buddha. The flowers they scattered were as numerous as Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi tree. After offering the flowers, they each offered their palaces to that Buddha and said: "Please have compassion and benefit us. We wish that you would accept the palaces we have offered." At that time, the Brahma Kings, in the presence of the Buddha, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:

At that time, the five hundred million million Brahma Kings of those lands, together with their palaces, each filled their robes with heavenly flowers and went to the west to search for the cause of this sign. They saw Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata at the place of enlightenment, under the bodhi tree, sitting on a lion's seat. He was revered and surrounded by gods, dragon kings, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and others. They also saw the sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel.

    "The Buddha Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom,
Sat for ten kalpas at the place of enlightenment.
The Buddha’s Dharmas did not appear before him,
And he could not attain the Buddha Way."

At that time, Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata silently gave his permission. The Brahma Kings from the southwest, and all the way to the nadir, were also like this.

At that time, the five hundred million million Brahma Kings, having praised the Buddha in verse, each said to the Buddha: "We only wish that the World-Honored One would turn the Dharma wheel, to bring great peace and to liberate many." The Brahma Kings then spoke in verse:

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Volume Four

    "The light in all our palaces
We have never seen before.
What is the reason for this?
We should all go and search for it together."

    "The light in all our palaces
Is extremely majestic and brilliant.
This is not without a cause;
We should search for the reason for this sign."

    "The great, majestic World-Honored One,
To save all sentient beings,
After immeasurable millions of kalpas,
Has finally attained Buddhahood."

When Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Buddha passed eighty-four thousand kalpas, he arose from his samadhi. He went to the Dharma seat and sat down calmly. He universally announced to the great assembly: “These sixteen Bodhisattva śrāmaṇeras are truly rare. Their faculties are sharp and their wisdom is clear. They have previously made offerings to immeasurable millions and hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas. Under all these Buddhas, they have constantly cultivated pure conduct, received and upheld the Buddha’s wisdom, and revealed it to sentient beings, causing them to enter it. You should all constantly be close to them and make offerings to them. Why? If a śrāvaka, a pratyekabuddha, or a Bodhisattva is able to believe in and accept the Dharma preached by these sixteen Bodhisattvas and uphold it without destroying it, this person will all attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi and the wisdom of the Tathagata.”

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

When the Buddha preached this Dharma in the midst of the assembly of gods and humans, six hundred million million nayuta people, because they did not accept any conditioned phenomena, had their minds liberated from all defilements. They all attained profound and subtle meditation, the three wisdoms, and the six supernatural powers, and were complete in the eight liberations. When he preached for the second, third, and fourth time, tens of millions of millions of sentient beings, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and as many as nayutas, also had their minds liberated from all defilements because they did not accept any conditioned phenomena. From this time on, the assemblies of śrāvakas were immeasurable and boundless, beyond calculation.

At that time, the sixteen princes all renounced their homes as youths and became śrāmaṇeras (novice monks). Their faculties were sharp and their wisdom was clear. They had previously made offerings to hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, had cultivated pure conduct, and were seeking Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Together, they said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, these immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of great śrāvakas have all attained their goal. World-Honored One, you should also preach the Dharma of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi for us. When we have heard it, we will all cultivate and learn it together. World-Honored One, we aspire to the Tathagata’s wisdom and insight. Our deepest thoughts are known by the Buddha himself.” At that time, among the multitude that the wheel-turning holy king led, eighty million people saw the sixteen princes renounce their homes and also asked to do so. The king immediately gave his permission.

At that time, the Brahma Kings, having praised the Buddha in verse, each said: "We only wish that the World-Honored One would turn the Dharma wheel, to save and liberate all sentient beings and open the way to nirvana." The Brahma Kings, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:

"At that time, the gods of the Thirty-three Heavens had already prepared a lion's seat for that Buddha under the bodhi tree, a yojana in height. On this seat, the Buddha would attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. As soon as he sat on this seat, all the Brahma Kings rained down various heavenly flowers over a hundred yojanas. A fragrant wind would come from time to time, blowing away the withered flowers and raining down new ones. This continued for ten minor kalpas to make offerings to the Buddha, and even until his passing away, this rain of flowers continued. The Four Heavenly Kings, to make offerings to the Buddha, constantly beat heavenly drums, and the other heavenly beings played heavenly music. This continued for ten minor kalpas, and even until his passing away, it was also like this."

In the middle of the journey, the multitude becomes weary and wants to turn back. They say to the guide: ‘We are exhausted and also afraid, and we cannot go on. The road ahead is still far, and we wish to turn back.’ The guide, who has many expedient means, thinks to himself: ‘These people are pitiful. How can they abandon the great treasures and want to turn back?’ Having thought this, he uses the power of his expedient means and creates a phantom city in the dangerous road, at the distance of three hundred yojanas. He tells the multitude: ‘You should not be afraid or turn back. You can stop and rest in this great city. You can do whatever you wish. When you enter this city, you will be at ease and peaceful. If you can go on to the treasure place, you can also leave.’

"Monks, when Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Buddha passed ten minor kalpas, the Dharmas of all the Buddhas then appeared before him, and he attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. When that Buddha had not yet renounced his home, he had sixteen sons. The first of them was named Wisdom-Accumulation. Each of his sons had various rare and precious playthings. When they heard that their father had attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, they all gave up their treasures and went to the Buddha's place. Their mothers followed them, weeping. Their grandfather, a wheel-turning holy king, with a hundred ministers and a hundred thousand million other people, all surrounded them and followed them to the place of enlightenment. They all wished to get close to the Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata, to make offerings to him, to show him reverence, respect, and praise. When they arrived, they bowed their heads at his feet, circled the Buddha a hundred times, and then, with one mind, they joined their palms and looked up at the World-Honored One, speaking in verse:

“Monks, the Tathagata is also like this. I am now your great guide. I know that the evil path of life, death, and afflictions is dangerous, difficult, and long, and should be left and transcended. If sentient beings only heard about the One Buddha Vehicle, they would not want to see the Buddha or be close to him, and would think: ‘The Buddha Way is long and far, and one can only attain it after a long time of diligence and suffering.’ The Buddha knows this timid and lowly mindset and, with the power of expedient means, for the sake of giving them a place to rest in the middle of the path, he preaches the two nirvanas. When sentient beings dwell on the two grounds, the Tathagata then tells them: ‘What you have done is not yet complete. The ground you dwell on is near the Buddha’s wisdom. You should observe and weigh that the nirvana you have attained is not the true one. It is only the power of the Tathagata’s expedient means that, for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle, differentiates and speaks of three.’ It is like that guide who, for the sake of a rest, creates a phantom city. When he knows they are rested, he tells them: ‘The treasure place is near. This city is not real; I created it for you.’”

“Imagine a difficult and dangerous evil road of five hundred yojanas, a desolate and uninhabited place of fear. If there is a great multitude who wishes to pass through this road to reach a place of treasures, there is a guide who is intelligent and wise, and who skillfully knows the dangerous road and its open and blocked passages. He leads the multitude, wishing to pass through this danger.

At that time, Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata silently gave his permission.

The Buddha said to all the monks: “These sixteen Bodhisattvas always delight in preaching this Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma. Each of these Bodhisattvas converted six hundred million million sentient beings, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. In every lifetime, they were born with the Bodhisattvas, heard the Dharma from them, and all believed and understood. Because of this cause, they were able to encounter four million million World-Honored Buddhas, and this will not come to an end in this lifetime.”

"Monks, the countries that this person passed, whether they received a dot or not, if they were all ground into dust, and each grain of dust were a kalpa, the time since that Buddha passed away would surpass this number by immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas. With the power of the Tathagata's wisdom and insight, I see that distant time as if it were today."

    "Great sage, turn the Dharma wheel,
And reveal the true nature of all Dharmas.
Save the suffering and afflicted sentient beings,
And cause them to attain great joy."

At that time, the exhausted multitude was filled with great joy and praised this as something they had never had. ‘We have now escaped this evil road and have gained peace and comfort.’ The multitude then went into the phantom city, and they thought they had been saved and had found peace. At that time, the guide, knowing that these people had rested and were no longer weary, extinguished the phantom city and said to the multitude: ‘You should go on now! The treasure place is near. The great city you just saw was created by me as a place to rest.’”

    "The World-Honored One is very difficult to see,
The one who breaks through all afflictions.
After one hundred and thirty kalpas,
We can finally see him."

At that time, the five hundred million million Brahma Kings, together with their palaces, each filled their robes with heavenly flowers and went to the north to search for the cause of this sign. They saw Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata at the place of enlightenment, under the bodhi tree, sitting on a lion's seat. He was revered and surrounded by gods, dragon kings, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and others. They also saw the sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel.

    "World-Honored One, you are extremely rare,
And difficult to encounter.
You are complete in immeasurable merit,
And can save and protect all."

At that time, the five hundred million million Brahma Kings, together with their palaces, each filled their robes with heavenly flowers and went to the northwest to search for the cause of this sign. They saw Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata at the place of enlightenment, under the bodhi tree, sitting on a lion's seat. He was revered and surrounded by gods, dragon kings, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and others. They also saw the sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel.

“Monks, I now tell you, those sixteen śrāmaṇeras who were disciples of that Buddha have all now attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi and are currently preaching the Dharma in the lands of the ten directions. They have immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of Bodhisattvas and śrāvakas as their retinues. The two śrāmaṇeras in the east have become Buddhas; one is named Akshobhya, in the land of Joy, and the other is named Sumeru-Peak. In the southeast are two Buddhas; one is named Lion-Sound, and the other is named Lion-Form. In the south are two Buddhas; one is named Dwelling-in-Space, and the other is named Constant-Extinction. In the southwest are two Buddhas; one is named King-Form, and the other is named Brahmā-Form. In the west are two Buddhas; one is named Amitābha, and the other is named Savior-of-All-Worldly-Sufferings. In the northwest are two Buddhas; one is named Tāmalapattra-Sandalwood-Fragrance Supernatural-Power, and the other is named Sumeru-Form. In the north are two Buddhas; one is named Cloud-Sovereign, and the other is named Cloud-Sovereign-King. The Buddha in the northeast is named Destroyer-of-All-Worldly-Fears. The sixteenth is myself, Śākyamuni Buddha, who has attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi in this Saha land.”

Translated by Tripitaka Master Kumarajiva of the Kucha Kingdom in the Later Qin Dynasty, by imperial decree.

Monks, it has been a very long time since that Buddha passed away. It is like if someone were to take all the ground of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, grind it all into ink, and then, after passing a thousand countries in the east, drop a single dot the size of a tiny grain of dust. Then, after passing another thousand countries, drop another dot. In this way, he continues until all the ground is used up as ink. What do you think, monks? Can any calculator or student of a calculator figure out the end and know the number of these countries, or not?"

    "Holy master, King of all gods,
With a voice like the kalaviṅka bird,
You who have compassion for sentient beings—
We now pay homage to you."

At that time, Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata accepted the request of the Brahma Kings of the ten directions and the sixteen princes. He then, in three ways, turned the twelve-linked Dharma wheel—which no śramaṇa, Brahmin, god, demon, Brahmā, or anyone in the world could turn. He taught that "This is suffering, this is the accumulation of suffering, this is the extinction of suffering, and this is the Way to the extinction of suffering." And he widely preached the Dharma of the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination: "From ignorance comes volitional formations; from volitional formations comes consciousness; from consciousness comes name and form; from name and form comes the six sense faculties; from the six sense faculties comes contact; from contact comes sensation; from sensation comes craving; from craving comes grasping; from grasping comes existence; from existence comes birth; from birth comes old age, death, sorrow, grief, suffering, and affliction. When ignorance is extinguished, volitional formations are extinguished; when volitional formations are extinguished, consciousness is extinguished; when consciousness is extinguished, name and form are extinguished; when name and form are extinguished, the six sense faculties are extinguished; when the six sense faculties are extinguished, contact is extinguished; when contact is extinguished, sensation is extinguished; when sensation is extinguished, craving is extinguished; when craving is extinguished, grasping is extinguished; when grasping is extinguished, existence is extinguished; when existence is extinguished, birth is extinguished; when birth is extinguished, old age, death, sorrow, grief, and suffering are all extinguished."

The Buddha said to all the monks: "The life span of Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Buddha was five hundred and forty million million nayuta kalpas. When that Buddha first sat at the place of enlightenment, after defeating the army of Māra, he was about to attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, but the Dharmas of the Buddhas did not appear before him. In this way, for one minor kalpa, and even up to ten minor kalpas, he sat in the lotus posture, his body and mind motionless, and yet the Dharmas of the Buddhas still did not appear before him."

"Furthermore, monks, in the southeastern five hundred million million countries, the great Brahma Kings each saw their own palaces shining with a light they had never had before. They were overjoyed and filled with a rare feeling. They immediately went to each other and discussed this matter. In their assembly, there was a great Brahma King named Great Compassion, who spoke to the assembly of Brahmas in verse, saying:

The Brahma Kings immediately bowed their heads at the Buddha's feet, circled him a hundred thousand times, and then scattered heavenly flowers upon the Buddha. The flowers they scattered were as numerous as Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi tree, which was ten yojanas high. After offering the flowers, they each offered their palaces to that Buddha and said: "Please have compassion and benefit us. We wish that you would accept the palaces we have offered." At that time, the Brahma Kings, in the presence of the Buddha, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

At that time, the sixteen princes, having praised the Buddha in verse, requested the World-Honored One to turn the Dharma wheel. They all said: "World-Honored One, when you preach the Dharma, you bring great peace, compassion, and benefit to the gods and humans." They spoke again in verse:

At that time, that Buddha accepted the request of the śrāmaṇeras. After two hundred thousand kalpas, he then preached this Great Vehicle sutra in the midst of the four groups of the assembly, named the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a Dharma for Bodhisattvas protected and remembered by the Buddhas. When he had finished this sutra, the sixteen śrāmaṇeras, for the sake of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, all received, upheld, recited, and mastered it.

    "What is the reason
For this sign to appear?
The light in all our palaces
Is something we have never had before."

At that time, the five hundred million million Brahma Kings of the zenith also saw their palaces shining with a majestic and brilliant light they had never had before. They were overjoyed and filled with a rare feeling. They immediately went to each other and discussed this matter: "For what reason do our palaces have this light?" In their assembly, there was a great Brahma King named Śikhin, who spoke to the assembly of Brahmas in verse, saying:

    "It is excellent to see the Buddhas,
The holy and honored saviors of the world.
You are able to save all sentient beings
From the prison of the three realms."

    "World Hero, Honored One of the two-footed,
We only wish you would expound the Dharma.
With the power of great compassion,
Save the suffering and afflicted sentient beings."

The Buddha said to all the monks: "It was in the past, in immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, that there was a Buddha named Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land was named Good-City, and the kalpa was named Great-Mark.

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 8: Bestowal of Prophecies upon Five Hundred Disciples
======================================================================


At that time, the twelve hundred Arhats, whose minds were free, thought: "We are so joyful and have gained what we have never had. If the World-Honored One were to give each of us a prophecy like he did the other great disciples, would that not also be wonderful?"

“World-Honored One, we always thought: ‘We have already attained ultimate extinction.’ But now we know we were like ignorant people. Why? We should have attained the Buddha's wisdom, but we were content with our little wisdom.”

"You should not think that Pūrṇa is only able to protect and assist in the preaching of my Dharma. In the past, under ninety million Buddhas, he also protected and assisted in the preaching of the true Dharma of the Buddhas. Among those who preached the Dharma, he was also the foremost. Moreover, he has a clear and unhindered understanding of the Dharma of emptiness preached by the Buddhas, and he has attained the four unhindered wisdoms. He can always preach the Dharma purely with careful consideration, without any doubt, and is complete in the supernatural powers of a Bodhisattva. Throughout his life, he always cultivated pure conduct. The people of those Buddha worlds all truly believed him to be a śrāvaka. But Pūrṇa, with these expedient means, brought benefit to immeasurable hundreds of thousands of sentient beings, and he also converted immeasurable asaṃkhyeya people, causing them to establish the resolve for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. For the sake of purifying a Buddha land, he constantly does the work of a Buddha and converts sentient beings."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Monks, Pūrṇa was also the foremost among those who preached the Dharma under the Seven Buddhas of the past, and he is the foremost among those who preach the Dharma under me today. Among the Buddhas who will appear in the Bhadrakalpa (the present auspicious kalpa), he will also be the foremost among those who preach the Dharma. He will also protect and assist in the preaching of the Dharma of immeasurable and boundless Buddhas in the future, converting and benefiting immeasurable sentient beings and causing them to establish the resolve for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. For the sake of purifying a Buddha land, he will always diligently progress in converting sentient beings and will gradually be complete in the Bodhisattva Way. After immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, he will, in this very land, attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, with the title Dharma-Light Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One."

    "Monks, listen carefully."

The Buddha knew the thoughts in their hearts and said to Mahākāśyapa: "I will now give prophecies to these twelve hundred arhats, one by one, in your presence, for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. In this assembly, my great disciple, the monk Ajñāta-Kauṇḍinya, will make offerings to six hundred and twenty thousand million Buddhas and will then attain Buddhahood, with the title Universal-Light Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The five hundred arhats—Uruvilva-Kāśyapa, Gayā-Kāśyapa, Nadī-Kāśyapa, Kāludāyin, Udayin, Aniruddha, Revata, Kapphiṇa, Bakkula, Cunda, Svāgata, and others—will all attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, and their titles will all be the same, Universal-Light.”

World-Honored One, we now know that we are truly Bodhisattvas who will receive the prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Because of this, we are filled with great joy and have gained what we never had before.”

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

“World-Honored One, it is like a person who goes to a friend's house and, having become drunk, falls asleep. At that time, the friend had an official matter to attend to and was about to leave. He took a priceless jewel and sewed it inside the person's robe and then went away. The person, being drunk and asleep, was completely unaware of it. When he woke up, he traveled to another country. For the sake of clothing and food, he diligently struggled to make a living. It was extremely difficult, and if he gained a little, he would be content with that.

The Application of the Parable

“The Buddha is also like this. When you were a Bodhisattva, you taught and converted us, causing us to give rise to the mind for All-Knowing Wisdom. But we soon became neglectful and forgot it, and we were unaware of it. When we attained the arhat Way, we thought we had attained extinction. Like that man struggling to live, we gained a little and were content with it. But our vow for All-Knowing Wisdom was still there and was not lost.

Today, the World-Honored One has awakened us and said: ‘Monks, what you have attained is not ultimate extinction. I have long ago caused you to plant the good roots of a Buddha, and with expedient means, I showed you the form of nirvana, but you thought that you had truly attained extinction.’

At that time, the five hundred arhats, having received a prophecy in the presence of the Buddha, were filled with joy and delight. They immediately rose from their seats, went before the Buddha, and bowed their heads at his feet, repenting and reproaching themselves.

At that time, Ajñāta-Kauṇḍinya and others, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

At that time, the Buddha said to all the monks: "Do you all see this Pūrṇa-Maitrāyaṇīputra? I always praise him as the foremost among those who preach the Dharma. I also constantly praise his various merits. He is diligent in protecting and assisting in the preaching of my Dharma. He can guide and benefit the four groups of the assembly, fully explaining the true Dharma of the Buddha and bringing great benefit to those who practice the same pure conduct. Other than the Tathagata himself, there is no one who can exhaust his eloquence and debate."

The Parable of the Pearl in the Robe

That Buddha will have a Buddha land as vast as the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, and the ground will be made of the seven treasures, level as a palm, without any mountains, hills, streams, valleys, or ditches. Jeweled towers and pavilions will fill it. The palaces of the gods will be close to the sky, and humans and gods will be able to see one another. There will be no evil destinies and no women. All sentient beings will be born by transformation and will have no sexual desire. They will have great supernatural powers, and light will emanate from their bodies. They will be able to fly freely, their resolve will be firm, they will be diligent in their wisdom, and all of them will have golden bodies adorned with the thirty-two marks. The sentient beings in that land will always have two kinds of food: one, the food of Dharma joy, and two, the food of meditation joy. There will be an immeasurable number of asaṃkhyeya tens of millions of nayuta Bodhisattva assemblies, who have attained great supernatural powers and the four unhindered wisdoms, and who are skilled at converting all kinds of sentient beings. The śrāvaka assemblies will be so numerous they cannot be known by calculation. They will all be complete in the six supernatural powers, the three wisdoms, and the eight liberations. That Buddha land will be adorned with these immeasurable merits. The kalpa will be named Jewel-Light, and the land will be named Good-Purification. The Buddha's life span will be immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas. The Dharma will remain for a very long time. After the Buddha's passing, seven-jeweled stupas will be erected, filling his land.

    "The monk Ajñāta-Kauṇḍinya"

    "We have heard the supreme
Voice of a prophecy, which brings peace,
And we are filled with an unprecedented joy.
We pay homage to the Buddha of boundless wisdom."

At that time, Pūrṇa-Maitrāyaṇīputra, having heard from the Buddha this wisdom of expedient means, this preaching of the Dharma according to what is appropriate, and having heard the prophecies for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi for the great disciples, and having heard of the past life karmic connections, and having heard of the great supernatural powers of the Buddhas, felt an unprecedented joy and purity in his heart.

Later, the friend met him by chance and said: ‘Hey, my good man! Why do you struggle for clothing and food like this? I wanted you to be happy and at ease and enjoy the five desires. On a certain day of a certain month in a certain year, I sewed a priceless jewel inside your robe, and it is still there now. But you do not know it, and you labor with great difficulty and worry to sustain your life. This is so foolish! You can now use this jewel to trade for whatever you need and can always have what you wish for, without any lack.’”

He immediately rose from his seat, went before the Buddha, bowed his head at the Buddha's feet, and then stood to one side, looking up at the revered face of the Buddha without taking his eyes off him. He thought: "The World-Honored One is so wonderful and rare! He follows the various natures of the world and preaches the Dharma with the wisdom of expedient means, pulling sentient beings out of their attachments everywhere. We cannot express the merits of the Buddha in words. Only the World-Honored One can know our deepest hearts and our original vows."

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 9: Bestowal of Prophecies upon Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas
======================================================================


At that time, the World-Honored One, knowing the thoughts in the hearts of the Bodhisattvas, said to them: "Noble men, Ānanda and I gave rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi at the same time, under the Buddha King of Emptiness. Ānanda always delighted in hearing much, and I always cultivated diligent progress. For this reason, I have already attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, while Ānanda protects my Dharma and will also protect the Dharma treasury of all future Buddhas, converting and bringing to completion the assemblies of Bodhisattvas. His original vow was like this, and so he receives this prophecy."

At that time, the Buddha said to Rāhula: "In a future life, you will attain Buddhahood. Your title will be Treading-on-Seven-Jeweled-Flowers Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. You will make offerings to a number of Buddhas as numerous as the dust motes in ten worlds. You will always be the eldest son of all the Buddhas, just as you are now. The land of this Treading-on-Seven-Jeweled-Flowers Buddha, his life span, the kalpa, the disciples he converts, the True Dharma, and the Dharma-Image will be no different from that of King of All-Penetrating-Wisdom of Mountains and Oceans Tathagata, and you will also be the eldest son of this Buddha. After this, you will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

At that time, the Buddha said to Ānanda: "In a future life, you will attain Buddhahood. Your title will be King of All-Penetrating-Wisdom of Mountains and Oceans Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.

    "These two thousand śrāvakas,"

"Ānanda, these people will make offerings to a number of Tathagatas as numerous as the dust motes in fifty worlds. They will show them respect and reverence and protect the Dharma treasury. In their final life, they will all simultaneously attain Buddhahood in the lands of the ten directions. Their title will all be the same: Jewel-Form Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. Their life span will be one kalpa. The adornments of their lands, their śrāvakas and Bodhisattvas, and their True Dharma and Dharma-Image will all be the same."

Prophecy for Rāhula and the 2,000 Disciples

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Yes, I do," he replied.

    "I now declare among the monks:"

    "The World-Honored One, the lamp of wisdom,"

At that time, the two thousand learners and non-learners, having heard the Buddha's prophecy, were filled with joy and delight and spoke in verse:

At that time, the two thousand disciples who were still "learners" or were "non-learners" all rose from their seats, bared their right shoulders, went before the Buddha, joined their palms with a single mind, and looked up at the World-Honored One. Just like Ānanda and Rāhula, they stood to one side, holding the same wish.

At that time, the World-Honored One saw the two thousand disciples, both learners and non-learners, whose intentions were gentle, still, and pure, and who were looking at the Buddha with a single mind. The Buddha said to Ānanda: "Do you see these two thousand learners and non-learners?"

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

    "When I was a prince,"

    "The World-Honored One is extremely rare,"

When Ānanda heard the Buddha give him a prophecy in his presence and describe the adornments of his future land, all his wishes were fulfilled. His heart was filled with great joy and he felt an unprecedented happiness. He immediately recalled the Dharma treasuries of immeasurable millions of Buddhas from the past, and he understood them all without hindrance, just as he had heard the present Dharma, and he also remembered his original vow. At that time, Ānanda spoke in verse:

At that time, Ānanda and Rāhula thought to themselves: "If we were to receive a prophecy, would that not also be wonderful?"

At that time, eight thousand newly resolved Bodhisattvas in the assembly all thought: "We have not even heard of great Bodhisattvas receiving such prophecies. What is the reason that these śrāvakas are receiving such a definitive promise?"

They immediately rose from their seats, went before the Buddha, bowed their heads at his feet, and together said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we too should have a share in this. Only in the Tathagata do we find our refuge. Moreover, we are known by all the worlds of gods, humans, and asuras. Ānanda has always been your attendant and has protected the Dharma treasury. Rāhula is your son. If the Buddha gives us a prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, our wishes will be fulfilled, and the hopes of the assembly will also be met."

Prophecy for Ānanda

You will serve sixty-two hundred million Buddhas and protect the Dharma treasury, and only then will you attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. You will convert twenty thousand million nayuta Bodhisattvas, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, and cause them to attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Your land will be named Banner of Constant-Victory, and its ground will be pure and made of lapis lazuli. The kalpa will be named Sound-Filling-Everything. The life span of that Buddha will be immeasurable millions of millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas. If a person were to try to calculate it over millions of millions of immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, they would not be able to know its length. The True Dharma will remain in the world for a period double his life span, and the Dharma-Image will last for double the True Dharma. Ānanda, this King of All-Penetrating-Wisdom of Mountains and Oceans Buddha will be universally praised by the immeasurable millions of millions of Tathagatas, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, in the ten directions, who will extol his merits."

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 10: A Teacher of the Dharma
======================================================================


    "If you wish to dwell in the Buddha Way
And attain self-enlightened wisdom,
You should always diligently make offerings to
And uphold the Lotus Sutra."

At that time, the Buddha again said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Medicine King: "Of the immeasurable millions of sutras that I have preached, am now preaching, and will preach, among them, this Lotus Sutra is the most difficult to believe and difficult to comprehend. Medicine King, this sutra is the secret treasury of the Buddhas. It should not be distributed or casually given to others. It is protected by the World-Honored Buddhas and has never been revealed until now. But even when the Tathagata is in the world, this sutra still draws many grudges and jealousies. How much more so after my passing away?"

"Medicine King, there are many people, both lay and monastic, who practice the Bodhisattva Way. If they are unable to see, hear, read, recite, copy, uphold, or make offerings to this Lotus Sutra, you should know that these people have not yet properly practiced the Bodhisattva Way. But if a person is able to hear this scripture, they are then able to properly practice the Bodhisattva Way. If there are sentient beings who seek the Buddha Way and who see or hear this Lotus Sutra, and having heard it, believe in it, understand it, and uphold it, you should know that this person is close to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."

"Medicine King, you should know that after the Tathagata's passing, anyone who is able to copy, uphold, read, recite, make offerings to, and preach this sutra to others, will be covered by the Tathagata’s robe and will be protected and remembered by the present Buddhas of the other directions. This person has great power of faith, the power of a great vow, and the power of all good roots. You should know that this person dwells with the Tathagata and that the Tathagata's hand has touched his head."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Medicine King, it is like a person who is thirsty and needs water. In a high, dry plateau, he digs and searches for it. If he still sees dry soil, he knows the water is still far away. But he continues to work, and when he starts to see wet soil, and then gradually mud, his mind is certain that the water is near. A Bodhisattva is also like this. If they have not heard, understood, or been able to practice this Lotus Sutra, you should know that this person is still far from Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. But if they can hear, understand, contemplate, and practice it, they will surely know that they are close to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Why? All the Bodhisattvas' Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi belongs to this sutra. This sutra opens the gate of expedient means and reveals the true nature of reality. This treasury of the Lotus Sutra is profound, firm, and remote, and no one can reach it. But now, the Buddha, having converted and brought the Bodhisattvas to completion, is revealing it for them."

"Medicine King, if there is an evil person who, with an unwholesome mind, constantly slanders and abuses the Buddha in the Buddha's presence for an entire kalpa, his sin is still light. But if a person, with a single evil word, slanders a layman or laywoman, or a monk or nun, who reads and recites the Lotus Sutra, their sin is much heavier."

"Medicine King, you should know that this person, leaving the reward of his pure karma behind, is born into this evil world after my passing away, out of compassion for sentient beings, to widely preach this sutra. If this noble man or noble woman, after my passing away, is able to secretly preach the Lotus Sutra, even a single line, to one other person, you should know that this person is the Tathagata's envoy, sent by the Tathagata to do the Tathagata's work. How much more so for one who widely preaches it to a great assembly?"

"Medicine King, in every place where this sutra is preached, read, recited, or copied, or wherever a scroll of this sutra is kept, you should erect a stupa of seven treasures. It should be made extremely tall, vast, and beautifully adorned. There is no need to place relics inside. Why? Because the full body of the Tathagata is already there. This stupa should be revered and worshipped with all kinds of flowers, incense, garlands, silken canopies, banners, streamers, music, and songs. If a person sees this stupa, bows, and makes offerings to it, you should know that these people are all close to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."

At that time, the World-Honored One, addressing Bodhisattva Medicine King, said to the eighty thousand great beings: "Medicine King, do you see in this great assembly the immeasurable gods, dragon kings, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen? There are also those who seek the śrāvaka path, those who seek the pratyekabuddha path, and those who seek the Buddha Way. All of them, in my presence, who hear even one verse or one line of the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, or even rejoice for a single thought, I will give them all a prophecy that they will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."

"Medicine King, if someone asks what kind of sentient beings will attain Buddhahood in a future life, you should show them these people and say that they will surely attain Buddhahood in a future life. Why? If a noble man or noble woman upholds, reads, recites, explains, or copies even a single line of the Lotus Sutra, and makes various offerings to the sutra scrolls—of flowers, incense, garlands, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silken canopies, banners, streamers, robes, and music, and joins their palms in reverence—this person should be looked up to by the entire world. He should be offered the same kind of offerings that are made to a Tathagata. You should know that this person is a great Bodhisattva who has fulfilled Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi and, out of compassion for sentient beings, has vowed to be born in this world to widely preach and differentiate the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma. How much greater is the merit for one who can fully uphold it and make all kinds of offerings?"

"Medicine King, if a Bodhisattva hears this Lotus Sutra and is shocked, doubtful, and afraid, you should know that he is a newly resolved Bodhisattva. If a śrāvaka hears this sutra and is shocked, doubtful, and afraid, you should know that he is arrogant. Medicine King, if a noble man or noble woman, after the Tathagata’s passing, wishes to preach this Lotus Sutra to the four groups of the assembly, how should they do it? This noble man or noble woman should enter the Tathagata’s room, wear the Tathagata’s robe, and sit on the Tathagata’s seat. Only then should they widely preach this sutra to the four groups. The Tathagata’s room is a mind of great compassion for all sentient beings. The Tathagata’s robe is a mind of gentleness and patience. The Tathagata’s seat is the emptiness of all phenomena. When one dwells in this, then with a tireless mind, one should widely preach this Lotus Sutra for the Bodhisattvas and the four groups."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

    "If you wish to abandon all laziness,
You should listen to this sutra.
This sutra is difficult to hear,
And those who believe in and accept it are also rare."

"Medicine King, if a person reads and recites the Lotus Sutra, you should know that this person is adorning himself with the Buddha's adornments and is being carried on the Tathagata's shoulders. Wherever he goes, people should follow him and pay reverence, join their palms with a single mind, and make offerings to him with reverence, respect, and praise, with flowers, incense, garlands, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silken canopies, banners, streamers, robes, fine food, and music. They should make the most supreme offerings of humans to him. They should hold heavenly treasures and scatter them, and heavenly jewels should be offered to him. Why? Because this person preaches the Dharma with joy, and by listening to it for a moment, one can attain ultimate Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."

"Medicine King, in other lands, I will send a phantom person to gather an assembly to listen to the Dharma. I will also send phantom monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen to listen to him preach the Dharma. These phantom people, when they hear the Dharma, will believe it, accept it, and follow it without opposition. If the preacher is in a secluded place, I will then send gods, dragons, ghost-spirits, gandharvas, asuras, and others in great numbers to listen to his Dharma. Although I am in another country, I will, from time to time, cause the preacher to see my body. If he forgets a phrase or a line, I will preach it to him again, so he can have it completely."

The Buddha said to Medicine King: "Furthermore, after the Tathagata's passing away, if there is a person who hears even one verse or one line of the Lotus Sutra and rejoices for a single thought, I will also give them a prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. If there is a person who upholds, reads, recites, explains, or copies the Lotus Sutra, even a single verse, and reveres this scripture as if it were the Buddha himself, making various offerings—of flowers, incense, garlands, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silken canopies, banners, streamers, robes, and music—and even joins their palms in reverence, Medicine King, you should know that these people have already made offerings to a hundred thousand million Buddhas in the past. Under those Buddhas, they have fulfilled their great vows and, out of compassion for sentient beings, are born in this human world."

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 11: The Appearance of the Jeweled Stupa
======================================================================


Śākyamuni Buddha, for the sake of the Buddhas who were to come and sit, again transformed two hundred million million nayuta countries in each of the eight directions, making them all pure. There were no hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras. He also moved the gods and humans and placed them in other lands. These transformed lands also had a ground of lapis lazuli, were adorned with jeweled trees, and the trees were five hundred yojanas high. Their branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits were adorned in a beautiful order. Under each tree was a jeweled lion’s seat, five yojanas high, also decorated with various treasures. There were also no great oceans, rivers, or the kings of mountains like Mount Mucilinda, Mount Mahāmucilinda, the Iron Ring Mountains, the Great Iron Ring Mountains, or Mount Sumeru. It all became one Buddha land. The jeweled ground was level, and a jeweled net canopy covered it everywhere. Banners and canopies hung down, a great, precious fragrance was burned, and all kinds of heavenly jeweled flowers were spread all over the ground.

At that time, the four groups of the assembly saw the great jeweled stupa hanging in the air and heard the voice coming from within it. They were all filled with Dharma joy and astonished by this unprecedented event. They rose from their seats, respectfully joined their palms, and stood to one side.

The Buddha said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Great-Joyful-Eloquence: "This Abundant Treasures Buddha has a profound and heavy vow. When my jeweled stupa appears before all the Buddhas for the sake of hearing the Lotus Sutra, if someone wishes to show my body to the four groups of the assembly, the Buddhas who are my emanations and are preaching the Dharma in the worlds of the ten directions must all be gathered in one place. Only then will my body appear."

"Noble man, please go to Śākyamuni Buddha at Mount Gridhrakuta and greet him on my behalf: 'Are you in good health and without much sickness? Are you at ease in your energy? Are the Bodhisattva and śrāvaka assemblies also at peace?' Scatter these jeweled flowers as an offering to the Buddha and say: 'The Buddha of a certain land, wishes to open this jeweled stupa.'" The envoys of all the other Buddhas also did the same.

    "The holy master, the World-Honored One,
Although he passed away long ago,
Dwells in the jeweled stupa,
And has come for the Dharma."

At that time, the Saha world transformed and became pure. The ground was of lapis lazuli, adorned with jeweled trees, and golden ropes lined the eight roads. There were no villages, towns, cities, great oceans, rivers, mountains, streams, or forests. A great, precious fragrance was burned, and maṇḍārava flowers were spread all over the ground. A jeweled net canopy was spread above, and precious bells hung from it. Only the assembly that was there was left. The gods and humans were moved to other lands.

At that time, a great voice came from within the jeweled stupa, praising: "Excellent! Excellent, Śākyamuni World-Honored One! You are able to preach this Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma for the great assembly, which is the Dharma of the Bodhisattvas, protected and remembered by the Buddhas, with your equal and great wisdom. It is just so, it is just so, Śākyamuni World-Honored One. All that you have preached is true."

At that time, all the Buddhas of the ten directions each said to their assembly of Bodhisattvas: "Noble men, we should now go to the Saha world, to Śākyamuni Buddha’s place, and also make offerings to the jeweled stupa of Abundant Treasures Tathagata."

"Great-Joyful-Eloquence, my emanations—the Buddhas who are preaching the Dharma in the worlds of the ten directions—should now be gathered."

At that time, Bodhisattva Great-Joyful-Eloquence, by the Tathagata's supernatural power, said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we wish to see this Buddha's body."

At that time, the Buddhas, each with one great Bodhisattva as an attendant, arrived in the Saha world, and each came to a jeweled tree. Each jeweled tree was five hundred yojanas high, and its branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits were adorned in a beautiful order. Under each of the jeweled trees was a lion’s seat, five yojanas high, also decorated with great treasures. At that time, the Buddhas each sat in the lotus posture on these seats. They spread out in this way and filled the entire three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world. But the emanations of Śākyamuni Buddha from a single direction were still not exhausted.

Great-Joyful-Eloquence said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we also wish to see the World-Honored One’s emanations, the Buddhas, to pay homage to them and make offerings."

"After that Buddha attained the Way, when he was about to pass away, he told all the monks in the assembly of gods and humans: 'After my passing away, if you wish to make offerings to my complete body, you should erect a great stupa.' With that Buddha's supernatural powers and vow, wherever in the worlds of the ten directions the Lotus Sutra is preached, that jeweled stupa appears before it, and his complete body is within the stupa, praising: 'Excellent! Excellent!'"

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha, seeing that all his emanations had gathered and were all sitting on a lion’s seat, and hearing all the Buddhas wish to open the jeweled stupa, rose from his seat and stood in the air. The entire four groups of the assembly rose, joined their palms, and looked at the Buddha with a single mind.

At that time, the Buddhas who were the emanations of Śākyamuni Buddha from the hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta countries as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in the east, each came here after preaching the Dharma. In this way, the Buddhas of the ten directions all came and gathered, sitting in the eight directions. At that time, each direction was filled with four hundred million million nayuta Tathagatas. At that time, the Buddhas, each sitting on a lion’s seat under a jeweled tree, all sent their attendants to ask Śākyamuni Buddha about his well-being. They each brought a handful of jeweled flowers and said:

Then, Śākyamuni Buddha, with his right finger, opened the door of the seven-jeweled stupa. A great sound was heard, like removing a bolt and opening a great city gate. Immediately, the entire assembly saw Abundant Treasures Tathagata sitting on a lion’s seat inside the jeweled stupa, his complete body intact as if he were in meditation. They also heard his words: "Excellent! Excellent, Śākyamuni Buddha! You have preached the Lotus Sutra so wonderfully. I have come here to hear this sutra."

Then, Abundant Treasures Buddha, in the jeweled stupa, offered half of his seat to Śākyamuni Buddha and said: "Śākyamuni Buddha, you may sit on this seat." Immediately, Śākyamuni Buddha entered the stupa and sat on the other half of the seat, in the lotus posture. At that time, the great assembly saw the two Tathagatas sitting in the lotus posture on the lion's seat in the seven-jeweled stupa. They all thought: "The Buddha's seat is high and far away. We only wish that the Tathagatas, with their supernatural powers, would cause us to also be in the air."

"Great-Joyful-Eloquence, this stupa of Abundant Treasures Tathagata has risen from the ground and is praising: 'Excellent! Excellent!' because it heard the preaching of the Lotus Sutra."

At that time, a Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva named Great-Joyful-Eloquence, knowing the doubts in the hearts of all the gods, humans, and asuras in the world, said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what is the reason for this jeweled stupa to have risen from the ground, and for this voice to have come from within it?"

At that time, the four groups of the assembly and others saw the Buddha who had passed away countless millions of kalpas ago speak these words. They praised this unprecedented event and scattered a shower of heavenly jeweled flowers upon Abundant Treasures Buddha and Śākyamuni Buddha.

Immediately, Śākyamuni Buddha, with his supernatural power, took the great assembly and placed them all in the air. With a great voice, he universally announced to the four groups: "Who, in this Saha world, is able to widely preach the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma? The time is now. The Tathagata will soon enter nirvana, and the Buddha wishes to entrust this Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma to a worthy person."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

At that time, the Buddha released a single ray of light from the white hair between his eyebrows and immediately saw the Buddhas of the five hundred million million nayuta countries as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in the east. In those lands, the ground was made of crystal, adorned with jeweled trees and jeweled robes. Innumerable millions of millions of Bodhisattvas filled them. They were covered everywhere with jeweled canopies and jeweled nets were spread above. The Buddhas in those lands preached the various Dharmas with a great and wonderful voice, and countless millions of millions of Bodhisattvas filled all those lands, preaching the Dharma for the assembly. The places illuminated by the light from the white hair in the south, north, west, the four diagonals, and above and below were also like this.

The banners and canopies were made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, tridacna, agate, pearls, and rose quartz—the seven treasures—and they reached up to the palaces of the Four Heavenly Kings. The gods of the Thirty-three Heavens rained down heavenly maṇḍārava flowers to make offerings to the jeweled stupa. The other gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans, numbering in the millions and millions, made offerings to the jeweled stupa with all kinds of flowers, incense, garlands, banners, canopies, and music. They showed reverence, respect, and praise.

Śākyamuni Buddha, wishing to make room for his emanations, the Buddhas, transformed two hundred million million nayuta countries in each of the eight directions, making them all pure. There were no hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras. He also moved the gods and humans and placed them in other lands. These transformed lands also had a ground of lapis lazuli, were adorned with jeweled trees, and the trees were five hundred yojanas high. Their branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits were adorned in a beautiful order. Under each tree was a jeweled lion’s seat, five yojanas high, also decorated with various treasures. There were also no great oceans, rivers, or the kings of mountains like Mount Mucilinda, Mount Mahāmucilinda, the Iron Ring Mountains, the Great Iron Ring Mountains, or Mount Sumeru. It all became one Buddha land. The jeweled ground was level, and a jeweled net canopy covered it everywhere. Banners and canopies hung down, a great, precious fragrance was burned, and all kinds of heavenly jeweled flowers were spread all over the ground.

At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva Great-Joyful-Eloquence: "Within this jeweled stupa is the complete body of a Tathagata. It was in the past, in the east, in immeasurable millions of millions of asaṃkhyeya worlds, that there was a land named Jewel-Purity. In that land there was a Buddha named Abundant Treasures. When that Buddha practiced the Bodhisattva Way, he made a great vow: 'When I attain Buddhahood and pass away, my stupa will appear before any place in the ten directions where the Lotus Sutra is preached, to bear witness and to praise: "Excellent!"'"

At that time, in front of the Buddha, a seven-jeweled stupa, five hundred yojanas high and two hundred and fifty yojanas in both length and width, rose from the ground and hung in the air. It was adorned with various treasures. It had five thousand railings and thousands of millions of pavilions. It was adorned with countless banners and streamers, and hundreds of thousands of millions of precious bells and jeweled garlands hung from it. From its four sides, it emitted the fragrance of tāmalapattra and sandalwood, which filled the world.

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 12: Devadatta
======================================================================


Mañjuśrī said: "In the ocean, I always preach the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma."

The Buddha said to all the monks: "In the future, if there is a noble man or noble woman who hears this Devadatta chapter of the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma with a pure heart of faith and respect and without giving rise to doubt, they will not fall into the hells, the hungry ghost realm, or the animal realm. They will be born in the presence of Buddhas in the ten directions, and wherever they are born, they will always hear this sutra. If they are born among humans or gods, they will receive supreme and wonderful joy. If they are born in the presence of a Buddha, they will be born by transformation in a lotus flower."

The people of that time had immeasurable life spans. For the sake of the Dharma, I gave up my royal position and entrusted the government to my crown prince. I had drums beaten and a proclamation sent in all four directions to seek the Dharma: 'Whoever can preach the Great Vehicle for me, I will be their servant and serve them for my entire life.' At that time, a hermit came and said to the king: 'I have a Great Vehicle sutra named the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma. If you do not oppose me, I will preach it to you.'

Bodhisattva Accumulated Wisdom said: "I see Śākyamuni Tathagata, who, for immeasurable kalpas, practiced difficult and painful austerities, accumulating merits and virtues to seek the Way of enlightenment, without ever stopping. I have looked at the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, and there is not even a space the size of a mustard seed that is not a place where a Bodhisattva gave up his body and life for the sake of sentient beings. Only after this could he attain the Way of enlightenment. I do not believe that this girl can attain true enlightenment in a moment."

    "I have a deep understanding of the nature of sin and merit,
And my light shines universally in the ten directions.
My subtle, pure Dharma body
Is complete with the thirty-two marks,"

Bodhisattva Accumulated Wisdom asked Mañjuśrī: "How many sentient beings have you converted in the dragon palace?"

Mañjuśrī said: "There is the daughter of Sāgara, the dragon king. She is only eight years old, but she has sharp faculties and wisdom. She is skilled in knowing the faculties and practices of all sentient beings. She has attained dhāranīs, and all the profound and secret treasuries preached by the Buddhas, she can receive and uphold. She has entered deep meditation, thoroughly understood all phenomena, and in a single moment, gave rise to the mind of enlightenment, attained non-retrogression, and has unhindered eloquence. She has a mind of compassion for sentient beings just like a loving mother has for her baby. She is complete in all merits, and her heart and words are subtle, wonderful, and vast. She is compassionate, benevolent, and gentle, and her resolve is harmonious and elegant. She can reach enlightenment."

    "Great wisdom, virtue, courage, and power,
Have converted immeasurable beings.
Now this great assembly
And I have all seen it."

At that time, King of Heaven Buddha will remain in the world for twenty middle kalpas, widely preaching the wonderful Dharma for sentient beings. Sentient beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges will attain the fruit of an arhat. Immeasurable sentient beings will give rise to the mind of a pratyekabuddha. Sentient beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges will give rise to the mind for the supreme Way, attain the patience of non-arising, and reach the state of non-retrogression."

    "I recall a past kalpa,
For the sake of seeking the great Dharma,
Although I was a king of the world,
I was not attached to the pleasures of the five desires."

At that time, the Buddha said to all the Bodhisattvas, gods, and the four groups of the assembly: "In the past, in immeasurable kalpas, I sought the Lotus Sutra without ever being lazy. For many kalpas, I was a king and made a vow to seek supreme enlightenment, and my mind did not waver. To fulfill the six pāramitās, I diligently practiced giving with a mind that was not stingy. I gave away my elephants, horses, seven treasures, country, cities, wife, and children, as well as my slaves and servants. I even gave away my head, eyes, marrow, brain, body, flesh, hands, and feet, and did not begrudge my life.

The Buddha said to all the monks: "The king at that time was myself. The hermit at that time is Devadatta today. It was because of the good friendship of Devadatta that I was able to fully complete the six pāramitās, compassion, joy, giving up, the thirty-two marks, the eighty subtle characteristics, the deep golden color, the ten powers, the four kinds of fearlessness, the four embracing Dharmas, the eighteen unique Dharmas, and the power of supernatural abilities. I attained true enlightenment and widely saved sentient beings, all because of the good friendship of Devadatta."

At that time, the dragon girl had a precious jewel, worth the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, which she held up and offered to the Buddha. The Buddha immediately accepted it. The dragon girl said to Bodhisattva Accumulated Wisdom and the venerable Śāriputra: "I offered the jewel, and the World-Honored One accepted it. Was that fast?"

When the king heard the hermit's words, his heart was filled with joy and delight. He immediately followed the hermit and supplied all his needs. He picked fruit, drew water, gathered firewood, and prepared meals, and he even offered his own body as a bed. His body and mind were never weary. For a thousand years, he served the hermit. For the sake of the Dharma, he diligently attended to him, ensuring he had no lack."

Accumulated Wisdom asked Mañjuśrī: "This sutra is so profound and subtle, a treasure among all sutras, and it is rare in the world. Are there any sentient beings who, by diligently cultivating and practicing this sutra, can quickly attain Buddhahood?"

The girl said: "With your supernatural power, observe my attainment of Buddhahood, which will be even faster than that."

At that time, the Bodhisattva who had followed Abundant Treasures World-Honored One from the lower direction, named Accumulated Wisdom, said to Abundant Treasures Buddha: "We should now return to our home land."

At that moment, everyone in the assembly saw the dragon girl, in an instant, transform into a man. He was complete in the practices of a Bodhisattva, and he immediately went to the world of Stainless-Purity in the south, where he sat on a jeweled lotus flower and attained true enlightenment. He was complete with the thirty-two marks and the eighty subtle characteristics, and he universally preached the wonderful Dharma for all sentient beings in the ten directions.

At that time, Śāriputra said to the dragon girl: "Your belief that you will quickly attain the supreme Way is difficult to believe. Why? A woman's body is defiled and is not a vessel for the Dharma. How can you attain supreme enlightenment? The Buddha Way is vast and far away, and it is attained only after cultivating diligently for immeasurable kalpas and completing all the pāramitās. Furthermore, a woman's body has five hindrances: first, she cannot become a Brahma King; second, a Śakra; third, a Māra King; fourth, a wheel-turning holy king; and fifth, a Buddha. How can a woman's body quickly attain Buddhahood?"

At that time, Bodhisattva Accumulated Wisdom spoke in verse:

At that time, Mañjuśrī, sitting on a lotus flower with a thousand petals as large as a chariot wheel, along with the Bodhisattvas who came with him, also sitting on jeweled lotus flowers, naturally arose from the great ocean, from the dragon king Sāgara’s palace. They dwelt in the air and went to Mount Vulture Peak. They descended from their lotus flowers, went to the Buddha’s place, and bowed their heads in reverence at the feet of the two World-Honored Ones. Having completed their respects, they went to Accumulated Wisdom and greeted him, then sat to one side.

"After King of Heaven Buddha passes into parinirvāṇa, the True Dharma will remain in the world for twenty middle kalpas. A seven-jeweled stupa will be erected for his complete body-relics, sixty yojanas high and forty yojanas in both length and width. All the gods and people will use various flowers, powdered incense, burning incense, paste incense, robes, garlands, banners, canopies, music, and songs to pay homage and make offerings to this wonderful seven-jeweled stupa. Immeasurable sentient beings will attain the fruit of an arhat. Immeasurable sentient beings will be awakened as pratyekabuddhas, and an inconceivable number of sentient beings will give rise to the mind of enlightenment and reach the state of non-retrogression."

At that time, the Bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, gods, dragons, eight kinds of non-human beings, and the humans and non-humans of the Saha world all saw the dragon girl from a distance, becoming a Buddha. He universally preached the Dharma to the assembly of humans and gods at that time. Their hearts were filled with great joy, and they all bowed in reverence from a distance. Immeasurable sentient beings heard the Dharma, understood it, and attained non-retrogression. Three thousand sentient beings attained the prophecy for the Way. The land of Stainless-Purity shook in six ways, and three thousand sentient beings of the Saha world attained the ground of non-retrogression. Three thousand sentient beings gave rise to the mind for enlightenment and received a prophecy. Bodhisattva Accumulated Wisdom, Śāriputra, and the entire assembly silently believed and accepted it.

Mañjuśrī said: "The number is immeasurable, incalculable, beyond what can be expressed in words or measured by the mind. Just wait for a moment, and you will see and know for yourself."

They replied: "Very fast!"

Before he had finished speaking, the Dragon King's daughter suddenly appeared before him. She bowed her head in reverence and then stood to one side, speaking in verse:

Śākyamuni Buddha said to Accumulated Wisdom: "Noble man, please wait for a moment. Here is a Bodhisattva named Mañjuśrī whom you can meet and discuss the wonderful Dharma with. Then you can return to your homeland."

Before he had finished speaking, countless Bodhisattvas, sitting on jeweled lotus flowers, arose from the ocean. They went to Mount Vulture Peak and dwelt in the air. All these Bodhisattvas were converted by Mañjuśrī. They were all complete in the practices of a Bodhisattva and were all discussing the six pāramitās. Those who were originally śrāvakas, who were in the air, spoke of the śrāvaka practices, but now they all practiced the great vehicle Dharma of emptiness.

Mañjuśrī said to Accumulated Wisdom: "My work of converting beings in the ocean is like this."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

The Story of the Dragon King’s Daughter

He said to the four groups of the assembly: "Devadatta, after an immeasurable number of kalpas from now, will attain Buddhahood. His title will be King of Heaven Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His world will be named Heavenly Path.

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 13: Encouragement for Upholding the Sutra
======================================================================


Translated by Tripitaka Master Kumarajiva of the Kucha Kingdom in the Later Qin Dynasty, by imperial decree.

At that time, the Buddha's foster mother, Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, the nun, with her retinue of six thousand nuns who were learners and non-learners, rose from her seat. With a single mind, she joined her palms, and looked up at the Buddha’s revered face without taking her eyes off him.

Then the World-Honored One said to Gautamī: "Why do you look at the Tathagata with a sorrowful expression? Do you think that I did not mention your name and give you a prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?"

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Volume Five

    "We only wish that you would not be concerned.
After the Buddha’s passing,
In that frightening, evil world,
We will widely preach."

At that time, Yaśodharā, the nun and mother of Rāhula, thought: "The World-Honored One has not mentioned my name in the prophecies."

At that time, all the Bodhisattvas together spoke in verse, saying:

“World-Honored One, after the passing of the Tathagata, we will travel and wander in all the worlds of the ten directions and will enable sentient beings to copy this sutra, uphold it, read and recite it, explain its meaning, practice it according to the Dharma, and remember it properly. This will all be due to the Buddha's majestic power. We only wish that the World-Honored One, from another land, would watch over us from afar."

"Gautamī, I previously said that all the śrāvakas have already received a prophecy. But now, if you wish to know your prophecy, in a future life, you will be a great Dharma teacher in the Dharma of sixty-eight thousand million Buddhas. You, and the six thousand learners and non-learners who are nuns, will all be Dharma teachers. In this way, you will gradually complete the Bodhisattva Way and will attain Buddhahood, with the title All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. Gautamī, this All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See Buddha and the six thousand Bodhisattvas will all, in succession, receive a prophecy and attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."

After the nuns spoke this verse, they said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we also will be able to widely preach this sutra in other lands."

The Buddha said to Yaśodharā: "In a future life, in the Dharma of hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, you will practice the Bodhisattva Way and be a great Dharma teacher, gradually completing the Buddha Way. In a pure land, you will attain Buddhahood, with the title King of a Thousand Million Lights Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The Buddha’s life span will be immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas."

    "Our Guide, World-Honored One,
Brings peace to everyone.
Our prophecy now heard and clear,
Calms every heart, dispels all fear."

At that time, the five hundred Arhats in the assembly who had received prophecies said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we also vow that we will widely preach this sutra in other lands."

At that time, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Medicine King and Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Great-Joyful-Eloquence, together with their retinue of twenty thousand Bodhisattvas, all made this vow in the presence of the Buddha: "We only wish, World-Honored One, that you would not be concerned. After the Buddha's passing, we will receive, uphold, read, recite, and preach this scripture. In the evil age to come, sentient beings' roots of goodness will dwindle, and their arrogance will increase. They will be greedy for offerings and gains, and their unwholesome roots will grow. They will be far from liberation. Although they will be difficult to convert, we will give rise to great power of patience and will read, recite, uphold, preach, copy, and make various offerings to this sutra without begrudging our bodies or lives."

The Vow of the Bodhisattvas

At that time, Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, and Yaśodharā, the nun, along with their retinues, were all filled with great, unprecedented joy. They then spoke in verse in the presence of the Buddha:

And the eight thousand learners and non-learners who had received prophecies rose from their seats, joined their palms toward the Buddha, and made this vow: "World-Honored One, we also will widely preach this sutra in other lands. Why? Because the people in this Saha world are very evil, filled with arrogance, shallow in their merit, and full of anger, impurity, flattery, and deceitfulness in their hearts."

At that time, the World-Honored One looked at the eighty million million nayuta Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas. These Bodhisattvas had all attained non-retrogression, turned the non-retrogressing Dharma wheel, and attained all the dhāranīs. They immediately rose from their seats, went to the Buddha's presence, and joined their palms with a single mind. They thought: "If the World-Honored One commands us to uphold and preach this sutra, we will, as commanded by the Buddha, widely preach this Dharma." They thought again: "The Buddha is now silent and does not command us. What should we do?"

Then the Bodhisattvas, respectfully following the Buddha's will and also wishing to fulfill their own original vows, made a lion's roar in the Buddha’s presence and made this vow:

Prophecies for the Nuns

Our prophecy now heard and clear,

Our Guide, World-Honored One,

Calms every heart, dispels all fear.

Brings peace to everyone.

    "After the Buddha’s passing, a truth unlearned.
In that frightening, evil world we face,
We will widely preach with unwavering grace.

There will be ignorant people, filled with spite,
Who will slander and abuse us, day and night.
With evil words and blows, they'll strike and beat,
But we will patiently endure, never retreat.

In the evil world, there will be monks untold,
With false wisdom and hearts of flattery, bold.
They'll claim what they've not reached, with immense pride,
Their arrogance will swell, nowhere to hide.

Some will live in secluded places, wearing rags,
Claiming the true Way, like tattered flags.
But they'll despise the people of the world's embrace,
Lost in their self-proclaimed, isolated space.

Attached to gain and offerings, they'll preach the Dharma's call,
Revered by the world, standing proud and tall.
As if they were Arhats, with powers six,
Their false piety, a deceptive mix.

These people, with minds of evil, will constantly stray,
Thinking of worldly matters, night and day.
Falsely claiming seclusion, a cunning guise,
They'll love to point out our faults with critical eyes.

And they will say these kinds of things, with bitter tongue,
"These monks, to gain and offerings, are wrongly strung.
They preach the theories of outside paths, a twisted lore,
They wrote this scripture themselves, and nothing more.

They delude the world for fame, a selfish plight,"
To slander this sutra, in the fading light.
They will often be in a great assembly's hold,
Wishing to destroy us, stories to be told.

They will go to kings and ministers, Brahmins, elders, all,
And other monks assembled, answering their call.
They'll slander us with evils, spreading wicked lies,
Saying we are people with wrong views, under cloudy skies.

Who preach the theories of outside paths, a grave offense,
Because we revere the Buddha, we bear this immense
Burden of evil, scornful words we'll hear,
"You will all become Buddhas!" banishing all fear.

All such scornful and arrogant words, we'll endure with grace,
In the turbid and evil age, many fears we'll face.
Evil ghosts will enter bodies, with voices low,
And slander and abuse us, as wicked winds blow.

We, out of reverence and faith, will wear the armor of patience,
For the sake of preaching this sutra, with calm prescience.
We do not love our bodies or lives, a transient flight,
But we cherish the supreme Way, shining ever bright.

We will, in a future life, protect what Buddha has bestowed,
The World-Honored One will surely know the path we've trod.
The evil monks of the turbid age, so blind and keen,
Who know not Buddha's expedient means, a sacred scene.

And his preaching of the Dharma, perfectly aligned,
Will abuse us with evil words and frowns, unkind.
They will often be banished, far from stupas and temples, grand,
All these kinds of evil things, we'll bear throughout the land.

We endure, remembering Buddha's command, so clear and deep,
In all the villages and cities, where seekers sleep.
Where there are people seeking Dharma, we'll go to them,
To preach the Dharma Buddha entrusted, a precious gem.

We are the World-Honored One's envoys, with hearts so free,
And we will have no fear in the assembly, you see.
We will skillfully preach the Dharma, with wisdom and might,
We wish the Buddha would be at peace, in pure, clear light.

In the presence of the World-Honored One, our hearts align,
And of all the Buddhas from ten directions, a sacred sign.
We make this vow, with unwavering spirit and soul,
The Buddha himself knows our hearts, making us whole."

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 14: Peaceful and Joyful Practices
======================================================================


"Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the first of all the Tathagata's sermons. Among all the preachings, it is the most profound and subtle. He gives it away at the very end, just like that powerful king who protected the luminous jewel for a long time and only now gives it away. Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the secret treasury of all the Tathagatas. Among all the sutras, it is the most supreme. He has protected it for a long night of existence and has not preached it casually, but only today, he is revealing it for you."

Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is so rare that in immeasurable lands, even its name is not heard, let alone being able to see, uphold, read, or recite it."

"Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Mañjuśrī, in the future, at the time of the final Dharma, when the Dharma is about to be extinguished, those who uphold, read, and recite this scripture should not have a mind of jealousy, flattery, or deceit. He should also not be disrespectful or abuse those who seek the Buddha Way, or look for their good and bad qualities. If they are monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen, or those who seek the śrāvaka path, the pratyekabuddha path, or the Bodhisattva Way, he should not trouble them or cause them to have doubts and regrets. He should not say to them: 'You are still very far from the Way and will never be able to attain All-Knowing Wisdom. Why? Because you are lazy and slack in the Way.' He also should not engage in verbal games about the Dharma or in any disputes.

    "The Bodhisattva should always delight in
Preaching the Dharma peacefully and joyfully.
On a pure ground,
He should place his seat."

"Mañjuśrī, what is called the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva's sphere of actions? The Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva must dwell on the ground of patience, be gentle and yielding, without being abrupt, and their mind should not be agitated. Furthermore, for the Dharma, he should not take any action, but should contemplate all Dharmas as their true nature. He should not act or differentiate. This is called the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva's sphere of actions."

Mañjuśrī, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva who is complete in this fourth Dharma after the Tathagata’s passing, will have no faults when he preaches this Dharma. He will always be respected and worshiped by the monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, kings, princes, ministers, citizens, Brahmins, and elders. The heavenly beings in the sky, for the sake of hearing the Dharma, will also constantly follow him. If he is in a village, city, or secluded forest, and someone comes to ask him a difficult question, the heavenly beings, day and night, will protect him for the sake of the Dharma, and will cause all who listen to rejoice. Why? Because this sutra is protected by the supernatural power of all the Buddhas of the past, present, and future.

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Furthermore, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva should contemplate that all Dharmas are empty, just as their true nature is. They are not upside down, motionless, non-retrogressing, and unchangeable. They are like empty space, without any fixed nature. All verbal expressions are cut off. They do not arise, are not created, do not appear. They have no name and no form. They are truly without any fixed existence. They are immeasurable, boundless, unhindered, and without obstacles. They are only said to exist due to conditions, and they arise from upside-down views. He should always delight in contemplating the true nature of the Dharma. This is called the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva's second sphere of proximity."

The Parable of the King’s Jewel

    "Constantly practicing patience
And compassion for all,
He is then able to expound
The sutra that the Buddha praises."

"What is called the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva's sphere of proximity? The Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva should not be close to kings, princes, ministers, or officials. He should not be close to heretics, Brahmins, or the Nirgranthas, or those who write worldly literature, who praise outside scriptures, or the Lokāyatas and their opponents. He also should not be close to those who engage in dangerous games, wrestling, or wrestling with animals, and all kinds of theatrical performances. He should also not be close to caṇḍālas, or those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens, or dogs, and those who hunt, fish, and engage in all unwholesome professions. If such people happen to come, he should preach the Dharma for them without any hope for a return. He should also not be close to or greet the monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen who seek the śrāvaka path. Whether in their rooms, in their walking meditation area, or in the Dharma hall, he should not live with them. If they happen to come, he should preach the Dharma to them according to what is appropriate, without any hope for a return."

"Mañjuśrī, if the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva in the future, at the time of the final Dharma, when the Dharma is about to be extinguished, is complete in this third peaceful and joyful practice, no one will be able to trouble or confuse him when he preaches this sutra. He will get good fellow students to read and recite this sutra together, and he will also get a great assembly to come and listen. When they have listened, they will be able to uphold it. Having upheld it, they will be able to recite it. Having recited it, they will be able to preach it. Having preached it, they will be able to copy it, or cause others to copy it, and make offerings to the sutra scrolls with reverence, respect, and praise."

"Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, after the Tathagata's passing, in the period of the final Dharma, if a person wishes to preach this sutra, he should dwell in the peaceful and joyful practice. When he preaches the Dharma or reads the sutra, he should not delight in speaking of the faults of others or of other scriptures. He should not be disrespectful to other Dharma teachers, or speak of the good and bad or the long and short of others. For the śrāvaka followers, he should not call them by name and speak of their faults, nor should he call them by name and praise their good qualities. He should also not give rise to a mind of resentment or dislike. By cultivating this kind of peaceful and joyful mind, those who listen will not oppose his wishes. If they have a difficult question, he should not answer with the Small Vehicle Dharma, but should only explain with the Great Vehicle, causing them to attain All-Knowing Wisdom."

"Mañjuśrī, furthermore, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva should not look at a woman in a way that gives rise to thoughts of desire and should preach the Dharma for them. He should also not take pleasure in seeing them. If he enters another person's home, he should not speak alone with young girls, virgins, or widows. He should also not be close to the five kinds of people who are not fully men. He should not enter another person's home alone. If there is a reason for him to enter alone, he should only think of the Buddha with a single mind. If he preaches the Dharma for a woman, he should not show his teeth in laughter, or show his chest. Even for the Dharma, he should not be too intimate, let alone for other matters. He should not take pleasure in having young disciples, śrāmaṇeras, or small children, or in having the same teacher as them. He should always enjoy sitting in meditation and, in a secluded place, cultivate and gather his mind. Mañjuśrī, this is called the first sphere of proximity."

    "If you wish to preach this sutra,
You should abandon jealousy, hatred, and arrogance.
You should abandon flattery and falsehood,
And always cultivate honest conduct."

    "If there is a Bodhisattva,
In a future evil age,
Without a fearful heart,
Who wishes to preach this sutra,
He should enter the sphere of actions
And the sphere of proximity."

"Mañjuśrī, the Tathagata is also like this. With the power of meditation and wisdom, he has attained the land of the Dharma and reigns over the three realms. But all the demon kings do not obey him. The holy and virtuous generals of the Tathagata fight with them—with the demon of the five aggregates, the demon of afflictions, and the demon of death. Those who perform great feats, who extinguish the three poisons, leave the three realms, and break the nets of Māra, the Tathagata is also filled with great joy. The Lotus Sutra is the one Dharma that can cause sentient beings to attain All-Knowing Wisdom. The world is filled with many who resent it and find it difficult to believe. It is a Dharma that was not spoken of before, but now it is being spoken."

He should give rise to a mind of great compassion for all sentient beings. He should give rise to the thought of a compassionate father for all the Tathagatas. He should give rise to the thought of a great teacher for all the Bodhisattvas. For all the great Bodhisattvas of the ten directions, he should always, with a deep heart, bow in reverence. He should preach the Dharma equally to all sentient beings. In accordance with the Dharma, he should not preach too much or too little. Even for those who have a deep love for the Dharma, he should not preach too much for them."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

The Buddha said to Mañjuśrī: "If the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva wishes to preach this sutra in the evil age to come, he must dwell in four Dharmas. First, he must dwell in the sphere of actions and the sphere of proximity of a Bodhisattva, and then he can expound this sutra for sentient beings."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, if the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva, in the future, at the time of the final Dharma, when the Dharma is about to be extinguished, upholds this Lotus Sutra, he should give rise to a mind of great compassion for the laypeople and monastics. For those who are not Bodhisattvas, he should give rise to a mind of great pity. He should think: 'Such people are at a great loss. The Tathagata used expedient means to preach the Dharma according to what was appropriate, but they have not heard it, known it, awakened to it, asked about it, believed in it, or understood it. Even though they do not ask about, believe in, or understand this sutra, when I attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, I will, wherever they are, use the power of my supernatural abilities and wisdom to guide them and cause them to dwell in this Dharma.'

At that time, the Dharma Prince Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Mañjuśrī said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, these Bodhisattvas are very rare. Out of reverence for the Buddha, they have made a great vow to protect, uphold, read, and preach this Lotus Sutra in the evil age to come. World-Honored One, how should the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas preach this sutra in the evil age to come?"

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Mañjuśrī, it is like a powerful wheel-turning holy king who, with his majestic power, wishes to conquer many lands. But the small kings do not obey his command. The wheel-turning king then raises various armies and goes to fight and punish them. The king, seeing his soldiers who have performed great feats in battle, is filled with great joy and rewards them according to their merits. He may give them land and houses, villages and cities, or robes and personal adornments, or various precious treasures, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, tridacna, agate, coral, amber, elephants, horses, carriages, slaves, and people. But the one jewel that is in his topknot, he does not give away. Why? Only the king has this one jewel on his head. If he were to give it away, his relatives would be greatly surprised and alarmed."

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 15: Welling Up from the Earth
======================================================================


    "Excellent! Excellent!
Great, valiant World-Honored One!
All sentient beings
Are easy to convert."

At that time, all the Buddhas each said to their attendants: "Noble men, just wait for a moment. There is a Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva named Maitreya, who has been given a prophecy by Śākyamuni Buddha to be the next Buddha. He has already asked this question. The Buddha will now answer it. You will all be able to hear it on your own."

At that time, the World-Honored One, having spoken this verse, said to Bodhisattva Maitreya: "I now declare to this great assembly and to you: Ajita, these great Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, immeasurable, countless, and asaṃkhyeya, who have sprung forth from the earth, whom you have never seen before, I, in this Saha world, since attaining Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, have converted, guided, and shown them the Way. I have subdued their minds and caused them to give rise to the mind for the Way. These Bodhisattvas all dwell in the empty space below this Saha world, and they read, recite, and master all the scriptures. They contemplate, differentiate, and remember them properly. Ajita, these noble men do not delight in being in a great assembly or in speaking much. They always delight in quiet places and diligently practice with vigor without ever resting. They do not rely on gods or humans to live. They always delight in profound wisdom and have no hindrances. They always delight in the Dharma of the Buddhas, diligently seeking supreme wisdom with a single mind."

At that time, the World-Honored One praised the four great Bodhisattvas: "Excellent, excellent, noble men! You are able to give rise to a mind of joy for the Tathagata."

Although we believe what the Buddha says, that his words are spoken with expedient means and are never false, and that the Buddha knows and has a thorough understanding of everything, if the new Bodhisattvas, after the Buddha’s passing, were to hear these words, they might not believe them and thus commit the sin of rejecting the Dharma. For this reason, World-Honored One, we ask that you explain this matter to remove our doubts, so that in the future, when noble men hear this, they will also not give rise to doubt."

When these Bodhisattvas had emerged from the earth, they each went into the air to the wonderful seven-jeweled stupa, to the place of Abundant Treasures Tathagata and Śākyamuni Buddha. When they arrived, they bowed their heads at the feet of the two World-Honored Ones, and also paid reverence to the Buddhas on the lion’s seats under all the jeweled trees. They circled the Buddhas three times, joined their palms in reverence, and praised them with the various methods of Bodhisattva praise. They stood to one side, joyfully looking up at the two World-Honored Ones.

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha said to Bodhisattva Maitreya: "Excellent, excellent, Ajita! You have been able to ask the Buddha such a great matter. You should all be of one mind, put on the armor of diligence, and give rise to a firm resolve. The Tathagata now wishes to reveal and declare the wisdom of all Buddhas, the independent supernatural power of all Buddhas, the lion's roar power of all Buddhas, and the powerful and majestic power of all Buddhas."

At that time, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya and the countless Bodhisattvas felt doubt in their hearts. They were astonished by this unprecedented event and thought: "How could the World-Honored One, in such a short time, convert such immeasurable and countless asaṃkhyeya great Bodhisattvas and cause them to dwell in Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?" He then said to the Buddha:

At that time, the Buddha said to the assembly of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas: "Stop, noble men. There is no need for you to protect this sutra. Why? In my Saha world, there are already Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers. Each of these Bodhisattvas has a retinue of as many sentient beings as the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers. These people are able, after my passing, to protect, uphold, read, recite, and widely preach this sutra."

    "Be diligent and of one mind!
I am about to speak of this matter.
Do not give rise to any doubt or regret,
For the Buddha’s wisdom is inconceivable."

At that time, the four great Bodhisattvas spoke in verse:

At that time, all the great Bodhisattvas spoke in verse:

At that time, the emanations of Śākyamuni Buddha who had come from countless millions of millions of lands in other directions, were sitting on the lion’s seats under the jeweled trees in the eight directions. Their attendants each saw this great multitude of Bodhisattvas emerging from the ground in all four directions of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world and dwelling in the air. They each said to their Buddha: "World-Honored One, from where has this immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable assembly of Bodhisattvas come?"

At that time, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya, knowing the thoughts in the hearts of the Bodhisattvas, as numerous as the sands of eight thousand Ganges Rivers, and wishing to resolve his own doubts, joined his palms toward the Buddha and spoke in verse:

    "In the past, the Buddha left the Śākya clan,
And near the city of Gaya,
He sat under the bodhi tree.
The time since then has not been long."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

"World-Honored One, when you were a prince, you left the palace of the Śākyas. Not far from the city of Gaya, you sat at the place of enlightenment and attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Since then, only a little over forty years have passed. World-Honored One, how, in such a short time, have you been able to do such a great work of a Buddha and, with the Buddha's power and merits, convert such an immeasurable assembly of great Bodhisattvas, causing them to attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?"

At that time, the World-Honored One spoke to the great assembly of Bodhisattvas, saying: "It is so, it is so, noble men. The Tathagata is at ease, in good health and without much sickness. All sentient beings are easy to convert, and they do not cause me to become weary. Why? These sentient beings, from lifetime to lifetime, have always received my conversion. They have also, in the presence of past Buddhas, shown reverence and respect and planted all kinds of roots of goodness. When these sentient beings first see my body and hear what I preach, they immediately believe it and enter the wisdom of the Tathagata. For those who have first cultivated the Small Vehicle, I now also cause them to hear this sutra and enter the Buddha's wisdom."

Among this assembly of Bodhisattvas, there were four leaders: first, Superior Conduct; second, Limitless Conduct; third, Pure Conduct; and fourth, Firmly-Established Conduct. These four Bodhisattvas were the foremost guides of the assembly. In front of the great assembly, they each joined their palms, looked at Śākyamuni Buddha, and asked him about his well-being: "World-Honored One, are you in good health and without much sickness? Are you at ease in your practice? Are those who should be saved easy to convert? Have they not caused the World-Honored One to become weary?"

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

    "Countless millions of millions of
Bodhisattvas in the great assembly,
We have never seen before.
We wish the Honored One of the two-footed would explain,"

"World-Honored One, even if a person were to count these great Bodhisattva assemblies for millions of kalpas, they could not exhaust or reach the end of their number. These beings, since ancient times, under immeasurable and countless Buddhas, have planted all kinds of good roots, completed the Bodhisattva Way, and constantly cultivated pure conduct. World-Honored One, this matter is difficult for the world to believe. It is like a person who is handsome and has black hair, and is only twenty-five years old. He points to a hundred-year-old man and says, 'This is my son.' And the hundred-year-old man also points to the young man and says, 'This is my father, who fathered us.' This is a matter that the entire world would find difficult to believe."

At that time, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya and his assembly of Bodhisattvas as numerous as the sands of eight thousand Ganges Rivers, all thought: "From the past until now, we have never seen or heard of such a great assembly of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas rising from the earth, dwelling before the World-Honored One, joining their palms, making offerings, and asking about the Tathagata’s well-being."

Each of these Bodhisattvas was the leader of a great assembly and had a retinue of sentient beings as numerous as the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers. How much more so for those who had retinues of fifty thousand, forty thousand, thirty thousand, twenty thousand, or ten thousand Ganges River sands? How much more still for those with even one Ganges River sand, a half, a quarter, or even one part of ten million nayuta? How much more for those with a retinue of millions and millions, or thousands and thousands, or hundreds, or tens, or even five, four, three, two, or one disciple? How much more for those who were alone and delighted in the practice of solitude? Such Bodhisattvas were immeasurable and boundless, beyond the reach of calculation and parables.

"The Buddha is also like this. The time since you attained the Way is truly not long, and yet this great assembly of Bodhisattvas has, for immeasurable millions of kalpas, diligently practiced for the sake of the Buddha Way. They have skillfully entered, dwelt in, and come out of immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of samadhis, attained great supernatural powers, cultivated pure conduct for a long time, and are skilled in gradually learning all wholesome Dharmas. They are eloquent in asking and answering questions, they are the treasures of the world, and are extremely rare in all the worlds. Yet today, the World-Honored One says that when he attained the Buddha Way, he first caused them to give rise to the mind of enlightenment, and he converted and guided them, causing them to aspire to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. The World-Honored One attained Buddhahood not long ago, and yet you were able to do this great and meritorious deed.

When the Buddha said this, the ground of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world split open and trembled. From within, countless millions of millions of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas rose all at once. These Bodhisattvas all had golden bodies, were adorned with the thirty-two marks, and radiated immeasurable light. They had all been living below the Saha world in the empty space of this realm. These Bodhisattvas heard the voice of Śākyamuni Buddha and came forth from below.

    "Ajita, you should know,
These great Bodhisattvas,
Since countless kalpas,
Have cultivated the Buddha's wisdom."

    "World-Honored One, are you at ease?
In good health and without much sickness?
In converting sentient beings,
Do you not feel weary?"

At that time, Bodhisattva Maitreya, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

At that time, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas who had come from other lands, numbering more than eight times the sands of the Ganges, rose from the assembly, joined their palms in reverence, and said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, if you would permit us, after the Buddha's passing, we will diligently and with great effort, protect, uphold, read, recite, copy, and make offerings to this scripture in this Saha world. We will then widely preach it in this land."

From the moment these Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas first emerged, they praised the Buddhas with various methods of Bodhisattva praise. In this way, a period of fifty minor kalpas passed. At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha sat in silence, and the four groups of the assembly also sat in silence for fifty minor kalpas. But by the supernatural power of the Buddha, the great assembly felt that it had been only a half day. At that time, the four groups of the assembly, also by the supernatural power of the Buddha, saw these Bodhisattvas filling the air of immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of countries.

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 16: The Lifespan of the Tathagata
======================================================================


"Noble men, in this interim, I have spoken of Buddhas such as Burning Lamp and have also said that they entered nirvana. All of this was differentiated through expedient means. Noble men, if there are sentient beings who come to me, I use my Buddha eye to observe their faith and their sharpness or dullness of faculties. According to who needs to be saved, I manifest myself in different places, with different names and ages. I also declare that I am about to enter nirvana, and I use all kinds of expedient means to preach the subtle and wonderful Dharma, which can cause sentient beings to give rise to a joyful heart. Noble men, when the Tathagata sees sentient beings who delight in the small Dharma and have little virtue and heavy defilements, he preaches for these people, saying: 'I renounced my home when I was young and attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.' However, I have actually attained Buddhahood for a long, long time, but for the sake of converting sentient beings and causing them to enter the Buddha Way, I speak in this way."

The Parable of the Good Doctor

"Noble men, all the scriptures expounded by the Tathagata are for the sake of saving and liberating sentient beings. Sometimes he speaks of his own body, and sometimes he speaks of other bodies. Sometimes he shows his own deeds, and sometimes he shows the deeds of others. All that he says is truthful and not false. Why? The Tathagata truly knows and sees the nature of the three realms. There is no such thing as life and death, or leaving and returning. There is also no such thing as dwelling in the world or passing away. It is neither real nor false, neither the same nor different. It is not like the three realms, which are seen as the three realms. Such matters are clearly seen by the Tathagata, without any error. Because sentient beings have various natures, various desires, various practices, and various thoughts and differentiations, wishing to cause them to give rise to roots of goodness, I use various causes, parables, and words to preach the Dharma in various ways. The work of a Buddha has never ceased, not even for a moment. In this way, the time since I attained Buddhahood has been very long. My life span is immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, and I constantly dwell in the world and do not pass away."

"Noble men, what do you think? Is there anyone who could say that this good doctor committed a crime of falsehood?"

"No, World-Honored One."

At that time, their father returns home. Some of the children who drank the poison have lost their original minds, and some have not. When they see their father from a distance, they are all filled with great joy. They bow down and ask about his safe and peaceful return: 'We were foolish and accidentally drank poison. We wish that you would save and cure us and grant us a longer life.' The father sees his children suffering like this. He follows the prescriptions in the scriptures, finds good medicinal herbs, and has them prepared with all the right colors, fragrances, and tastes. He grinds and sifts them and gives them to his children to take, saying: 'This is a great, good medicine. Its color and fragrance are both wonderful, and it is complete with all good tastes. You should all take it. It will quickly remove your suffering and afflictions, and you will have no more sickness.'

Having given this instruction, he went to another country. He sent a messenger back to his home to say: 'Your father has died.' When the children heard of their father's passing, their hearts were filled with great sorrow and affliction. They thought: 'If our father were still alive, he would have compassion for us and be able to save and protect us. But now he has left us and passed away in a distant land.' They felt orphaned and alone, with no one to rely on. A constant feeling of grief filled their hearts, and their minds gradually became clear. They then realized that the medicine was good in its color, taste, and fragrance. They took it immediately, and the sickness from the poison was all cured. Their father heard that his children had all recovered, so he returned home and let them all see him."

"It is like five hundred million million nayuta asaṃkhyeya three-thousand-great-thousand-fold worlds. If there was a person who ground them into fine dust, and then, after passing five hundred million million nayuta asaṃkhyeya countries to the east, he dropped one speck of dust. In this way, he continues eastward until all the fine dust is used up. Noble men, what do you think? Can these worlds be calculated or can their number be known by a thought?"

At that time, the World-Honored One, knowing that the Bodhisattvas' three requests would not stop, said to them: "You must listen carefully to the secret and supernatural power of the Tathagata. All the worlds of gods, humans, and asuras believe that Śākyamuni Buddha left the palace of the Śākya clan, and not far from the city of Gaya, sat at the place of enlightenment and attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. But noble men, I have, in fact, attained Buddhahood since immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta asaṃkhyeya kalpas ago."

Bodhisattva Maitreya and the others all said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, these worlds are immeasurable and boundless. They are not known by calculation, nor can they be reached by the power of the mind. All the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, with their pure wisdom, cannot contemplate or know their number. We, who dwell on the ground of non-retrogression, also cannot reach this. World-Honored One, such worlds are truly immeasurable and boundless."

    "Since I attained Buddhahood,
The number of kalpas that have passed
Is immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions
of eons and asaṃkhyeyas."

"Among the children, those who had not lost their minds saw that this good medicine had a wonderful color and fragrance, and they immediately took it. Their sickness was completely cured. The others, who had lost their minds, although they saw their father return and were happy to ask about his well-being and seek a cure for their sickness, refused to take the medicine when it was given to them. Why? Because the poison had gone deep and they had lost their original minds. They thought that this medicine, with its wonderful color and fragrance, was not good.

"Noble men, the life span I attained through my practice of the Bodhisattva Way is still not exhausted, and it is more than double the number I gave above. However, I am not truly entering extinction, but I declare that I am about to attain extinction. The Tathagata uses this expedient means to convert sentient beings. Why? If the Buddha were to dwell in the world for a long time, people with little virtue would not plant roots of goodness. They would be poor and of low status, and would be attached to the five desires, falling into a net of thoughts and false views. If they saw that the Tathagata always exists and does not pass away, they would become arrogant and lazy. They would not give rise to the thought that he is difficult to encounter or a respectful mind. For this reason, the Tathagata, using expedient means, says: 'Monks, you should know that the appearance of the Buddhas in the world is difficult to encounter.' Why? For those with little virtue, after countless millions of kalpas, they may see a Buddha, or they may not. Because of this, I say: 'Monks, the Tathagata is difficult to see.' When these sentient beings hear such words, they will surely give rise to the thought that he is difficult to encounter, and their hearts will be filled with longing and thirst for the Buddha. They will then plant roots of goodness. For this reason, even though the Tathagata does not truly pass away, he says he is entering extinction."

At that time, the assembly of Bodhisattvas, led by Maitreya, joined their palms and said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we only wish that you would speak. We will believe and accept the Buddha's words." After they made this request three times, they said again: "We only wish that you would speak. We will believe and accept the Buddha's words."

"Furthermore, noble men, the Dharmas of all the Tathagatas are all like this. For the sake of saving sentient beings, their words are all true and not false.

At that time, the Buddha said to all the Bodhisattvas and the entire great assembly: "Noble men, you must believe and understand the Tathagata's honest and truthful words." He again said to the great assembly: "You must believe and understand the Tathagata's honest and truthful words." And again, he said to the great assembly: "You must believe and understand the Tathagata's honest and truthful words."

"Imagine a good doctor who is intelligent and wise, and who is well-versed in prescriptions and medicines, and skilled at curing all kinds of sicknesses. This man has many children, perhaps ten, twenty, or even a hundred. Because of a business matter, he goes far away to another country. Later, his children drink poison that was given to them by someone else. When the poison takes effect, they become confused and lie on the ground, rolling in agony.

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

At that time, the Buddha said to the great assembly of Bodhisattvas: "Noble men, I will now clearly declare this for you. All these worlds, whether a speck of dust was dropped on them or not, if they were all made into dust, and each speck of dust were a kalpa, the time since I attained Buddhahood would be more than that by hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta asaṃkhyeya kalpas. Since that time, I have constantly been in this Saha world, preaching the Dharma and converting beings. I have also, in other places, in hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta asaṃkhyeya countries, guided and benefited sentient beings."

The father thought: 'These children are pitiful. They have been poisoned, and their minds are all upside-down. Although they see me and are happy, and they seek to be saved and cured, they will not take this wonderful medicine. I must now devise an expedient means to cause them to take this medicine.' He then said: 'You should all know that I am now old, and my time to die has come. This good, great medicine will be left here. You can take it and take it. Do not worry that you will not be cured.'

The Buddha said: "I am also like this. The time since I attained Buddhahood has been an immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta asaṃkhyeya kalpas. For the sake of sentient beings, I use the power of expedient means to say that I am about to enter extinction. There is no one who can, according to the Dharma, accuse me of a fault of falsehood."

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 17: Merits of Distinction
======================================================================


At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya: "Ajita, if there is a sentient being who hears that the Buddha's life span is so long and far-reaching, and is able to give rise to a single thought of belief and understanding, the merit they attain is without any limit. If a noble man or noble woman, for the sake of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, practices the five pāramitās for eighty million million nayuta kalpas—the pāramitā of giving, the pāramitā of precepts, the pāramitā of patience, the pāramitā of diligence, and the pāramitā of meditation, but not the pāramitā of wisdom—and you compare this merit to the previous merit, it is not even one hundredth, one thousandth, one hundred-millionth of it. It cannot be known by any calculation or parable. If a noble man or noble woman has such a merit, it is impossible for them to retrogress from Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."

"How much more so for a person who can uphold this sutra and also practice giving, precepts, patience, diligence, a single mind, and wisdom? Their virtues are the most supreme, immeasurable, and boundless. Just as empty space—east, west, south, north, the four diagonals, above, and below—is immeasurable and boundless, the merit of this person is also immeasurable and boundless. He will quickly attain All-Knowing Wisdom. If a person reads and recites this sutra, upholds it, preaches it for others, copies it himself, or causes others to copy it, and is also able to erect a stupa, build monasteries, and make offerings to and praise the śrāvaka monastic community, and also uses hundreds of thousands of millions of methods to praise the merits of the Bodhisattvas, and for the sake of others, uses various causes and conditions to explain this Lotus Sutra according to its meaning, and is also able to purely uphold the precepts and live with those who are gentle, is patient and without anger, his resolve is firm, he always values sitting in meditation and attains various profound meditations, he is diligent and valiant, gathering all good Dharmas, and he has sharp wisdom and is skilled in answering difficult questions..."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Ajita, after my passing, if a person hears this scripture and is able to uphold it, or copies it himself, or causes others to copy it, he has already built monasteries. He has built thirty-two halls and pavilions with red sandalwood, which are eight tāla trees high, vast, and beautifully adorned. A hundred thousand monks will dwell within them. The gardens, bathing ponds, walking meditation areas, and meditation caves will all be complete with various wonderful things. Such monasteries and pavilions, numbering hundreds of thousands of millions, are immeasurable. With these, he makes offerings to me and the monastic community. For this reason, I say that after the Tathagata’s passing, if a person upholds, reads, recites, and preaches this sutra for others, or copies it himself, or causes others to copy it and make offerings to the sutra scrolls, he does not need to build a stupa or monastery and make offerings to the monastic community.

"Furthermore, Ajita, if there is a person who hears that the Buddha's life span is long and far-reaching and understands its meaning, the merit this person attains is without any limit. They are able to give rise to the Buddha's supreme wisdom. How much more so for one who widely hears this sutra, or causes others to hear it? Or if they uphold it themselves, or cause others to uphold it? Or if they copy it themselves, or cause others to copy it? Or if they make offerings to the sutra scrolls with flowers, incense, garlands, banners, canopies, fragrant oil, and ghee lamps? The merit of this person is immeasurable and boundless. He is able to give rise to All-Knowing Wisdom.

"Ajita, this noble man or noble woman does not need to build a stupa or monastery for me or make the four kinds of offerings to the monastic community. Why? This noble man or noble woman who receives, upholds, reads, and recites this scripture has already built a stupa, erected monasteries, and made offerings to the monastic community. They have already built a seven-jeweled stupa with the Buddha’s relics, which is tall and vast, gradually becoming smaller as it reaches the Brahma heavens. They have hung banners and canopies and all kinds of jeweled bells from it, with flowers, incense, garlands, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, all kinds of drums, music, flutes, and harps. With wonderful voices, they sing and praise it. This is as if they have made these offerings for immeasurable millions of kalpas."

"When the Buddha spoke of these Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas gaining the great benefits of the Dharma, heavenly maṇḍārava and mahāmaṇḍārava flowers rained down from the air. They were scattered upon the Buddhas sitting on the lion's seats under the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of jeweled trees, and also upon Śākyamuni Buddha and the long-passed-away Abundant Treasures Tathagata in the seven-jeweled stupa. They were also scattered upon all the great Bodhisattvas and the four groups of the assembly.

    "If after my passing,
One can uphold this sutra,
The blessings of this person are immeasurable,
Just as I have said above."

    "The Buddha has preached a rare Dharma,
That we have never heard before.
The World-Honored One has great power,
And his life span is immeasurable."

"Ajita, after my passing, if a noble man or noble woman receives and upholds this scripture and has these wholesome merits, you should know that this person has already reached the place of enlightenment and is close to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, sitting under the bodhi tree. Ajita, if a noble man or noble woman is sitting, standing, or in a walking meditation area, a stupa should be erected right there. All the gods and humans should make offerings to it, as if it were the Buddha's stupa."

"Ajita, when I preached that the Tathagata's life span is long and far-reaching, sentient beings, as numerous as the sands of six hundred and eighty million million nayuta Ganges Rivers, attained the patience of non-arising. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, one thousand times that number, attained the Dharma-gate of total recall (dhāranī). Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of one world attained the unhindered eloquence of joyful speech. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of one world attained the total recall of the whirling Dharma, with its hundreds of thousands of millions of varieties. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of a three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world were able to turn the non-retrogressing Dharma wheel. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of two thousand middle worlds were able to turn the pure Dharma wheel. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of a thousand small worlds will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi in eight lifetimes. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of four four-continents will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi in four lifetimes. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of three four-continents will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi in three lifetimes. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of two four-continents will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi in two lifetimes. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of one four-continent will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi in one lifetime. Furthermore, sentient beings as numerous as the dust motes of eight worlds all gave rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

    "If a person seeks the Buddha’s wisdom,
For eighty million million
Nayuta kalpas,
And practices the five pāramitās,"

At that time, the great assembly, having heard the Buddha speak of his life span as being so long and far-reaching, found that immeasurable, boundless, and asaṃkhyeya sentient beings gained great benefits. Then the World-Honored One said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya:

At that time, Bodhisattva Maitreya rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, joined his palms toward the Buddha, and spoke in verse:

"Fine sandalwood and incense like agarwood also rained down from the air. Heavenly drums sounded by themselves, with a subtle and profound sound. A thousand kinds of heavenly robes also rained down, along with garlands of pearls, garlands of mani jewels, and garlands of wish-fulfilling jewels. They filled the nine directions. Jeweled incense burners of many kinds, burning priceless incense, naturally spread everywhere as offerings to the great assembly. Above each Buddha, there were Bodhisattvas holding banners and canopies, moving in order, all the way up to the Brahma heavens. These Bodhisattvas, with their wonderful voices, sang countless verses, praising all the Buddhas."

"Ajita, if a noble man or noble woman hears me speak of my long and far-reaching life span and believes and understands it with a deep heart, they will be as if they see the Buddha constantly on Mount Vulture Peak, surrounded by great Bodhisattvas and śrāvaka assemblies, preaching the Dharma. They will also see this Saha world with a ground of lapis lazuli, level and smooth, with golden ropes lining the eight roads. Jeweled trees will stand in rows, and all the towers and pavilions will be made of jewels. The Bodhisattva assemblies will all be dwelling within it. If a person can contemplate in this way, you should know that this is a sign of deep belief and understanding."

"Furthermore, after the Tathagata’s passing, if a person hears this sutra and does not slander it but gives rise to a joyful heart, you should know that this is also a sign of deep belief and understanding. How much more so for one who reads, recites, and upholds it? Such a person is bearing the Tathagata on his head.

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 18: Merits of Joyful Following
======================================================================


    "After the World-Honored One has passed away,"

"Furthermore, Ajita, if a person, for the sake of this sutra, goes to a monastery and, whether sitting or standing, listens for a moment and accepts it, because of this merit, in their next life, they will be reborn with good and wonderful elephants, horses, carriages, jeweled palanquins, and will even ride in a heavenly palace. If a person is sitting in a place where the Dharma is being preached and another person comes and is encouraged to sit and listen, or if they give a part of their seat to them, the merit of this person is such that in their next life, they will be reborn in the seat of Śakra, or on the seat of the Brahma King, or on the seat of a wheel-turning holy king."

At that time, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, if a noble man or noble woman hears this Lotus Sutra and rejoices in it, how much merit do they attain?" He spoke in verse, asking:

    "If a person, in a Dharma assembly,"

At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya: "Ajita, after the Tathagata's passing, if a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman, or any other wise person, whether old or young, hears this sutra, and having rejoiced in it, leaves the Dharma assembly and goes to another place—whether in a monastery, a secluded place, a city, a street, a village, or a field—and for their parents, relatives, good friends, or acquaintances, preaches what they heard according to their ability, and these people hear it and rejoice, and then in turn preach to others, and others hear it and also rejoice and preach in turn, and so on, until the fiftieth person in this chain. Ajita, I will now speak of the merit of the fiftieth person who rejoices. You should listen well."

"Ajita, if a person says to another person: 'There is a sutra named the Lotus Sutra; we should go and listen to it together,' and that person accepts the instruction and goes and listens for even a moment, the merit of this person is such that in their next life, they will be reborn in the same place as a Bodhisattva with dhāranīs. They will have sharp faculties and wisdom, and for hundreds of thousands of lifetimes, they will never be mute. Their breath will never be foul, their tongue will always be free of sickness, and their mouth will also be free of sickness. Their teeth will not be dirty, black, or yellow; they will not be gapped, crooked, or missing. Their lips will not be drooping, retracted, coarse, or chapped. They will not be broken or slanted. They will not be thick or large, or dark and black. They will not have any unpleasant characteristics. Their lips, tongue, and teeth will all be beautifully adorned. Their nose will be long, high, and straight. Their face will be round and full. Their eyebrows will be high and long. Their forehead will be broad, level, and straight. They will be complete in the marks of a human being. In every life in which they are born, they will see the Buddha, hear the Dharma, and believe and accept his teachings."

What do you think, Maitreya? Is the merit gained by this great giver great?"

The Merit of Simple Acts

The Buddha said to Maitreya: "I will now tell you clearly. The merit of that person who gave all the means of enjoyment to the sentient beings of the six destinies in four hundred million million asaṃkhyeya worlds and also caused them to attain the fruit of an arhat, is not even one-hundredth, one-thousandth, or one-hundred-millionth of the merit of the fiftieth person who hears a single verse of the Lotus Sutra and rejoices in it. It is beyond the reach of any calculation or parable. Ajita, the merit of this fiftieth person in the chain who rejoices in the Lotus Sutra is still immeasurable, boundless, and asaṃkhyeya, how much more so for the person who first heard it in the assembly and rejoiced? Their blessings are even greater, immeasurable, boundless, and asaṃkhyeya, and cannot be compared."

"Ajita, you should consider this: the merit of encouraging a single person to go and listen to the Dharma is like this. How much more so for one who listens with a single mind, preaches and recites it, and for the great assembly, explains it for others and practices it as it is taught?"

Maitreya said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, the merit of this person is very great, immeasurable, and boundless. If this giver had only given all sentient beings the means of enjoyment, his merit would be immeasurable, let alone causing them to attain the fruit of an arhat."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

The Merit of the Fiftieth Person

"Imagine in four hundred million million asaṃkhyeya worlds, there are all the sentient beings of the six destinies and four types of birth—those born from eggs, from wombs, from moisture, and from transformation; those with form and those without form; those with thought, those without thought, and those with neither thought nor no thought; and those with no feet, two feet, four feet, or many feet. In this great number of sentient beings, there is a person who seeks to plant blessings and gives them all the means of enjoyment they desire. He gives each and every one of these sentient beings enough gold, silver, lapis lazuli, tridacna, agate, coral, amber, and other wonderful precious treasures to fill the entire Jambudvīpa (the entire world). He also gives them elephants, horses, carriages, and jeweled palaces and pavilions. This great giver practices this charity for eighty years. He then thinks: 'I have given all sentient beings the means of enjoyment they wished for, but now these sentient beings are all old, over eighty years of age, with white hair and wrinkled faces, and will soon die. I should now instruct and guide them with the Buddha Dharma.' He then gathers all these sentient beings and proclaims the Dharma, revealing and teaching it to them, bringing them benefit and joy. They all, at once, attain the fruit of a srotāpanna, a sakṛdāgāmin, an anāgāmin, and an arhat. They end all their defilements, attain freedom in profound meditation, and are complete in the eight liberations.

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 19: Merits of a Teacher of the Dharma
======================================================================


"If he preaches on worldly scriptures, on the words of governance, or on the work of sustaining life, it will all be in accordance with the true Dharma. The thoughts, actions, and verbal games of all sentient beings in the six destinies of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, he will know them all. Although he has not yet attained the wisdom of unconditioned reality, his mind faculty is already this pure. Whatever this person thinks, contemplates, or speaks, it is all the Buddha Dharma, and it is all true. It is also what has been preached in the sutras of the Buddhas of the past."

The Merits of the Tongue

    "The ear born of his parents"

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

    "This person's mind is pure,"

"Furthermore, Constant Diligence, if a noble man or noble woman upholds this sutra, or reads, recites, explains, or copies it, they will attain twelve hundred merits for the ear. With this pure ear, they will hear all kinds of languages and sounds, both inside and outside the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, from the lowest Avīci hell to the highest heaven. The sounds of elephants, horses, cattle, and carriages; the sounds of crying and sighing; the sounds of conches, drums, bells, and chimes; the sounds of laughter and speech; the sounds of men, women, boys, and girls; the sounds of the Dharma and the sounds of non-Dharma; the sounds of suffering and the sounds of joy; the sounds of ordinary people and the sounds of sages; the sounds of happiness and the sounds of unhappiness; the sounds of gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, and mahoragas; the sounds of fire, water, and wind; the sounds of the hells, the animal realm, and the hungry ghost realm; the sounds of monks and nuns; the sounds of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; the sounds of Bodhisattvas and the sounds of the Buddhas. To put it simply, with their pure, ordinary ear born of their parents, they will hear and know all sounds, both inside and outside the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world. In this way, they will differentiate all kinds of sounds without damaging their ear faculty."

"This noble man or noble woman, with their pure physical eyes, born from their parents, will see all the mountains, forests, rivers, and seas, both inside and outside the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world. He will see down to the Avīci hell and up to the highest heaven. He will also see all the sentient beings within them, and their karmic causes, effects, and places of rebirth. He will see and know all of this."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

The Merits of the Nose

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

The Merits of the Body

"The one who upholds this sutra, although dwelling here, can also smell the fragrances of the heavenly beings—the fragrance of the pārijāta and kovidāra trees, and the fragrances of maṇḍārava flowers, mahāmaṇḍārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, and mahāmañjūṣaka flowers; and the fragrances of sandalwood, agarwood, and various powdered incenses and blended floral incenses. He can hear all of these fragrances. He also hears the body fragrance of the heavenly beings. He hears the fragrance of Śakra, the king of the gods, when he is in his wonderful palace enjoying the five desires. He hears the fragrance of when he is in the wonderful Dharma hall preaching the Dharma for the gods of the Thirty-three Heavens. He hears the fragrance of when he is playing in the gardens. He also hears the body fragrance of the other gods, men, and women, from a distance. In this way, he can hear the body fragrances of the heavenly beings, all the way up to the Brahma world and the highest heaven. He can also smell the incense that the heavenly beings burn, and the fragrances of the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, and all the Buddhas’ bodies, and he knows where they are. Although he hears all these fragrances, his nose faculty is not damaged or confused. If he wishes to differentiate them and preach them for others, he can remember them without error."

    "If a person upholds the Lotus Sutra,"

"The one who upholds this sutra, dwelling in this place, can differentiate all of these. He can also differentiate the fragrances of sentient beings—the fragrance of elephants, horses, cattle, and sheep; the fragrance of men, women, boys, and girls; and the fragrance of shrubs and forests. All fragrances, whether near or far, he can hear them all and differentiate them without any error.

"Furthermore, Constant Diligence, if a noble man or noble woman upholds this sutra, or reads, recites, explains, or copies it, they will attain eight hundred merits for the nose. With this pure nose, they will smell all kinds of fragrances, both inside and outside the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, from above and below. The fragrances of sumana flowers, jāti flowers, mallikā flowers, campaka flowers, and parūṣaka flowers; the fragrances of red, blue, and white lotus flowers; the fragrances of flowering trees and fruit trees; the fragrances of sandalwood, agarwood, tāmalapattra incense, and tagara incense; and thousands of kinds of blended incenses, whether in powder, ball, or paste form.

"Furthermore, Constant Diligence, if a noble man or noble woman upholds this sutra, or reads, recites, explains, or copies it, they will attain twelve hundred merits for the tongue. If they eat something that is good or bad, beautiful or not beautiful, or all things that are bitter and astringent, on their tongue faculty, they all become a supreme flavor, like the ambrosia of the heavens. Nothing is not delicious.

"Furthermore, Constant Diligence, if a noble man or noble woman, after the Tathagata's passing, upholds this sutra, or reads, recites, explains, or copies it, they will attain twelve hundred merits for the mind. With this pure mind faculty, upon hearing even one verse or one line, they will penetrate the immeasurable and boundless meanings. Having understood this meaning, they can then expound on a single line or a single verse for a month, for four months, or even for a year. What he preaches, according to its meaning, will not be at odds with the true nature of all phenomena.

"Furthermore, Constant Diligence, if a noble man or noble woman upholds this sutra, or reads, recites, explains, or copies it, they will attain eight hundred merits for the body. They will attain a pure body, like pure lapis lazuli, which sentient beings delight to see. Because their body is pure, all sentient beings of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, from the time of their birth to the time of their death, whether they are superior or inferior, beautiful or ugly, or born in good or evil places, will all be reflected within it. And the Iron Ring Mountains, the Great Iron Ring Mountains, Mount Meru, Mount Mahāmeru, and all such mountains, and all the sentient beings within them, will all be reflected within it. Down to the Avīci hell and up to the highest heaven, all beings and all their surroundings will all be reflected within it. The Dharma preached by the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, and all the Buddhas will all be reflected as images within his body."

    "This person's tongue faculty is pure;"

At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Constant Diligence: "If a noble man or noble woman receives and upholds this Lotus Sutra, or reads, recites, explains, or copies it, this person will attain eight hundred merits for the eye, twelve hundred merits for the ear, eight hundred merits for the nose, twelve hundred merits for the tongue, eight hundred merits for the body, and twelve hundred merits for the mind. With these merits, their six sense faculties will be adorned and made completely pure.

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If, with their tongue faculty, they expound anything in a great assembly, a profound and subtle voice will come forth that can enter the hearts of all and cause them to be joyful and happy. Furthermore, the heavenly gods and goddesses, and the gods of the Śakra and Brahma heavens, when they hear this profound and subtle voice, and his orderly explanation and words, they will all come to listen. And the dragons and dragon maidens, yakshas and yaksha maidens, gandharvas and gandharva maidens, asuras and asura maidens, garudas and garuda maidens, kinnaras and kinnara maidens, and mahoragas and mahoraga maidens, for the sake of hearing the Dharma, will all come to be close to him and make respectful offerings. And the monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, kings, princes, ministers, and their families; the small and great wheel-turning kings, with their thousands of sons and all their relatives, will ride in their palaces and all come to listen to the Dharma, because this Bodhisattva preaches the Dharma so well. The Brahmins, elders, and the people of the land will serve and make offerings to him for their entire lives. Furthermore, the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, and all the Buddhas always delight in seeing him. In whatever direction this person is, all the Buddhas will preach the Dharma toward that place. He can receive and uphold all the Buddha Dharmas and can also emit a profound and subtle sound of Dharma."

    "If, in a great assembly,"

    "This person's nose is pure."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 20: The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging
======================================================================


    "In the past, there was a Buddha"

"After the first King of Awesome Sound Tathagata had passed away and his True Dharma had been extinguished, in the period of the Dharma-Image, the arrogant monks were a great force. At that time, there was a Bodhisattva monk named Never Disparaging. Great-Power, for what reason was he named Never Disparaging? This monk, whenever he saw a person—whether they were a monk, nun, layman, or laywoman—he would bow in reverence to them and praise them, saying: 'I deeply revere all of you, and I do not dare to hold you in contempt. Why? Because you will all practice the Bodhisattva Way and will attain Buddhahood.'

"In this way, after many years, he was constantly abused, but he did not give rise to a mind of anger. He always said: 'You will attain Buddhahood.' When he spoke these words, people would sometimes hit him with sticks, wood, tiles, or stones. He would run away and stand at a distance, and would still say in a loud voice: 'I do not dare to hold you in contempt. You will all attain Buddhahood.' Because he always spoke these words, the arrogant monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen gave him the name Never Disparaging."

"This Bodhisattva also converted hundreds of thousands of millions of beings, causing them to dwell in Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. After he passed away, he encountered two hundred thousand million Buddhas, all named Sun Moon Lamp Light, and in their Dharma, he preached the Lotus Sutra. Because of this cause, he again encountered two hundred thousand million Buddhas, all named King of Cloud-Sovereign-Lamp. In the Dharma of all these Buddhas, he received and upheld, read, and recited this sutra. Because he preached this scripture for the four groups of the assembly, he attained the constant purity of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. When he preached the Dharma for the four groups, his heart was fearless."

At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Great-Power: "You should now know that if a monk, nun, layman, or laywoman who upholds the Lotus Sutra is slandered and abused with evil words, the great karmic retribution they receive is as I have said before. The merit they gain is the purification of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, as I have also said before.

The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging

The Karmic Connection

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

Great-Power, in the distant past, an immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable asaṃkhyeya kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named King of Awesome Sound Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa was named Leaving-Decay, and the land was named Great-Completion. This King of Awesome Sound Buddha, in that world, preached the Dharma for gods, humans, and asuras. For those who sought the śrāvaka path, he preached the Dharma of the Four Noble Truths to save them from birth, old age, sickness, and death and lead them to ultimate nirvana. For those who sought the pratyekabuddha path, he preached the Dharma of the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. For the Bodhisattvas, he preached the Dharma of the six pāramitās for the sake of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, ultimately leading them to the wisdom of the Buddha.

"Great-Power, this Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Never Disparaging made offerings to countless Buddhas in this way, with reverence, respect, and praise, and planted roots of goodness. In a later time, he again encountered thousands of millions of Buddhas, and he also preached this scripture in their Dharma. With the completion of his merits, he was able to attain Buddhahood.

"When this monk was about to pass away, he heard from the empty sky the Lotus Sutra that King of Awesome Sound Buddha had previously preached, in twenty hundred million verses. He was able to receive and uphold all of it and immediately attained the purification of the six sense faculties—the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, as mentioned above. Having attained this purification of the six sense faculties, he gained a longer life of two hundred million million nayuta years and widely preached the Lotus Sutra to people. At that time, the arrogant four groups who had held him in contempt and given him the name Never Disparaging, saw that he had attained great supernatural power, the power of joyful eloquence, and the power of great stillness. When they heard his preaching, they all believed and submitted, and followed him.

"Great-Power, the four groups of the assembly at that time—the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—who, with a mind of anger, held me in contempt, for two hundred million kalpas did not encounter a Buddha, did not hear the Dharma, and did not see the monastic community. For a thousand kalpas, they endured great suffering in the Avīci hell. After their sins were exhausted, they again encountered Bodhisattva Never Disparaging, who converted them to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.

Great-Power, this King of Awesome Sound Buddha's life span was four hundred thousand million nayuta kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. The number of kalpas that his True Dharma remained in the world was as many as the dust motes of a single Jambudvīpa. The number of kalpas that his Dharma-Image remained in the world was as many as the dust motes of four four-continents. After that Buddha brought great benefit to sentient beings, he passed away. After the True Dharma and Dharma-Image had been completely extinguished, in that land, another Buddha appeared, also named King of Awesome Sound Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. In this way, there were twenty hundred million Buddhas, all with the same title."

"This monk did not exclusively read or recite the scriptures. He only bowed and paid reverence. Even when he saw the four groups of the assembly from a distance, he would still go and bow to them and praise them, saying: 'I do not dare to hold you in contempt. You will all attain Buddhahood.' Among the four groups of the assembly, those who gave rise to a mind of anger and impurity and abused him with evil words said: 'Where has this ignorant monk come from? He claims not to hold us in contempt, but he gives us a prophecy that we will attain Buddhahood. We do not need such a false prophecy.'

"Great-Power, what do you think? Was the Bodhisattva Never Disparaging of that time a different person? He was myself. If I had not, in my past lives, received and upheld, read, and recited this sutra and preached it for others, I could not have so quickly attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. It was because I, in the presence of past Buddhas, received, upheld, read, and recited this sutra and preached it for others that I quickly attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.

"Great-Power, what do you think? Were the four groups who held that Bodhisattva in contempt at that time different people? They are the five hundred Bodhisattvas such as Bhadrapāla, the five hundred monks such as Lion-Moon, and the five hundred laymen such as Nisīśvara in this assembly now, who have all attained the state of non-retrogression from Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Great-Power, you should know that this Lotus Sutra brings great benefit to the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas and can cause them to attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. For this reason, all Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, after the Tathagata’s passing, should constantly receive, uphold, read, recite, explain, and copy this sutra."

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 21: The Transcendent Powers of the Tathagata
======================================================================


At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

At that time, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of a thousand worlds, who had sprung forth from the earth, all stood in the presence of the Buddha. With a single mind, they joined their palms and, looking up at the Buddha's revered face, said: "World-Honored One, after the Buddha's passing, in the lands where your emanations have dwelt and passed away, we will widely preach this sutra. Why? We ourselves wish to attain this truly pure great Dharma and to receive, uphold, read, recite, explain, copy, and make offerings to it."

At that time, the World-Honored One, in the presence of Mañjuśrī and the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of old Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas of the Saha world, and all the monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans, manifested his great supernatural powers. He extended his long and broad tongue up to the Brahma heavens. From all his pores, he emitted immeasurable and countless lights of different colors, which universally shone throughout all the worlds of the ten directions.

The sentient beings in those worlds—the gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans—by the Buddha's supernatural power, were all able to see this Saha world. They saw the immeasurable and boundless hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas sitting on lion’s seats under the jeweled trees. They also saw Śākyamuni Buddha and Abundant Treasures Tathagata sitting on a lion’s seat inside the jeweled stupa. They also saw the immeasurable and boundless hundreds of thousands of millions of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas and the four groups of the assembly reverently surrounding Śākyamuni Buddha. Having seen this, they were all filled with great joy and felt an unprecedented happiness.

The Entrustment of the Sutra

The sentient beings of those worlds, having heard the voice from the air, joined their palms and, facing the Saha world, said: "Namo Śākyamuni Buddha! Namo Śākyamuni Buddha!" With all kinds of flowers, incense, garlands, banners, canopies, adornments for the body, and precious, wonderful objects, they all scattered them toward the Saha world from afar. All these scattered objects, coming from the ten directions, were like gathering clouds. They became a jeweled canopy that universally covered all the Buddhas here. At that time, all the worlds of the ten directions were connected without hindrance, like one Buddha land.

    "The saviors of the world, all the Buddhas,"

"For this reason, after the Tathagata's passing, you should all, with a single mind, receive and uphold, read, recite, explain, copy, and practice it as it is taught. In any land where there is one who receives and upholds, reads, recites, explains, or copies it, or practices it as it is taught—or wherever a scroll of this sutra is kept, whether in a garden, a forest, under a tree, in a monastery, in a layman's house, in a hall, or in a mountain valley or wilderness—a stupa should be erected there and offerings should be made. Why? You should know that this place is the very place of enlightenment. The Buddhas attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi here. The Buddhas turn the Dharma wheel here. And the Buddhas enter parinirvāṇa here."

At that time, the Buddha said to Superior Conduct and the great assembly of Bodhisattvas: "The supernatural powers of the Buddhas are immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable. If I were to use these supernatural powers to speak of the merits of this sutra for the purpose of entrusting it, for an immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, I still could not exhaust them. To put it concisely, all the Dharmas that the Tathagata possesses, all the Tathagata's supernatural powers of independence, all the secret treasures of the Tathagata, and all the extremely profound matters of the Tathagata, are all revealed and expounded in this sutra.

The Buddhas who were sitting on the lion's seats under the jeweled trees also did the same: they extended their long and broad tongues and emitted immeasurable light. Śākyamuni Buddha and the other Buddhas under the jeweled trees manifested their supernatural powers in this way for a full hundred thousand years, and then they retracted their tongues. At the same time, they coughed and snapped their fingers. The sound of these two actions reached all the worlds of the ten directions, and the earth shook in six ways.

The Manifestation of the Buddha's Transcendent Powers

Immediately, the gods in the air loudly proclaimed: "Beyond these immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of millions of asaṃkhyeya worlds, there is a land named Saha. In this land, there is a Buddha named Śākyamuni, who is now preaching a Great Vehicle sutra for the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, named the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a Dharma for Bodhisattvas protected and remembered by the Buddhas. You should all give rise to a deep heart of joyful following and should also pay homage and make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha."

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 22: The Final Entrustment
======================================================================


When the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas heard the Buddha speak these words, they were all filled with great joy throughout their bodies. They became even more respectful, bowing and lowering their heads. With joined palms facing the Buddha, they all spoke in one voice, saying: "As the World-Honored One has commanded, we will fully obey and practice. Yes, World-Honored One, please do not be concerned." The assemblies of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, in this way, spoke in one voice three times: "As the World-Honored One has commanded, we will fully obey and practice. Yes, World-Honored One, please do not be concerned."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha caused all the emanations of the Buddhas who had come from the ten directions to return to their home lands and said: "All you Buddhas, each of you may return to your lands, and the stupa of Abundant Treasures Buddha may return to what it was." When these words were spoken, the immeasurable emanations of the Buddhas from the ten directions who were sitting on the lion's seats under the jeweled trees, and Abundant Treasures Buddha, and the countless asaṃkhyeya great Bodhisattvas such as Superior Conduct, and the four groups of śrāvakas such as Śāriputra, and all the worlds of gods, humans, and asuras, heard what the Buddha said and were all filled with great joy.

You should also follow the Dharma of the Tathagata and not be stingy. In a future life, if there is a noble man or noble woman who believes in the Tathagata's wisdom, you should expound this Lotus Sutra for them, so they may hear and know it, and so they may attain the Buddha's wisdom. If there are sentient beings who do not believe and accept it, you should teach, guide, and give them joy with the other profound Dharmas of the Tathagata. If you are able to do this, you will have repaid the grace of all the Buddhas."

In this way, he rubbed the heads of the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas three times and said: "I have, for immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, cultivated this Dharma of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, which is difficult to attain. I now entrust it to all of you. You must receive, uphold, and widely preach this Dharma, causing all sentient beings to hear and know it. Why? The Tathagata has great compassion, no stinginess, and is without fear. He is able to give sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom, the Tathagata's wisdom, and self-attained wisdom. The Tathagata is the great giver of all sentient beings.

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha rose from his Dharma seat and, manifesting his great supernatural power, used his right hand to rub the heads of the countless Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, and he said: "I have, for immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, cultivated this Dharma of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, which is difficult to attain. I now entrust it to all of you. You must all, with a single mind, spread this Dharma and cause it to be widely benefited."

The Merit for Women and a Final Admonition

"Having attained this patience, her eye faculty will be pure. With this pure eye faculty, she will see all the Tathagatas, as numerous as the sands of seven million two hundred thousand million nayuta Ganges Rivers. At that time, these Buddhas will all praise her from a distance, saying: 'Excellent! Excellent, noble woman! You were able, in the Dharma of Śākyamuni Buddha, to receive, uphold, read, recite, contemplate, and preach this sutra for others. The blessings and virtues you have attained are immeasurable and boundless. Fire cannot burn you, and water cannot drown you. Your merits, if a thousand Buddhas were to speak of them together, could not be exhausted. You have now been able to break all the armies of Māra and destroy the armies of life and death. All your other enemies are all crushed and extinguished. Noble woman, hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, with their supernatural powers, are protecting you together. Among all the worlds of gods and humans, there is none who can compare to you, except for a Tathagata. The wisdom and meditation of all the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and even the Bodhisattvas, are not equal to yours.'

"Having attained this samadhi, his heart was filled with great joy, and he thought: 'My attainment of the Samadhi of Manifesting All Forms is entirely due to the power of hearing the Lotus Sutra. I should now make an offering to the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha and the Lotus Sutra.' He then entered this samadhi, and from the sky, rained down maṇḍārava and mahāmaṇḍārava flowers, and fine powder of a firm, black sandalwood, which filled the sky and fell like a cloud. He also rained down the incense of sandalwood from this side of the ocean. The value of six grains of this incense was the equivalent of the entire Saha world. He used this to make an offering to the Buddha.

"At that time, Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See, having spoken this verse, said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the World-Honored One is still in the world.' At that time, the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha said to Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See: 'Noble man, my time for nirvāṇa has arrived. The time for extinction has come. You should prepare a seat for me. I will pass into parinirvāṇa tonight.'

"At that time, all the Bodhisattvas, gods, humans, and asuras, seeing that his arms were gone, were filled with worry, sorrow, and pity and said: 'This Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See, our teacher who converted us, has now burned his arms and his body is no longer complete.'

"The Buddhas in those worlds simultaneously praised him, saying: 'Excellent! Excellent! Noble man, this is true diligence! This is called a true Dharma offering to the Tathagata. Offerings of flowers, incense, garlands, burning incense, powdered incense, paste incense, heavenly silks, banners, canopies, and the sandalwood incense from this side of the ocean, or other kinds of offerings, cannot compare to this. Even the giving of one's country, city, wife, and children cannot compare to this. Noble man, this is called the first of all acts of giving. Among all acts of giving, it is the most revered and supreme, because it is a Dharma offering to all the Tathagatas.'

"He also commanded Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See: 'Noble man, I entrust my Buddha Dharma to you and all the Bodhisattvas and great disciples, as well as the Dharma of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. I also give you the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world of seven treasures, all the jeweled trees, the jeweled platforms, and the gods who serve me. After my passing, I also entrust all my relics to you. You must cause them to be spread and widely make offerings to them. You should erect thousands of stupas.' In this way, the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha, having commanded Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See, passed into nirvāṇa in the latter part of the night.

"Star-King-Flower, you must use the power of your supernatural abilities to protect this sutra. Why? This sutra is a good medicine for the illnesses of the people of Jambudvīpa. If a person is sick and hears this sutra, their sickness will immediately be extinguished, and they will not grow old or die. Star-King-Flower, if you see a person who upholds this sutra, you should fill a blue lotus flower with powdered incense and scatter it upon him. Having scattered it, you should think: 'This person will soon gather grass and sit at the place of enlightenment. He will break all the armies of Māra, blow the Dharma conch, beat the great Dharma drum, and save all sentient beings from the great ocean of birth, old age, sickness, and death.' For this reason, those who seek the Buddha Way, when they see a person who upholds this scripture, should give rise to such a respectful heart."

At that time, Bodhisattva Star-King-Flower said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, how does Bodhisattva Medicine King travel and work in this Saha world? World-Honored One, this Bodhisattva Medicine King has performed hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta of difficult and painful ascetic practices. Excellent, World-Honored One! We wish you would explain a little about this." The gods, dragons, spirits, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans, as well as the Bodhisattvas who had come from other lands, and the śrāvaka assembly all heard this and were filled with joy.

Translated by Tripitaka Master Kumarajiva of the Kucha Kingdom in the Later Qin Dynasty, by imperial decree.

    "Your face is so wondrous and beautiful,"

"At that time, Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See, in the midst of the great assembly, made this vow: 'I have given up my two arms, and I will surely attain the Buddha's golden body. If this is truly not false, then may my two arms return to what they were before.' When he made this vow, his two arms were naturally restored. This was due to the purity of the Bodhisattva's blessings and wisdom. At that moment, the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world shook in six ways. Heavenly jeweled flowers rained down, and all the gods and humans felt an unprecedented joy."

"Star-King-Flower, this Bodhisattva is complete in such merits and the power of wisdom."

"Having spoken this verse, he said to his father: 'The Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha is still in the world. I previously made an offering to the Buddha and attained the total recall of all sentient beings' languages. I also heard this Lotus Sutra in verses of eight hundred million million nayutas as numerous as jeṅkara, bimvara, and akṣobhya. Great King, I will now go back and make offerings to this Buddha.' Having said this, he immediately sat on a seven-jeweled platform, rose into the air as high as seven tāla trees, went to the Buddha's place, bowed his head at the Buddha's feet, joined his ten fingers, and praised the Buddha in verse:

"Star-King-Flower, it is like the ocean, which is the foremost of all the streams, rivers, and waters. This Lotus Sutra is also like this; among all the sutras preached by the Tathagatas, it is the most profound and supreme. And it is like Mount Sumeru, which is the foremost among all mountains—the earth mountains, black mountains, small and great Iron Ring Mountains, and the ten precious mountains. This Lotus Sutra is also like this; among all the sutras, it is the most supreme. And it is like the moon, which is the foremost among all the stars. This Lotus Sutra is also like this; among the millions of millions of kinds of Dharma scriptures, it is the most illuminating. And it is like the sun, which can dispel all darkness. This sutra is also like this; it can break the darkness of all unwholesome deeds. And it is like a wheel-turning holy king, who is the foremost among all the small kings. This sutra is also like this; it is the king among all sutras. And it is like Śakra, who is the king of the Thirty-three Heavens. This sutra is also like this; it is the king among all sutras. And it is like the great Brahma King, who is the father of all sentient beings. This sutra is also like this; it is the father of all sages, learners, non-learners, and those who give rise to the Bodhisattva mind. And it is like the srotāpanna, sakṛdāgāmin, anāgāmin, arhat, and pratyekabuddha, who are the foremost among all ordinary people. This sutra is also like this; among all the scriptures and Dharmas preached by the Tathagata, the Bodhisattvas, and the śrāvakas, it is the most supreme. It is like the Buddha, who is the King of all Dharmas. This sutra is also like this; it is the King among all sutras."

"At that time, Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See again thought to himself: 'Although I have made these offerings, my heart is still not satisfied. I will now make another offering to the relics.' He then said to the Bodhisattvas, the great disciples, and the gods, dragons, yakshas, and all the great assembly: 'You should all remember with a single mind that I am now making an offering to the relics of the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha.' Having said this, he immediately, in front of the eighty-four thousand stupas, set his hundred-blessing-adorned arms on fire for seventy-two thousand years to make an offering. He caused countless beings seeking the śrāvaka path, and immeasurable asaṃkhyeya people, to give rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. He enabled them all to dwell in the Samadhi of Manifesting All Forms."

The Story of the Bodhisattva's Self-Offering

"At that time, that Buddha preached the Lotus Sutra for the Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See, and for the other Bodhisattvas and the śrāvaka assemblies. This Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See delighted in cultivating difficult ascetic practices. In the Dharma of the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha, he diligently practiced walking meditation. He sought the Buddha with a single mind for twelve thousand years and attained the Samadhi of Manifesting All Forms.

"At that time, Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See, seeing that the Buddha had passed away, felt grief, sorrow, and longing for the Buddha. He immediately gathered sandalwood from this side of the ocean to make a pyre, made offerings to the Buddha’s body, and burned it. After the fire was extinguished, he collected the relics, made eighty-four thousand jeweled bottles, and erected eighty-four thousand stupas, as tall as the three worlds, adorned with jeweled shafts, with banners, canopies, and various jeweled bells hanging from them.

"Star-King-Flower, this sutra can save all sentient beings. This sutra can cause all sentient beings to be free from all suffering and affliction. This sutra can bring great benefit to all sentient beings and fulfill their vows. It is like a cool pond that can satisfy all who are thirsty. It is like fire for those who are cold, clothes for those who are naked, a master for a merchant, a mother for a child, a boat for crossing a river, a doctor for the sick, a lamp for the dark, a treasure for the poor, a king for the people, an ocean for a merchant, and a torch that removes darkness. This Lotus Sutra is also like this; it can cause sentient beings to be free from all suffering and sickness, and it can untie all the bonds of life and death. If a person hears this Lotus Sutra, or copies it themselves, or causes others to copy it, the merit they gain is so vast that even with the Buddha's wisdom, one cannot calculate its end. If one copies this sutra scroll and makes offerings of flowers, incense, garlands, burning incense, powdered incense, paste incense, banners, canopies, robes, and all kinds of lamps—ghee lamps, oil lamps, fragrant oil lamps, campaka oil lamps, sumana oil lamps, parūṣaka oil lamps, vārsikā oil lamps, and navamallikā oil lamps—the merit they gain is also immeasurable."

"Star-King-Flower, if a person hears this chapter on the former lives of Bodhisattva Medicine King, they will also attain immeasurable and boundless merits. If a woman hears this chapter on the former lives of Bodhisattva Medicine King and is able to uphold it, this is her last lifetime as a woman; she will not be reborn as a woman again. If, after the Tathagata’s passing, in the latter five hundred years, a woman hears this scripture and practices it as it is taught, upon the end of her life, she will immediately go to the Land of Peace and Joy (Pure Land), and be reborn in a lotus flower on a jeweled seat, surrounded by Amitābha Buddha and the great assembly of Bodhisattvas. She will no longer be tormented by greedy desire, nor by anger and foolishness, nor by arrogance and jealousy. She will attain the supernatural powers of a Bodhisattva and the patience of non-arising.

"If a person hears this chapter on the former lives of Bodhisattva Medicine King and can rejoice and praise it, in this lifetime, the fragrance of a blue lotus flower will constantly come from their mouth, and the fragrance of sandalwood will constantly come from the pores of their body. The merit they attain is as I have spoken above. For this reason, Star-King-Flower, I entrust this chapter on the former lives of Bodhisattva Medicine King to you. After my passing, in the latter five hundred years, you must widely preach and spread it throughout the world of Jambudvīpa and not allow it to be cut off, so that the evil Māra, Māra's followers, the gods, dragons, yakshas, and Kumbhāṇḍas, etc., will not have an advantage over it."

"That Buddha had eighty million great Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas and seventy-two times the sands of the Ganges of great śrāvaka assemblies. The Buddha's life span was forty-two thousand kalpas, and the Bodhisattvas' life spans were the same. That land had no women, hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras, and was free from all calamities. The ground was as flat as a palm and made of crystal, adorned with jeweled trees. Jeweled canopies hung above, and jeweled flower banners hung down. Jeweled bottles and incense burners were found everywhere in the land. There were jeweled platforms, one under each tree, and the distance between the tree and the platform was the flight of one arrow. Under these jeweled trees, Bodhisattvas and śrāvakas were sitting. On each of the jeweled platforms, there were ten million heavenly beings who played heavenly music and sang praises to the Buddha as an offering.

"The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Star-King-Flower: 'What do you think? Was that Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See a different person? He is Bodhisattva Medicine King today. The giving of his body was in this way, in immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta of times. Star-King-Flower, if a person who has given rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi can burn their fingers, or even one finger, to make an offering to a Buddha stupa, this is better than giving their country, city, wife, and children, and even the mountains, forests, rivers, and ponds, and all the precious treasures of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world as an offering. If a person were to fill the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world with the seven treasures and offer it to the Buddha, great Bodhisattvas, pratyekabuddhas, and arhats, the merit this person gains is not as great as receiving and upholding this Lotus Sutra, even a single four-line verse. Their blessings are the greatest.'

"Having made this offering, he arose from the samadhi and thought to himself: 'Although I have made offerings to the Buddha with my supernatural power, it is not as good as making an offering with my own body.' He then ingested all kinds of incense—sandalwood, frankincense, aloe, pine resin, agarwood, and gum incense—and drank the fragrant oil of campaka flowers. After twelve hundred years, he anointed his body with the fragrant oil. In the presence of the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha, he wrapped his body in a heavenly jeweled robe, poured fragrant oils over himself, and with the power of his spiritual vow, set his body on fire. His light shone universally throughout eighty million worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges.

When this chapter on the former lives of Bodhisattva Medicine King was being preached, eighty-four thousand Bodhisattvas attained the total recall of all sentient beings' languages. Abundant Treasures Tathagata, from within the jeweled stupa, praised Bodhisattva Star-King-Flower, saying: "Excellent! Excellent, Star-King-Flower! You have attained inconceivable merits and were able to ask Śākyamuni Buddha such a matter, which benefits all sentient beings without measure."

The Merit of Upholding the Sutra

"Having spoken these words, they all fell silent. His body burned for twelve hundred years. After that, his body was completely consumed. After Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See had made such a Dharma offering, he passed away and was reborn in the land of the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha, in the house of King Pure-Virtue, sitting in the lotus posture. He was born instantly by transformation. He immediately spoke in verse to his father, the king, saying:

At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva Star-King-Flower: "In the distant past, an immeasurable number of kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, there was a Buddha named Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.

    "Great King, you should know,"

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 24: The Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound
======================================================================


"Flower-Virtue, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound is able to save and protect all sentient beings in the Saha world. The various forms this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound manifests in this Saha land to preach this scripture for sentient beings do not diminish his supernatural powers, transformations, or wisdom. With various kinds of wisdom, this Bodhisattva illuminates the Saha world and causes all sentient beings to know what they should know. In worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in the ten directions, he also does the same. If a person should be saved by the form of a śrāvaka, he appears as a śrāvaka to preach the Dharma for them. If they should be saved by the form of a pratyekabuddha, he appears as a pratyekabuddha. If they should be saved by the form of a Bodhisattva, he appears as a Bodhisattva. If they should be saved by the form of a Buddha, he appears as a Buddha. In this way, according to who should be saved, he manifests his form for them. Even if they should be saved by entering extinction, he manifests extinction for them. Flower-Virtue, the story of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound's attainment of great supernatural powers and the power of wisdom is like this."

Then, Abundant Treasures Buddha said to Wonderful Sound: "Excellent! Excellent! You were able to come here to make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha, and to hear the Lotus Sutra, and also to see Mañjuśrī and the others."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha said to Mañjuśrī: "This long-passed-away Abundant Treasures Tathagata will manifest his form for you all to see him."

At that time, Bodhisattva Flower-Virtue said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound has planted deep roots of goodness. World-Honored One, in what samadhi does this Bodhisattva dwell that he can manifest such transformations to save and liberate sentient beings?"

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha emitted light from the tuft of hair on his head, one of the supreme marks of a great being. He also emitted a ray of light from the white hair between his eyebrows, which universally illuminated the worlds of all the Buddhas, as numerous as the sands of a hundred and eighty million million nayuta Ganges Rivers in the east. Beyond that number of worlds, there was a world named Pure-Light Adornment. In that land, there was a Buddha named Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. He was surrounded and revered by an immeasurable and boundless assembly of Bodhisattvas, and he was preaching the Dharma. Śākyamuni Buddha's light from his white hair universally shone upon that land.

The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Flower-Virtue: "In the past, there was a Buddha named King of Cloud-Thunder-Voice Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land was named Manifesting-All-Worlds, and the kalpa was named Rejoice-in-Seeing.

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha said to Abundant Treasures Buddha: "This Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound wishes to see you."

"Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound, for twelve thousand years, used a hundred thousand kinds of music to make offerings to the King of Cloud-Thunder-Voice Buddha and also offered him eighty-four thousand seven-jeweled bowls. Because of this karmic reward, he is now born in the land of the Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha and has this supernatural power. Flower-Virtue, what do you think? Was the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound who made offerings of music and offered the jeweled bowls to the King of Cloud-Thunder-Voice Buddha a different person? He is this very Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound. Flower-Virtue, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound has made offerings to and been close to immeasurable Buddhas and has long planted roots of virtue. He has also encountered hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta Buddhas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges."

When this chapter on the travels of Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound was being preached, forty-two thousand heavenly beings attained the patience of non-arising, and Bodhisattva Flower-Virtue attained the Samadhi of the Lotus Sutra.

At that time, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound, having made offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha and the stupa of Abundant Treasures Buddha, returned to his home land. As he passed through the various lands, the ground shook in six ways, and jeweled lotus flowers rained down. A hundred million millions of various kinds of music played. When he arrived in his home land, he and his eighty-four thousand Bodhisattvas, surrounded by their retinue, went to the Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha's place. He said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I went to the Saha world and benefited sentient beings. I saw Śākyamuni Buddha and the stupa of Abundant Treasures Buddha, and I paid homage and made offerings. I also saw the Dharma Prince Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, and I saw Bodhisattva Medicine King, Bodhisattva Diligence, and Bodhisattva Valiant-Giver. I also enabled these eighty-four thousand Bodhisattvas to attain the Samadhi of Manifesting All Forms."

The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Flower-Virtue: "Noble man, that samadhi is named the Samadhi of Manifesting All Forms. Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound dwells in this samadhi and is able to bring such benefits to countless sentient beings."

Then, Abundant Treasures Buddha said to that Bodhisattva: "Noble man, please come. The Dharma Prince Mañjuśrī wishes to see your body."

Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound said to his Buddha: "World-Honored One, my journey to the Saha world is entirely due to the power of the Tathagata. It is the playful supernatural power of the Tathagata and the adornment of the Tathagata's merits and wisdom."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha said to Mañjuśrī: "Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound, with his retinue of eighty-four thousand Bodhisattvas, wishes to come from the land of the Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha to this Saha world to make offerings to, be close to, and pay homage to me. He also wishes to make offerings to and hear the Lotus Sutra."

At that time, the Dharma Prince Mañjuśrī, seeing these lotus flowers, said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what is the reason for this auspicious sign to appear first? There are thousands of millions of these lotus flowers, with stems of Jambunada gold, leaves of white silver, filaments of diamond, and platforms of kimbulaka jewels."

When he arrived, he descended from the seven-jeweled tower, held a necklace worth a hundred thousand jewels, and went to Śākyamuni Buddha's place. He bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, offered the necklace, and said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, the Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha asks about the World-Honored One's well-being: 'Are you in good health and without much sickness? Are you at ease in your daily life? Are your four elements in harmony? Is the world endurable? Are sentient beings easy to convert? Do they not have too much greedy desire, anger, foolishness, jealousy, stinginess, and arrogance? Are they not unfilial to their parents, disrespectful of the śramaṇas, and do they not hold wrong views and have unwholesome minds? Do they not restrain their five senses?'

Then, Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound, without rising from his seat and without his body moving, entered a samadhi. With the power of this samadhi, he transformed eighty-four thousand jeweled lotus flowers not far from the Dharma seat on Mount Vulture Peak. Their stems were of Jambunada gold, their leaves were of white silver, their filaments were of diamond, and their platforms were of kimbulaka jewels.

At that time, the Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha said to Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound: "Do not be scornful of that land and give rise to a lowly thought. Noble man, that Saha world is high and low and uneven. It is filled with dirt, rocks, mountains, and filth. The Buddha's body is small and low, and the Bodhisattva assemblies are also small in form. Your body is forty-two thousand yojanas tall. My body is six hundred and eighty million yojanas tall. Your body is the most majestic, adorned with hundreds of thousands of millions of blessings, and your light is wonderfully beautiful. For this reason, when you go, do not be scornful of that land, or the Buddha, or the Bodhisattvas, or the country by giving rise to a lowly thought."

"Flower-Virtue, you only see Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound's body here, but this Bodhisattva manifests various bodies everywhere to preach this scripture for all sentient beings. He may appear as a Brahma King, as Śakra, as a Sovereign of the Devas, as a Great Sovereign of the Devas, as a great heavenly general, as the heavenly king Vaiśravaṇa, as a wheel-turning holy king, as a small king, as an elder, as a householder, as a government official, as a Brahmin, as a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman. He may appear as the wife of an elder, a householder, or a government official, or as the wife of a Brahmin. He may appear as a boy or a girl. He may appear as a god, a dragon, a yaksha, a gandharva, an asura, a garuda, a kinnara, a mahoraga, a human, or a non-human to preach this sutra. He is able to save those in the hells, the hungry ghost realm, the animal realm, and all difficult places. He can even transform into a woman to preach this sutra in the king's palace."

"World-Honored One, are sentient beings able to subdue all the demon armies? Has the long-passed-away Abundant Treasures Tathagata come to listen to the Dharma in his seven-jeweled stupa? He also asks about Abundant Treasures Tathagata's well-being: 'Is he at peace and without much sickness? Can he endure staying for a long time?' World-Honored One, I now wish to see Abundant Treasures Buddha's body. We only wish that the World-Honored One would show me and cause me to see it."

When this chapter on Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound was being preached, eighty-four thousand people who had come with him all attained the Samadhi of Manifesting All Forms. And the countless Bodhisattvas of this Saha world also attained this samadhi and dhāranīs.

At that time, in the world of Pure-Light Adornment, there was a Bodhisattva named Wonderful Sound. He had long ago planted roots of all merits and had made offerings to and been close to immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, and he was complete in a profoundly deep wisdom. He had attained the Samadhi of Wonderful Banner Form, the Samadhi of the Lotus Sutra, the Samadhi of Pure Virtue, the Samadhi of the King of Constellation's Play, the Samadhi of Non-Conditionedness, the Samadhi of the Seal of Wisdom, the Samadhi of Understanding All Sentient Beings' Languages, the Samadhi of Accumulating All Merits, the Samadhi of Purity, the Samadhi of Supernatural Play, the Samadhi of the Wisdom Torch, the Samadhi of the Adornment King, the Samadhi of Pure Light, the Samadhi of the Pure Treasury, the Samadhi of Non-Commonness, and the Samadhi of the Sun's Whirlwind. He had attained such great samadhis, numbering hundreds of thousands of millions of times the sands of the Ganges.

At that time, Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound vanished from that land and, along with his eighty-four thousand Bodhisattvas, came forth. As they passed through all the lands, the ground shook in six ways, and they all rained down seven-jeweled lotus flowers. Hundreds of thousands of heavenly music played without being beaten. This Bodhisattva's eyes were like the wide leaves of a blue lotus flower. Even if you were to combine the moon a hundred million times, his face would be even more majestic. His body was of a pure golden color, adorned with immeasurable hundreds of thousands of merits. His majesty was brilliant, and his light was shining. He was complete with all the marks, and his body was as firm as the diamond body of a Narayana. He entered a seven-jeweled tower and rose into the air, seven tāla trees high from the ground. He and his retinue of Bodhisattvas, who were reverently surrounding him, came to Mount Vulture Peak in the Saha world.

Mañjuśrī said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what roots of goodness did this Bodhisattva plant? What merits did he cultivate to have such great supernatural power? What samadhi does he practice? We wish you would tell us the name of this samadhi. We also wish to diligently cultivate it. By practicing this samadhi, one can see the size and form of this Bodhisattva, and his dignified conduct. We only wish, World-Honored One, that with your supernatural power, you would cause us to see that Bodhisattva when he comes."

When Śākyamuni Buddha's light shone on his body, he immediately said to the Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha: "World-Honored One, I will now go to the Saha world to pay homage to, be close to, and make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha. I also wish to see the Dharma Prince Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, Bodhisattva Medicine King, Bodhisattva Valiant-Giver, Bodhisattva Star-King-Flower, Bodhisattva Superior-Conduct, Bodhisattva King of Adornment, and Bodhisattva Medicine-on-High."

At that time, Bodhisattva Flower-Virtue said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what roots of goodness did this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound plant? What merits did he cultivate to have such supernatural power?"

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 25: The Universal Gateway of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara
======================================================================


"Boundless Intent, if a person were to receive and uphold the names of sixty-two million Bodhisattvas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, and for their entire life, they were to make offerings of food, clothing, bedding, and medicine, what do you think? Is the merit of this noble man or noble woman great?"

Bodhisattva Boundless Intent said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I will now make an offering to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara." He then took off the jeweled necklace from his neck, worth hundreds of thousands of gold, and gave it to him, saying: "Noble One, please accept this precious jeweled necklace, which is a Dharma offering." At that time, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara would not accept it.

At that time, Bodhisattva Boundless Intent spoke in verse, asking:

"Boundless Intent, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara is complete in these merits and, with various forms, travels to all lands to save and liberate sentient beings. For this reason, you all should, with a single mind, make offerings to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. This Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is able to grant fearlessness in times of fear and urgent danger. For this reason, in this Saha world, he is also called the Giver of Fearlessness."

Immediately, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, out of compassion for the four groups and the gods, dragons, humans, and non-humans, accepted the necklace. He divided it into two parts. He offered one part to Śākyamuni Buddha and the other part to the stupa of Abundant Treasures Buddha.

Boundless Intent said: "Very great, World-Honored One."

At that time, Bodhisattva Boundless Intent rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, and, with palms joined, said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, for what reason is Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara called Avalokiteśvara?"

The Manifestations of Avalokiteśvara

Boundless Intent again said to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara: "Noble One, out of compassion for us, please accept this necklace."

"Boundless Intent, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara has such great majestic and spiritual power and brings great benefit to many. For this reason, all sentient beings should constantly think of him. If a woman wishes to have a son, and she bows and makes offerings to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, she will give birth to a son who is blessed with virtues and wisdom. If she wishes to have a daughter, she will give birth to a daughter who is beautiful and has good marks, who has planted roots of virtue in past lives, and who is loved and revered by all. Boundless Intent, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara has such power. If a sentient being reverently bows and makes offerings to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, their blessings will not be in vain. For this reason, all sentient beings should receive and uphold the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara."

The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Boundless Intent: "Noble man, in a certain land, if sentient beings should be saved by the form of a Buddha, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will immediately manifest as a Buddha to preach the Dharma for them. If they should be saved by the form of a pratyekabuddha, he will immediately manifest as a pratyekabuddha to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a śrāvaka, he will immediately manifest as a śrāvaka to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a Brahma King, he will immediately manifest as a Brahma King to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a Śakra, he will immediately manifest as a Śakra to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a Sovereign of the Devas, he will immediately manifest as a Sovereign of the Devas to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a Great Sovereign of the Devas, he will immediately manifest as a Great Sovereign of the Devas to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a great heavenly general, he will immediately manifest as a great heavenly general to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of Vaiśravaṇa, he will immediately manifest as Vaiśravaṇa to preach the Dharma.

"If they should be saved by the form of a small king, he will immediately manifest as a small king to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of an elder, he will immediately manifest as an elder to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a householder, he will immediately manifest as a householder to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a government official, he will immediately manifest as a government official to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a Brahmin, he will immediately manifest as a Brahmin to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a monk, nun, layman, or laywoman, he will immediately manifest as a monk, nun, layman, or laywoman to preach the Dharma.

At that time, Bodhisattva Earth-Holder rose from his seat and said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, if a sentient being hears this chapter on Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara's free and independent work, and his power to manifest in a universal gateway, you should know that the merit of this person is not small."

"If they should be saved by the form of the wife of an elder, a householder, a government official, or a Brahmin, he will immediately manifest as a woman to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a boy or a girl, he will immediately manifest as a boy or a girl to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a god, a dragon, a yaksha, a gandharva, an asura, a garuda, a kinnara, a mahoraga, a human, or a non-human, he will immediately manifest as such to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a vajra-holding deity, he will immediately manifest as a vajra-holding deity to preach the Dharma."

"If there is a person who is about to be harmed, and they call the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, the knives and sticks in the hands of the person trying to harm them will immediately break into pieces, and they will be liberated. If the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world is filled with yakshas and rakshasas who want to torment a person, and they hear that person call the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, these evil ghosts will not even be able to look at them with evil eyes, let alone harm them.

The Universal Gateway (Verse)

"If a person upholds the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, and even enters a great fire, the fire will not be able to burn them, because of the majestic and spiritual power of this Bodhisattva. If they are swept away by a great flood, and they call his name, they will immediately reach a shallow place. If there are hundreds of thousands of millions of sentient beings who, for the sake of seeking treasures like gold, silver, lapis lazuli, tridacna, agate, coral, amber, and pearls, enter the great ocean, and if a black wind blows their ships and causes them to drift into the land of the Rakshasa demons, and if even one person among them calls the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, all these people will be liberated from the dangers of the Rakshasas. It is for this reason that he is called Avalokiteśvara (the one who perceives the sound)."

The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Boundless Intent: "Noble man, if there are immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of sentient beings who suffer from all kinds of afflictions, and they hear of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and with a single mind call his name, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will immediately perceive their voices and they will all be liberated.

Bodhisattva Boundless Intent said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, how does Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara travel in this Saha world? How does he preach the Dharma for sentient beings? What is the matter of his power of expedient means?"

"Boundless Intent, the majestic and spiritual power of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is so great. If there is a sentient being who is filled with greedy desire and they constantly remember and revere Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, they will be freed from desire. If they are filled with anger and constantly remember and revere Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, they will be freed from anger. If they are filled with foolishness and constantly remember and revere Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, they will be freed from foolishness.

When the Buddha preached this chapter of the universal gateway, eighty-four thousand sentient beings in the assembly all gave rise to the unequaled mind of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.

At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara: "You should have compassion for this Bodhisattva Boundless Intent and the four groups of the assembly, the gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans, and accept this necklace."

    "The World-Honored One, who is complete in wonderful marks,"

"If there is a person, whether they are guilty or not, whose body is bound by shackles, chains, and manacles, and they call the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, all of these will be broken and they will immediately be liberated. If the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world is filled with hostile bandits, and there is a caravan leader who is guiding many merchants with valuable treasures through a dangerous road, and one person among them proclaims: 'All you noble men, do not be afraid! You should all, with a single mind, call the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara! This Bodhisattva is able to grant fearlessness to sentient beings. If you call his name, you will be liberated from these hostile bandits.' When the merchants hear this, they will all call out: 'Namo Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara!' Because they call his name, they will immediately be liberated."

The Buddha said: "If a person receives and upholds the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and even for a short time, bows and makes offerings, the blessings of these two people are exactly equal and cannot be exhausted even in hundreds of thousands of millions of kalpas. Boundless Intent, by receiving and upholding the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, one attains such immeasurable and boundless blessings and benefits."

"Boundless Intent, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara has such free and supernatural power and travels in the Saha world."

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 26: Dharanis
======================================================================


"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī spell was spoken by Buddhas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. They all rejoiced in it. If anyone harms or slanders this Dharma teacher, they are harming and slandering all these Buddhas."

    "If you do not follow our spell,"

They then spoke in verse in the presence of the Buddha:

At that time, there were ten rakshasa maidens, whose names were Lamva, Vilamva, Crooked-Tooth, Flower-Tooth, Black-Tooth, Many-Hairs, Endless-Stomach, Upholder-of-Garlands, Kunti, and Seizer-of-the-Essence-of-All-Beings. These ten rakshasa maidens, along with the Mother of Demon Children, and their sons and retinues, all went to the Buddha's place. With one voice, they said to the Buddha:

When this chapter on Dharanis was being preached, sixty-eight thousand people attained the patience of non-arising.

At that time, Bodhisattva Medicine King said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I will now give the Dharma teacher a dhāraṇī spell to protect him." He then spoke the spell:

"World-Honored One, with this divine spell, I will protect the Dharma teacher. I myself will also protect the one who upholds this sutra, so that within a hundred yojanas, they will have no misfortune."

At that time, Bodhisattva Medicine King rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, and, with palms joined, said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, if a noble man or noble woman is able to uphold the Lotus Sutra—whether they read, recite, and master it, or copy the sutra scrolls—how much merit do they attain?"

    "A-jia-ni, Jia-ni, Qu-li, Gan-tuo-li, Zhan-tuo-li, Mo-deng-qi, Chang-qiu-li, Fu-lou-suo-ni, E-di."

At that time, the Heavenly King Dhṛtarāṣṭra was in the assembly with his retinue of tens of millions of nayuta gandharva beings. With reverence, they all went before the Buddha, joined their palms, and said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I also, with a divine dhāraṇī spell, will protect the one who upholds the Lotus Sutra." He then spoke the spell:

"World-Honored One, we also wish to protect those who read, recite, and uphold the Lotus Sutra and to remove their misfortunes. If there are those who seek to find a weakness in the Dharma teacher, we will prevent them from having an advantage." They then spoke the spell in the presence of the Buddha:

The Buddha said to the rakshasa maidens: "Excellent! Excellent! The blessings you attain from only protecting the name of the Lotus Sutra are immeasurable, how much more so for protecting one who fully upholds, makes offerings to the sutra scrolls with flowers, incense, garlands, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, banners, canopies, and music, and lights all kinds of lamps—ghee lamps, oil lamps, fragrant oil lamps, sumana flower oil lamps, campaka flower oil lamps, vārsikā flower oil lamps, and utpala flower oil lamps—and a hundred thousand other kinds of offerings? Kunti, you and your retinues should protect such Dharma teachers."

    "A-li, Na-li, Tuo-na-li, A-na-lu, Na-li, Ju-na-fu."

"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī spell was spoken by forty-two hundred million Buddhas. If anyone harms or slanders this Dharma teacher, they are harming and slandering all these Buddhas."

"It is better that someone climb on our heads than to trouble a Dharma teacher. No yakshas, rakshasas, hungry ghosts, pūtanas, kṛtyas, vetālas, gandhas, unmādas, apasmāras, yaksha-kṛtyas, human-kṛtyas, or those with fevers of one day, two days, three days, four days, or up to seven days, or those with constant fevers; whether they have the form of a man, a woman, a boy, or a girl—even in a dream, they shall not trouble him."

"Very great, World-Honored One."

    "Yi-ti-li, Yi-ti-min, Yi-ti-li, A-di-li, Yi-ti-li, Ni-li, Ni-li, Ni-li, Ni-li, Ni-li, Lou-xi, Lou-xi, Lou-xi, Lou-xi, Duo-xi, Duo-xi, Duo-xi, Dou-xi, Nu-xi."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha praised Bodhisattva Medicine King, saying: "Excellent! Excellent, Medicine King! Because you have compassionately protected this Dharma teacher, you have spoken this dhāraṇī, which brings great benefit to sentient beings."

    "An-er, Man-er, Mo-ni, Mo-mo-ni, Zhi-li, Zha-li-di, She-wei, She-li-duo-wei, Shan-di, Mu-di, Mu-duo-li, Suo-li, A-wei-suo-fu, Sang-li, Suo-li, Cha-yi, A-cha-yi, A-qi-ni, Shan-di, She-li, Tuo-luo-ni, A-lu-qie-po-suo-po-zha-bi-sha-ni, Ni-pi-ti, A-bian-duo-luo-ni-li-ti, A-dan-duo-bo-li-shu-di, Ou-jiu-li, Mu-jiu-li, A-luo-li, Bo-luo-li, Shou-jia-cha, A-san-mo-san-li, Fo-tuo-bi-ji-li-ti, Da-mo-bo-li-cha-ti, Seng-qie-ni-qu-sha-ni, Po-she-po-she-shu-di, Man-duo-luo, Man-duo-luo-cha-ye-duo, You-lou-duo, You-lou-duo-qiao-she-lüe, E-cha-luo, E-cha-ye-duo-ye, A-po-luo, A-mo-ruo-na-duo-ye."

The Buddha said to Medicine King: "If a noble man or noble woman makes offerings to Buddhas as numerous as the sands of sixty-two hundred million Ganges Rivers, what do you think? Is the merit they attain great?"

"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī spell was spoken by Buddhas as numerous as the sands of sixty-two hundred million Ganges Rivers. If anyone harms or slanders this Dharma teacher, they are harming and slandering all these Buddhas."

At that time, the world-protecting Heavenly King Vaiśravaṇa said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I also, out of compassion for sentient beings and to protect this Dharma teacher, will speak a dhāraṇī." He then spoke the spell:

The Buddha said: "If a noble man or noble woman is able to uphold even a four-line verse of this sutra, and reads, recites, understands its meaning, and practices it as it is taught, their merit is very great."

At that time, Bodhisattva Valiant Giver said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I also, for the sake of protecting those who read, recite, and uphold the Lotus Sutra, will speak a dhāraṇī. If this Dharma teacher attains this dhāraṇī, no yakshas, rakshasas, pūtanas, kṛtyas, kumbhāṇḍas, or hungry ghosts will be able to find a weakness to attack him." He then spoke the spell in the presence of the Buddha:

The Vow of the Rakshasa Maidens

After the rakshasa maidens spoke this verse, they said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we will also personally protect those who receive, uphold, read, recite, and practice this sutra and will cause them to be at peace, free from all misfortunes, and we will eliminate all poisons."

    "Zuo-li, Mo-he-zuo-li, Yu-zhi, Mu-zhi, A-li, A-luo-po-di, Nie-li-di, Nie-li-duo-po-di, Yi-zhi-ni, Wei-zhi-ni, Zhi-chi-ni, Nie-li-chi-ni, Nie-li-chi-po-di."

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 27: The Former Lives of King Wonderful Adornment
======================================================================


"The mother said to her sons: 'Your father is deeply attached to the heretical teachings and reveres the Brahmins. You should go and tell your father and go with him.'

"These Bodhisattva Medicine King and Bodhisattva Medicine-on-High are complete in such great merits and have, under immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, planted all kinds of good roots. They have completed inconceivable good merits. If a person knows the names of these two Bodhisattvas, all the gods, humans, and people of the world should also pay them reverence."

"At that time, King Wonderful Adornment thought: 'The Buddha's body is so rare, majestic, and wonderful, complete with the most subtle and supreme form.'

"The mother said to her sons: 'You should have a worried thought for your father and manifest a spiritual transformation for him. If he sees it, his mind will surely become pure, and he might allow us to go to the Buddha's place.'

The Story of King Wonderful Adornment

The Buddha said to the great assembly: "What do you think? Was King Wonderful Adornment a different person? He is Bodhisattva Flower-Virtue today. His queen, Pure Virtue, is Bodhisattva Adorned with Pure Light who is here before me. Out of compassion for King Wonderful Adornment and all his relatives, she was born into that family. His two sons are Bodhisattva Medicine King and Bodhisattva Medicine-on-High today.

"At that time, the two sons, wishing to repeat their meaning, said in verse to their mother:

"Then, King Wonderful Adornment, with his ministers and retinues, and Queen Pure Virtue, with her retinue of palace maidens, and the two sons of the king, with their retinue of forty-two thousand people, all went to the Buddha's place. When they arrived, they bowed their heads at his feet, circled the Buddha three times, and stood to one side."

"They had also attained the Bodhisattva's Samadhi of Purity, the Samadhi of the Sun and Stars, the Samadhi of Pure Light, the Samadhi of Pure Form, the Samadhi of Pure Illumination, the Samadhi of Eternal Adornment, and the Samadhi of the Great Treasury of Majestic Virtue. In these samadhis, they were all thoroughly proficient."

"In that Buddha's Dharma, there was a king named Wonderful Adornment. The king's queen was named Pure Virtue, and they had two sons, one named Pure Treasury and the other named Pure Eye. These two sons had great supernatural powers, blessings, and wisdom. They had long cultivated the path of a Bodhisattva, practicing the pāramitā of giving, the pāramitā of precepts, the pāramitā of patience, the pāramitā of diligence, the pāramitā of meditation, the pāramitā of wisdom, and the pāramitā of expedient means. They were also clear in their understanding of compassion, joy, giving up, and the thirty-seven parts of the Way.

"Then, the Cloud-Thunder-Voice-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha said to the four groups of the assembly: 'Do you see King Wonderful Adornment standing before me with joined palms? This king will, in my Dharma, become a monk, diligently cultivate, and assist in the Dharma of the Buddha Way. He will attain Buddhahood, with the title King of the Sāla-Tree Tathagata. His land will be named Great-Light, and the kalpa will be named Great-High-King. This Sāla-Tree-King Buddha will have an immeasurable assembly of Bodhisattvas and immeasurable śrāvakas. His land will be level, and its merits will be like this.'

"At that time, King Wonderful Adornment, having praised the Buddha's immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of merits in this way, with a single mind and joined palms before the Tathagata, said again to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, this is unprecedented! The Dharma of the Tathagata is completely adorned with inconceivable, subtle, and wonderful merits. The teachings and practices bring peace, comfort, and goodness. From today on, I will no longer follow my own will, and I will not give rise to wrong views, arrogance, anger, or any other unwholesome thoughts.' Having spoken these words, he paid reverence to the Buddha and left."

"Then, the two sons, out of love for their father, rose into the air, as high as seven tāla trees. They manifested all kinds of supernatural transformations. In the air, they would walk, stand, sit, and lie down. Water would come from their upper body and fire from their lower body; fire would come from their upper body and water from their lower body. Sometimes they would manifest as a great body that filled the sky, and then they would manifest as a small body. They would vanish in the air and suddenly reappear on the ground. They would enter the ground as if it were water and walk on water as if it were ground.

The King's Prophecy and Renunciation

"Pure Treasury and Pure Eye, with joined palms, said to their mother: 'We are sons of the Dharma King, but we were born into a family that holds these wrong views.'

"Then the two sons descended from the air, went to their mother, and, with palms joined, said to her: 'Father has now gained faith and understanding and is worthy of giving rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. We have already done the work of a Buddha for our father. We wish that our mother would allow us to renounce our home and cultivate the Way under that Buddha.'

"The mother then said: 'I allow you to renounce your home. Why? Because the Buddha is difficult to encounter.' Then the two sons said to their parents: 'Excellent, our parents! We wish that you would now go to the place of the Cloud-Thunder-Voice-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha to be close to him and make offerings. Why? A Buddha is difficult to encounter, like the udumbara flower, and it is like a one-eyed tortoise finding a floating log with a hole in it. Because our past blessings are so deep and rich, we have been born at a time when we can encounter the Buddha's Dharma. For this reason, parents, you must allow us to renounce our home. Why? Buddhas are difficult to encounter, and the time is also difficult to meet.'

"At that time, that Buddha, wishing to guide King Wonderful Adornment and out of compassion for sentient beings, preached the Lotus Sutra. The two sons, Pure Treasury and Pure Eye, went to their mother, joined their palms, and said: 'Mother, we wish for you to go to the Cloud-Thunder-Voice-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha's place. We will also follow you to be close to him and make offerings. Why? This Buddha is now preaching the Lotus Sutra in the midst of all the gods and humans, and it is proper that we should listen and accept it.'

"At that time, that Buddha preached the Dharma for the king, revealing, teaching, benefiting, and filling him with joy. The king was extremely delighted. Then, King Wonderful Adornment and his queen took off their pearl necklaces, worth a hundred thousand, and scattered them upon the Buddha. In the air, they transformed into a four-pillared jeweled platform. On the platform, there was a great jeweled bed covered with hundreds of thousands of millions of heavenly robes. Upon it, the Buddha sat in the lotus posture, emitting great light.

"At that time, the Cloud-Thunder-Voice-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha said to King Wonderful Adornment: 'It is so, it is so, just as you say. If a noble man or noble woman plants roots of goodness, from lifetime to lifetime, they will attain good companions. The good companions are able to do the work of a Buddha—revealing, teaching, benefiting, and filling them with joy, and causing them to enter Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Great King, you should know that good companions are a great cause, as they convert and guide one to see the Buddha and give rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Great King, do you see these two sons? These two sons have made offerings to sixty-five hundred thousand million nayutas of Buddhas, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. They have been close to them with reverence, and have received and upheld the Lotus Sutra from those Buddhas, and out of compassion for sentient beings with wrong views, they have caused them to dwell in right views.'

"King Wonderful Adornment then descended from the air and said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the Tathagata is so rare. Because of your merits and wisdom, the tuft of hair on your head shines with a brilliant light. Your eyes are long and broad and are a deep blue color. The tuft of hair between your eyebrows is white like a crystal moon. Your teeth are white, even, and close together, and always have a shining light. The color of your lips is a beautiful red, like the bimva fruit.'

"They manifested all these kinds of supernatural transformations to cause their father's heart to become pure and full of faith. When the father saw the supernatural power of his sons in this way, his heart was filled with great joy and he gained what he had never had. He joined his palms toward his sons and said: 'Who is your teacher? Whose disciples are you?' The two sons said: 'Great King, that Cloud-Thunder-Voice-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha is now sitting on a Dharma seat under a seven-jeweled bodhi tree. In the midst of all the assemblies of gods and humans, he is widely preaching the Lotus Sutra. He is our teacher, and we are his disciples.' The father said to his sons: 'I now also wish to see your teacher. We should go together.'

    "We wish, mother, that you would allow us"

At that time, the Buddha said to all the great assemblies: "In the distant past, an immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable asaṃkhyeya kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named Cloud-Thunder-Voice-Constellation-King-Wisdom Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land was named Bright-Adornment, and the kalpa was named Joy-in-Seeing."

When the Buddha preached this chapter on the former lives of King Wonderful Adornment, eighty-four thousand people became far from defilement and dirt and attained the pure eye of the Dharma.

"The king then immediately gave his country to his younger brother and, along with his queen, his two sons, and all his retinues, renounced his home and cultivated the Way in the Buddha's Dharma. When the king had renounced his home, for eighty-four thousand years, he constantly and diligently cultivated and practiced the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma. After that, he attained the Samadhi of All Pure Merit Adornment. He immediately rose into the air, as high as seven tāla trees, and said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, my two sons have done the work of a Buddha. With their supernatural transformations, they turned my wrong views and enabled me to be settled in the Buddha Dharma and to see the World-Honored One. These two sons are my good companions. For the sake of giving rise to my roots of goodness from a past life and for my benefit, they were born into my family.'"

"At that time, the eighty-four thousand women in King Wonderful Adornment's palace were all worthy of receiving and upholding this Lotus Sutra. Bodhisattva Pure Eye had long had a thorough understanding of the Samadhi of the Lotus Sutra, and Bodhisattva Pure Treasury had, for an immeasurable hundred million kalpas, had a thorough understanding of the Samadhi of Leaving All Evil Destinies and wished for all sentient beings to be free from all evil destinies. The king's queen, Pure Virtue, had attained the Samadhi of All Buddhas' Assembly and was able to know the secret treasury of all Buddhas. The two sons, in this way, used the power of expedient means to skillfully convert their father, causing his heart to believe and understand and to love the Buddha's Dharma.

======================================================================
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Chapter 28: The Bodhisattva Universal Worthy Encouraging and Upholding the Sutra
======================================================================


At that time, Bodhisattva Universal Worthy said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, in the latter five hundred years of the turbid and evil age, if there is one who upholds this scripture, I will protect him and remove his misfortunes, so that he may be at peace. I will prevent anyone who seeks his weakness—whether they are a demon, a son of a demon, a daughter of a demon, a follower of a demon, one who is possessed by a demon, a yaksha, a rakshasa, a kumbhāṇḍa, a piśāca, a kṛtya, a pūtanā, or a vetāla—from having an advantage over him.

"If a person only copies the sutra, when this person dies, he will be born in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven. At that time, eighty-four thousand heavenly maidens will come with music to greet him. This person will put on a seven-jeweled crown and, in the midst of the maidens, will find joy and happiness. How much more for one who receives, upholds, reads, recites, remembers it properly, understands its meaning, and practices it as it is taught?

He then spoke the spell in the presence of the Buddha:

The Merits of Upholding the Sutra

The Vow of Universal Worthy

At that time, Bodhisattva Universal Worthy, with his independent and supernatural powers, his majestic virtue, and his well-known fame, came from the east with a countless and boundless assembly of great Bodhisattvas. As they passed through all the lands, they all shook, rained down jeweled lotus flowers, and played countless hundreds of thousands of millions of different kinds of music. He was surrounded by a great assembly of countless gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans, all manifesting their majestic and spiritual powers. When he arrived at Mount Vulture Peak in the Saha world, he bowed his head at the feet of Śākyamuni Buddha, circled him seven times to the right, and said to the Buddha:

"Such a person is no longer attached to worldly pleasures, does not delight in heretical scriptures or writings, and does not delight in being close to such people or those who are evil—whether they are butchers, those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens, or dogs, hunters, or those who live by selling women’s beauty. This person’s heart and mind are simple and honest, he has right mindfulness, and he has the power of blessings. This person is not tormented by the three poisons, nor is he tormented by jealousy, arrogance, false pride, or overconfidence. This person has few desires and is content, and he is able to cultivate the conduct of Universal Worthy."

"Universal Worthy, if, in a future age, a person receives and upholds this scripture, this person will no longer be attached to robes, bedding, food, or material possessions. His wishes will not be in vain, and he will receive his karmic reward in this very life. If there is a person who scorns him and says, 'You are a madman! Your practice is empty, and you will never gain anything,' the karmic retribution for this sin is that he will be without eyes in lifetime after lifetime. If there is one who makes offerings to and praises him, he will receive his present reward in this life. If another person sees one who upholds this sutra and points out their faults, whether they are real or not, this person will, in this life, suffer from white leprosy. If there is one who laughs at him, he will, in lifetime after lifetime, have gapped teeth, ugly lips, a flat nose, and crooked hands and feet. His eyes will be cross-eyed, and his body will be foul-smelling, with evil sores, pus, and blood, dropsy, and shortness of breath, and all kinds of severe evil sicknesses. For this reason, Universal Worthy, if you see one who upholds this scripture, you should go out to meet him from afar, and you should revere him as if he were the Buddha."

The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Universal Worthy: "If a noble man or noble woman is complete in four Dharmas, after the Tathagata’s passing, they will be able to attain this Lotus Sutra. The four are: first, they are protected and remembered by all the Buddhas; second, they plant roots of all merits; third, they enter the correct group (of those destined for enlightenment); and fourth, they give rise to the mind to save all sentient beings. Noble men and noble women who are complete in these four Dharmas will surely attain this sutra after the Tathagata’s passing."

"Universal Worthy, if, after the Tathagata’s passing, in the latter five hundred years, there is a person who sees one who receives, upholds, reads, and recites the Lotus Sutra, he should think: 'This person will soon go to the place of enlightenment, break all the demon armies, attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, turn the Dharma wheel, beat the Dharma drum, blow the Dharma conch, and rain the Dharma rain. He will sit on the lion’s Dharma seat in the midst of the assembly of gods and humans.'"

"World-Honored One, I will now, with my supernatural power, protect this sutra, and after the Tathagata’s passing, I will cause it to be widely spread in the world of Jambudvīpa so that it is not cut off."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha praised him, saying: "Excellent! Excellent, Universal Worthy! You are able to protect and assist this sutra and bring peace, joy, and benefit to many sentient beings. You have completed inconceivable merits and a deep and great compassion. Since a long time ago, you have given rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, and you are able to make this vow of supernatural power to protect this sutra. I will use my supernatural power to protect those who can uphold the name of Bodhisattva Universal Worthy."

"If a person receives, upholds, reads, and understands its meaning, when this person dies, a thousand Buddhas will extend their hands to him, causing him to have no fear and not to fall into an evil destiny. He will immediately go to the Tuṣita heaven, to the place of Bodhisattva Maitreya. Bodhisattva Maitreya, who is surrounded by a great assembly of thirty-two marks of Bodhisattvas, will also have hundreds of thousands of millions of heavenly maidens in his retinue. This person will be born among them and receive such meritorious benefits. For this reason, the wise should, with a single mind, copy it for themselves, or have others copy it. They should receive, uphold, read, recite, remember it properly, and practice it as it is taught."

"World-Honored One, if, in a future age, in the last five hundred years of the turbid and evil age, a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman who is a seeker, upholder, reader, reciter, or copier wishes to cultivate this Lotus Sutra, they should, for three seven-day periods, with a single mind, be diligent. When the three seven-day periods have passed, I will ride my white six-tusked elephant and, surrounded by countless Bodhisattvas, manifest my body, which is a joy for all sentient beings to see, before that person. I will preach the Dharma for him, reveal and teach, benefit and fill him with joy. I will also give him a dhāraṇī spell, and because he attains this dhāraṇī, no non-human being will be able to harm him, nor will he be deluded by a woman. I myself will also constantly protect this person. We only wish, World-Honored One, that you would permit me to speak this dhāraṇī spell."

"World-Honored One, if a Bodhisattva hears this dhāraṇī, they should know the supernatural power of Universal Worthy. If the Lotus Sutra is being practiced in the world of Jambudvīpa, and there is one who upholds it, they should think: 'This is all due to the majestic and spiritual power of Universal Worthy.' If a person upholds, reads, recites, remembers it properly, understands its meaning, and practices it as it is taught, you should know that this person is practicing the conduct of Universal Worthy. He has planted deep roots of goodness under immeasurable and boundless Buddhas and has had his head touched by all the Tathagatas.

The Buddha's Confirmation

When this chapter on Universal Worthy’s encouragement was preached, countless and boundless Bodhisattvas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges attained the Dhāraṇī of a Hundred Thousand Million Whirlings. The Bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust motes of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world attained the path of Universal Worthy. When the Buddha finished preaching this sutra, Universal Worthy and all the Bodhisattvas, the śrāvakas such as Śāriputra, and all the gods, dragons, humans, and non-humans, and the entire great assembly were all filled with great joy. They received and upheld the Buddha’s words, bowed in reverence, and departed.

"Universal Worthy, if a person receives, upholds, reads, recites, remembers properly, cultivates, and copies this Lotus Sutra, you should know that this person has seen Śākyamuni Buddha, has heard this scripture as if from the Buddha’s own mouth, has made offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha, is praised as excellent by the Buddha, has had his head touched by the Buddha's hand, and is covered by the Buddha's robe.

    "A-tan-di, Tan-tuo-po-di, Tan-tuo-po-di, Tan-tuo-jiu-she-li, Tan-tuo-xiu-tuo-li, Xiu-tuo-li, Xiu-tuo-luo-po-di, Fo-tuo-po-shan-ni, Sa-po-tuo-luo-ni-a-po-duo-ni, Sa-po-po-sha-a-po-duo-ni, Xiu-a-po-duo-ni, Seng-qie-po-li-cha-ni, Seng-qie-nie-qie-tuo-ni, A-seng-qi, Seng-qie-bo-qie-di, Di-li-a-duo-seng-qie-dou-lüe, A-luo-di-po-luo-di, Sa-po-seng-qie-san-mo-di-qie-lan-di, Sa-po-da-mo-xiu-bo-li-cha-di, Sa-po-sa-duo-lou-tuo-qiao-she-lüe-a-men-qie-di, Xin-a-pi-ji-li-di-di."

"If this person is walking or standing, reading and reciting this sutra, I will, at that time, ride my white six-tusked elephant king, with a great assembly of Bodhisattvas, and go to his place. I will manifest my body to him, make offerings, protect him, and comfort his heart, and I will also be making offerings to the Lotus Sutra. If this person is sitting and contemplating this sutra, I will also, at that time, ride my white elephant king and appear before him. If this person forgets a single line or a single verse of the Lotus Sutra, I will teach him, read and recite it with him, and cause him to master it again. At that time, the one who receives, upholds, reads, and recites the Lotus Sutra, will see my body and be filled with great joy, and will become even more diligent. Because he sees me, he will immediately attain a samadhi and a dhāraṇī, named Whirling Dhāraṇī, Dhāraṇī of a Hundred Thousand Million Whirlings, and Dhāraṇī of the Dharma Sound and Expedient Means. He will attain these kinds of dhāraṇī."

"World-Honored One, from the land of King of Superior Virtue of Treasures, I heard from afar that in this Saha world, the Lotus Sutra is being preached. I have come with immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of millions of Bodhisattva assemblies to listen to it. We only wish that the World-Honored One would tell us how a noble man or noble woman can attain this Lotus Sutra after the Tathagata’s passing?"
