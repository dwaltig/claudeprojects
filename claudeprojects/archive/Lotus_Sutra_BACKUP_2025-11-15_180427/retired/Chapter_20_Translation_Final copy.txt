Chapter Twenty: The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta, saying: "You should now understand that if any monk, nun, layman, or laywoman who upholds the Lotus Sutra is subject to slander, abuse, and vilification, they will incur grave karmic retribution, as previously explained. Yet the merit they acquire is as aforementioned—the purification of the faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, in ages long past, beyond measureless, boundless, inconceivable, incalculable kalpas, there was a Buddha named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata, One Worthy of Offerings, One of Right and Universal Knowledge, One Perfect in Clarity and Conduct, Well Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa was named離衰 (Free from Decline), and the land was named 大成 (Great Completion). This Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja taught the Dharma in that world to humans, devas, and asuras. For those seeking the śrāvaka path, he expounded the teaching appropriate to the Four Noble Truths, enabling them to transcend birth, old age, sickness, and death, and ultimately attain nirvāṇa. For those seeking the pratyekabuddha path, he expounded the teaching appropriate to the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. For the bodhisattvas, on account of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, he expounded the teaching appropriate to the Six Perfections, enabling them to ultimately attain the wisdom of the Buddha.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, the lifespan of this Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja was forty myriads of millions of nayutas of Ganges sands of kalpas. The True Dharma abided in the world for a number of kalpas equal to the dust motes of one Jambudvīpa. The Semblance Dharma abided in the world for a number of kalpas equal to the dust motes of the four continents. After this Buddha had brought benefit to sentient beings, he then passed into extinction. After both the True Dharma and the Semblance Dharma had completely vanished, in that same land another Buddha appeared, also bearing the name Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata, One Worthy of Offerings, One of Right and Universal Knowledge, One Perfect in Clarity and Conduct, Well Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. In this manner, there appeared in succession twenty thousand myriads of Buddhas, all bearing the same name.

"After the first Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata had passed into extinction, and after the True Dharma had perished, in the age of the Semblance Dharma, there were monks of overbearing arrogance who wielded great power. At that time there was a bodhisattva monk named Sadāparibhūta (Never Disparaging). Mahāsthāmaprāpta, for what reason was he named Never Disparaging? This monk, whenever he encountered anyone—whether monk, nun, layman, or laywoman—would invariably bow in reverence and offer praise, speaking these words: 'I deeply respect you all and dare not treat you with contempt. Why is this so? You are all practicing the bodhisattva path and shall attain Buddhahood.'

"Yet this monk did not devote himself exclusively to reading and reciting the sutras. He merely practiced reverent prostration. Even when he saw the four assemblies from afar, he would deliberately approach them to bow in reverence and offer praise, speaking these words: 'I dare not disparage you, for you shall all attain Buddhahood.' Among the four assemblies, there were those who gave rise to anger and impure thoughts, who reviled him with harsh speech, saying: 'This ignorant monk—from whence has he come? He says he does not disparage us, yet presumes to confer upon us the prediction that we shall attain Buddhahood. We have no use for such false and empty predictions.'

"For many years he endured such abuse, yet he never gave rise to anger, but constantly spoke these words: 'You shall attain Buddhahood.' When he spoke thus, people would sometimes strike him with staffs and staves, or pelt him with tiles and stones. He would retreat and stand at a distance, yet still cry out in a loud voice: 'I dare not disparage you, for you shall all attain Buddhahood.' Because he constantly spoke these words, the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen of overbearing arrogance gave him the name Never Disparaging.

"When this monk was approaching the end of his life, he heard in empty space the complete teaching of the Lotus Sutra previously expounded by the Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja—twenty thousand myriads of millions of verses—and was able to receive and uphold them all. Immediately he attained the purification of the eye faculty as previously described, as well as the purification of the faculties of ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Having attained the purification of these six faculties, his lifespan was extended by two hundred myriads of millions of nayutas of years, and he extensively expounded this Lotus Sutra to others.

"At that time, those of the four assemblies of overbearing arrogance—the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen who had treated this person with contempt and given him the name Never Disparaging—witnessed that he had attained great spiritual powers, the power of joyful eloquence, and the power of great virtuous tranquility. Hearing his teaching, they all believed, submitted themselves, and became his followers. This bodhisattva also converted thousands of myriads of millions of beings, causing them to abide in anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"After the end of his life, he encountered two thousand myriads of Buddhas, all named Candrasūryapradīpa (Sun Moon Lamp Bright). In the Dharma of these Buddhas, he expounded this Lotus Sutra. By reason of this cause and condition, he again encountered two thousand myriads of Buddhas, all bearing the name Meghasvararājaprabhāsa (Cloud Free King of Sound). In the Dharma of all these Buddhas, he received, upheld, read, and recited this sutra, and because he expounded this scriptural teaching to the four assemblies, he attained the constant purification of the eye faculty and the purification of all the faculties—ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. When he expounded the Dharma amidst the four assemblies, his mind was free from all fear.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, this Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Never Disparaging made offerings to all these various Buddhas, showing them reverence, honor, and praise, planting manifold roots of goodness. Thereafter, he again encountered thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas, and in the Dharma of each of these Buddhas he expounded this scriptural teaching. His merit having been perfected, he was destined to attain Buddhahood.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, what do you think? Could the Bodhisattva Never Disparaging of that time have been some other person? He was none other than myself. Had I not received, upheld, read, and recited this sutra in former lives, and expounded it to others, I would not have been able to swiftly attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. Because in the presence of former Buddhas I received, upheld, read, and recited this sutra and expounded it to others, I swiftly attained anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, the four assemblies of that time—the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—who with minds of hatred and anger treated me with contempt, for two hundred myriads of kalpas never encountered a Buddha, never heard the Dharma, and never beheld the Saṅgha. For a thousand kalpas they suffered grievous torment in the Avīci Hell. After exhausting that karmic retribution, they again encountered the Bodhisattva Never Disparaging, who taught and converted them to anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, what do you think? Could those of the four assemblies who constantly disparaged this bodhisattva at that time have been other persons? They are none other than the five hundred bodhisattvas of this assembly, including Bhadrapāla and others; the five hundred monks, including Siṃhacandra (Lion Moon) and others; and the five hundred laymen, including Nirbhayabuddhi (Thought of the Buddha) and others—all of whom are now irreversibly established in anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. Mahāsthāmaprāpta, you should understand that this Lotus Sutra greatly benefits all bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and is able to cause them to arrive at anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. Therefore, after the passing of the Tathāgata, the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas should constantly receive, uphold, read, recite, expound, and transcribe this sutra."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"In ages past there was a Buddha
Named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja,
Whose spiritual wisdom was measureless,
Who guided and led all beings.

Devas, humans, dragons, and spirits
All made offerings to him together.
After this Buddha passed into extinction,
When the Dharma was about to expire,

There was a bodhisattva
Named Never Disparaging.
At that time the four assemblies
Were attached and clinging to the Dharma.

The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging
Approached them
And spoke to them, saying:
'I do not disparage you,

For you all practice the Way
And shall all attain Buddhahood.'
When the people heard this,
They slandered and reviled him.

The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging
Was able to patiently endure this.
When his karmic offenses were exhausted,
At the end of his life,

He was able to hear this sutra,
And his six faculties became pure.
Through the power of spiritual penetrations,
His lifespan was extended,

And he again for the sake of others
Extensively expounded this sutra.
All those attached to the Dharma
Were blessed by this bodhisattva,

Who taught and perfected them,
Causing them to abide in the Buddha Way.
When Never Disparaging's life ended,
He encountered countless Buddhas.

Because he expounded this sutra,
He gained measureless blessings.
Gradually perfecting his merit,
He swiftly accomplished the Buddha Way.

That Never Disparaging of former times
Was none other than myself.
The members of the four assemblies
Who were attached to the Dharma,

Who heard Never Disparaging say,
'You shall attain Buddhahood'—
By reason of this cause and condition,
They encountered countless Buddhas.

The five hundred bodhisattvas
In this present assembly,
Together with the four assemblies
Of pure-faithed men and women

Who now stand before me
Listening to the Dharma—these they are.
In former lives I exhorted
All these people

To listen to and receive this sutra,
The foremost of teachings.
I revealed and taught them,
Causing them to abide in nirvāṇa,

Life after life receiving and upholding
This scriptural teaching.
Only after myriads upon myriads of kalpas,
Beyond all reckoning,

Does one have the opportunity to hear
This Lotus Sutra.
Only after myriads upon myriads of kalpas,
Beyond all reckoning,

Do the Buddhas, World-Honored Ones,
Expound this sutra.
Therefore, practitioners,
After the Buddha's extinction,

Upon hearing such a sutra as this,
Should not give rise to doubt.
They should single-mindedly
Extensively expound this sutra,

And life after life encounter Buddhas,
Swiftly accomplishing the Buddha Way."
