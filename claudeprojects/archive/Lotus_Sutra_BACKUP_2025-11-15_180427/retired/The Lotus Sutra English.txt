The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma,
Chapter 1: Introduction
Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying on Mount Vulture Peak in the city of Rajagriha, together with a great assembly of twelve thousand monks. All were Arhats, their defilements extinguished, their afflictions gone. They had attained their own benefit, cut all bonds of existence, and their minds had achieved liberation. Their names were: Ajñāta-Kauṇḍinya, Mahākāśyapa, Uruvilva-Kāśyapa, Gayā-Kāśyapa, Nadī-Kāśyapa, Śāriputra, Mahāmaudgalyāyana, Mahākātyāyana, Aniruddha, Kapphiṇa, Kauṇḍinya, Revata, Pūrṇa-Maitrāyaṇīputra, Subhūti, Ananda, Rāhula, and other great Arhats well known to the assembly.
There were also two thousand people, both those who were still learning and those who had nothing more to learn. Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, the nun, was there with her retinue of six thousand. Yaśodharā, the mother of Rāhula, the nun, was also there with her retinue.
There were also eighty thousand Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, all of whom had reached the stage of non-retrogression from Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi (supreme, perfect enlightenment). They all possessed dhāranīs and were gifted in joyful speech and eloquence, turning the Dharma wheel of non-retrogression. They had made offerings to countless hundreds of thousands of Buddhas and planted roots of virtue at their feet, always receiving praise from the Buddhas. They cultivated compassion in their conduct, skillfully entering the wisdom of the Buddhas. They had a thorough understanding of great wisdom and had reached the other shore. Their fame was heard throughout immeasurable worlds, and they were able to save countless hundreds of thousands of sentient beings.
Their names were: Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva, Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, Mahāsthāmaprāpta Bodhisattva, Constant-Progress Bodhisattva, Never-Resting Bodhisattva, Jewel-Hand Bodhisattva, Medicine-King Bodhisattva, Valiant-Giver Bodhisattva, Jewel-Moon Bodhisattva, Moon-Light Bodhisattva, Full-Moon Bodhisattva, Great-Might Bodhisattva, Immeasurable-Might Bodhisattva, Transcending-Three-Worlds Bodhisattva, Bhadrapāla Bodhisattva, Maitreya Bodhisattva, Jewel-Accumulation Bodhisattva, Leader Bodhisattva, and others, numbering eighty thousand great Bodhisattvas.
At that time, Śakra, King of the Devas, was there with his retinue of twenty thousand celestial beings. There were also King Moonlight, King All-Fragrance, King Jewel-Light, and the Four Great Heavenly Kings, each with a retinue of ten thousand celestial beings. The Heavenly King of the Pure Abode and the Great Heavenly King of the Pure Abode were there with their retinue of thirty thousand celestial beings. The Brahmā King Śikhin and the Great Brahmā King of Light, rulers of the Saha world, were there with their retinue of twelve thousand celestial beings.
There were eight great Dragon Kings: the Dragon Kings Nanda, Upananda, Sagara, Vāsuki, Takṣaka, Anavatapta, Manasvin, and Utpalaka, each with hundreds of thousands of followers. There were four great Kinnara Kings: Dharma-Kinnara, Wonderful-Dharma-Kinnara, Great-Dharma-Kinnara, and Upholder-of-Dharma-Kinnara, each with hundreds of thousands of followers. There were four great Gandharva Kings: Music-Gandharva, Musical-Sound-Gandharva, Beautiful-Gandharva, and Beautiful-Sound-Gandharva, each with hundreds of thousands of followers. There were four great Asura Kings: Valiant-Asura, Kharaskandha-Asura, Vimalacitra-Asura, and Rāhu-Asura, each with hundreds of thousands of followers. There were four great Garuda Kings: Great-Might-Garuda, Great-Body-Garuda, Great-Fullness-Garuda, and As-You-Wish-Garuda, each with hundreds of thousands of followers.
King Ajātaśatru, the son of Vaidehī, was there with hundreds of thousands of followers. All of them paid homage to the Buddha's feet and then sat down to one side.
At that time, the World-Honored One was surrounded by the four groups of disciples, who were making offerings, showing reverence, respect, and praise. He was expounding a Great Vehicle sutra for the Bodhisattvas, named the Sutra of Innumerable Meanings, which is a teaching for Bodhisattvas and is protected and remembered by the Buddhas.
After the Buddha had finished expounding this sutra, he sat in the lotus posture and entered the samadhi of the station of Innumerable Meanings. His body and mind remained motionless. At that moment, heavenly flowers rained down—maṇḍārava, mahāmaṇḍārava, mañjūṣaka, and mahāmañjūṣaka flowers—scattering upon the Buddha and the great assembly. The entire world of the Buddha shook in six ways.
At that time, the great assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, as well as minor kings and wheel-turning holy kings—experienced a joy they had never known before. With palms joined, they focused their attention entirely on the Buddha.
At that moment, the Buddha released a ray of light from the white hair between his eyebrows, illuminating eighteen thousand worlds in the east, without missing a single one. This light reached down to the Avīci hell and up to the Akaniṣṭha heaven. In this world, the assembly saw all the sentient beings in the six destinies of those lands, and they also saw the Buddhas who were currently present there. They heard the Dharma that those Buddhas were teaching and saw the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen who were practicing and attaining the Way. They also saw the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas following the Bodhisattva path through various causes, beliefs, and appearances. They saw Buddhas who had entered parinirvāṇa and saw jeweled stupas of seven treasures erected to house their relics.
At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva thought: "For what reason is the World-Honored One now displaying this wondrous, supernatural manifestation? The World-Honored One has entered samadhi; this is an inconceivable and rare event. Who should I ask? Who can answer?" He thought again: "Mañjuśrī, the son of the Dharma King, has already served and made offerings to countless Buddhas in the past. He must have seen such a rare sign before. I will ask him now."
At that time, the monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, and the gods, dragons, and ghost-spirits in the assembly all thought: "This miraculous sign of the Buddha's light—whom should we ask about it now?"
Then, Maitreya Bodhisattva, wishing to resolve his own doubts and observing the thoughts of the four groups of disciples and the gods, dragons, and ghost-spirits in the assembly, asked Mañjuśrī: "For what reason is there this auspicious sign of supernatural power? Why has the Buddha emitted this great light, illuminating eighteen thousand lands in the east and revealing the glorious adornments of those Buddha lands?"
Wishing to repeat this meaning, Maitreya Bodhisattva spoke in a verse, asking:
Mañjuśrī, tell us why,
The Great Teacher, with light so high,
From brows so white, a radiant gleam,
Illuminates all, like a wondrous dream.
With maṇḍārava and mañjūṣaka showers,
And fragrant sandalwood, through all the hours,
Delighting hearts, a gentle breeze,
The ground so pure, with perfect ease.
This world it shakes, in sixfold sway,
The fourfold host, on that blessed day,
Rejoiced as one, with joy profound,
Such peace and bliss, had ne'er been found.

The light that shines, from eyebrows bright,
Upon the east, dispels all night,
Eighteen thousand lands, a golden hue,
From Avīci's depths, to heavens new,
To Akaniṣṭha's highest sphere,
All worlds revealed, so plain and clear.
Six kinds of beings, in life and death's flow,
Their good and evil karma, we now know,
And all rewards, both sweet and sour,
Can all be seen, in this bright hour.

We see the Buddhas, lions of men,
Expounding scriptures, again and again,
Subtle and sublime, their voices pure,
Gentle sounds, that long endure,
Teaching millions, Bodhisattvas bold,
The Brahma sound, a story told,
That makes us yearn, to hear anew,
In their own worlds, the Dharma true,
Explaining causes, with parables grand,
To light the Dharma, throughout the land,
And waken beings, from their slumber deep.

If suffering comes, and sorrows creep,
Despising age, and sickness' sting,
The Buddha preaches, nirvana's spring,
Ending all pain, a sweet release.
If merit's there, and inner peace,
With offerings made, to Buddhas past,
And seeking Dharma, that will last,
The Buddha shows, the Pratyekabuddha's way.
If Buddha's son, from day to day,
Cultivates practices, with wisdom's plea,
The pure path opens, for them to see.

Mañjuśrī, as I stand here,
Such things I see, and hold them dear,
Thousands of millions, now unfold,
A brief account, will now be told.
In those far lands, as Ganges' sand,
Bodhisattvas seek, the Buddha's hand.
Some practice giving, with open heart,
Of gold and silver, a precious part,
Coral and pearls, and mani's gleam,
Tridacna, agate, a shining dream,
Diamonds and jewels, beyond compare,
Slaves and servants, carriages rare,
Jeweled palanquins, with joy they give,
To Buddha's Way, that all may live.
They vow to gain, this vehicle grand,
The foremost one, in every land,
Praised by all Buddhas, in realms above.

Or Bodhisattvas, filled with love,
Give jeweled carriages, with horses four,
With railings bright, and canopies' store,
Adorned with flowers, a lovely sight.
Again I see, with pure delight,
Bodhisattvas giving, flesh and hand,
Their feet, their wives, throughout the land,
Even their children, for the Way so high.
I see them gladly, with upward eye,
Giving their heads, their eyes, their frame,
To seek the Buddha's wisdom, and his name.

Mañjuśrī, I see kings,
To Buddha's place, their spirit brings,
Asking for Way, supreme and grand.
They leave their lands, a pleasant strand,
Palaces, ministers, and consorts dear,
Shave hair and beard, with naught to fear,
And don the robes, of Dharma's call.

Or Bodhisattvas, rising tall,
Become as monks, in quiet space,
Reciting scriptures, with joyful grace.
I see them striving, with might and main,
Entering mountains, to ease all pain,
To contemplate the Buddha's mind.
And those who leave desire behind,
In empty places, quiet and deep,
Cultivating meditation, while others sleep,
Gaining the powers, fivefold and bright.

I see them sitting, bathed in light,
In meditation, with palms so high,
Praising the Kings of Dharma, to the sky,
With millions of verses, a chorus sweet.
Again I see them, with wisdom complete,
With firm resolve, and knowledge deep,
Asking the Buddhas, secrets to keep,
Receiving all, and holding fast.

I see the Buddha's sons, built to last,
In wisdom and samādhi, they excel,
With countless parables, the Dharma they tell,
Delighting in teaching, with grace and might,
Transforming Bodhisattvas, with inner light,
Breaking Māra's armies, with valiant hand,
Beating the Dharma drum, throughout the land.

I see Bodhisattvas, silent and serene,
Revered by gods and dragons, a noble scene,
But not by praise, are they swayed.
I see them shining, in forest glade,
Saving those suffering, in hell's dark night,
Leading them onward, to Buddha's light.

I see the Buddha's sons, who never rest,
Pacing the forest, put to the test,
Diligent seeking, the Buddha's Way.
I see those pure, from day to day,
Flawless in conduct, like jewels so bright,
As they seek the Buddha's guiding light.

I see the Buddha's sons, in patience's power,
Enduring insults, in every hour,
Beatings of arrogant, they bravely face,
As they seek the Buddha's saving grace.

I see Bodhisattvas, from jokes they flee,
And foolish family, to be truly free,
Associating with wise, with single aim,
Removing distractions, and calling His Name,
Collecting thoughts, in mountains and woods,
For millions of years, as true one good,
As they seek the Buddha's perfect Way.

Or I see Bodhisattvas, come what may,
Making offerings, of food so fine,
And medicines diverse, a gift divine,
To Buddhas and Sangha, with hearts so true.
Or precious robes, of every hue,
Worth thousands of millions, beyond all price,
Offered to Buddhas, with sacrifice.
Or millions of kinds, of sandalwood sweet,
And jeweled homes, a vision complete,
And wonderful bedding, for rest and ease,
Offered to Buddhas, to bring them peace.
Pure gardens and forests, with blossoms bright,
Flowing springs, and bathing light,
Offered to Buddhas, with love and care.

These and other gifts, beyond compare,
Cultivate fruit, subtle and grand,
With endless joy, throughout the land,
As they seek the Way, supreme and true.

Or Bodhisattvas, with wisdom's view,
Teach Dharma of stillness, and ending strife,
Giving instructions, to all of life.
Or I see them pondering, dharmas' core,
Seeing not two natures, but one, and no more,
Just like empty space, a truth profound.
Again, I see Buddha's sons, on holy ground,
Whose minds aren't attached, to anything here,
With wisdom wonderful, banishing fear,
They seek the Way, so pure and bright.

Mañjuśrī, there are Bodhisattvas, with all their might,
After Buddha's passing, a solemn time,
Make offerings to relics, in realms sublime.
I see Buddha's sons, with fervent grace,
Building stupas and temples, in every place,
As countless as Ganges' sands, so vast,
Adorning their lands, designed to last.
The jeweled stupas, tall and grand,
Five thousand yojanas, in every land,
And two thousand, in width and in length,
A wonder of beauty, and spiritual strength.

Each stupa and temple, a sight to behold,
A thousand banners and streamers, stories untold,
A jewel net canopy, shining above,
Precious bells ringing, with harmony and love.
Gods, dragons, and spirits, with human kind,
Non-humans as well, with incense entwined,
Flowers and music, offerings so sweet,
Constantly offered, at Buddha's feet.

Mañjuśrī, these sons of the Buddha, so bold,
To offer to relics, a story oft told,
Adorn the stupas and temples, with grace.
The lands naturally, in every place,
Become wondrous and beautiful, beyond compare,
Like the Heavenly Tree King, with flowers so fair,
When its blossoms are fully, in glorious bloom.

When the Buddha emitted, one ray through the gloom,
I and this assembly, saw wonders unfold,
Extraordinary visions, more precious than gold.
The Buddhas' great power, and wisdom so rare,
Emitted one pure ray, to banish all care,
Illuminating lands, beyond our sight.
When we saw this, we felt such delight,
A joy we had never, known before.

Mañjuśrī, son of the Buddha, we implore,
Resolve the doubts, of this assembly's heart.
The fourfold groups, they play their part,
Looking with longing, at you and at me.
For what reason, the World-Honored, you see,
Emitted this light, so pure and bright?
Son of the Buddha, answer tonight,
Resolve our doubts, and bring us great joy.

What benefit is there, what good can employ,
In showing this light, so grand and so vast?
Is it to teach Dharma, that forever will last,
That the Buddha attained, at enlightenment's place?
Or to bestow prophecies, with wisdom and grace?
He showed us the Buddha lands, all jeweled and pure,
And let us see Buddhas, a sight to endure.
This is no small cause, a truth you must know,
Mañjuśrī, you see, the seeds that will grow.
The fourfold groups, dragons, and spirits, so keen,
Are looking to you, to tell what is seen.
So what will you say, with wisdom so deep?
At that time, Mañjuśrī said to Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva and the other great beings and noble men: “As I reflect, I believe the World-Honored One is now about to preach the great Dharma, to pour the great Dharma rain, to blow the great Dharma conch, to beat the great Dharma drum, and to expound the great Dharma truth. Noble men, in the past, when I was with other Buddhas, I saw this same auspicious sign. After they emitted this light, they then preached the great Dharma. Therefore, you should know that the Buddha’s manifestation of this light today is also for this reason. He wishes for all sentient beings to hear and know this Dharma which is difficult to believe for the people of this world, and so he reveals this auspicious sign.”
“Noble men, in the past, in immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, there was a Buddha named Sun Moon Lamp Light Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. He expounded the true Dharma, which was excellent in the beginning, excellent in the middle, and excellent in the end. Its meaning was profound and far-reaching, its words were skillful and wonderful, pure, unmixed, and complete in the characteristic of pure conduct. For those seeking to become śrāvakas (voice-hearers), he preached the Dharma of the Four Noble Truths to save them from birth, old age, sickness, and death and lead them to ultimate nirvāṇa. For those seeking to become pratyekabuddhas (self-enlightened ones), he preached the Dharma of the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. For the Bodhisattvas, he preached the Dharma of the Six Pāramitās to help them attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi and become an All-Knowing One.”
“After him, there was a Buddha also named Sun Moon Lamp Light. Then again, another Buddha also named Sun Moon Lamp Light. In this way, twenty thousand Buddhas all had the same name, Sun Moon Lamp Light, and all shared the same surname, Bharadvaja. Maitreya, you should know that the first and the last of these Buddhas all had the same name, Sun Moon Lamp Light, and were complete in the ten titles of a Buddha. The Dharma they preached was excellent in the beginning, middle, and end. The last of these Buddhas had eight sons before he renounced his home. Their names were: Intention, Good-Intention, Boundless-Intention, Jewel-Intention, Increasing-Intention, Doubt-Removing-Intention, Directed-Intention, and Dharma-Intention. These eight princes were majestic and at ease, each ruling over one of the four continents. When these princes heard that their father had renounced his home and attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, they all abandoned their royal positions and also renounced their homes. They all conceived the Mahayana resolve and constantly cultivated pure conduct. They all became Dharma teachers, having already planted roots of goodness under millions of Buddhas.”
“At that time, the Buddha Sun Moon Lamp Light preached a Mahayana sutra named the Sutra of Innumerable Meanings, a Dharma for Bodhisattvas protected and remembered by the Buddhas. After he had finished this sutra, he sat in the lotus posture in the midst of the great assembly and entered the samadhi of the station of Innumerable Meanings. His body and mind remained motionless. At that time, heavenly flowers rained down—maṇḍārava, mahāmaṇḍārava, mañjūṣaka, and mahāmañjūṣaka flowers—scattering upon the Buddha and the great assembly. The entire world of the Buddha shook in six ways. At that time, the great assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, as well as minor kings and wheel-turning holy kings—experienced a joy they had never known before. With palms joined, they focused their attention entirely on the Buddha.”
“At that time, the Tathagata released a ray of light from the white hair between his eyebrows, illuminating eighteen thousand Buddha lands in the east, without missing a single one, just as you see these Buddha lands now. Maitreya, you should know that at that time, there were twenty million Bodhisattvas in the assembly who were eager to hear the Dharma. When these Bodhisattvas saw this light illuminating all the Buddha lands, they felt a joy they had never known before and wished to know the cause of this light. At that time, there was a Bodhisattva named Wonderful Light who had eight hundred disciples. When the Buddha Sun Moon Lamp Light arose from his samadhi, he preached a Mahayana sutra named the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a Dharma for Bodhisattvas protected and remembered by the Buddhas. He remained on his seat for sixty minor kalpas. Those in the assembly who were listening also remained in one place for sixty minor kalpas, their bodies and minds motionless, listening to the Buddha’s teaching as if it were only a moment of a meal. At that time, there was not a single person in the assembly whose body or mind felt any weariness.”
“After the Buddha Sun Moon Lamp Light had finished preaching this sutra for sixty minor kalpas, he declared to the assembly of Brahma, Māra, śramaṇas, Brahmins, gods, humans, and asuras that the Tathagata would enter parinirvāṇa at midnight that very day. At that time, there was a Bodhisattva named Virtue-Store. The Buddha Sun Moon Lamp Light immediately gave him a prophecy, saying to the monks: ‘This Virtue-Store Bodhisattva will soon become a Buddha, with the title Pure-Body Tathagata, Arhat, Samyaksambuddha.’ After the Buddha gave this prophecy, he entered parinirvāṇa at midnight. After the Buddha's passing, Wonderful Light Bodhisattva held and taught the Lotus Sutra for a full eighty minor kalpas. The eight sons of the Buddha Sun Moon Lamp Light all took Wonderful Light as their teacher. Wonderful Light taught and transformed them, making them firm in their resolve for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. After these princes had made offerings to countless hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, they all attained the Buddha Way. The last to become a Buddha was named Burning Lamp. Among the eight hundred disciples of Wonderful Light, there was one named Fame-Seeker, who was attached to gain and honor. Although he read and recited many sutras, he did not understand them well and forgot much, which is why he was called Fame-Seeker. Because this person also planted roots of goodness, he was able to meet countless hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, making offerings to them, showing respect, reverence, and praise.”
“Maitreya, you should know that the Wonderful Light Bodhisattva of that time—was he anyone other than me? I was that Bodhisattva. And the Fame-Seeker Bodhisattva—was he anyone other than you? You were that Bodhisattva. Now that I see this auspicious sign, it is no different from the one I saw before. Therefore, I believe that today the Tathagata is about to preach the Mahayana sutra named the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a Dharma for Bodhisattvas protected and remembered by the Buddhas.”
At that time, Mañjuśrī, wishing to repeat this meaning for the great assembly, spoke in a verse, saying:
In ages past, beyond all count,
A Buddha rose, a sacred fount.
Sun Moon Lamp Light, his name so bright,
He shared the Dharma, shedding light, oh Lord, shedding light.

He saved all beings, vast and wide,
And Bodhisattvas, side by side.
To wisdom's path, he led the way,
To Buddha's truth, in that far day, yeah, in that far day.

Before he left his earthly home,
Eight sons he had, who chose to roam
The path of pure and righteous deed,
Following their Sage, sowing wisdom's seed, hmm, wisdom's seed.

A sutra then, the Buddha taught,
"Innumerable Meanings," deeply sought.
Among the throngs, its truths unfurled,
A guiding light for all the world, for all the world, you see.

When done, he sat in lotus grace,
In samadhi's calm, a sacred space.
"Innumerable Meanings" was its name,
A tranquil state, a holy flame, burning so free.

Then maṇḍārava flowers rained down,
And drums of heaven, without a sound,
Played on their own, a wondrous sign,
Gods, dragons, spirits, all divine, a sweet refrain.

All Buddha-worlds began to shake,
A great tremor for all to take.
From 'tween his brows, a light he sent,
Revealing wonders, heaven-bent, and easing pain.

Eighteen thousand lands to the east,
This light revealed, a glorious feast.
Life and death, karma's hold,
In every being, stories told, deep in the soul.

Some saw the lands, with jewels adorned,
Of lapis lazuli, bright and unhorned.
Crystal clear, a dazzling sight,
By Buddha's wisdom, shining bright, worth more than gold.

Gods and humans, dragons too,
Yakshas, Gandharvas, Kinnaras, a view.
Each to their Buddha, offerings made,
In sacred reverence, unafraid, no need to be blue.

Tathagatas, they then did see,
Who found the Way, in majesty.
Like golden mountains, bodies gleamed,
Subtle, wondrous, as if dreamed, a soulful hue.

A golden image, true and bright,
In pure lapis lazuli, bathed in light.
The World-Honored One, in grand array,
Proclaimed the Dharma, come what may, come what may, my friend.

In Buddha lands, beyond all sum,
Countless śrāvakas had become.
By Buddha's light, we could behold,
Those great assemblies, stories told, until the end.

Some were monks, in mountain's keep,
Pure precepts holding, vows so deep.
Like guarding pearls of priceless worth,
They sought enlightenment on this earth, from dust to grace.

Bodhisattvas, too, I saw,
Practicing giving, 'gainst all law
Of selfish gain, with patience true,
Like Ganges sands, their numbers grew, in that holy place.

And Bodhisattvas, deep in thought,
In meditation, stillness sought.
Their bodies, minds, in quiet repose,
Seeking the Way, where wisdom grows, like a gentle breeze.

Others saw, in nature's core,
All dharmas still, forevermore.
In their own lands, the Dharma preached,
The Buddha Way, they bravely reached, and found their ease.

The fourfold group, with joyful heart,
Saw Sun Moon Lamp Light play his part.
With power vast, a wondrous show,
Their hearts rejoiced, a joyous glow, oh, how they sang.

"What is the cause?" they asked around,
As the Honored One, from trance unbound,
Arose from samadhi, revered by all,
Answering their questions, heeding their call, the sweet bells rang.

He praised Wonderful Light, "World's eye you are,
A trust and refuge, a guiding star.
The Dharma's treasury, you uphold,
Its deepest truths, by you are told," every word so true.

"The Dharma I've preached," he then did say,
"Only you can verify this day."
The World-Honored One, with praises high,
Made Wonderful Light's spirit fly, up to the sky so blue.

Then preached the Lotus, sixty kalpas long,
From his seat he moved not, with Dharma strong.
The subtle Dharma, supreme and grand,
Wonderful Light received, throughout the land, for me and for you.

When Lotus Sutra's words were done,
He spoke to gods and everyone:
"The nature true, of all that be,
I've now explained, for you to see," every single plea.

"At midnight, I'll enter nirvana's rest,
Be diligent, put forth your best.
Buddhas are rare, in kalpas vast,
A billion years, their light can last," eternally.

His Buddha sons, with sorrow deep,
Heard of his passing, then did weep.
"How swiftly goes the Buddha's light!"
They mourned his leaving, in the night, a mournful cry.

The sacred ruler, King of Dharma's grace,
Consoled the throng, in that sad place.
"When I pass on, fear not, nor fret,
A guiding light, you'll surely get," beneath the sky.

"Virtue-Store Bodhisattva, wise and true,
The unconditioned's nature, he sees through.
He'll be a Buddha, Pure-Body named,
And sentient beings, will be reclaimed," by and by.

That night, the Buddha entered peace,
Like fire extinguished, finding ease.
His relics scattered, stupas grand,
Were built in reverence, through the land, for all to revere.

Monks and nuns, like Ganges' sands,
With doubled zeal, through all the lands,
Sought the supreme Way, with fervent mind,
Leaving all earthly ties behind, wiping every tear.

Wonderful Light, that teacher wise,
Upheld the Dharma, in his eyes.
For eighty kalpas, long and vast,
The Lotus Sutra's truths he cast, for all to hear.

The eight princes, by Light converted,
In the supreme Way, were now asserted.
Countless Buddhas, they would see,
A journey long, for eternity, year after year.

To Buddhas all, their offerings made,
The great Way followed, unafraid.
Attaining Buddhahood, one by one,
Their prophecies, their race was run, no need to fear.

The last of gods, in heaven's sphere,
Was Buddha Burning Lamp, so dear.
Leader of sages, saving souls,
Beyond all measure, reaching goals, oh, so very clear.

Wonderful Light, with one disciple there,
Who lazy was, without a care.
Attached to fame, and worldly gain,
Seeking applause, enduring pain, it brings a tear.

Unsatisfied, with praise and might,
He sought out families, day and night.
His studies lost, forgotten, dim,
Understanding little, at their whim, oh dear, oh dear.

Thus, "Fame-Seeker," he was called,
Yet many good deeds, he installed.
Countless Buddhas, he did see,
And offerings made, for all to be, banishing all fear.

He served the Buddhas, followed the Way,
Six pāramitās, through night and day.
Now, Śākyas' Lion, he beholds,
A future Buddha, in stories told, and always near.

Soon, Maitreya, he will be,
Saving beings, for all to see.
Immeasurable numbers, vast and grand,
His loving kindness, through the land, calming every fear.

That lazy one, when Buddha passed,
Was you, whose present life is cast.
And Wonderful Light, that teacher great,
Is now my body, sealed by fate, so hold it dear.

Sun Moon Lamp Light, his sign I saw,
Like this one now, defying law.
Today's own Buddha, I now know,
The Lotus Sutra, he'll bestow, for all to hear.

Today's sign, like the one of old,
Buddhas' skillful means, to be told.
This light emitted, strong and bright,
To realize truth, in purest light, oh, so very clear.

Now, all of you, this truth embrace,
Join palms and wait, with single grace.
The Buddha's Dharma, rain will pour,
To quench the thirst, forevermore, and wipe away each tear.

For those who seek the vehicles three,
If doubt or sorrow, there may be,
The Buddha will remove each trace,
And fill your hearts with boundless grace, year after year.






Chapter 2: Expedient Means
At that time, the World-Honored One calmly arose from his meditation and said to Śāriputra: "The wisdom of the Buddhas is profoundly immeasurable. The gate to this wisdom is difficult to comprehend and difficult to enter. It is something that no śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha can know. Why is this? The Buddha has served and been close to hundreds of thousands of millions of countless Buddhas, fully practicing their immeasurable path. He has progressed with valor and diligence, and his name is heard everywhere. He has perfected a profound and unprecedented Dharma. The teachings he gives are always appropriate, but their intent is difficult to comprehend.
Śāriputra, since I attained Buddhahood, I have used various causes, various parables, and a wide array of teachings and countless expedient means to guide sentient beings, enabling them to leave all attachments. Why is this? The Tathagata's expedient means and wisdom pāramitā (perfection) are all fully complete. Śāriputra, the Tathagata’s wisdom and insight are vast, profound, and far-reaching, immeasurable and unhindered. His powers, fearlessnesses, meditations, liberations, and samadhis have penetrated boundless reaches, and he has perfected all unprecedented Dharmas. Śāriputra, the Tathagata can differentiate and skillfully expound all Dharmas with gentle words that please the hearts of the assembly. Śāriputra, to put it concisely, the Buddha has perfected immeasurable, boundless, and unprecedented Dharmas.”
"Stop, Śāriputra, there is no need to speak further. Why? The most rare and difficult-to-comprehend Dharma that the Buddha has perfected can only be fully exhausted by a Buddha together with another Buddha. This is what is meant by the true nature of all phenomena: their suchness of form, suchness of nature, suchness of substance, suchness of power, suchness of function, suchness of cause, suchness of condition, suchness of effect, suchness of retribution, and suchness of how they are all completely alike from beginning to end."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
The World Hero, beyond all measure,
Gods and people, a boundless treasure,
No one can know the Buddha's grace,
His power, fearlessness, in every place.
Liberations, samadhis, all his ways,
No one can measure through countless days.
From countless Buddhas, I began to strive,
Practiced all paths, to truly thrive.
This Dharma, profound and subtly spun,
Is hard to grasp for everyone.
For ages long, I walked these roads,
At enlightenment's place, shed all my loads.
The fruit attained, I fully knew,
A karmic reward, both deep and true.
The natures, forms, their meanings deep,
Only I and Buddhas, this secret keep.

This Dharma cannot be displayed,
Its words and forms, still and unswayed.
All other beings, cannot comprehend,
Except for Bodhisattvas, with faith to transcend.
Buddha's disciples, who served with might,
Ended defilements, nearing the light,
Even these souls, though pure and keen,
Are unable to grasp what truly has been.

If Śāriputra, filled the earth,
With all his wisdom, since his birth,
To measure the Buddha's wisdom bright,
He could not grasp a single light.
If ten directions, with him were filled,
And other disciples, all so skilled,
Ten thousand worlds, with them arrayed,
Their wisdom combined, still wouldn't persuade.

Pratyekabuddhas, with minds so clear,
Ended defilements, banishing fear,
Filling ten directions, like a bamboo grove,
If with one mind, for eons they strove,
To think on Buddha's wisdom, true and grand,
They could not know one grain of sand.

Newly resolved Bodhisattvas, a countless throng,
To Buddhas offered, their whole lives long,
Understood meanings, skilled in the lore,
Like rice and hemp, from shore to shore,
Filling ten thousand worlds, with hearts so pure,
If with one mind, their wisdom so sure,
For kalpas vast, like Ganges' sand,
Together they pondered, across the land,
They still could not fathom, the Buddha's great plan.

Non-retrogressing Bodhisattvas, a Ganges' tide,
With single mind, if they thought and tried,
They still could not know, the truth inside.

I tell you now, Śāriputra dear,
This unconditioned, beyond all fear,
Profound and subtle, Dharma's great art,
I've fully attained it, within my heart.
Only I know this form, so deep and wide,
The Buddhas of ten directions, also abide.
Śāriputra, know this truth, my friend,
The words of the Buddhas, never bend.

Have great faith and power, in what Buddha preaches,
The World-Honored One's Dharma, reaches,
After long ages, the truth will emerge,
Like a powerful, undeniable surge.

To śrāvaka's assembly, I now declare,
And those who seek Pratyekabuddha's rare,
From bonds of suffering, I set you free,
And caused you to attain nirvāṇa's decree.
The Buddha uses expedient means, so grand,
To show the three vehicles, across the land.
Sentient beings, attached to their plight,
He guides them to freedom, and endless light.
At that time, among the great assembly, there were twelve hundred śrāvaka arhats who had ended all defilements, such as Ajñāta-Kauṇḍinya and others. Also, monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen who had conceived the mind of a śrāvaka or a pratyekabuddha, each thought to themselves: “For what reason does the World-Honored One so earnestly praise these expedient means, and say that the Dharma the Buddha has attained is so profound and difficult to understand, and that what he has to say is so difficult to grasp, beyond the reach of all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas? The Buddha teaches the meaning of a single liberation, and we have also attained this Dharma and reached nirvāṇa. Yet now, we do not know what this meaning is leading to.”
At that time, Śāriputra, knowing the doubts in the hearts of the four groups of the assembly and not yet understanding himself, said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, for what cause and for what reason are you so earnestly praising the first expedient means of the Buddhas, this profound, subtle, and difficult-to-understand Dharma? Since the past, I have never heard such a teaching from the Buddha. Now, the four groups of the assembly are all in doubt. We only wish the World-Honored One would explain this matter. Why does the World-Honored One so earnestly praise this profound, subtle, and difficult-to-understand Dharma?”
At that time, Śāriputra, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
The great sage, the Sun of Wisdom bright,
Has spoken this Dharma, a wondrous light.
He says he's attained, with power and grace,
This inconceivable Dharma, in time and space,
Of powers, fearlessness, Samadhis, and liberation's embrace.
The Dharma he found, where enlightenment shone,
Has never been questioned, by anyone known.
My mind's hard to fathom, a mystery deep,
No one can question the secrets I keep.

Now, unasked, he preaches, a path he has trod,
Praising the journey, with blessings from God.
His wisdom so subtle, a wonder to see,
What all of the Buddhas attain, wild and free.

The arhats who ended defilements' dark hold,
And those who seek nirvana, stories untold,
Are now all entangled in doubt's winding thread,
"Why has the Buddha these words wisely said?"

Those seeking the pratyekabuddha's lone way,
The monks and the nuns, at the close of the day,
The gods and the dragons, ghost-spirits so vast,
And gandharvas, etc., their numbers amassed,
All look at each other, with hesitation's slow pace,
Looking up at the Double-Footed Honored One's face.

"What does this mean?" they all earnestly ask,
"We wish the Buddha would lighten our task."
Among the assembly of śrāvakas, so grand,
The Buddha has said, "I am foremost in this land."

Now, even I, with my wisdom so keen,
Am in doubt, cannot grasp what these words truly mean.
"Is this the ultimate Dharma, so pure and so true?
Or is it the path that we all should pursue?"

The children born from the Buddha's own speech,
Join their palms, looking up, hoping wisdom he'll teach.
"We wish that you'd speak, with your subtle soft tone,
And tell us the truth, to make everything known."

The gods, dragons, and spirits, a countless array,
Their numbers like sands where the Ganges does sway,
And Bodhisattvas, the Buddha Way seek,
Eighty thousand of them, humble and meek.

As well as the kings of a million bright spheres,
Have come to this gathering, calming all fears.
With palms joined and hearts filled with deepest respect,
They wish to hear all of the path, quite complete.
At that time, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: “Stop, stop, there is no need to speak further. If I were to explain this matter, all the gods and people in the world would be shocked and full of doubt.”
Śāriputra again said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, please speak, please speak. Why? The immeasurable, hundreds of thousands of millions of asaṃkhyeya sentient beings in this assembly have previously seen Buddhas. Their faculties are sharp and their wisdom is clear. When they hear what the Buddha says, they will be able to believe it with reverence.”
At that time, Śāriputra, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
The King of Dharma, the Supreme Honored One,
Please speak, do not worry, your wisdom will stun.
For countless beings in this assembly so vast,
Will believe with reverence, their faith holding fast.
The Buddha again stopped Śāriputra: “If I were to explain this matter, all the gods, humans, and asuras in the world would be shocked and full of doubt. The arrogant monks will fall into a great abyss.”
At that time, the World-Honored One again spoke in verse:
Stop, stop, no more words need be said.
My Dharma is subtle, hard to embed.
The arrogant ones, with their haughty pride,
Will surely not believe, with reverence inside.
At that time, Śāriputra again said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, please speak, please speak. In this assembly, there are hundreds of thousands of millions like us, who from lifetime to lifetime have been converted by the Buddha. Such people will certainly be able to believe with reverence. For a long night, they will be at peace and receive great benefit.”
At that time, Śāriputra, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Please preach the Dharma, across the land.
I am the Buddha’s eldest son,
Explain and clarify, when you are done.

In this great gathering, vast and wide,
Are countless beings, with faith inside.
The Buddha has, through lives untold,
Converted these souls, brave and bold.

With single minds, their palms they press,
Awaiting words, the Buddha’s address.
For this assembly, we twelve hundred here,
And seekers of the Way, drawing near,
Please condescend to make it clear.

When these good people hear this lore,
Great joy will fill them, to their core.
At that time, the World-Honored One said to Śāriputra: “Since you have earnestly requested three times, how can I not speak? You should now listen carefully and contemplate it well. I will explain and differentiate it for you.”
When he said this, five thousand people in the assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—immediately rose from their seats, paid reverence to the Buddha, and withdrew. Why? Because these people had deep roots of transgression and were arrogant, claiming to have attained what they had not yet attained, and to have realized what they had not yet realized. Having such faults, they did not stay. The World-Honored One remained silent and did not stop them.
At that time, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: “This assembly of mine is no longer filled with twigs and leaves; only the pure, true fruit remains. Śāriputra, it is good that these arrogant people have withdrawn. You should now listen well, for I will speak to you.”
Śāriputra said: “Yes, World-Honored One, we joyfully wish to hear.”
The Buddha said to Śāriputra:
“Such a wonderful Dharma as this is preached by the Buddhas only from time to time, just as the udumbara flower appears only once in a while. Śāriputra, you should believe what the Buddha says, for his words are not empty falsehoods. Śāriputra, the Buddhas preach the Dharma according to what is appropriate, but their intent is difficult to grasp. Why? Because I use countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas. This Dharma cannot be understood by thinking and distinguishing. Only the Buddhas can know it. Why? Because the World-Honored Buddhas appear in the world for only One Great Purpose.
Śāriputra, what is meant by the World-Honored Buddhas appearing in the world for only One Great Purpose? The World-Honored Buddhas appear in the world to enable sentient beings to open the Buddha's wisdom and insight, so they may become pure. They appear in the world to show sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom and insight. They appear in the world to cause sentient beings to awaken to the Buddha's wisdom and insight. They appear in the world to enable sentient beings to enter into the path of the Buddha's wisdom and insight. Śāriputra, this is what is meant by the Buddhas appearing in the world for One Great Purpose.”
The Buddha said to Śāriputra: “The Tathagatas only teach and convert Bodhisattvas. Everything they do is for a single matter: to show and awaken sentient beings to the Buddha's wisdom and insight. Śāriputra, the Tathagata preaches the Dharma for sentient beings by using only the One Buddha Vehicle; there is no other vehicle, whether two or three. Śāriputra, the Dharma of all the Buddhas in the ten directions is also like this.”
“Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the past used immeasurable, countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas for sentient beings. This Dharma was all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. When these sentient beings heard the Dharma from the Buddhas, they all ultimately attained All-Knowing Wisdom. Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the future who will appear in the world will also use immeasurable, countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas for sentient beings. This Dharma will all be for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. When these sentient beings hear the Dharma from the Buddhas, they will all ultimately attain All-Knowing Wisdom. Śāriputra, the World-Honored Buddhas in the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddha lands in the ten directions today, who bring great benefit and peace to sentient beings, these Buddhas also use immeasurable, countless expedient means, various causes, parables, and words to expound all Dharmas for sentient beings. This Dharma is all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. When these sentient beings hear the Dharma from the Buddhas, they all ultimately attain All-Knowing Wisdom. Śāriputra, these Buddhas only teach and convert Bodhisattvas, wishing to show sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom and insight, wishing to awaken sentient beings to the Buddha's wisdom and insight, and wishing to enable sentient beings to enter the Buddha's wisdom and insight. Śāriputra, I am also the same now. I know the various desires of all sentient beings, their deep attachments, and their original nature. I use various causes, parables, and words, and the power of expedient means, to preach the Dharma for them. Śāriputra, all of this is for them to attain the One Buddha Vehicle and All-Knowing Wisdom.”
“Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions, there are not even two vehicles, let alone three. Śāriputra, the Buddhas appear in the five turbid and evil ages: the turbidity of the kalpa, the turbidity of defilements, the turbidity of sentient beings, the turbidity of views, and the turbidity of life. Thus, Śāriputra, during the chaos of the kalpa turbidity, sentient beings are heavily polluted, possess avarice and jealousy, and are filled with unwholesome roots. For this reason, the Buddhas use the power of expedient means to differentiate the One Buddha Vehicle and speak of three. Śāriputra, if my disciples call themselves arhats or pratyekabuddhas, and do not hear or know that the Tathagatas only teach and convert Bodhisattvas, these are not my disciples; they are not arhats, and they are not pratyekabuddhas.”
“Furthermore, Śāriputra, if these monks and nuns claim that they have already attained arhatship, that this is their last body, and that they have reached ultimate nirvāṇa, and they no longer strive to seek Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, you should know that all these people are arrogant. Why? If a monk truly attains arhatship and does not believe in this Dharma, there is no such thing. This is with the exception of after the Buddha’s passing, when there is no Buddha present. Why? After the Buddha’s passing, those who can uphold, read, recite, and comprehend the meaning of these kinds of sutras are rare. If they were to encounter another Buddha, they would immediately become clear about this Dharma. Śāriputra, you must believe, understand, receive, and uphold the words of the Buddha with a single mind. The words of the Tathagatas are not empty falsehoods. There is no other vehicle, only the One Buddha Vehicle.”
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
The monks and nuns with arrogant pride,
The laymen too, with much to hide,
And laywomen who do not believe—
Such four groups, their faults they conceive
Not in themselves, a number grand,
Five thousand strong, across the land.
Their precepts have holes, their leaks run free,
Their flaws they guard with careful glee.
These small-minded ones, they've gone away,
The chaff of the assembly, on that day,
Left by the Buddha's majesty's might,
With little merit, dim their light.
Unworthy they, this Dharma to find,
This gathering now, no twigs to bind,
Only true fruit remains, a pure delight.
Śāriputra, listen with all your might,
To Dharma the Buddhas attained, shining bright.
With expedient means and power untold,
For sentient beings, their truths unfold.
The thoughts in hearts, the paths they pursue,
Desires diverse, and natures new,
Good karma, evil, from lives of the past,
The Buddha knows all, from first to last.
He uses causes, parables, and words,
The power of expedient means, like singing birds,
To make all joyful, free from all strife,
He may speak sūtra, gāthā, and stories of life,
Of past events, and jātaka so grand,
Unprecedented events, throughout the land.
He speaks of causes and conditions, true,
And parables, and geya, and upadeśa too.
For those with dull minds, who small Dharma embrace,
Attached to life's cycle, in this fleeting space,
Who shun the profound, the subtle, and deep,
Of Buddhas immeasurable, while they sleep,
Troubled and confused by suffering's hold,
For these, nirvana's story is told.
This expedient means, I did set it so,
That Buddha's wisdom, they might come to know.
I never said that you all would attain,
Buddhahood's glory, again and again.
The reason I kept silent, you see,
The time had not yet arrived, for thee.
But now is the moment, perfect and clear,
To preach the Great Vehicle, banishing fear.
My ninefold teachings, a sacred art,
Are preached for all beings, from the very start.
But entering the Great Vehicle, the foundation laid,
Which is why this sūtra is now displayed.

There are Buddha's sons, with minds so pure,
Gentle and sharp, their wisdom secure.
Under Buddhas countless, they've trod the way,
Profound and subtle, through night and day.
For these sons of the Buddha, I preach this lore,
This Great Vehicle sūtra, and much, much more.
I give them a prophecy, clear and bold,
That Buddhas they'll be, in ages of old,
Because of deep thought for the Buddha's grace,
And pure precepts cultivated, in every place.
These people, hearing they'll Buddhahood gain,
Are filled with great joy, easing all pain.
The Buddha knows their mental state, so deep,
And preaches the Great Vehicle, while they sleep
If a śrāvaka or Bodhisattva, with keen ear,
Hears the Dharma I preach, banishing fear,
Even a single verse, a profound decree,
They will all certainly Buddhas be.
In Buddha lands of the ten directions wide,
Only the Dharma of One Vehicle can ride.
Not two, nor three, save when the Buddha guides,
Through expedient means, where wisdom hides.
He uses temporary names, a guiding light,
To help sentient beings, with all their might,
To understand the Buddha's wisdom, so grand.
The Buddhas appear for this truth in the land,
For this one true matter, the others aren't real.
The Small Vehicle, I'll never reveal,
To save sentient beings, with its limited scope,
The Buddha himself in the Great Vehicle will cope.
The Dharma he's gained, a magnificent prize,
Adorned with meditation and wisdom's wise eyes,
With this, he saves beings, from suffering's chain,
He's realized the supreme Way, again and again,
The Great Vehicle, Dharma of equality's might.
If I converted just one, with the Small Vehicle's light,
I'd fall into avarice, a terrible plight,
This is something that could not be, by day or by night.
If a person believes and in Buddha takes refuge,
The Tathagata won't deceive them, a sacred deluge,
Nor has he intent of avarice or jealousy's sting,
He cuts off all evil, like a bird on the wing.
Thus, the Buddha in ten directions, so bold,
Is uniquely without fear, stories untold.
I've adorned my body with marks, a radiant gleam,
My light illuminates the world, like a beautiful dream.
Revered by immeasurable beings, far and near,
I preach for them the seal of true nature, so clear.
Śāriputra, know this, my vow from the start,
To cause all beings to be no different from my heart.
Just as I vowed in the past, a sacred decree,
It is now fulfilled, for all to see.
I've converted all beings, with wisdom and grace,
And caused them all to enter the Buddha Way's space.
If I were to meet a being, with a mind so dense,
And teach them only the Buddha Way, without defense,
The ignorant would be confused, deluded and slow,
They wouldn't accept the teaching, they wouldn't know.
I know that these beings, roots of goodness not sown,
Are attached to five desires, like seeds overgrown,
By foolish love blinded, afflicted they are,
Because of their desires, they fall from afar,
Into three evil destinies, a sorrowful plight,
And wander in six realms, enduring all night,
The bitter sufferings, a continuous dread.
They receive a subtle form in the womb, it is said,
From lifetime to lifetime, it always will grow,
With little virtue and merit, a sorrowful show,
Tormented by many sufferings, a ceaseless refrain.
They enter thickets of wrong views, again and again,
Like 'existence' or 'non-existence', a tangled embrace.
Relying on these views, in this fleeting space,
They're complete in sixty-two views, a complex design.
Deeply attached to false dharmas, they intertwine,
Firmly holding on, unable to release,
For thousands of millions of kalpas, without peace,
They don't hear the Buddha's name, a distant sound,
Nor the true Dharma, on hallowed ground.
Such people are difficult to save, it is true.
Therefore, Śāriputra, expedient means I now use for you,
Preaching the path to the end of all pain,
And showing them nirvana, again and again.
Although I preach nirvana, a peaceful art,
This is also not true extinction, from the very start.
All phenomena, from their very first breath,
Have always been still and extinct, even in death.
When a son of the Buddha has practiced the way,
He will become a Buddha in a future day.
I have the power of expedient means, so grand,
And so I reveal the Dharma of three vehicles, across the land.
All World-Honored Ones, with voices clear,
Preach the path of the One Vehicle, banishing fear.
Now, all of you in this assembly so vast,
Should remove all your doubts, let them not last.
The words of the Buddhas are not different, you see,
There is only one, not a second vehicle, for thee.

In countless kalpas, in ages long past,
Immeasurable Buddhas, their number so vast,
Hundreds of thousands of millions of kinds,
Their number incalculable, through all human minds.
These World-Honored Ones, with causes diverse,
And parables, and the power of means to immerse,
Countless expedient means, a wondrous array,
Expounded the nature of all Dharmas, each day.
These World-Honored Ones, with wisdom so deep,
All preached the One Vehicle Dharma, while others would sleep,
Converting immeasurable beings, a guiding light,
And enabling them to enter the Buddha Way, with all their might.
And the great holy masters, with hearts so kind,
Who know the deepest wishes, in every mind,
Of all sentient beings in the world, so wide,
The gods, humans, and creatures, where they reside.
Use different expedient means, a skillful design,
To assist in revealing the ultimate truth, so divine.
If there are any sentient beings, with hearts so true,
Who meet a past Buddha, and their teachings pursue,
If they hear the Dharma, and practice giving's art,
Or uphold the precepts, with a pure and kind heart,
Patience, diligence, meditation's deep grace,
Or wisdom, cultivating blessings, in every place,
These people, with spirits so bright,
Have all already attained the Buddha Way's light.
When the Buddhas have passed away, and their presence is gone,
If a person has a soft and good heart, like the dawn,
These sentient beings, with minds so keen,
Have all already attained the Buddha Way, it would seem.
When the Buddhas have passed away, a sorrowful tear,
If one makes offerings to their relics, holding them dear,
And builds hundreds of millions of stupas, so grand,
Of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, throughout the land,
Tridacna, agate, rose quartz, or crystal beads bright,
And they are purely and widely adorned, a beautiful sight,
Decorating the stupas, with artistic grace.
Or if someone builds stone temples, in a hallowed place,
Or those of sandalwood or agarwood, so sweet,
Or of wood and other materials, at their feet,
Or of brick, tile, and mud, a humble display.
If one is in a wilderness, on a lonely way,
And piles up soil to make a Buddha temple, so small,
Even a child at play, answering truth's call,
Piling up sand to make a Buddha stupa, with glee,
These people, with spirits so joyful and free,
Have all already attained the Buddha Way, you see.
If a person, for the Buddha's sake, with devotion so true,
Erects any kind of image, for all to view,
Carving and sculpting it into a form, so fine,
They have all already attained the Buddha Way divine.
Or if it is made of the seven treasures, a wondrous art,
Of tin, red and white copper, from the very start,
Of white lead and tin, or of iron so strong,
Wood, and mud, where these materials belong,
Or if it is adorned with glue and lacquer, with care,
And made into a Buddha image, beyond compare,
These people, with hearts so pure and so bright,
Have all already attained the Buddha Way's light.
If one uses paint to make a Buddha image, so grand,
With the marks of a hundred blessings, across the land,
Whether they do it themselves or have others do it, so clear,
They have all already attained the Buddha Way, banishing fear.
Even a child at play, with innocent grace,
Who uses grass, wood, or a pen, in this hallowed space,
Or even a fingernail, with a tender touch,
To draw a Buddha image, meaning so much,
These people, gradually accumulate merit's bright glow,
And, becoming complete in great compassion, will know,
They have all already attained the Buddha Way, so grand.
The Buddhas only convert Bodhisattvas, throughout the land,
To save immeasurable beings, from suffering's chain.
If a person at a stupa or temple, again and again,
Or before a jeweled or painted image, so bright,
With flowers, incense, banners, and canopies of light,
Makes a respectful offering, with a heart full of praise.
Or if they have someone play music, through all their days,
Beating drums, blowing conches, a joyful sound,
Or playing flutes, zithers, harps, on hallowed ground,
Lutes, gongs, and cymbals, a melodic embrace,
Such wonderful sounds, filling every space,
All of them held as offerings, with love and with grace.
Or if they sing and praise the Buddha’s virtues, so clear,
With a joyful heart, banishing all fear,
Even with a single small sound, so soft and so low,
They have all already attained the Buddha Way, you know.
If a person, with a distracted mind, without a care,
Offers even a single flower, beyond compare,
To a painted image, with a fleeting thought,
They will gradually see countless Buddhas, bravely fought.
Or if a person bows down, with reverence deep,
Or simply joins their palms, while others sleep,
Or even raises one hand, a simple sign,
Or slightly bows their head, with a touch divine,
And makes this offering to the image, so grand,
They will gradually see immeasurable Buddhas, throughout the land,
And they will attain the supreme Way themselves, so bright,
Widely saving countless beings, with all their might,
And entering unconditioned nirvana, with peaceful release,
Like a fire that goes out when the firewood's at peace.
If a person with a distracted mind, and no more to say,
Enters a stupa or temple, on a sacred way,
And says, “Namo Buddhāya” once, a whispered plea,
They have all already attained the Buddha Way, for all to see.
Of the Buddhas of the past, with their wisdom so vast,
Whether they were in the world or had passed,
If a person heard this Dharma, a truth to embrace,
They have all already attained the Buddha Way, in this hallowed space.
The World-Honored Ones of the future, a countless array,
Whose number is immeasurable, for a future day,
These Tathagatas, with wisdom and grace,
Will also preach the Dharma with expedient means, in every place.
All the Tathagatas, with power so grand,
Use immeasurable expedient means, throughout the land,
To save all sentient beings, from suffering's chain,
And enable them to enter the unconditioned wisdom, again and again.
If one hears this Dharma, with an open heart,
There is not a single one who will not become a Buddha, from the start.
The original vow of the Buddhas is, with solemn decree:
“The Buddha Way that I practice, for all to be,
I wish for all sentient beings, with hearts so pure,
To also attain this same Way, forever secure.”
The future Buddhas, with their wisdom so deep,
Although they will speak of hundreds of thousands, while others sleep,
And millions and countless Dharma gates, a wondrous display,
The truth is for the One Vehicle, lighting the way.
The Buddhas, the Double-Footed Honored Ones, so wise,
Know that all phenomena are always without a fixed nature, before their eyes.
The Buddha seed arises from conditions, a truth to embrace,
And for this reason, they preach the One Vehicle, in every space.
This Dharma dwells in its rightful position, so clear,
And the forms of the world are in a constant state, banishing fear.
Having known this at the place of enlightenment, so bright,
The guide teaches with expedient means, with all their might.
The present Buddhas in the ten directions, so grand,
Who are worshipped by gods and humans, throughout the land,
Their number is like the sands of the Ganges, a countless array,
They appear in the world, at the dawn of each day,
To bring peace and comfort to sentient beings, with grace,
And they also preach this same Dharma, in every place.
They know the first stillness and extinction, a truth to embrace,
But with the power of expedient means, in this hallowed space,
Although they show various paths, with wisdom so deep,
The truth is for the Buddha Vehicle, while others sleep.
They know the various practices of sentient beings, so vast,
The deepest thoughts of their hearts, designed to last,
The karma they have cultivated in the past, so true,
Their desires and diligence, for me and for you,
And the sharpness or dullness of their faculties, so clear.
With various causes, banishing all fear,
Parables, and words, they preach with such grace,
With appropriate expedient means, in every place.
I am also the same now, with a heart so kind,
For the sake of bringing peace to sentient beings, I find,
I use various Dharma gates, with wisdom so deep,
To reveal the Buddha Way, while others sleep.
With the power of my wisdom, so clear and so bright,
I know the nature and desires of sentient beings, with all my might,
And preach the various Dharmas with expedient means, so grand,
To make them all joyful, throughout the land.
Śāriputra, you should know, with my Buddha eye, I see,
The sentient beings of the six realms, for all to be,
They are poor and without blessings and wisdom, a sorrowful plight,
They enter the dangerous road of life and death, with all their might,
And their suffering is continuous and never-ending, so sad.
They are deeply attached to the five desires, making them mad,
Like a yak that loves its tail, a foolish embrace.
By its greedy love, it blinds itself, in this fleeting space,
And is unable to see, with eyes so dim.
They do not seek a powerful Buddha, or a sacred hymn,
Or the Dharma that cuts off suffering, from its very start.
They deeply enter into all wrong views, with a heavy heart.
With suffering, they wish to abandon suffering's pain.
For the sake of these sentient beings, again and again,
I give rise to great compassion, a love so grand.
When I first sat at the place of enlightenment, throughout the land,
I contemplated beneath the tree and also walked, so slow,
For twenty-one days, I thought about this, you know:
"The wisdom I have attained, is subtle and bright,
The very first, shining with all its light.
The faculties of sentient beings are dull, it is true,
They are attached to pleasure and blinded by ignorance, too.
How can these types of beings, so lost and so blind,
Be saved?" I pondered, with a thoughtful mind.
At that time, the Brahma Kings, with reverence deep,
The Heavenly Ruler Śakra, while others would sleep,
The Four Heavenly Kings who guard the world, so grand,
And the Great Lord of the Heavens, throughout the land,
And the rest of the heavenly assembly, a countless array,
Their followers numbering hundreds of thousands, each day,
And millions, respectfully joined their palms, so clear,
And bowed, and asked me to turn the Dharma wheel, banishing fear.
I then thought to myself, with a heavy heart,
"If I only praise the Buddha Vehicle, from the very start,
Sentient beings who are sunk in suffering's deep pain,
Will not be able to believe in this Dharma, again and again.
Because they will not believe and will reject the Dharma, so sad,
They will fall into the three evil destinies, making them mad.
It would be better for me not to preach the Dharma, so clear,
And to quickly enter nirvana," banishing all fear.
I then remembered the Buddhas of the past, with their grace,
And their power of expedient means, in every place.
"The Way that I have now attained, so bright and so free,
I should also preach the three vehicles, for all to see."
When I was thinking this, with a thoughtful mind,
The Buddhas of the ten directions all appeared, so kind.
They comforted me with the sound of Brahma, so clear:
"Well done, Śākyamuni, banishing all fear,
The first of all guides, with wisdom so deep!
You have attained this supreme Dharma, while others sleep.
You also should, like all Buddhas, with grace,
Use the power of expedient means, in every place.
We have all attained the most subtle and foremost Dharma, so bright,
But for the sake of all sentient beings, with all our might,
We differentiate and preach the three vehicles, so grand.
Those with little wisdom delight in the small Dharma, throughout the land,
And do not believe that they can become Buddhas, it is true.
Therefore, with expedient means, for me and for you,
We differentiate and preach the various fruits, so clear.
Although we preach the three vehicles, banishing all fear,
It is only to teach the Bodhisattvas," they said with grace.
Śāriputra, you should know that I heard, in this hallowed space,
The profound and subtle sound of the holy lions, so grand,
And I joyfully said, "Namo Buddhāya!" throughout the land.
I then thought this: "I have come to this turbid and evil age.
What the Buddhas have said, I will also follow and engage,
And practice." Having contemplated this matter, with a thoughtful mind,
I immediately went to Benares, for all to find.
The true nature of all phenomena is still and extinct, it is true,
And cannot be expressed in words, for me and for you.
With the power of expedient means, for them I did preach,
For the five monks, within my reach.
This is called the turning of the Dharma wheel, so grand,
And so there was the sound of nirvana, throughout the land,
And also the distinct names of the arhat, so clear,
And the Dharma and the Sangha, banishing all fear.
From ancient kalpas ago, with wisdom so deep,
I have praised this Dharma of nirvana, while others sleep,
Where the suffering of life and death is completely ended, so bright.
I have always preached in this way, with all my might.
Śāriputra, you should know, I see the sons of the Buddha, so grand,
Those who aspire to the Buddha Way, throughout the land,
Immeasurable millions of them, with hearts so pure,
With respectful hearts, they all come, to the Buddha’s place, secure.
They have previously heard from the Buddhas, with wisdom so deep,
The Dharma that was preached with expedient means, while others sleep.
I then thought: "The reason the Tathagatas appear, it is true,
Is to preach the Buddha’s wisdom, for me and for you.
Now is exactly the time," so clear and so bright.
Śāriputra, you should know that those with dull faculties, with all their might,
And little wisdom, who are attached to forms, and are arrogant, so sad,
Cannot believe in this Dharma, making them mad.
Now, I am joyful and without fear, with a heart so kind,
And in the midst of the Bodhisattvas, for all to find,
I will honestly abandon expedient means, with grace,
And preach only the supreme Way, in this hallowed space.
The Bodhisattvas who hear this Dharma, so clear,
Have already removed all their nets of doubt, banishing all fear.
The twelve hundred arhats, with wisdom so deep,
Will all also become Buddhas, while others sleep.
Just like the style of preaching, so grand,
Of the Buddhas of the three periods, throughout the land,
I am now also like this, with wisdom so bright,
Preaching the undifferentiated Dharma, with all my might.
The appearance of the Buddhas in the world, so rare,
Is very far away and difficult to meet, beyond compare.
Even if they do appear in the world, it is true,
This Dharma is even more difficult to preach, for me and for you.
For immeasurable and countless kalpas, a long, long span,
It is also difficult to hear this Dharma, throughout the land.
And the person who can hear this Dharma, so clear,
Is also very difficult to find, banishing all fear.
It is like the udumbara flower, so rare and so bright,
Which everyone loves, shining with all its light,
Which is rare for gods and humans, it is true,
And appears only once in a while, for me and for you.
Those who hear the Dharma and praise it with joy, so clear,
Even if they utter a single word, banishing all fear,
Are as if they have already made an offering, so grand,
To all the Buddhas of the three periods, throughout the land.
This person is extremely rare, it is true,
More so than the udumbara flower, for me and for you.
You must not have any doubt, with a heart so pure.
I am the King of all Dharmas, forever secure,
And I universally tell all in the great assembly, so grand,
That I only teach and convert the Bodhisattvas, throughout the land,
With the One Vehicle path, so clear and so bright.
There are no śrāvaka disciples, with all their might.
You, Śāriputra, with wisdom so deep,
The śrāvakas and Bodhisattvas, while others sleep,
Should know that this wonderful Dharma, so grand,
Is the secret key of all Buddhas, throughout the land.
In the five turbid and evil ages, with suffering and pain,
Sentient beings only delight in attachment to desires, again and again.
Such kinds of sentient beings, so lost and so blind,
Will ultimately not seek the Buddha Way, for all to find.
The evil people of the coming age, with hearts so cold,
Who hear the Buddha preach the One Vehicle, a story untold,
Will be deluded and will not believe or accept it, so sad,
They will reject the Dharma and fall into evil destinies, making them mad.
For those who have shame and are pure, with a heart so kind,
And aspire to the Buddha Way, for all to find,
For such people, I will widely praise the One Vehicle path, so clear.
Śāriputra, you should know that the Dharma of the Buddhas, banishing all fear,
Is like this. With millions of expedient means, so grand,
They preach the Dharma according to what is appropriate, throughout the land.
Those who are not familiar with the practices, with wisdom so dim,
Are unable to understand this, a sorrowful hymn.
Since you all have now known that the Buddhas are the teachers of the world,
And that these are all matters of expedient means, a story untold,
There will be no more doubts, with hearts so pure.
Your hearts will be filled with great joy, forever secure,
And you will know that you will become Buddhas, with light so bright.

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Volume Two
Translated by Tripitaka Master Kumarajiva of the Kucha Kingdom in the Later Qin Dynasty, by imperial decree.

Chapter 3: A Parable
At that time, Śāriputra was filled with immense joy. He rose, joined his palms, and, looking up at the World-Honored One’s revered face, said to the Buddha: “Having heard this Dharma sound from the World-Honored One today, my heart is filled with unprecedented joy. Why? In the past, when I heard this Dharma from the Buddha and saw the Bodhisattvas receiving prophecies of their future Buddhahood, I was not included in this, and I felt great sadness, as if I had lost the Tathagata’s immeasurable wisdom and insight.
World-Honored One, I often stayed alone in the mountains, forests, or under trees, whether sitting or walking. I would always think: ‘We have entered the same Dharma nature. Why has the Tathagata saved us with the Small Vehicle Dharma?’ This was our own fault, not the World-Honored One’s. Why? If we had waited for the reason to be revealed and then cultivated to attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, we would have certainly been saved by the Great Vehicle. But we did not understand the Buddha’s expedient means and his teachings according to our capacity. When we first heard the Dharma, we met it, believed in it, and sought to realize it with our minds. World-Honored One, since that time, I have constantly reproached myself, day and night.
But today, from the Buddha, I have heard a Dharma I have never heard before, an unprecedented Dharma, which has cut off all my doubts and regrets. My body and mind are at ease and have found true peace. Today I know that I am truly a son of the Buddha, born from the Buddha’s mouth, transformed by the Dharma, and a sharer in the Buddha’s Dharma.”
At that time, Śāriputra, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
The Dharma's sound, a truth profound,
A treasure gained, where none was found.
My heart now leaps with purest glee,
From doubt's dark net, completely free.
Once taught by Buddha, wisdom deep,
The Great Vehicle, I did not keep.
His voice, so rare, a gentle plea,
From sentient beings, sets burdens free.

My stains are gone, my worries cease,
Upon hearing this, I found release.
In mountain vale, or forest tree,
Whether sitting, or walking free,

I pondered always, this deep thought,
"Alas, myself, how have I fought?
How have I fooled my very soul?"
We're Buddha's sons, to make us whole.

Entered the Dharma, unconditioned, vast,
Yet in the future, could not cast
The supreme Way, for all to hear,
With golden marks, dispelling fear.

The thirty-two, the powers ten,
Liberations for all women and men.
In the same Dharma, we all abide,
Yet this deep truth, we could not guide.

The eighty marks, so subtle, fine,
Eighteen unique, a sacred sign—
All these great merits, I believed,
Were lost to me, and I was grieved.

Walking alone, in quiet grace,
I saw the Buddha, in that space.
His fame did fill the ten directions wide,
Bringing benefit, on every tide.

I thought such gain, I had let fall,
Deceiving truly, beyond recall.
Day and night, I yearned to know,
"Have I lost it, or will it grow?"

I saw the Buddha, day and night,
Praising Bodhisattvas, with all his might.
For this, my thoughts did always turn,
This sacred matter, I sought to learn.

Now hear the Buddha's voice so clear,
The Dharma preached, banishing fear.
Unconditioned, past what mind can trace,
Leading the assembly to wisdom's place.

Once caught in views, a Brahmin guide,
The World-Honored One, my heart inside,
He knew my errors, pulled them free,
And preached nirvana's mystery.

My wrong views gone, no longer bound,
Emptiness' Dharma, I truly found.
At that time, I thought, with deep content,
That final ending, I had sent.

But now I know, with clearer sight,
It was not true extinction's light.
Only when Buddha, I become,
With marks thirty-two, a future sum,

Revered by gods, by humans too,
By yakshas, dragons, spirits new,
Only then can I truly say,
All suffering's ended, come what may.

The Buddha spoke, in assembly grand,
That I'd become Buddha, in this land.
Hearing this Dharma's sacred sound,
All doubts and regrets, no more are found.

When first I heard, what Buddha said,
My heart was shocked, with doubt instead.
"Has a demon come, in Buddha's guise," I thought,
"To trouble my mind, a battle fought?"

The Buddha uses causes, diverse and deep,
With parables, and words to keep
The mind at peace, like ocean wide,
My net of doubt, was cast aside.

The Buddha said, in ages past,
Countless Buddhas, their die was cast.
All dwelled in means, with skillful art,
And preached this Dharma, from the heart.

The Buddhas present, and those to come,
Their number vast, beyond all sum,
Will also use, with skillful hand,
To expound this Dharma, throughout the land.

Just like the Honored One, today,
From birth and leaving, on his way,
To gaining Way, and turning wheel,
He preaches means, for us to feel.

The Honored One, the true Way shows,
Māra would not, as everyone knows.
Because of this, I'm truly sure,
No demon's acting, to obscure.

In doubt's dark net, I once was caught,
And Māra's doing, then I thought.
But hearing Buddha's gentle voice,
Profound, subtle, making me rejoice.

His wide, clear preaching, pure and bright,
My heart is filled with great delight.
My doubts and regrets, forever cease,
In true wisdom, I find my peace.

A Buddha I'll be, beyond all fear,
Revered by gods and humans here,
Turning the wheel, supreme and grand,
To teach Bodhisattvas, throughout the land.
At that time, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: “I now declare in the great assembly of gods, humans, śramaṇas, and brahmins that I once, for the sake of the supreme Way, taught and converted you under two hundred thousand millions of Buddhas. You have also followed me and received my teachings for a long night of existence. I used expedient means to guide you, which is why you were born into my Dharma. Śāriputra, in the past, I taught you to aspire to the Buddha Way, but you have now forgotten it completely and instead thought you had attained extinction. I now wish to make you recall your original vow and the path you have traveled. Therefore, I am preaching this Great Vehicle sutra for the śrāvakas, named the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a Dharma for Bodhisattvas protected and remembered by the Buddhas.”
“Śāriputra, in a future lifetime, after immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable kalpas, you will make offerings to a great many millions of Buddhas, uphold the true Dharma, and completely practice the path of a Bodhisattva. You will then attain Buddhahood with the title Flower Light Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land will be named Stainless, and that land will be level, pure, and beautifully adorned, peaceful, prosperous, and teeming with gods and humans. Its ground will be of lapis lazuli, with eight intersecting roads, and golden ropes will line their sides. Beside them, there will be rows of trees of seven treasures, always bearing flowers and fruits. Flower Light Tathagata will also use the three vehicles to teach and convert sentient beings.”
“Śāriputra, when that Buddha appears, although it will not be in an evil age, he will, due to his original vow, preach the Dharma of the three vehicles. That kalpa will be named Great Jewel Adornment. Why is it named Great Jewel Adornment? Because in that land, the Bodhisattvas are the great jewels. Those Bodhisattvas will be immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable, beyond the reach of calculation and parables. Only the power of a Buddha’s wisdom can know them. When they wish to walk, precious flowers will support their feet. These Bodhisattvas will not have just begun to conceive the mind. They will have planted roots of virtue long ago, cultivated pure conduct under immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, and always received praise from the Buddhas. They will constantly cultivate the Buddha’s wisdom, be complete in great supernatural powers, and be skilled in knowing the gateways to all Dharmas. They will be simple and honest, without falseness, and their resolve will be firm. Such Bodhisattvas will fill that land.”
“Śāriputra, the life span of Flower Light Buddha will be twelve minor kalpas, not including the time before he was a prince and had not yet become a Buddha. The people in his land will live for eight minor kalpas. After Flower Light Tathagata has been in the world for twelve minor kalpas, he will give a prophecy to the Bodhisattva Firm-Fullness for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. He will tell the monks: ‘This Firm-Fullness Bodhisattva will next become a Buddha, with the title Flower-Foot Peaceful-Practice Tathagata, Arhat, Samyaksambuddha, and his Buddha land will also be like this.’ Śāriputra, after the passing of this Flower Light Buddha, his True Dharma will last for thirty-two minor kalpas, and his Dharma-Image will also last for thirty-two minor kalpas.”
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Śāriputra, hear my word,
In a future life, a truth inferred.
A Buddha you shall then become,
Of All Wisdom, the Honored One.
Flower Light your title, bright and clear,
Immeasurable beings, you'll hold so dear.
To countless Buddhas, offerings made,
Bodhisattva practices, fully arrayed.
With ten great powers, and merits grand,
The supreme Way, you'll understand.
After kalpas, beyond all count,
Great Jewel Adornment, the time will mount.
Stainless the world, in purity it lies,
Without blemish, before all eyes.
Lapis lazuli, the ground so deep,
Golden ropes, the pathways keep.
Of seven treasures, trees brightly gleam,
Always bearing flowers, a lovely dream.
The Bodhisattvas, in that fair land,
Firm resolve and steady hand.
Supernatural powers, perfected quite,
All fully complete, a wondrous sight.
The Bodhisattva Way, superbly learned,
Under countless Buddhas, lessons earned.
Such great beings, pure and true,
By Flower Light Buddha, converted anew.
When the Buddha was a prince, so bold,
His country and honor, he let unfold.
In his very last body, free from strife,
Renounced his home, and found new life.
The Flower Light Buddha, in the world will stay,
For twelve minor kalpas, come what may.
The people of his land, with spirits bright,
Will live for eight minor kalpas, bathed in light.
After the Buddha passes, as all things do,
The True Dharma remains, steadfast and true.
For thirty-two minor kalpas, it will reside,
Widely saving beings, with naught to hide.
When the True Dharma completely fades,
The Dharma-Image lasts, through future decades.
His relics widely distributed, far and wide,
From gods and humans, offerings to abide.
What the Flower Light Buddha will decree,
Is all like this, for all to see.
He, the holy and Double-Footed Honored One,
Most supreme and equal to none.
He is you, no doubt, no fear,
Be delighted, congratulate yourself, my dear.
At that time, the four groups of the assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen, along with the gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, and mahoragas—seeing Śāriputra receive the prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi directly from the Buddha, were filled with great joy and unbounded delight. They each took off their upper garments to offer them to the Buddha. Śakra, the King of the Devas, the Brahma King, and others, along with countless heavenly beings, also offered wonderful heavenly robes and heavenly maṇḍārava and mahāmaṇḍārava flowers to the Buddha. The heavenly robes they scattered remained in the air and turned by themselves. The heavenly music, of hundreds of thousands of kinds, played all at once in the air, raining down all the heavenly flowers. They said: “The Buddha first turned the Dharma wheel in Benares, and today he turns the supreme and greatest Dharma wheel once more.”
At that time, the heavenly beings, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
In Benares of old, a truth did unfold,
The Dharma's great wheel, a story of old.
Of aggregates five, their rise and their fall,
The Dharma was preached, a message for all.
Now turns again, a wonder to see,
This supreme great wheel, for all to be free.
So subtle, profound, this truth we now hear,
But few can believe, and few hold it dear.
Though many a time, the Honored One spoke,
Such depth and such grace, we never awoke
To a Dharma so grand, so subtle and high,
We rejoice in its sound, as it fills up the sky.
Great Śāriputra, a prophecy won,
And we, too, shall follow, until we are one
With the Buddhas, most honored, supreme in all lands,
A Way inconceivable, held in our hands.
With skillfulest means, the Buddha does teach,
The merits we hold, within our soul's reach,
From this life and past, and the Buddha's own sight,
To the Buddha Way now, we dedicate all with our might.
At that time, Śāriputra said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, I am no longer in doubt, as I have received the prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi directly from the Buddha. But these twelve hundred Arhats who are free in mind, in the past they were still in the stage of learning. The Buddha always taught them, saying, ‘My Dharma can free you from birth, old age, sickness, and death and lead you to ultimate nirvana.’ These learners and non-learners also thought that by freeing themselves from the view of a self and the views of existence and non-existence, they had attained nirvana. But now, in the presence of the World-Honored One, they have heard what they have never heard before and are all in doubt. Please, World-Honored One, we ask that you explain the reason for this for the four groups of the assembly, so they may be freed from their doubts and regrets.”
At that time, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: “Did I not say before that the World-Honored Buddhas use various causes, parables, and words, and expedient means to preach the Dharma, all for the sake of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi? All these teachings were to convert Bodhisattvas. But Śāriputra, I will now use a parable to further clarify this meaning. For all wise people, a parable helps them to understand.”
The Parable of the Burning House
“Śāriputra, imagine a village or town where there is a great elder who is old and frail. He has boundless wealth, many fields, houses, and servants. His house is vast, but it has only one gate. It is home to many people—one hundred, two hundred, even five hundred—who live there. The halls and pavilions are old and decaying, the walls are collapsing, the pillars are rotten at their base, and the beams are dangerously leaning. All around, a great fire suddenly erupts, burning down the house. The elder’s children, whether ten, twenty, or thirty of them, are inside this house. The elder sees this great fire starting on all four sides and is greatly alarmed. He thinks: ‘Although I can escape through this one burning gate in safety, my children, who are inside this burning house, are attached to their games and do not feel or know the danger. They are not alarmed or frightened. The fire is coming closer to their bodies, and the pain is about to reach them, but their hearts do not feel loathing, and they have no intention of getting out.’”
“Śāriputra, the elder then thinks: ‘I am strong and capable, so I will take them out of the house in a basket or on a table.’ But then he thinks again: ‘This house has only one gate, and it is narrow and small. My children are young and ignorant. They are attached to their playthings and might fall and be burned by the fire. I must speak to them of the danger. This house is already on fire. They should quickly get out now, so they will not be burned and harmed by the fire.’ Having thought this, he told his children just as he had planned: ‘You must get out quickly!’ The father, out of compassion, used gentle words and parables to persuade them, but the children were attached to their games and would not believe him. They were not alarmed or afraid and had no intention of getting out. They also did not know what fire was, what the house was, or what a loss it would be. They just ran back and forth, playing, and only looked at their father.”
“At that time, the elder thought: ‘This house is now engulfed in a great fire. If I and my children do not get out now, we will surely be burned. I must now devise an expedient means to enable my children to escape this danger.’ The father knew that his children had various things they liked, all sorts of rare and curious toys, and that their hearts were surely attached to them. So he told them: ‘The various rare and wonderful playthings that you love are difficult to get. If you do not take them now, you will surely regret it later. All these different goat carts, deer carts, and ox carts are now outside the gate for you to play with. You should quickly come out of this burning house! Whatever you wish for, I will give it all to you.’”
“At that time, when the children heard their father speak of the precious toys, which suited their desires, their hearts were all filled with courage. They pushed and shoved each other, racing to get out of the burning house. At that moment, the elder saw that all his children had safely escaped. They were all sitting in the open, at the crossroad, with no more danger. Their minds were at ease, and they were filled with boundless joy. Then the children said to their father: ‘Father, you promised us the wonderful toys, the goat carts, the deer carts, and the ox carts. Please give them to us now.’”
“Śāriputra, what do you think? Was the elder being deceitful when he gave each of his children a single, magnificent, jeweled great cart?”
Śāriputra said: “No, World-Honored One. The elder’s only intention was to get his children out of the fire and save their lives. It was not a lie. Why? By saving their lives, they had already gained the most wonderful treasure. What is more, he used an expedient means to rescue them from the burning house. World-Honored One, even if that elder had not given them a single small cart, it would still not have been a lie. Why? The elder’s first thought was: ‘I will use an expedient means to get my children out.’ For this reason, there was no falsehood. How much more so, when the elder knew his own boundless wealth and, wishing to benefit his children, gave each of them a great cart.”
The Buddha said to Śāriputra: “Well said, well said. It is just as you have said. Śāriputra, the Tathagata is also like this. He is the father of all the world. He has completely extinguished all fear, decay, worries, and afflictions and has perfected immeasurable wisdom and insight, power, and fearlessness. He has great supernatural powers and the power of wisdom. He is complete in the perfection of expedient means and wisdom, and his great compassion is constant and tireless. He constantly seeks what is good to benefit all.
He is born into the decaying, burning house of the three realms to save sentient beings from the fire of birth, old age, sickness, and death, sorrow, grief, suffering, and affliction, ignorance, and the three poisons. He teaches and converts them so they may attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. He sees that all sentient beings are being burned by birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, grief, and suffering. They also receive various sufferings because of the five desires and the pursuit of wealth. Moreover, because of their greedy attachment and pursuit, they receive present sufferings and will later receive the sufferings of the hells, animal realms, and hungry ghosts. Or, if they are born in the heavens or among humans, they suffer from poverty, separation from loved ones, and the pain of meeting those they hate, and so on.
Sentient beings are sunk in these sufferings but are joyful and play games. They do not feel or know it; they are not alarmed or frightened. They do not feel loathing or seek liberation. They run back and forth in this burning house of the three realms. Although they encounter great suffering, they do not consider it a problem. Śāriputra, when the Buddha sees this, he thinks: ‘I am the father of sentient beings. I should pull them out of this suffering and danger and give them the joy of the Buddha’s boundless and immeasurable wisdom, so they may play happily.’”
“Śāriputra, the Tathagata also thinks: ‘If I were to abandon expedient means and use only my supernatural powers and the power of my wisdom to praise the Tathagata’s wisdom and insight, powers, and fearlessness for sentient beings, they would not be saved by this. Why? These sentient beings have not yet escaped birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, grief, and suffering and are being burned by the fire of the three realms. How could they comprehend the Buddha’s wisdom?’”
“Śāriputra, it is like that elder, who, although he had great physical strength, did not use it. Instead, he used earnest expedient means to rescue his children from the danger of the burning house and then gave each of them a great jeweled cart. The Tathagata is also like this. Although he has power and fearlessness, he does not use them. Instead, he uses the wisdom of expedient means to rescue sentient beings from the burning house of the three realms. He preaches the three vehicles—the śrāvaka vehicle, the pratyekabuddha vehicle, and the Buddha vehicle—and says: ‘You should not delight in dwelling in the burning house of the three realms. Do not covet the coarse and broken forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and sensations. If you are greedy and attached to them, you will be burned. You must quickly leave the three realms. You will then attain the three vehicles—the śrāvaka vehicle, the pratyekabuddha vehicle, and the Buddha vehicle. I will guarantee this for you now; it is not a lie. You should only diligently cultivate with vigor.’ The Tathagata uses this expedient means to induce and lead sentient beings. He then says: ‘You should know that these three Dharmas are all praised by the sages. They are free, unattached, and without seeking. By riding in these three vehicles, you will find joy in the unconditioned roots, powers, awakenings, ways, meditation, liberation, and samadhis, and you will attain immeasurable, peaceful, and joyful happiness.’”
“Śāriputra, if there are sentient beings who have an inner nature of wisdom, who hear the Dharma from the World-Honored Buddha, believe in it, and with earnest diligence wish to quickly leave the three realms to seek their own nirvana, this is called the śrāvaka vehicle, like those children who sought the goat cart and came out of the burning house. If there are sentient beings who hear the Dharma from the World-Honored Buddha, believe in it, and with earnest diligence seek self-enlightened wisdom, delighting in quiet solitude and knowing the causes and conditions of all Dharmas, this is called the pratyekabuddha vehicle, like those children who sought the deer cart and came out of the burning house. If there are sentient beings who hear the Dharma from the World-Honored Buddha, believe in it, and diligently cultivate with vigor, seeking all-knowing wisdom—the Buddha’s wisdom, self-attained wisdom, and the wisdom of a teacherless teacher, as well as the Tathagata’s wisdom, powers, and fearlessness—and who pity and seek to bring peace and joy to immeasurable sentient beings and to benefit gods and humans, saving them all, this is called the Great Vehicle. The Bodhisattvas seek this vehicle, and so they are called Mahāsattvas, like those children who sought the ox cart and came out of the burning house.”
“Śāriputra, just as that elder saw that all his children had safely escaped the burning house and reached a place of no fear, he thought of his boundless wealth and gave each of them a great cart. The Tathagata is also like this. He is the father of all sentient beings. When he sees countless millions of sentient beings escape the suffering of the three realms and their dangerous path through the gate of the Buddha’s teaching and attain the joy of nirvana, the Tathagata then thinks: ‘I have a treasury of immeasurable and boundless wisdom, powers, and fearlessness, and all the Dharmas of a Buddha. These sentient beings are all my children, and I will give them the Great Vehicle equally. I will not allow anyone to attain extinction alone.’ He saves all of them with the Tathagata’s extinction. Those sentient beings who have escaped the three realms are all given the tools of the Buddhas’ meditation and liberation to enjoy. These are all of one form and one kind, praised by the sages, and can create pure, wonderful, and supreme happiness.”
“Śāriputra, just as that elder first used three carts to lure his children and then gave them only one great cart, adorned with treasures, which was the most safe and supreme, that elder was not guilty of a lie. The Tathagata is also like this; he is not guilty of any lie. He first preaches the three vehicles to guide sentient beings, and then he saves and liberates them with only the Great Vehicle. Why? Because the Tathagata has an immeasurable treasury of wisdom, powers, and fearlessness—all the Dharmas—and is able to give the Great Vehicle Dharma to all sentient beings, even if they cannot all receive it completely.”
“Śāriputra, for this reason, you should know that due to the power of the Buddhas’ expedient means, they differentiate and speak of three vehicles, although there is only One Buddha Vehicle.”
The Buddha, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Imagine an elder, with a house grand and old,
Worn out and dilapidated, a story untold.
Halls and rooms dangerous, pillars crumbling low,
Beams and ridgepoles leaning, foundations let go.
Walls cracked and caved in, mud plaster now shed,
Thatch scattered and falling, rafters all dread.
A fence all around, crooked and filled with such grime,
Five hundred souls dwelling, trapped within time.
Owls, vultures, and eagles, crows, pigeons, and doves,
Vipers and snakes, with scorpions it moves.
Centipedes, millipedes, geckos that crawl,
Poisonous insects, within every wall.
Monkeys and civets, rats and small mice,
Vicious bugs running, a terrible price.

The stench of foul waste, flowing everywhere,
Dung beetles and insects, gathering there.
Foxes and wolves, and wild dogs that roam,
Gnawing and trampling, far from a home.
They bite and they chew on the bodies now dead,
Bones and flesh scattered, a horrific spread.
Packs of dogs fighting, for food they now vie,
Hungry and skinny, beneath a dark sky.
Confused and searching, for sustenance found,
They fight and they tug, with a terrible sound.
Baring their teeth, with a mournful, deep howl,
The house is quite terrifying, a dark, ghostly cowl.

Demons and spirits, and ghosts all around,
Yakshas and evil, on this cursed ground.
Eating human flesh, with poisonous sting,
Evil birds and beasts, their young they now bring.
Each one is hiding, their offspring to keep,
While yakshas are fighting, and secrets run deep.
Striving to snatch, and the young ones to eat,
When full from their feasting, their evil complete.
The sound of their fighting, a frightening call,
The Kumbhāṇḍa ghosts squat, on mounds in the hall.
Or sometimes they fly, a foot or two high,
Wandering and playing, beneath a dark sky.
They grab a dog's legs, and throw it with might,
Making it voiceless, a terrible sight.
A foot on its neck, for their wicked delight,
Frightening the dog, in the dark of the night.

Other ghosts gather, with bodies so vast,
Naked and skinny and black, their dark shadows cast.
They constantly live there, with great evil cries,
Crying and searching, beneath darkened skies.
Other ghosts wait, with throats thin as needles,
Other ghosts watch, with heads like huge bee-dles.
Some eat human flesh, or devour the dogs,
Their hair wild and tangled, through marshy, dark bogs.
Cruel and ferocious, by hunger now pressed,
They howl and they run, with no moment of rest.

The yakshas, hungry ghosts, and evil birds of the air,
In desperate hunger, they look everywhere.
Peeking in windows, and doors all around,
All these dangers and fears, on this cursed ground.
Immeasurable terrors, within this old keep,
This old ruined house, where dark secrets sleep,
Belongs to one person, whose fate is now sealed.

This man recently went out, his presence concealed,
Not long before, in the house's deep rear,
A fire suddenly started, bringing forth fear.
On all four sides at once, the flames fiercely blazed,
Beams, ridgepoles, and pillars, in a thunderous daze.
Exploded and cracked, then collapsed with a roar,
The walls crumbled and fell, to the dust on the floor.
The ghost-spirits cried out, with a terrible sound,
As eagles and vultures, flew high all around.

The Kumbhāṇḍa ghosts, in a confused, frightened state,
Could not get themselves out, sealed by cruel fate.
The evil beasts hid, and poisonous things crawled,
In holes and in cracks, as the burning house called.
The Piśāca ghosts lived there, within the dark space,
Their meager merit failing, in this burning disgrace.
Pressed by the fire, they hurt and they harmed,
Drinking blood, eating flesh, by the danger alarmed.

The wild dogs, and others, had already died,
Great evil beasts came, to feast side by side.
A foul, smoky haze, filled all sides with its blight,
Centipedes, millipedes, in the dim, fading light.
Poisonous snakes, by the fire now burned,
Raced out of their holes, as the lesson was learned.
The Kumbhāṇḍa ghosts grabbed them, and ate them with glee,
And hungry ghosts, with fire on their heads, you see,
Suffering from hunger, and thirst, and the heat,
Ran around in a daze, with their blistering feet.
The house was like this, frightening and dire,
The poisonous, harmful, disastrous fire.
The multitude of dangers, not merely one,
As the terrible saga, had only begun.

At that time, the owner, stood outside the gate,
Heard someone declare, sealing their children's sad fate:
"Your children, because of their innocent games,
Came into this house, now consumed by the flames.
They are young and quite ignorant, in play they delight,
Attached to their games, in the fading of light."

When the elder heard this, he was startled and then,
Entered the burning house, a brave, noble man.
He thought he should rescue, and save them from harm,
Lest they be burned wholly, by the fire's alarm.
He told his dear children, and gave his command,
Explaining the dangers, throughout the whole land:
"The evil ghosts, poisonous insects now fly,
And the fire is raging, beneath a hot sky!
The various sufferings, continuous and strong,
Following swiftly, for far too long.
The poisonous snakes, and the vipers that crawl,
As well as the yakshas, within this dark wall.
The Kumbhāṇā ghosts, and the wild, savage hound,
Foxes and jackals, on this burning ground.

The vultures, and owls, and the birds of the air,
And the centipedes crawling, beyond all compare.
Are starving and thirsty, in desperate plight,
And are extremely frightening, in this terrible light.
This place is so full of suffering and dread,
Not to mention the great fire, now fiercely spread!"

The children were ignorant, in their innocent play,
Though they heard their father's words, they wished to stay.
Still attached to their happiness, they would not cease,
Their games and their laughter, defying all peace.
At that time, the elder, thought to himself then,
"My children are like this, again and again,
Increasing my worry, and sadness profound.
In this house of peril, no joy can be found.
But my children are captured, by games and by fun,
And will not accept instruction, until it is done.
They will surely be harmed, by the merciless fire."

He immediately thought, with a fervent desire,
A skillful means to set his dear children free.
He told his children, with great certainty:
"I have all kinds of wonderful playthings, so grand,
Wondrous jeweled carts, now outside the land.
Goat carts, deer carts, and great ox carts you'll see,
Now outside the gate, just waiting for thee.
You must come out quickly, and I will then give,
These treasures unto you, that you may then live.

I have made these fine carts, expressly for you,
You can play with them freely, your wishes come true."
When the children heard this, of all these fine carts,
They immediately raced, with joyful young hearts.
To get out of the house, away from all fright,
They reached the open ground, in the sun's warm light.
Away from all sufferings, and dangers so great,
Escaping the burning, before it was late.

When the elder saw, his children were free,
Had gotten out safely, for all eyes to see.
And were at the crossroads, now safe from the blaze,
He sat on a lion's seat, in triumphant haze.
And congratulated himself, with joy in his soul,
Saying, "I am now joyful, and peacefully whole.
These children, who were so difficult to raise,
Were foolish and ignorant, in their childish ways.
But they entered the dangerous house, so forlorn,

With so many poisonous insects, and demons now born.
The great fire raged fiercely, all around and around,
But I have saved these children, on this hallowed ground.
And caused them to escape, the danger so dire.
For this reason, all people, I am now peaceful, desire."

At that time, the children, knew father was free,
And sitting at ease, for all eyes to see.
They all went to him, in the sun's golden gleam,
And said, "Please give us, the carts of our dream.

The three kinds of jeweled carts, so wondrous and grand,
You promised before, throughout the whole land.
'When you children come out, from the fire's hot breath,
I will give you the three carts,' avoiding all death.
'According to your wishes,' so now is the time,
Please give them to us," in their youthful prime.

The elder was wealthy, with riches untold,
His storerooms were plentiful, worth more than gold.
With gold, silver, lapis lazuli bright,
Tridacna, and agate, shining with light.
He made all the great carts, with treasures so rare,
Adorned and decorated, beyond all compare.

With railings all around, and bells softly chiming,
Hanging on all four sides, in perfect, sweet timing.
And golden ropes interwoven, a beautiful sight,
A net of fine pearls, spread above them so bright.
Golden flowers and garlands, hung down everywhere,
Many adornments, filling the air.
Surrounded the carts, with silk floss so soft,
Used as mattresses, from the ground lifted aloft.
The most wonderful cloth, fine beyond measure,
Worth thousands of millions, a priceless, rare treasure.
Fresh, white, and clean, covered each cart,
A masterpiece of beauty, a work of fine art.

There were great white oxen, fat, strong, and so bold,
With beautiful bodies, a story untold.
To pull the jeweled carts, with power and grace,
Many attendants, with smiles on each face.
Waited upon them, with these wonderful carts,
He gave them to all, with loving, true hearts.
His children receiving, in equal degree,

At that time, the children, with joy and with glee,
Were filled with delight, for all eyes to see.
They rode in these jeweled carts, with hearts light and free,
And traveled in all four directions, with pure ecstasy.
Playing so happily, without any strife,
Freely and unhindered, throughout their whole life.

He said to Śāriputra: "I am like this, my friend.
I am the Honored One, whose teachings transcend.
The father of the world, for all to embrace,
All sentient beings, my children of grace.

And they are deeply attached, to worldly delight,
Without a mind of wisdom, in shadows of night.
The three realms are not safe, just like a house ablaze,
It is full of much suffering, in countless dark ways.

And is extremely frightening, with worries so deep,
Of birth, old age, sickness, and death, while they sleep.
Such fires are burning, fiercely and without end,
The Tathagata has left, on whom we depend.
The burning house of the three realms, now far behind,

He lives in a stillness, a peace of the mind.
Resting comfortably, in the forest's soft embrace,
Now, these three realms, belong to my grace.
And the sentient beings, who dwell within them,
Are all my own children, a precious, bright gem.

But now this place, is full of great fears,
Only I, all alone, can wipe away tears.
Can save and protect them, with teachings so true,
Though I may teach them, what can I do?
They do not believe, or accept what I say,
Because they are deeply attached, day after day,
To the defilement of desires, a powerful hold,

For this reason, with expedient means, so bold,
I preach the three vehicles, a story unfolds.
To cause all sentient beings, to know of the pain,
The suffering of the three realms, again and again.
I reveal and expound, the path pure and bright,
The path that is beyond, the world's fading light.

These children, if their minds are firm and quite strong,
Will be complete in three wisdoms, where they truly belong.
And the six supernatural powers, a wondrous gift,
Some will attain pratyekabuddha status, a spiritual lift.
Or become a non-retrogressing Bodhisattva, so grand,

You, Śāriputra, I use this command,
This parable for sentient beings, throughout the whole land.
To speak of the One Buddha Vehicle, so true,
If you all can believe, and accept what I do,

You will all attain, the Buddha Way's grace.
This vehicle is subtle, and wonderful, takes its place.
Pure, and supreme, beyond all compare,

In all of the worlds, there's nothing above there.
It is praised by the Buddha, and should be adored,
Made offerings to, and revered and explored.
By all sentient beings, with hearts pure and keen,
The immeasurable thousands, of powers, I've seen.
And liberations, meditation, and wisdom's bright flame,
And the other Dharmas of the Buddha, by this holy name,
One attains this vehicle, by which all the children,

Can play, day and night, for kalpas, again and again.
Along with all the Bodhisattvas, and the śrāvaka throng,
They ride this jeweled vehicle, where they truly belong.
Straight to the place of enlightenment, so pure and so high,
For this reason, in ten directions, you must truly try,
And search, for no other vehicle, will you ever discern,

Besides the Buddha’s expedient means, a lesson to learn.
I tell Śāriputra: All of you here,
Are my children, so precious and dear.

And I am your father, who watches with care,
You have been burned by the sufferings, beyond all compare.
Of countless kalpas, for so very long,
I have rescued and pulled you, from where you belonged.

Causing you to leave, the three realms, in their plight,
Although I previously told you, with wisdom and light,
That you had attained extinction, an end to all strife,
You have only ended, the cycle of life and death.
You have not truly, become extinct, my dear friend.

What you should now do, until the very end,
Is to attain only, the wisdom of the Buddha, so grand.
If there is a Bodhisattva, throughout this whole land,
In this assembly, with pure heart and mind,

Who can listen with oneness, to truth you will find.
To the true Dharma of the Buddhas, so wise and so deep,
The World-Honored Buddhas, their promises keep.
Although they use expedient means, for all eyes to see,

The sentient beings they convert, all Bodhisattvas will be.
If a person has little wisdom, and their mind is not clear,
And is deeply attached, to love and to fear.

For these people, I preach, the truth of all suffering,
When sentient beings hear this, their hearts start to sing.
And they gain something, they've never yet had,
The Buddha preaches the truth of suffering, both good and bad.
And it is true, and not different, for all to then learn.

If there are sentient beings, who do not discern,
The root of all suffering, where troubles reside,
And are deeply attached, to the cause deep inside.
And cannot leave it, for even a moment's sweet peace,

For these people, I use expedient means, to bring sweet release.
I preach the path to them, so they may then see,
The cause of all suffering, for you and for me.
Is greed and desire, as the root, deep and strong.

If greed and desire, are extinguished, where they don't belong,
There is nothing to rely on, as we journey along.
The complete extinction of all sufferings, a truth to embrace,
Is named the third truth, with beauty and grace.

To attain the truth of extinction, so wondrous and pure,
One must practice the Way, to forever endure.
To be free from the bonds, of all suffering's might,
Is named liberation, a glorious light.

From what are these people, now truly set free?
They are only freed from falsehood, for all eyes to see.
Which is named liberation, a freedom they gain.

But they have not truly, attained total reign.
Attained total liberation, so wondrous and grand,
The Buddha says these people, throughout the whole land,
Have not truly attained extinction, a state pure and bright,

As these people have not attained, the supreme Way's light.
My intent is not, to allow them to stop,
At extinction's sweet promise, from bottom to top.

I am the King of Dharma, at ease in its flow,
I appear in the world, so all sentient beings will know.
To bring peace and comfort, to all hearts and minds,

You, Śāriputra, this Dharma Seal one finds,
I preach it for the benefit, of the world's many kinds.

Wherever you go, you must not, you will see,
Preach it to the unworthy, for it is not for thee.
If there is someone who hears it, with joy in their heart,
Rejoices in it, and receives it from the start,
On their head, as a blessing, so pure and so deep,

You should know that this person, their promise will keep.
Is a non-retrogressing Bodhisattva, so grand,
If there is a person who believes, throughout the whole land,
And receives the true Dharma, of this holy sutra, so bright,

This person has already, seen Buddhas of light.
Seen past Buddhas, with offerings so true,
Made respectful offerings, for me and for you.
And has also heard this Dharma, a wisdom so vast.

If a person is able to believe, and their faith will then last,
In what you say, it is as if, they have seen me, so grand,
And have also seen you, throughout the whole land.

And the assembly of monks, with their wisdom and grace,
And all the Bodhisattvas, in this sacred place.
This Lotus Sutra, so profound and so deep,
Is for those with deep wisdom, whose secrets they keep.

The shallow-minded who hear it, will be confused, you will find,
And will not understand it, with an untrained mind.
The power of all the śrāvakas, so earnest and true,
And pratyekabuddhas, for me and for you,

Is insufficient for this sutra, its meaning to glean.
You, Śāriputra, could only have been,
Could only enter this sutra, through faith, strong and bright,

How much more so for the other śrāvakas, in fading light?
The other śrāvakas, because they believe in the word,
The Buddha’s words, a message they've heard.
Follow this sutra, with hearts pure and keen.

It is not a matter, of their own wisdom, it's been,
Furthermore, Śāriputra, those who are proud and lazy,
And hold the view of a self, their minds often hazy,

You must not preach this sutra, to them, you will find.
The shallow-minded person, with an ordinary mind.
Who is deeply attached, to the five desires' sweet call,
If they hear but cannot understand, they will stumble and fall,

You also should not preach it, to them, my dear friend.
If a person does not believe, and their heart will then bend,
And slanders this sutra, with words sharp and keen,
They will cut off all the Buddha seeds, that ever have been,
In the world, so wondrous.

Or if they frown, with a look so unkind,
And harbor doubts, within their own mind.
You should listen, as I describe, in tones solemn and deep,
The karmic retribution, that they then will reap.

Whether the Buddha is in the world, in light or in shade,
Or after he has passed away, his presence will fade.
If a person slanders, these kinds of true sutras, so grand,

And sees someone who reads, recites, throughout the whole land,
And upholds the sutra, with love and with grace,
They despise them, hold grudges, with hatred on their face.

And are full of jealousy, and hatred, so strong,
The karmic retribution for this person, where they truly belong,
You should listen to it now, as the story unfolds.
When this person dies, to the Avīci hell they're sold.

For a full kalpa, in torment so deep,
When the kalpa ends, they will awaken from sleep.
They will be reborn again, in this sorrowful way,
And in this way, they will revolve, for countless a day.

For countless kalpas, a cycle of pain,
When they get out of hell, they will fall once again.
Into the animal realm, a fate harsh and grim.
They will be a dog, or a wild dog, their prospects so dim.
Their shadows will be thin, and weak, you will see,

They will be dark, scabby, and leprous, for all eyes to be.
And they will be tormented, by people's harsh touch,
Furthermore, they will be despised, suffering so much.
And looked down upon by people, with scorn and with sneers.

They will always be troubled, by hunger and fears.
Their bones and their flesh, will be dry and so withered,
In life they will endure agony, by fate they are tethered.
And in death, they will be hit, with stones and with tiles,

Because they cut off the Buddha seed, for countless long miles.
They receive this karmic retribution, so harsh and so strong.
They may become a camel, where they don't belong,
Or be born as a donkey, with burdens to bear,

Their bodies always carrying, heavy loads in the air.
And being beaten with sticks, and with whips, sharp and keen,
They will only think of water, and grass, as I've seen.
And will not know anything else, in their sorrowful plight.

Because they slandered this sutra, in darkness of night,
They receive such a karmic retribution, a terrible sight.
Some may become a wild dog, with a scabby, sad face,
And enter a village, in a desolate place.

Their bodies are scabby and leprous, and in pain they will writhe,
And they have only one eye, as their fortunes then thrive.
They are hit and are thrown, by children at play,
And endure all kinds of suffering, throughout the whole day.

Sometimes even dying from it, in their sorrowful state,
When they die from this, they are reborn by fate.
In the body of a great snake, whose form is so vast,
Whose form is five hundred yojanas long, built to last.

They are deaf, foolish, and have no feet, as they go,
Rolling and slithering, on their belly, so slow.
They are gnawed and are eaten, by small insects so many,
They endure suffering, day and night, for not a penny.

Without any rest, in their torment so deep,
Because they slandered this sutra, their sorrow they keep.
They receive such a karmic retribution, a terrible cost.

If they are able to be reborn, as a human, then lost,
Their faculties are dull and ignorant, so far from the light.
They are short, ugly, crippled, lame, a sorrowful sight,
Blind, deaf, and hunchbacked, for all eyes to see.

Whatever they say, people will not agree,
People do not believe, or accept, you will find.
Their breath is always foul, leaving reason behind,
And they are possessed, by ghosts and by demons.

They are poor and of low status, with terrible portents,
And are made to work for others, with little to gain.
They are often sick and emaciated, enduring great pain,
With no one to rely on, in their sorrowful plight.

Even if they get close to people, they vanish from sight,
People do not care about them, in darkness and light.
If they get anything, they immediately lose,
A life full of sorrow, with nothing to choose.

If they practice medicine, with knowledge so vast,
And treat a disease, according to a prescription's cast.
They will only worsen, the other person's ill plight,
Or even cause their death, in the fading of light.

If they themselves are sick, with aches and with pains,
No one will save and treat them, in sun or in rains.
Even if they take good medicine, it will only get worse,
A terrible fate, a sorrowful curse.

If others rebel, with anger and might,
Plunder, rob, or steal, in the darkness of night.
These kinds of sins, will be blamed on them, it's true,
Unjustly blamed on them, for me and for you.

Such a sinner, will never then see,
A Buddha, the King of all sages, for eternity.
Who preaches the Dharma, and converts all beings,
Such a sinner, will always be born, with their sorrowful pleadings.

In difficult places, where darkness takes hold.
They will be insane and deaf, their minds will be cold,
Their minds will be confused, and they'll never then hear,
The Dharma's sweet message, for countless a year.

For countless kalpas, like the sands of the Ganges, they'll turn,
Every time they are born, they will deaf and mute learn.
Their faculties will be incomplete, a sorrowful plea,
And they will always live, in the hells, you will see,
As if they were in a garden, with flowers so bright,

In other evil destinies, in the fading of light,
It will be like their own home, where darkness takes flight.
Camels, donkeys, pigs, and dogs, throughout the whole land,
These are the places, where they then will stand.
Because they slandered this sutra, so cruel and so deep,

They receive such a karmic retribution, their sorrow they keep.
If they are reborn as a human, with faculties so frail,
They will be deaf, blind, and mute, a sorrowful tale.
And adorned with all kinds of poverty, so harsh and so grim,
And decay, in their bodies, from limb to each limb.

They will be bloated with dropsy, and wasted away,
With scabs, leprosy, boils, and sores, day after day.
Such illnesses, will be like their own clothes,
Their body will always be foul and rotten, as everyone knows.

Unclean with filth and with dirt, a terrible sight,
They will be deeply attached, to the view of a self, with all might.
And will increase their anger, like a raging wild fire,
Their lust will be burning, with fervent desire.
And they will not differentiate, between birds and beasts,
Because they slandered this sutra, their suffering now feasts.
They receive such a karmic retribution, a terrible cost.

I tell Śāriputra: If one were to speak,
Of the sins of those, who slander, throughout the whole week.
This sutra, its message, so pure and so deep,
It would not be exhausted, in a whole kalpa's sleep.

For this reason, I tell you, my friend, you will find,
Do not preach this sutra, among ignorant kind.

If there is a person, with faculties so keen,
Whose wisdom is clear, a bright and pure scene.
Who has heard much, and has a strong memory's hold,
And who seeks the Buddha Way, with a spirit so bold.

To such a person, you may preach it, with grace,
If a person has already seen, in time and in space,
Millions and hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, so grand,

And has planted roots of goodness, throughout the whole land.
With a deeply firm mind, and a heart pure and true,
To such a person, you may preach it, for me and for you.

If a person is diligent, and constantly strives,
And cultivates a mind of compassion, where true love then thrives.
And does not begrudge their life, for all eyes to see,
You may preach it, to such a person, so lovingly.

If a person is respectful, and has no other thought,
Is far from the foolish, and common, by whom they are caught.
And lives alone, in the mountains and swamps, so serene,

To such a person, you may preach it, a wondrous, bright scene.
Furthermore, Śāriputra, if you see someone now,

Who has left evil companions, and made a new vow.
And is close to good friends, with a heart pure and true,
To such a person, you may preach it, for me and for you.

If you see a son of the Buddha, with spirit so bright,
Who upholds the precepts purely, in pure, shining light.
Like a pure and bright pearl, a treasure so rare,
And seeks the Great Vehicle sutras, beyond all compare.

To such a person, you may preach it, with wisdom and grace,
If a person has no anger, with a smile on their face.
Is simple, honest, and gentle, throughout the whole day,

And always has compassion for all, in a kind, loving way.
And is respectful to all Buddhas, with reverence deep,
To such a person, you may preach it, your promises keep.

And if there is a son of the Buddha, in a great, holy throng,
With a pure heart, and with various causes, where they truly belong,

Parables, and words, that flow like a stream,
He preaches the Dharma without hindrance, a beautiful dream.
To such a person, you may preach it, with wisdom and might.

If there is a monk, who seeks all-knowing light,
Who seeks all-knowing wisdom, so wondrous and grand,
And searches for the Dharma, throughout the whole land.
In all four directions, receiving it with joined palms, so high,
On their head, a blessing, beneath a clear sky.

And who only delights in receiving, and upholding the truth,
The Great Vehicle scriptures, from childhood to youth.
And will not even accept, one verse, as they've heard,
From other sutras, with their spoken word.

To such a person, you may preach it, with heart pure and bold.
It is like a person who sincerely, and truly, has told,
Seeks the Buddha's relics, a treasure so vast.

In the same way, this person seeks the sutra, built to last.
And when they get it, they receive it, on their head, so bright,
This person will no longer seek, other sutras, in fading light.

Nor will they ever think of, with a heart pure and free,
The classics of outside paths, for all eyes to see.
To such a person, you may preach it, with wisdom and grace.

I tell Śāriputra: I have preached, in this sacred place,
These characteristics, with wisdom so vast.
Those who seek the Buddha Way, their journey will last,
Will not be exhausted, even after a kalpa, so grand.

Such people, will be able to believe, throughout the whole land,
And understand it, with wisdom's bright gleam.
You must preach, this Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a dream,
To them, with devotion, so pure and so deep.




Chapter 4: Belief and Understanding

At that time, the wise Subhūti, Mahākātyāyana, Mahākāśyapa, and Mahāmaudgalyāyana, having heard the unprecedented Dharma from the Buddha and seen the World-Honored One give Śāriputra the prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, were filled with a rare and joyful feeling in their hearts. They immediately rose from their seats, straightened their robes, bared their right shoulders, knelt on their right knees, joined their palms with a single mind, bowed respectfully, and looked up at the Buddha’s revered face. They said to the Buddha:
“We are the leaders of the monastic community, and our years have passed and our bodies are decaying. We considered ourselves to have attained nirvana and to be no longer capable of anything or needing to seek Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi further. In the past, when the World-Honored One preached the Dharma for a long time, we were in the assembly, but our bodies were tired and lazy. We only thought of emptiness, signlessness, and purposelessness. We did not delight in the Bodhisattva’s Dharmas, their playful supernatural powers, purifying Buddha lands, or saving sentient beings. Why? The World-Honored One caused us to leave the three realms and attain the realization of nirvana. And now that our years have passed and our bodies are decaying, we did not give rise to a single thought of delight in the Buddha’s teaching on the Bodhisattva’s Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.
Now, in the presence of the Buddha, we hear the śrāvakas being given a prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Our hearts are filled with great joy and have gained what we never had. We did not think that today, we would suddenly hear this rare Dharma, and we deeply congratulate ourselves. We have gained a great benefit and immeasurable treasures that we did not even seek.”
The Parable of the Poor Son (Prose)
“World-Honored One, we now wish to speak with a parable to make this meaning clear. It is like a person who, when he was young, was foolish and left his father and ran away. He lived in another country for a long time—for ten, twenty, or even fifty years. When he had grown up, he became poor and wandered in all four directions, seeking clothing and food. He gradually traveled and eventually happened to come to his home country.
His father had been searching for his son but could not find him and had stopped in a certain city. His family was very rich with boundless treasures—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, coral, amber, crystal, pearls, and so on. His storerooms were all overflowing. He had many servants, ministers, officials, and citizens, and countless elephants, horses, carriages, and cattle. The profits from his businesses spread throughout other countries, and he had many merchants and traders.
At that time, the poor son traveled through the villages and passed through the various countries and cities, eventually reaching the city where his father had settled. The father had been thinking of his son and felt heartbroken, as they had been separated for more than fifty years. He had never spoken of this matter to anyone, only contemplating it himself with sorrow and regret. He thought to himself that he was old and decaying, had much wealth, gold, silver, and precious treasures filling his storerooms, but had no child. If he were to die suddenly, his wealth would be scattered, and he would have no one to entrust it to. For this reason, he earnestly and constantly remembered his son. He also thought: ‘If I could find my son and entrust my wealth to him, I would be at ease and happy, without any more worries.’”
“World-Honored One, at that time, the poor son, working as a day laborer, eventually arrived at his father's house and stood outside the gate. From a distance, he saw his father sitting on a lion’s seat, with a jeweled table supporting his feet. All the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and elders respectfully surrounded him. His body was adorned with pearl necklaces, worth tens of millions, and his officials, citizens, and servants held white whisks and waited on him on his right and left. He was covered with a jeweled canopy, with banners of various flowers hanging down. Perfumed water was sprinkled on the ground, and famous flowers were scattered. Precious treasures were arranged in rows, being brought in and out. There were all kinds of such adornments, and his majesty was exceptionally revered.
When the poor son saw his father’s great power and influence, he was filled with fear and regretted coming there. He secretly thought: ‘This must be a king or someone of equal rank. This is not a place where I can earn money with my labor. It is better to go to a poor village, where I can use my strength to work and easily get food and clothing. If I stay here for a long time, I might be forced and compelled to work for him.’ Having thought this, he quickly ran away.”
“At that time, the rich elder, from his lion’s seat, saw his son and immediately recognized him. His heart was filled with great joy. He thought: ‘My wealth and treasury now have someone to entrust to! I have always thought of this son, but have had no way to see him, and now he has come on his own accord. This is a fulfillment of my wish. Although I am old and decaying, I am still greedy for my son.’ He immediately sent a nearby servant to quickly chase him and bring him back.
At that time, the servant ran quickly and grabbed him. The poor son was shocked and cried out in distress: ‘I have not wronged you! Why are you grabbing me?’ The servant held him even tighter and forcibly dragged him back. At that time, the poor son thought to himself that he was innocent, but was being imprisoned. He was sure he would die. He became even more terrified, fainted, and fell to the ground. From a distance, the father saw this and said to the servant: ‘You don’t need this person. Do not bring him back by force. Sprinkle cold water on his face to revive him, and do not speak to him further.’
Why? Because the father knew that his son’s aspirations were lowly. He knew that his own status as a rich nobleman would be a burden for his son. He knew this was his son, but he used an expedient means and did not tell anyone that this was his son. The servant said to him: ‘I will now let you go. You can go wherever you want.’ The poor son was overjoyed, gaining something he had never had before. He rose from the ground and went to the poor village to seek clothing and food.”
“At that time, the elder wished to lure his son and devised an expedient means. He secretly sent two servants, who were haggard in appearance and without dignity. He told them: ‘You can go to him and slowly tell the poor son that there is a job here and that you will give him double the usual wage. If the poor son agrees, bring him back to work. If he asks what kind of work it is, you can tell him that you will hire him to remove dung, and that the two of you will work with him.’
The two servants then went and found the poor son. When they had found him, they told him all the above. At that time, the poor son first took his wages and then proceeded to remove the dung. The father saw his son and felt pity and a strange joy. On another day, from a window, he saw his son’s body was thin and haggard, covered in dirt and dust, and was filthy and impure. He then took off his pearl necklaces, fine and soft robes, and adornments. He changed into a coarse, dirty, and grimy robe, and covered his body with dust. In his right hand, he held a tool for removing dung, pretending to be afraid of something. He said to the workers: ‘You must all work hard and not be lazy or rest.’ By using this expedient means, he got close to his son.
Later, he said to him: ‘Hey, my boy! You must always work here and not go anywhere else. I will raise your wages. Whatever you need—bowls, pots, rice, flour, salt, vinegar, and other things—do not hesitate. There will also be older servants to help you. Be at ease, I am like your father; do not worry. Why? Because I am old, and you are young and strong. When you work, you are never deceitful or lazy, nor do you show anger or complain. I have not seen any of these faults in you, unlike in other workers. From now on, I will treat you as my own son.’
At that time, the elder even gave him a new name, calling him ‘son.’ At that time, the poor son, though happy with this new life, still thought of himself as a lowly hired hand. For this reason, for twenty years, he was constantly given the job of removing dung. After this time, they had mutual trust, and he could come and go freely. However, he still lived in his original place.”
“World-Honored One, at that time, the elder became sick and knew he would not live much longer. He said to the poor son: ‘I now have a lot of gold, silver, and precious treasures, and my storerooms are overflowing. You know the exact amounts that have been brought in and out. This is what is in my heart, and you should understand my intention. Why? From now on, I am no different from you. You must put your heart into this and not allow anything to be lost.’
At that time, the poor son accepted the instructions and took charge of all the gold, silver, precious treasures, and storerooms, but he did not have a single thought of taking a meal for himself. However, he still lived in his original place and had not yet been able to abandon his lowly mindset.
After a short time, the father knew that his son’s mind had gradually opened up and that he had achieved great resolve, no longer holding his former low opinion of himself. When he was about to pass away, he summoned his son and also gathered his relatives, clan members, kings, ministers, Kshatriyas, and elders. When they had all gathered, he publicly declared: ‘Gentlemen, you should know that this is my son, whom I fathered. He left me and ran away from a certain city and wandered and suffered for more than fifty years. His original name was such-and-such, and my name is such-and-such. In the past, in my home city, I worriedly searched for him, and I suddenly met him here. This is truly my son, and I am truly his father. All my wealth and possessions are now his. He knows all that has been brought in and out before.’
World-Honored One, when the poor son heard his father’s words, he was filled with great joy, gaining what he had never had before. He thought: ‘I originally had no mind to seek anything, but now this treasure has come to me naturally.’”
“World-Honored One, the great wealthy elder is the Tathagata. We are all like the sons of the Buddha. The Tathagata always says that we are his children. World-Honored One, we have been tormented by the three sufferings in the cycle of life and death, deluded and ignorant, attached to the small Dharma. Today, the World-Honored One has caused us to contemplate and cast away the dung of all the Dharmas of empty discourse. In this, we have cultivated with diligence and attained the wages of a single day of nirvana. Having gained this, our hearts were filled with great joy and felt content. We thought to ourselves: ‘Because we have diligently cultivated the Buddha’s Dharma, our gains are great and plentiful.’
But the World-Honored One knew that our hearts were attached to meager desires and delighted in the small Dharma, so he let us go and did not differentiate for us that we would also have a share in the treasury of the Tathagata’s wisdom and insight. The World-Honored One, with the power of expedient means, preached the Tathagata’s wisdom. We received a single day’s wages of nirvana from the Buddha and thought it was a great gain. For this Great Vehicle, we had no resolve to seek it. And we, using the Tathagata’s wisdom, have revealed and expounded it for the Bodhisattvas, but for ourselves, we had no such aspirations. Why? Because the Buddha knew our hearts delighted in the small Dharma, and with the power of expedient means, he preached for us according to our needs, but we did not know that we were truly sons of the Buddha.
Now we finally know that the World-Honored One is not stingy with the Buddha’s wisdom. Why? We have been true sons of the Buddha since the past, but we only delighted in the small Dharma. If we had the mind to delight in the great, the Buddha would have preached the Great Vehicle Dharma to us. In this sutra, only the One Vehicle is preached, but in the past, in front of the Bodhisattvas, he disparaged the śrāvakas who delighted in the small Dharma. But the Buddha truly converts us with the Great Vehicle. This is why we say we originally had no mind to seek it. But now, the great treasure of the Dharma King has come to us naturally, and we have attained everything that the sons of the Buddha should attain.”
Mahākāśyapa's Verse
At that time, Mahākāśyapa, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:

Well we heard the Buddha preaching, heard him singing out today, 
Yeah we heard the Buddha preaching, singing truth along the way, 
Got a joy down deep inside us, like we never felt before this day.
The Buddha said us wanderers, said we gonna reach that shore, 
Buddha said us poor old wanderers, we gonna reach that Buddha shore, 
This treasure we ain't even asked for, coming through our daddy's door.

There was a young and foolish boy, left his daddy's house one day, 
Yeah a young and foolish boy, he just up and ran away, 
Wandered through them distant countries for fifty years of pain and gray.
His daddy kept on searching, looking everywhere around, 
That daddy kept on searching, checking every town and ground, 
Got tired of all that looking, so he settled himself down.
Built himself a mansion, had gold and silver piled high, 
Built himself a mighty mansion, treasures reaching to the sky, 
Had elephants and servants, had profits multiplying by and by.

That poor boy kept on drifting, looking for his daily bread, 
Yeah that poor boy kept on drifting, hungry and his body dead, 
Covered up in sores and scabbing, didn't know where he was being led.
One day he came wandering, wandering to his daddy's town, 
Yeah he came a-wandering, to where his daddy'd settled down, 
Saw that mansion shining golden, thought "This ain't no place for me around."
Saw his daddy on a throne, looking like a king up there, 
Saw his daddy high up on that throne, jewels hanging everywhere, 
Got scared and started running, said "I got no business here, I swear."

But daddy saw him from that window, recognized his long-lost son, 
Yeah daddy saw him through that window, knew that boy was the one, 
Sent his servants out to catch him, but that poor boy turned to run.
Boy fell down in terror, thought he gonna surely die, 
That boy fell down in pure terror, too scared to even cry, 
Daddy said "Let him go now, don't you make that poor boy lie."

So daddy got him a plan, gonna take it nice and slow, 
Yeah daddy worked out him a plan, gonna let that love just grow, 
Sent some poor-looking messengers, said "We got some work, you know."
Told him "We'll pay double wages, if you'll come and clean our place," 
"Yeah we'll pay you double wages, just come work at this pace," 
Poor boy took that dung-removing job, thought he'd found his proper space.
Daddy put on ragged clothing, got down in the dirt and grime, 
Yeah daddy shed those royal garments, working right there all the time, 
Told his boy "You keep on working, I'll treat you right, son of mine."

Twenty years of cleaning outhouses, twenty years of feeling low, 
Yeah twenty years of shoveling, moving steady, moving slow, 
Till daddy knew his boy was ready for the truth that he should know.
Daddy called him to his deathbed, called the whole town to hear, 
Called his boy to that deathbed, made the message crystal clear, 
Said "This here's my long-lost son, and everything he'll inherit here."

Poor boy heard his daddy speaking, couldn't believe what he just heard, 
Yeah that poor boy heard his daddy, every single blessed word, 
Said "I never asked for nothing, but this treasure ain't deferred."

Well the Buddha's just like that rich man, and we're the children he raised up, 
Yeah the Buddha's like that father, and we're drinking from his cup, 
We been cleaning out the outhouses, but now we're filling up.
We thought we'd reached the end, thought nirvana was enough, 
Yeah we thought we'd reached the finish, that one day's wage and stuff, 
But Buddha knew we could go higher, though the climbing might be rough.
He let us work the small jobs, didn't push us toward the throne, 
Let us work them small jobs, cleaning up and all alone, 
Waited till our hearts were ready to claim what we should've known.

Now we finally understand it, we been Buddha's sons all along, 
Yeah we finally got the message, been his children all along, 
Just been too small-minded to hear that great vehicle song.
The Buddha ain't no miser, with his wisdom he won't hold back, 
No the Buddha ain't no miser, ain't nothing that he lacks, 
We just loved them small teachings, walking on that narrow track.

But now the truth is shining, like a treasure in our hands, 
Yeah now that truth is shining, we can finally understand, 
We're the true sons of the Buddha, heirs to all his golden lands.
How we gonna thank him? Can't be done in endless time, 
How we gonna thank the Buddha? Can't repay in rhythm or rhyme, 
Even if we carried him forever, still couldn't match that grace sublime.
Buddha's got that freedom, knows what every soul needs most, 
Yeah Buddha's got that wisdom, from coast to shining coast, 
Preaches what we each can handle, like a loving, patient host.

So we singing hallelujah, got that dharma in our bones, 
We singing hallelujah, ain't wandering alone, 
We're the Buddha's own true children, coming home to claim our throne.
The blues rolls on, the dharma flows, 
From the highest peaks to the lowest lows, 
One vehicle, one path, one way it goes.

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Volume Three
Translated by Tripitaka Master Kumarajiva of the Kucha Kingdom in the Later Qin Dynasty, by imperial decree.



Chapter 5: A Parable of the Medicinal Herbs

At that time, the World-Honored One said to Mahākāśyapa and the other great disciples: “Well said, well said, Kāśyapa! You have spoken well of the Tathagata’s true merits. It is truly as you say. The Tathagata also has immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable merits. If you were to speak of them for immeasurable millions of kalpas, you could not exhaust them.
Kāśyapa, you should know that the Tathagata is the King of all Dharmas. Whatever he says is not false. He expounds the Dharma with the wisdom of expedient means for all phenomena, and the Dharma he preaches all reaches the ground of All-Knowing Wisdom. The Tathagata knows and perceives the destination of all phenomena and also knows the deeply held thoughts of all sentient beings. He has a clear and unhindered understanding, and for all phenomena, he has fully and clearly comprehended them, revealing all wisdom to sentient beings.”
The Parable of the Great Cloud
“Kāśyapa, imagine the great world of three thousand realms, with its mountains, rivers, valleys, and lands. The trees, shrubs, forests, and all the medicinal herbs born there are of different kinds, with various names and forms. A dense cloud spreads out, covering the entire great world of three thousand realms. At the same time, it pours rain equally, and its moisture is spread everywhere. The trees, shrubs, forests, and all the medicinal herbs—those with small roots, small stems, small branches, and small leaves; those with medium roots, medium stems, medium branches, and medium leaves; and those with great roots, great stems, great branches, and great leaves—all the plants, both great and small, receive the rain according to their superior, medium, or inferior capacity. The one cloud pours rain, and according to their kind and nature, they all grow, and their flowers and fruits bloom and mature. Although they are born from the same earth and nourished by the same rain, all the plants have differences.”
“Kāśyapa, you should know that the Tathagata is also like this. He appears in the world like a great cloud rising. With a great sound, he reaches universally throughout the worlds of gods, humans, and asuras, just as that great cloud covers the three thousand great worlds. In the great assembly, he proclaims: ‘I am the Tathagata, the Worthy One, the Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. I save those who are unsaved, I enlighten those who are unenlightened, I bring peace to those who are not at peace, and I enable those who have not attained nirvana to attain it. I truly know this world and the world to come. I am the All-Knower, the All-Seer, the one who knows the Way, who opens the Way, and who preaches the Way. All of you—gods, humans, and asuras—should all come here to listen to the Dharma.’”
“At that time, countless millions of sentient beings came to the Buddha to listen to the Dharma. The Tathagata then observed the sharpness or dullness of the faculties of these sentient beings, their diligence or laziness. According to their capacity, he preached the Dharma to them, in countless ways, causing them all to rejoice and gain great benefit. When these sentient beings hear this Dharma, they find peace and comfort in their present lives, and they will be born in good places in their future lives. They will receive the joy of the Way and will also hear the Dharma. Having heard the Dharma, they are freed from all obstacles. For all phenomena, according to their capacity, they gradually enter the Way. It is like that great cloud that rains upon all the trees, shrubs, forests, and all the medicinal herbs, and according to their kind and nature, they are all fully nourished, and each one is able to grow.”
“The Dharma preached by the Tathagata has one form and one taste, which is the form of liberation, the form of leaving, and the form of extinction, ultimately leading to All-Knowing Wisdom. When a sentient being hears the Dharma of the Tathagata, whether they uphold it, read it, recite it, or practice it as it is taught, they do not realize the merits they gain. Why? Only the Tathagata knows the kind, form, and nature of these sentient beings. He knows what they think, what they contemplate, what they cultivate. He knows how they think, how they contemplate, how they cultivate, and with what Dharma they think, with what Dharma they contemplate, with what Dharma they cultivate, and with what Dharma they attain what Dharma. Sentient beings dwell on various grounds, but only the Tathagata sees them as they truly are, clearly and without hindrance. It is like the trees, shrubs, forests, and all the medicinal herbs, who do not know their superior, medium, or inferior nature.
The Tathagata knows the Dharma of one form and one taste, which is the form of liberation, the form of leaving, and the form of extinction, ultimately nirvana, the form of constant stillness and extinction, which ultimately returns to emptiness. When the Buddha knows this, he observes the desires of sentient beings’ hearts and protects them. Therefore, he does not immediately preach All-Knowing Wisdom to them. Kāśyapa, you are truly rare, to be able to know that the Tathagata preaches the Dharma according to what is appropriate, and to be able to believe in and accept it. Why? The World-Honored Buddhas preach the Dharma according to what is appropriate, and it is difficult to comprehend and difficult to know.”
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
The King of Dharma breaks through the chains,
 Appears in this world with healing rains,
 According to what each heart desires,
 He preaches truth that lifts us higher.
The Tathagata, oh so revered,
 His wisdom deep, his vision clear,
 He held his peace for oh so long,
 Now breaks the silence with this song.
If you got wisdom, you'll understand,
 If you're in doubt, you'll lose your stand,
 So Kāśyapa, preach what they need,
 Plant the Dharma like a seed.

Oh listen now, brothers and sisters...
Like a great cloud rising high,
 Covering earth and covering sky,
 That wisdom cloud is full of grace,
 Lightning flashing in its face.
Thunder rolling, shaking ground,
 Making everybody gather 'round,
 The sun hides low, the earth gets cool,
 Dense clouds hanging like a jewel.
Rain comes equal, rain comes down,
 Falls on country, falls on town,
 Pouring endless, pouring free,
 Saturating all you see.

Mountains, rivers, valleys deep,
 Places where the shadows sleep,
 Trees and shrubs and healing herbs,
 Great and small, they drink the words.
Seeds of grain and sugarcane,
 Grapes receiving heaven's rain,
 All get nourished, none left dry,
 All made rich from cloudy sky.
Dry land drinking, roots run deep,
 Plants and trees no longer weep,
 That cloud releases one sweet taste,
 But each one grows at its own pace.

Yes Lord, each one grows...
All the trees so tall and strong,
 Superior, medium all along,
 According to their frame and size,
 Each one drinking from the skies.
Roots and stems and branches too,
 Leaves and flowers in every hue,
 Fruits and colors shining bright,
 All made fresh by one rain's might.
According to what they can hold,
 Some get silver, some get gold,
 Nourishment is all the same,
 But each one grows in its own name.

The Buddha's just like that great cloud,
 Appears among the human crowd,
 Covering everything the same,
 Speaking truth in every name.
The great and holy World-Honored One,
 Among the gods when day is done,
 Among all beings gathered near,
 Proclaims these words for all to hear:

"I am the Tathagata, hear me now..."
"I am the Tathagata true,
 Honored One come here for you,
 I appear just like a cloud,
 To rain on every thirsty crowd.
To saturate the withered soul,
 To make the broken spirit whole,
 I cause them all to leave their pain,
 To find peace and joy again.
Peace on earth and joy above,
 The bliss of nirvana's love,
 All you gods and human friends,
 Listen with your heart and send—
Send your mind to understand,
 Come and see with open hand,
 I'm the World-Honored supreme,
 None can match this holy dream.
To bring comfort and peace to all,
 I appear when spirits fall,
 I preach the pure sweet Dharma rain,
 For all who gather here in pain."

This Dharma got one taste, one sound...
This Dharma got a single taste,
 Liberation, none to waste,
 Nirvana singing clear and free,
 One wonderful voice, one melody.
It's always cause for the Great Way,
 The Vehicle that saves the day,
 I see all beings eye to eye,
 No favorites beneath this sky.
No one closer, no one far,
 Everyone my shining star,
 No love, no hate within my soul,
 No greed to make me lose control.
I preach the Dharma to them all,
 Same for many, same for small,
 What I do for just one man,
 I do for multitudes the same plan.

Walking, sitting, standing still,
 I'm never tired, got that will,
 I saturate the thirsty ground,
 Like universal rain comes down.
Noble, lowly, rich and poor,
 Those who keep rules, those who ignore,
 Those with dignity complete,
 Those stumbling on unsteady feet.
Right views, wrong views, sharp and dull,
 I rain on partial, rain on full,
 Dharma rain comes equally,
 Never weary, ever free.

Now listen to what happens when they hear...
All those beings hear my song,
 According to where they belong,
 According to their capacity,
 They dwell on grounds of their degree.
Some stay among the gods on high,
 Or wheel-turning kings beneath the sky,
 Śakra or Brahma in their throne—
 These are small herbs that have grown.
Those who know unconditioned truth,
 Those who found nirvana's proof,
 With six powers and wisdom three,
 Living in mountains wild and free,
Always meditating deep,
 Pratyekabuddha's truth to keep—
 These are medium herbs that grow,
 Middle ground is what they know.

Those who seek the Buddha's place,
 Saying "We'll attain that grace,"
 Practicing with diligent mind—
 These superior herbs you'll find.
And those Buddha-sons so bright,
 Focusing on Buddha's light,
 Always practicing compassion's way,
 Knowing they'll be Buddhas someday,
Certain, without any doubt,
 That's what small trees are about.
 Those dwelling in supernatural might,
 Turning wheels that shine so bright,
Saving countless beings here,
 Millions saved year after year,
 These bodhisattvas strong and true—
 These are great trees breaking through.

The Buddha preaches equally, y'all...
Buddha preaches equally,
 Like rain of single quality,
 But according to each nature's way,
 What they receive ain't the same each day.
Like the plants and all the trees,
 Each one drinking as it please,
 Buddha uses parables so fine,
 To reveal and show the true design.
With various words and various ways,
 He expounds one Dharma all his days,
 But compared to Buddha's wisdom deep,
 It's like one drop the ocean keeps.

I rain the Dharma everywhere,
 Filling this world with loving care,
 Dharma of a single taste,
 Practiced according to each one's pace.
Like the shrubs so small and low,
 Healing herbs beginning to grow,
 All the trees both great and small,
 According to their size, they all—
They all grow lush and beautiful,
 Every single one gets full,
 Dharma of the Buddhas true,
 Always single, always new.
It causes all this world around,
 To be universally complete and sound,
 Gradually they cultivate their soul,
 All attain the Way's sweet goal.

Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas too...
Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas dwelling,
 In mountain forests, story telling,
 In their final body here,
 Hear the Dharma, fruit appears.
These are called the healing plants,
 Each one growing through their stance,
 And bodhisattvas wise and strong,
 Whose wisdom's firm their whole life long,
Understanding three realms clear,
 Seeking supreme vehicle here—
 These are called the small trees tall,
 Growing, flourishing one and all.

Those who dwell in meditation deep,
 Supernatural powers they keep,
 Hearing all Dharmas empty be,
 Hearts filled with joy and ecstasy.
They emit countless lights so bright,
 Saving beings left and right,
 These are called the great trees strong,
 Growing, flourishing all along.

So Kāśyapa, hear this truth...
Thus Kāśyapa, hear me say,
 The Dharma preached the Buddha's way,
 Is like a great cloud mighty and tall,
 With rain of one taste for us all,
Nourishing humanity's flower,
 In every moment, every hour,
 So each can come to fruition sweet,
 Each can make the Way complete.
Kāśyapa, you need to know,
 With various causes as I go,
 With various parables I share,
 I reveal the Buddha Way with care.
This is my expedient means,
 Greater than it ever seems,
 And all the Buddhas work this way,
 This is what I've got to say.

Now here's the final truth, the most real...
I'm telling you the truthful word,
 Most truthful thing you've ever heard:
 The assembly of śrāvakas here,
 Haven't truly disappeared.
The path that you've been walking on,
 Is the Bodhisattva Way, withdrawn,
 You'll gradually learn and cultivate,
 You'll all become Buddhas—that's your fate!

Let it rain, let it rain
 One sweet Dharma rain
 Let it fall, let it fall
 On the great and small
 Every plant gonna grow
 Every seed gonna show
 We're all becoming Buddhas
 That's the way it goes
Amen, Amen, Amen

Chapter 6: Bestowal of Prophecies

At that time, the World-Honored One, having spoken this verse, said to the great assembly, and proclaimed: “My disciple Mahākāśyapa, in a future lifetime, will see and serve three million million Buddhas, make offerings to them, show respect, reverence, and praise, and will widely preach the immeasurable great Dharma of the Buddhas. In his last body, he will become a Buddha, named Light Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land will be named Virtue-Light, and the kalpa will be named Great Adornment. The Buddha's life span will be twelve minor kalpas. The True Dharma will remain in the world for twenty minor kalpas, and the Dharma-Image will also remain for twenty minor kalpas. His land will be adorned, without any filth, rocks, tiles, thorns, or uncleanliness. The land will be level, without any hills, depressions, pits, or mounds. The ground will be of lapis lazuli, with rows of jeweled trees, and golden ropes will line the sides of the roads. Various precious flowers will be scattered everywhere, and it will be completely pure. In his land, the Bodhisattvas will be immeasurable thousands of millions, and the śrāvaka assembly will also be countless. There will be no demonic affairs, and although there will be demons and their followers, they will all protect the Buddha’s Dharma.”
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
I tell all the monks, with my Buddha eye so clear,
I see this Kasyapa, banishin' all fear.
In a future life, after countless kalpas have rolled,
He'll attain Buddhahood, a story to be told.
He'll make offerings and serve, three million million strong,
World-Honored Buddhas, where he truly does belong.
For the Buddha's wisdom, his good conduct will shine,
Pure and steady, on that spiritual line.
After he's offered to the supreme, Double-Footed Honored Ones,
He'll cultivate all that wisdom, till his work is done.
In his last body, he'll attain that holy light,
His land will be pure, lapis lazuli, shinin' ever so bright.
Many jeweled trees will line the roadsides wide,
Golden ropes will guide you, with nowhere left to hide.
Those who see them will rejoice, a pleasant fragrance in the air,
Many famous flowers scattered, beyond all compare.
All kinds of wondrous things, subtle and so grand,
Will serve as adornments, in that promised land.

His ground will be level, no hills or pits you'll find,
Bodhisattva assemblies, leavin' no one behind.
Their minds gentle and subdued, with great powers they'll ascend,
Upholdin' Mahayana scriptures, right until the end.
The Sravaka assemblies, in their last body, free from stain,
The sons of the King of Dharma, a countless, holy train.
Even with the heavenly eye, you couldn't count them all,
That Buddha's life span, twelve minor kalpas, standin' strong and tall.

The True Dharma will remain, twenty minor kalpas, hear my plea,
And the Dharma-Image too, for twenty more, you see.
Light Tathagata's story, like this, the blues will tell,
A future shining bright, where all good souls will dwell.
At that time, Mahāmaudgalyāyana, Subhūti, and Mahākātyāyana, were all filled with awe. With a single mind, they joined their palms, looked up at the revered face of the Buddha, and did not take their eyes off him. They spoke together in verse, saying:
Oh, great and mighty Buddha, strong and true,
King of Dharma, shining through and through.
From your deep compassion, a voice we hear,
Whispering wisdom, chasing away all fear.
If you could see deep down, where our hearts reside,
And know that prophecy, we can't deny,
Like sweet cool dew on a summer's day,
Washing our troubles and our heat away.

Like folks from a land where hunger bites hard,
Seein' a king's grand feast, a lavish card.
Still got a tremor, a doubt in our soul,
Too scared to eat, not yet makin' us whole.

But if the king says, "Go on, take a bite!"
Then we'd dig in, with all of our might.
We're caught in that Small Vehicle's weary ways,
Don't know how to reach those enlightened days.

Heard your voice, Lord, said we'd be Buddhas too,
Still got them worries, the blues runnin' through.
Like that hungry soul, can't quite make the start,
'Til prophecy's given, to ease this weary heart.

Oh, great and mighty Buddha, strong and true,
You long for peace, in all that you do.
Please give us that word, Lord, clear and bright,
Like tellin' the hungry, it's time to eat right.
At that time, the World-Honored One, knowing the thoughts in the hearts of his great disciples, said to all the monks: “This Subhūti, in a future lifetime, will serve and see three million million nayuta Buddhas, make offerings to them, show respect, reverence, and praise, and will constantly cultivate pure conduct and be complete in the Bodhisattva Way. In his last body, he will become a Buddha, named Name and Form Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa will be named Having-Treasures, and the land will be named Treasure-Born. His land will be level, with a ground of crystal, and jeweled trees will serve as adornments. There will be no hills, pits, sand, rocks, thorns, or filth. Jeweled flowers will cover the ground, and it will be completely pure. The people of his land will all live in jeweled towers and wonderful mansions. The śrāvaka disciples will be immeasurable and boundless, beyond the reach of calculation and parables. The Bodhisattva assemblies will be countless millions of nayuta. The Buddha’s life span will be twelve minor kalpas. The True Dharma will remain in the world for twenty minor kalpas, and the Dharma-Image will also remain for twenty minor kalpas. That Buddha will always dwell in the air and preach the Dharma for the assembly, saving and liberating immeasurable Bodhisattvas and śrāvaka assemblies.”
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Monks, I tell you true, from me you must hear,
You gotta be of one mind, banish all doubt and fear.
Listen to these words I say, let 'em sink down deep,
Good tidings I bring, secrets you will keep.
My great disciple, Subhūti, soon to be divine,
Attainin' Buddhahood, oh it's a mighty sign.
Name and Form his title, a sound so clear and grand,
Preachin' wisdom's gospel, across every land.

He'll make offerings to Buddhas, countless millions strong,
Walkin' that great Way, where he truly belongs.
Followin' the path they've walked, through joy and through strife,
Bringin' peace to all souls, for eternal life.

His very last body, thirty-two marks he'll claim,
Majestic and wondrous, shoutin' out his name.
Like a jeweled mountain, shinin' in the light,
A beacon for the weary, through the darkest night.

His Buddha land will be, so pure and adorned,
Every soul who sees it, they'll never be scorned.
Love and delight will fill 'em, from their heart's deep core,
Never turnin' away, always wantin' more.

He'll save immeasurable beings, within that blessed place,
In that Buddha's Dharma, full of truth and grace.
Many Bodhisattvas there, with faculties so keen,
Turnin' that great wheel, a holy, righteous scene.

Non-retrogressing they'll be, never lookin' back,
That land always adorned, on the rightest track.
Śrāvaka assemblies, too many to count by far,
Attainin' three wisdoms, shinin' like a star.

Complete in six powers, supernatural and grand,
Dwellin' in eight liberations, across that holy land.
Great majesty and virtue, flowin' all around,
When that Buddha preaches, a sweet and soulful sound.

Supernatural powers, beyond all you can conceive,
Transformations amazin', in what you believe.
Gods and human beings, like Ganges' sands they'll be,
Joinin' their palms together, for all the world to see.

Listenin' to the Buddha's words, every single one,
The life span of that Buddha, 'til his work is done.
Twelve minor kalpas, that's how long he'll stay,
Shinin' his light brightly, every single day.

True Dharma will remain, for twenty kalpas long,
Dharma-Image right beside it, where it truly belongs.
Twenty minor kalpas, for the world to see,
A bluesy, holy lesson, for eternity.
At that time, the World-Honored One again said to the assembly of monks: “I now tell you, this great Mahākātyāyana, in a future lifetime, will use various offerings to serve and make offerings to eight thousand million Buddhas, with reverence and respect. After these Buddhas pass away, he will erect stupas for each of them, a thousand yojanas tall, and five hundred yojanas in both length and width. They will all be made of the seven treasures—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, tridacna, agate, pearls, and rose quartz. He will use all kinds of flowers, garlands, paste incense, powdered incense, burning incense, silken canopies, banners, and streamers to make offerings to the stupas and temples. After this, he will again make offerings to twenty thousand million Buddhas, in the same way. Having made offerings to all these Buddhas, and being complete in the Bodhisattva Way, he will attain Buddhahood, with the title Jambunada Gold Light Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land will be level, with a ground of crystal, and jeweled trees will serve as adornments. Golden ropes will line the sides of the roads, and wonderful flowers will cover the ground. It will be completely pure and those who see it will rejoice. There will be no four evil destinies: hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras. There will be many gods, humans, śrāvaka assemblies, and Bodhisattva assemblies, immeasurable millions, to adorn his land. The Buddha's life span will be twelve minor kalpas. The True Dharma will remain in the world for twenty minor kalpas, and the Dharma-Image will also remain for twenty minor kalpas.”
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Monks, listen close, with a single mind,
What I'm tellin' you, is one of a kind.
This Kātyāyana, with a generous hand,
Will bring fine offerings across the land,
To all the Buddhas, with a joyful heart,
Playin' a faithful and righteous part.
When the Buddhas pass on, from this earthly coil,
He'll build up stupas, from precious soil,
Seven treasures shinin', in the sun's warm glow,
With flowers and incense, watchin' spirits grow.
To the holy relics, he'll bring his praise,
Through all his earthly, and heavenly days.

In his last body, when his time is due,
Buddha's wisdom will shine, bright and true.
A Truly Enlightened, one he will be,
His land pure and peaceful, for all to see.
Millions of beings, he'll save and free,
Worshipped by all, eternally.

The Buddha's light, no one can surpass,
His gentle glow, on every blade of grass.
Jambunada Gold Light, his name will resound,
On sacred ground, where peace can be found.
Bodhisattvas and śrāvakas, their journeys will cease,
Countless and immeasurable, adorning his land with ease.
At that time, the World-Honored One again said to the great assembly: “I now tell you, this great Mahāmaudgalyāyana, will use various offerings to make offerings to eight thousand Buddhas, with reverence and respect. After these Buddhas pass away, he will erect stupas for each of them, a thousand yojanas tall, and five hundred yojanas in both length and width. They will all be made of the seven treasures—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, tridacna, agate, pearls, and rose quartz. He will use all kinds of flowers, garlands, paste incense, powdered incense, burning incense, silken canopies, banners, and streamers to make offerings. After this, he will again make offerings to two million million Buddhas, in the same way. He will then attain Buddhahood, with the title Tāmalapattra Sandalwood Fragrance Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa will be named Joy-Full, and the land will be named Pleasure-Wished. His land will be level, with a ground of crystal, and jeweled trees will serve as adornments. Pearls will be scattered as flowers, and it will be completely pure and those who see it will rejoice. There will be many gods, humans, Bodhisattvas, and śrāvakas, whose numbers will be immeasurable. The Buddha’s life span will be twenty-four minor kalpas. The True Dharma will remain in the world for forty minor kalpas, and the Dharma-Image will also remain for forty minor kalpas.”
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
My disciple, now hear what I say,
Great Mahāmaudgalyāyana, after this life's day.
He'll see Buddhas, two million million, standing tall,
For the Dharma's path, he'll give his all.
Under their gaze, pure conduct he'll keep,
Through kalpas uncounted, the Dharma he'll seep.
When the Buddhas pass, seven treasures he'll raise,
Stupas with gold shafts, in a sacred haze.

With flowers and incense, and music so sweet,
He'll honor their temples, from his head to his feet.
Slowly perfecting, the Bodhisattva's grand way,
In Pleasure-Wished land, he'll see his new day.

Tāmalapattra, Sandalwood Fragrance, his name will resound,
Twenty-four kalpas, his life will be found.
Preaching the Dharma, for gods and for man,
Śrāvakas countless, like the Ganges' sand.

With wisdom and power, a majestic array,
Bodhisattvas countless, with firm resolve to stay.
In the Buddha's deep wisdom, they'll never fall back,
After the Buddha's passing, the True Dharma's on track.

For forty minor kalpas, its light will still gleam,
The Dharma-Image shining, like a beautiful dream.
All my disciples, with virtue so grand,
Five hundred in number, prophecies in their hand.

In a lifetime to come, Buddhas they'll all be,
The karmic connections, between you and me.
I'll speak of them now, so listen close, I implore,
Hear the old story, and want for no more.



Chapter 7: A Parable of the Phantom City
The Buddha said to all the monks: "It was in the past, in immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, that there was a Buddha named Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land was named Good-City, and the kalpa was named Great-Mark.
Monks, it has been a very long time since that Buddha passed away. It is like if someone were to take all the ground of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, grind it all into ink, and then, after passing a thousand worlds in the east, drop a single dot the size of a tiny grain of dust. Then, after passing another thousand worlds, drop another dot. In this way, he continues until all the ground is used up as ink. What do you think, monks? Can any calculator or student of a calculator figure out the end and know the number of these worlds, or not?"
"No, World-Honored One."
"Monks, the worlds that this person passed, whether they received a dot or not, if they were all ground into dust, and each grain of dust were a kalpa, the time since that Buddha passed away would surpass this number by immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas. With the power of the Tathagata's wisdom and insight, I see that distant time as if it were today."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
In ancient days, a long, long time ago,
A Buddha walked, where wisdom's waters flow.
Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom, was his name,
He lit the world with an eternal flame.
Now picture this, a world so vast and grand,
Ground down to dust, held in a mighty hand.
Each speck of dust, it turns to darkest ink,
A cosmic story, on the edge of the brink.
A thousand lands, he travels through the haze,
A single dot, in those ancient, dusty days.
He marks his path, with every tiny spot,
Until the ink, and dust, are all forgot.
The lands all marked, and those untouched by sight,
Are ground to dust, beneath the fading light.
Each tiny grain, a kalpa, deep and old,
A tale of ages, waiting to unfold.
Beyond that count, the kalpas stretch and weave,
Since that old Buddha, took his final leave.
An endless span, a time beyond all thought,
The wisdom deep, that truly he had brought.
The Tathagata, with wisdom pure and free,
He sees that past, for all eternity.
That Buddha's passing, clear as yesterday's sun,
His followers too, when their long race was run.
So listen close, all you who walk this way,
The Buddha's wisdom shines, to this very day.
So pure and subtle, a light that can't be bound,
Through countless kalpas, its truth is ever found.
The Buddha said to all the monks: "The life span of Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Buddha was five hundred and forty million million nayuta kalpas. When that Buddha first sat at the place of enlightenment, after defeating the army of Māra, he was about to attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, but the Dharmas of the Buddhas did not appear before him. In this way, for one minor kalpa, and even up to ten minor kalpas, he sat in the lotus posture, his body and mind motionless, and yet the Dharmas of the Buddhas still did not appear before him."
"At that time, the gods of the Thirty-three Heavens had already prepared a lion's seat for that Buddha under the bodhi tree, a yojana in height. On this seat, the Buddha would attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. As soon as he sat on this seat, all the Brahma Kings rained down various heavenly flowers over a hundred yojanas. A fragrant wind would come from time to time, blowing away the withered flowers and raining down new ones. This continued for ten minor kalpas to make offerings to the Buddha, and even until his passing away, this rain of flowers continued. The Four Heavenly Kings, to make offerings to the Buddha, constantly beat heavenly drums, and the other heavenly beings played heavenly music. This continued for ten minor kalpas, and even until his passing away, it was also like this."
"Monks, when Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Buddha passed ten minor kalpas, the Dharmas of all the Buddhas then appeared before him, and he attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. When that Buddha had not yet renounced his home, he had sixteen sons. The first of them was named Wisdom-Accumulation. Each of his sons had various rare and precious playthings. When they heard that their father had attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, they all gave up their treasures and went to the Buddha's place. Their mothers followed them, weeping. Their grandfather, a wheel-turning holy king, with a hundred ministers and a hundred thousand million other people, all surrounded them and followed them to the place of enlightenment. They all wished to get close to the Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata, to make offerings to him, to show him reverence, respect, and praise. When they arrived, they bowed their heads at his feet, circled the Buddha a hundred times, and then, with one mind, they joined their palms and looked up at the World-Honored One, speaking in verse:
The World-Honored One, so grand and high,
To save all souls beneath the sky,
Through countless eons, long and deep,
His Buddhahood, he finally did keep.
All his good vows, now they are done,
A mighty feat, for everyone.
This World-Honored One, so hard to find,
Ten minor kalpas, he kept his mind.
His body, hands, and weary feet,
Stayed still and peaceful, oh so sweet.
His mind was calm, no troubled thought,
No scattered chaos, dearly sought.
He found true stillness, deep and wide,
In unconditioned Dharma, he does reside.
Now we all see, with eyes so clear,
The Buddha Way, banishing all fear.
We gained a blessing, strong and true,
We clap our hands, and hail to you.
Folks always burdened, full of pain,
Blind and without a guide, through sun and rain.
They didn't know the way to ease their plight,
Couldn't find liberation, in the darkest night.
For so long, evil destinies grew strong,
And fewer gods sang their joyful song.
From darkness deep, to darker still,
Never heard a Buddha's name, against their will.
But now the Buddha, he has found the light,
A peaceful, unconditioned way, so pure and bright.
We and the spirits, down below and high,
Got the greatest blessing, reaching for the sky.
So we all bow our heads, and humbly pray,
To the supreme Honored One, at the close of day.
At that time, the sixteen princes, having praised the Buddha in verse, requested the World-Honored One to turn the Dharma wheel. They all said: "World-Honored One, when you preach the Dharma, you bring great peace, compassion, and benefit to the gods and humans." They spoke again in verse:
The World Hero, ain't no equal, it's true,
Adorned with blessings, a hundred or two.
Supreme wisdom, he done surely attained,
We wish you'd preach, let your wisdom be rained.
To save and liberate, us from this plight,
And all sentient beings, in the day and the night.
Please differentiate, reveal it for all to see,
So we can reach that wisdom, set our spirits free.
If we find Buddhahood, all souls will align,
The World-Honored One, knows what's deep in the mind.
He knows the paths they walk, through shadows and light,
And the power of their wisdom, burning ever so bright.
Their desires and pleasures, their blessings they sow,
And the karma they've gathered, from lives long ago.
The World-Honored One, he knows every single thing,
So turn that supreme wheel, let the sweet dharma sing.
The Buddha said to all the monks: "When Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Buddha attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, the five hundred million million Buddha worlds in each of the ten directions shook in six ways. The dark, remote places in between these lands, which the light and majesty of the sun and moon could not reach, were all brightly illuminated. The sentient beings within them were able to see one another and all said: 'How is it that sentient beings have suddenly appeared here?' And the heavenly palaces in their lands, and even the Brahma palaces, all shook in six ways. A great light universally shone, filling all the worlds, surpassing the light of the gods."
"At that time, in the eastern five hundred million million worlds, the Brahma palaces shone with a light that was double their usual brightness. The Brahma Kings all thought: 'The light of our palaces is something we have never had before. For what reason is this sign appearing?' At that time, all the Brahma Kings went to each other and discussed this matter. In their assembly, there was a great Brahma King named Savior-of-All, who spoke to the assembly of Brahmas in verse, saying:
A light shines bright in every hall,
A sight we've never seen before at all.
We gotta find out, what's the reason why,
Let's search together, beneath this mystic sky.
Has a great and virtuous god come into being?
Or a Buddha appeared, for all the world's seeing?
This mighty light, it shines so far and wide,
Ten directions bathed, with nowhere left to hide.
At that time, the five hundred million million Brahma Kings of those lands, together with their palaces, each filled their robes with heavenly flowers and went to the west to search for the cause of this sign. They saw Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata at the place of enlightenment, under the bodhi tree, sitting on a lion's seat. He was revered and surrounded by gods, dragon kings, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and others. They also saw the sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel.
The Brahma Kings immediately bowed their heads at the Buddha's feet, circled him a hundred thousand times, and then scattered heavenly flowers upon the Buddha. The flowers they scattered were as numerous as Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi tree, which was ten yojanas high. After offering the flowers, they each offered their palaces to that Buddha and said: "Please have compassion and benefit us. We wish that you would accept the palaces we have offered." At that time, the Brahma Kings, in the presence of the Buddha, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:
World-Honored One, you're a sight so rare,
Hard to find, beyond compare.
Got that boundless merit, true and deep,
Watchin' over all, my soul to keep.
Teacher of gods and humans, great and grand,
Compassion for this weary land.
Every soul, from east to west,
Receives your favor, puts 'em to the test.
We came from lands, a million miles away,
Left sweet meditation, couldn't stay.
Gotta bring our offerings, reverent and low,
To the Buddha, watchin' our spirits grow.
Our palaces, built on blessings from old,
Shinin' bright, a story untold.
Now we lay 'em down, for you to see,
World-Honored One, accept 'em compassionately.
At that time, the Brahma Kings, having praised the Buddha in verse, each said: "We only wish that the World-Honored One would turn the Dharma wheel, to save and liberate all sentient beings and open the way to nirvana." The Brahma Kings, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:
World Hero, Honored One, so true,
We only wish you'd share the Dharma, new.
With great compassion, hear our plea,
Save all who suffer, set them free.
At that time, Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata silently gave his permission.
"Furthermore, monks, in the southeastern five hundred million million worlds, the great Brahma Kings each saw their own palaces shining with a light they had never had before. They were overjoyed and filled with a rare feeling. They immediately went to each other and discussed this matter. In their assembly, there was a great Brahma King named Great Compassion, who spoke to the assembly of Brahmas in verse, saying:
Tell me, why's this light shinin' so bright?
Never seen such glory in the dark of night.
Is some great, virtuous god been born anew,
Or a Buddha appeared, for me and for you?
This sign, it's a mystery, a sight so grand,
Gotta search for the meaning, across the whole land.
Through ten million worlds, we'll follow the gleam,
Walkin' and searchin', like in a sweet dream.
Yeah, most likely a Buddha, has come down to earth,
To save all the sufferin' and give new birth.
At that time, the five hundred million million Brahma Kings, together with their palaces, each filled their robes with heavenly flowers and went to the northwest to search for the cause of this sign. They saw Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata at the place of enlightenment, under the bodhi tree, sitting on a lion's seat. He was revered and surrounded by gods, dragon kings, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and others. They also saw the sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel.
The Brahma Kings then bowed their heads at the Buddha's feet, circled him a hundred thousand times, and then scattered heavenly flowers upon the Buddha. The flowers they scattered were as numerous as Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi tree. After offering the flowers, they each offered their palaces to that Buddha and said: "Please have compassion and benefit us. We wish that you would accept the palaces we have offered." At that time, the Brahma Kings, in the presence of the Buddha, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:
Holy master, king of all gods, yeah,
Voice like the kalaviṅka bird, singin' soft and low.
You got compassion for all us weary souls, Lord,
Now we bow down to you, payin' homage, lettin' our praises flow.
Oh, the World-Honored One, so mighty rare,
He just shows up once in a great, great while.
Hundred and eighty kalpas just passed on by,
Empty as a broken dream, with no Buddha to make us smile.
Three evil destinies, they were overflowin',
And the angels in heaven, their numbers were goin' down.
But now the Buddha's come to this troubled ol' world,
To be the light in the darkness, the eye for every lost and lonesome town.
You're the refuge for this weary ol' world, Lord,
You save and you protect, come what may.
You're the father of all us strugglin' souls,
Got that compassion, bringin' blessings every single day.
From the good times in our lives, way back in the past,
That's why we're here today, feelin' strong and true.
Able to meet the World-Honored One, yeah,
Singin' these blues of gratitude, just for you.
At that time, the Brahma Kings, having praised the Buddha in verse, each said: "We only wish that the World-Honored One, out of compassion for all, would turn the Dharma wheel and save sentient beings." The Brahma Kings, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:
Great sage, turn that Dharma wheel, yeah,
And show us the true nature, so clear.
Save these suffering souls, lost and down,
Bring 'em great joy, all over this town.
When folks hear this Dharma, hear what I say,
They'll find the Way, or reach heaven someday.
Bad times gonna lessen, you just wait and see,
Goodness and patience, gonna grow strong and free.
At that time, Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata silently gave his permission.
"Furthermore, monks, in the southern five hundred million million worlds, the great Brahma Kings each saw their own palaces shining with a light they had never had before. They were overjoyed and filled with a rare feeling. They immediately went to each other and discussed this matter: 'For what reason do our palaces have this light?' In their assembly, there was a great Brahma King named Wonderful-Dharma, who spoke to the assembly of Brahmas in verse, saying:
The light in all our palaces, oh, it shines so bright and grand,
A majestic and brilliant glow, across this weary land.
This ain't without a reason, no, a cause we ought to find,
Gotta search for why this sign is here, and leave no truth behind.
For more than a hundred thousand years, this ain't a sight we've known,
Never seen this sign before, on a path we've always sown.
Is a great and virtuous god born, come to ease our troubled mind?
Or has a Buddha appeared in the world, the lost and weary to find?
At that time, the five hundred million million Brahma Kings, together with their palaces, each filled their robes with heavenly flowers and went to the north to search for the cause of this sign. They saw Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata at the place of enlightenment, under the bodhi tree, sitting on a lion's seat. He was revered and surrounded by gods, dragon kings, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and others. They also saw the sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel.
The Brahma Kings then bowed their heads at the Buddha's feet, circled him a hundred thousand times, and then scattered heavenly flowers upon the Buddha. The flowers they scattered were as numerous as Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi tree. After offering the flowers, they each offered their palaces to that Buddha and said: "Please have compassion and benefit us. We wish that you would accept the palaces we have offered." At that time, the Brahma Kings, in the presence of the Buddha, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:
The World-Honored One, so hard to find,
Breaks through the troubles of every kind.
After a long, long time, we finally see,
His wisdom shines for you and me.
He fills the hungry, he fills the dry,
With the Dharma rain from up on high.
Never seen such a man, so wise and deep,
Secrets of the ages, he does keep.
Like the udumbara, rare and true,
Today, our encounter, fresh and new.
Light in our palaces, a golden gleam,
Living out this wonderful dream.
World-Honored One, your heart's so grand,
Just wish you'd take us by the hand.
At that time, the Brahma Kings, having praised the Buddha in verse, each said: "We only wish that the World-Honored One would turn the Dharma wheel, so that all the world, gods, Māra, Brahmā, śramaṇas, and brahmins may all gain peace and be liberated." The Brahma Kings, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:
We only wish the Honored One, of gods and humans too,
Would turn that supreme Dharma wheel, and see us all anew.
Beat that great Dharma drum, let the rhythm fill the air,
And blow that great Dharma conch, chasing away our care.
Universally pour that great Dharma rain, let it wash away the pain,
And save immeasurable sentient beings, again and again.
We all bow and request you, with a heartfelt, soulful plea,
To expound a profound and far-reaching sound, and set our spirits free.
At that time, Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata silently gave his permission. The Brahma Kings from the southwest, and all the way to the nadir, were also like this.
At that time, the five hundred million million Brahma Kings of the zenith also saw their palaces shining with a majestic and brilliant light they had never had before. They were overjoyed and filled with a rare feeling. They immediately went to each other and discussed this matter: "For what reason do our palaces have this light?" In their assembly, there was a great Brahma King named Śikhin, who spoke to the assembly of Brahmas in verse, saying:
Oh, why do our grand halls now shine so bright,
With a glory we ain't ever seen, day or night?
Such a majestic glow, a brilliant sheen,
A wonder in this world, if you know what I mean.
This wondrous sign, it just ain't right,
Never heard a whisper, never seen such a light.
Has a great, good God now come to birth,
Or a Buddha's sweet presence graced this earth?
At that time, the five hundred million million Brahma Kings, together with their palaces, each filled their robes with heavenly flowers and went to the nadir to search for the cause of this sign. They saw Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata at the place of enlightenment, under the bodhi tree, sitting on a lion's seat. He was revered and surrounded by gods, dragon kings, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and others. They also saw the sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel.
The Brahma Kings then bowed their heads at the Buddha's feet, circled him a hundred thousand times, and then scattered heavenly flowers upon the Buddha. The flowers they scattered were as numerous as Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi tree. After offering the flowers, they each offered their palaces to that Buddha and said: "Please have compassion and benefit us. We wish that you would accept the palaces we have offered." At that time, the Brahma Kings, in the presence of the Buddha, with a single mind and voice, spoke in verse:
It's good to see the Buddhas, saviors of the world, so true,
Gonna save all us sentient beings, from these three realms, me and you.
The wise and honored One, of gods and humans too,
Got compassion for all creatures, gonna see us through.
Open up that sweet dew gate, let it flow so wide,
Gonna save us all, ain't nowhere to hide.
Past so many kalpas, passed without a sound,
No Buddha in this world, just darkness all around.
Three evil destinies risin', asuras too,
Gods were gettin' smaller, didn't know what to do.
Most folks went down bad roads, when their time was through.
Didn't hear the Dharma, just did unwholesome deeds,
Lost their strength and wisdom, planted sorrowful seeds.
Sinful karma's burden, happiness took flight,
Wrong views held 'em captive, lost in the dark of night.
Didn't know no goodness, couldn't find the light.
No Buddha to convert 'em, just fell to evil's sway,
But the Buddha's the eye of the world, shines a long, long day.
Out of pure compassion, he steps into this strife,
Found true enlightenment, gonna save every life.
Oh, we're so joyful, filled with brand new life.
All the other assemblies, they rejoice and praise,
For this light that's shinin', through these long, dark days.
Our palaces are adorned, with this light so grand,
Offer them to the World-Honored One, with a blessin' hand.
Just wish you'd accept 'em, across this weary land.
May this merit reach all beings, from shore to distant shore,
May we and all creation, walk the Buddha Way, and nothing more.
At that time, the five hundred million million Brahma Kings, having praised the Buddha in verse, each said to the Buddha: "We only wish that the World-Honored One would turn the Dharma wheel, to bring great peace and to liberate many." The Brahma Kings then spoke in verse:
World-Honored One, turn the Dharma wheel,
Beat the Dharma drum of sweet dew,
Save the suffering and afflicted sentient beings,
And reveal the Way to nirvana.
We only wish that you would accept our request,
And with your great and subtle voice,
Out of compassion, expound
The Dharma that you have gathered for immeasurable kalpas.
At that time, Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Tathagata accepted the request of the Brahma Kings of the ten directions and the sixteen princes. He then, in three ways, turned the twelve-linked Dharma wheel—which no śramaṇa, Brahmin, god, demon, Brahmā, or anyone in the world could turn. He taught that "This is suffering, this is the accumulation of suffering, this is the extinction of suffering, and this is the Way to the extinction of suffering." And he widely preached the Dharma of the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination: "From ignorance comes volitional formations; from volitional formations comes consciousness; from consciousness comes name and form; from name and form comes the six sense faculties; from the six sense faculties comes contact; from contact comes sensation; from sensation comes craving; from craving comes grasping; from grasping comes existence; from existence comes birth; from birth comes old age, death, sorrow, grief, suffering, and affliction. When ignorance is extinguished, volitional formations are extinguished; when volitional formations are extinguished, consciousness is extinguished; when consciousness is extinguished, name and form are extinguished; when name and form are extinguished, the six sense faculties are extinguished; when the six sense faculties are extinguished, contact is extinguished; when contact is extinguished, sensation is extinguished; when sensation is extinguished, craving is extinguished; when craving is extinguished, grasping is extinguished; when grasping is extinguished, existence is extinguished; when existence is extinguished, birth is extinguished; when birth is extinguished, old age, death, sorrow, grief, and suffering are all extinguished."
When the Buddha preached this Dharma in the midst of the assembly of gods and humans, six hundred million million nayuta people, because they did not accept any conditioned phenomena, had their minds liberated from all defilements. They all attained profound and subtle meditation, the three wisdoms, and the six supernatural powers, and were complete in the eight liberations. When he preached for the second, third, and fourth time, tens of millions of millions of sentient beings, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and as many as nayutas, also had their minds liberated from all defilements because they did not accept any conditioned phenomena. From this time on, the assemblies of śrāvakas were immeasurable and boundless, beyond calculation.
At that time, the sixteen princes all renounced their homes as youths and became śrāmaṇeras (novice monks). Their faculties were sharp and their wisdom was clear. They had previously made offerings to hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, had cultivated pure conduct, and were seeking Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Together, they said to the Buddha: “World-Honored One, these immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of great śrāvakas have all attained their goal. World-Honored One, you should also preach the Dharma of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi for us. When we have heard it, we will all cultivate and learn it together. World-Honored One, we aspire to the Tathagata’s wisdom and insight. Our deepest thoughts are known by the Buddha himself.” At that time, among the multitude that the wheel-turning holy king led, eighty million people saw the sixteen princes renounce their homes and also asked to do so. The king immediately gave his permission.
At that time, that Buddha accepted the request of the śrāmaṇeras. After two hundred thousand kalpas, he then preached this Great Vehicle sutra in the midst of the four groups of the assembly, named the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a Dharma for Bodhisattvas protected and remembered by the Buddhas. When he had finished this sutra, the sixteen śrāmaṇeras, for the sake of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, all received, upheld, recited, and mastered it.
While this sutra was being preached, the sixteen Bodhisattva śrāmaṇeras all believed and accepted it, and among the śrāvaka assembly, some also believed and understood. The rest of the sentient beings, numbering millions of millions, all gave rise to doubt. The Buddha preached this sutra for eight thousand kalpas without ever resting. When he finished this sutra, he immediately entered a quiet room and dwelt in meditation for eighty-four thousand kalpas. At that time, the sixteen Bodhisattva śrāmaṇeras, knowing that the Buddha had entered the room and was dwelling in meditation, each ascended a Dharma seat. They also, for eighty-four thousand kalpas, widely expounded and differentiated the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma for the four groups of the assembly. Each of them saved and converted six hundred million million sentient beings, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, teaching, guiding, benefiting, and filling them with joy, and causing them to conceive the mind of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.
When Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom Buddha passed eighty-four thousand kalpas, he arose from his samadhi. He went to the Dharma seat and sat down calmly. He universally announced to the great assembly: “These sixteen Bodhisattva śrāmaṇeras are truly rare. Their faculties are sharp and their wisdom is clear. They have previously made offerings to immeasurable millions and hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas. Under all these Buddhas, they have constantly cultivated pure conduct, received and upheld the Buddha’s wisdom, and revealed it to sentient beings, causing them to enter it. You should all constantly be close to them and make offerings to them. Why? If a śrāvaka, a pratyekabuddha, or a Bodhisattva is able to believe in and accept the Dharma preached by these sixteen Bodhisattvas and uphold it without destroying it, this person will all attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi and the wisdom of the Tathagata.”
The Buddha said to all the monks: “These sixteen Bodhisattvas always delight in preaching this Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma. Each of these Bodhisattvas converted six hundred million million sentient beings, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. In every lifetime, they were born with the Bodhisattvas, heard the Dharma from them, and all believed and understood. Because of this cause, they were able to encounter four million million World-Honored Buddhas, and this will not come to an end in this lifetime.”
“Monks, I now tell you, those sixteen śrāmaṇeras who were disciples of that Buddha have all now attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi and are currently preaching the Dharma in the lands of the ten directions. They have immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of Bodhisattvas and śrāvakas as their retinues. The two śrāmaṇeras in the east have become Buddhas; one is named Akshobhya, in the land of Joy, and the other is named Sumeru-Peak. In the southeast are two Buddhas; one is named Lion-Sound, and the other is named Lion-Form. In the south are two Buddhas; one is named Dwelling-in-Space, and the other is named Constant-Extinction. In the southwest are two Buddhas; one is named King-Form, and the other is named Brahmā-Form. In the west are two Buddhas; one is named Amitābha, and the other is named Savior-of-All-Worldly-Sufferings. In the northwest are two Buddhas; one is named Tāmalapattra-Sandalwood-Fragrance Supernatural-Power, and the other is named Sumeru-Form. In the north are two Buddhas; one is named Cloud-Sovereign, and the other is named Cloud-Sovereign-King. The Buddha in the northeast is named Destroyer-of-All-Worldly-Fears. The sixteenth is myself, Śākyamuni Buddha, who has attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi in this Saha land.”
“Monks, when we were śrāmaṇeras, we each converted immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of sentient beings, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, for the sake of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Some of these sentient beings are now dwelling on the śrāvaka ground. I always teach them Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. These people should gradually enter the Buddha Way with this Dharma. Why? Because the Tathagata’s wisdom is difficult to believe and difficult to comprehend. The sentient beings, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, who were converted at that time, are all of you monks and the śrāvaka disciples in the future after my passing away. After my passing away, there will be other disciples who do not hear this sutra and do not know or realize the practices of a Bodhisattva. They will think of the merits they have attained as extinction and will enter nirvana. I will then become a Buddha in another land, with a different name. These people, although they think they have attained extinction and have entered nirvana, will, in that land, seek the Buddha’s wisdom and hear this sutra. It is only with the One Buddha Vehicle that they will attain extinction; there is no other vehicle, except when the Tathagatas preach with expedient means.”
“Monks, if the Tathagata knows that the time of his nirvana is approaching, and the assembly is pure, their belief and understanding are firm, they have realized the Dharma of emptiness, and have entered deep meditation, he then gathers the Bodhisattvas and the śrāvaka assemblies and preaches this sutra. In the world, there are no two vehicles that can attain extinction, only the One Buddha Vehicle can attain extinction. Monks, you should know that the Tathagata, with his expedient means, deeply penetrates the nature of sentient beings. If they delight in the small Dharma and are deeply attached to the five desires, for the sake of these people, he preaches nirvana. When these people hear it, they will then believe and accept it.”
The Parable of the Phantom City (Prose)
“Imagine a difficult and dangerous evil road of five hundred yojanas, a desolate and uninhabited place of fear. If there is a great multitude who wishes to pass through this road to reach a place of treasures, there is a guide who is intelligent and wise, and who skillfully knows the dangerous road and its open and blocked passages. He leads the multitude, wishing to pass through this danger.
In the middle of the journey, the multitude becomes weary and wants to turn back. They say to the guide: ‘We are exhausted and also afraid, and we cannot go on. The road ahead is still far, and we wish to turn back.’ The guide, who has many expedient means, thinks to himself: ‘These people are pitiful. How can they abandon the great treasures and want to turn back?’ Having thought this, he uses the power of his expedient means and creates a phantom city in the dangerous road, at the distance of three hundred yojanas. He tells the multitude: ‘You should not be afraid or turn back. You can stop and rest in this great city. You can do whatever you wish. When you enter this city, you will be at ease and peaceful. If you can go on to the treasure place, you can also leave.’
At that time, the exhausted multitude was filled with great joy and praised this as something they had never had. ‘We have now escaped this evil road and have gained peace and comfort.’ The multitude then went into the phantom city, and they thought they had been saved and had found peace. At that time, the guide, knowing that these people had rested and were no longer weary, extinguished the phantom city and said to the multitude: ‘You should go on now! The treasure place is near. The great city you just saw was created by me as a place to rest.’”
The Buddha’s Application of the Parable
“Monks, the Tathagata is also like this. I am now your great guide. I know that the evil path of life, death, and afflictions is dangerous, difficult, and long, and should be left and transcended. If sentient beings only heard about the One Buddha Vehicle, they would not want to see the Buddha or be close to him, and would think: ‘The Buddha Way is long and far, and one can only attain it after a long time of diligence and suffering.’ The Buddha knows this timid and lowly mindset and, with the power of expedient means, for the sake of giving them a place to rest in the middle of the path, he preaches the two nirvanas. When sentient beings dwell on the two grounds, the Tathagata then tells them: ‘What you have done is not yet complete. The ground you dwell on is near the Buddha’s wisdom. You should observe and weigh that the nirvana you have attained is not the true one. It is only the power of the Tathagata’s expedient means that, for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle, differentiates and speaks of three.’ It is like that guide who, for the sake of a rest, creates a phantom city. When he knows they are rested, he tells them: ‘The treasure place is near. This city is not real; I created it for you.’”
The Parable of the Phantom City (Verse)
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
The Buddha Great-Thoroughly-Triumphant-Wisdom,
Sat for ten kalpas, but his light grew dim.
The Dharmas didn't shine, the Way he couldn't find,
Just darkness on his soul and trouble on his mind.

All the gods and spirits, dragon kings so grand,
Asura assemblies, a heavenly band.
They rained down pretty flowers, a sweet, soft, falling dew,
To that struggling Buddha, they made their offerings true.

The gods they beat their drums, a rhythm deep and low,
Played all kinds of music, watched the fragrant breezes blow.
Withered flowers flew away, new ones started to appear,
Chasin' out the shadows, banishin' all fear.

After ten long kalpas, he finally found his stride,
Attained the Buddha Way, with nowhere left to hide.
The hearts of gods and people, they all began to sing,
Filled with joy and delight, the happiness it did bring.

That Buddha had sixteen sons, all with their retinue,
Millions upon millions, saw his wisdom shining through.
They bowed down at his feet, in a humble, hopeful plea,
"Turn the Dharma wheel, set our spirits free."

"May the Dharma rain, from the holy lion fall,
Satisfy our hunger, answer every call.
World-Honored One, so hard to meet, a rare and precious sight,
To awaken all livin' beings, you shake 'em with your light."

In the eastern worlds, five hundred million deep,
The Brahma palaces shone, secrets they did keep.
A light they'd never witnessed, blazing, bright and bold,
A story for the ages, forever to be told.

When the Brahmas saw that sign, they hurried to his place,
Scattered pretty flowers, with smiles upon their face.
They offered up their palaces, with devotion strong and true,
"Turn the Dharma wheel, there's so much work to do."

They praised him with their verses, a sweet and soulful sound,
But the Buddha knew the time, was not yet to be found.
He accepted their request, then sat in silence deep,
While the sacred mysteries, he still had left to keep.

Three directions, four diagonals, above and down below,
They scattered all their flowers, watched the offerings flow.
"World-Honored One, so hard to meet, your wisdom we embrace,
With your great compassion, please show us saving grace."

"Open up the gate of sweet dew, let your mercy pour,"
"Turn the supreme Dharma wheel, we can't ask for much more."
The World-Honored One, with wisdom deep and vast,
Accepted that assembly's plea, a love that's built to last.

He preached the various Dharmas, a lesson clear and plain,
The Four Noble Truths, washin' away the pain.
The Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, how it all takes hold,
From ignorance to old age and death, a story to unfold.

"All exists by birth's condition, a chain we must unbind,
You should all know such faults and suffering, for all of humankind."
When he laid down this Dharma, six hundred million strong,
Reached the end of all their suffering, where they truly do belong.

They all became arhats, free from every ill,
When he preached for the second time, standing strong and still.
Millions of millions of beings, like the Ganges' flowing sand,
Didn't accept the Dharmas, became arhats in the land.

From then on, those who found the Way, their number couldn't be told,
Calculations of a million kalpas, a story to unfold.
At that time, sixteen princes, left their homes, a solemn vow,
Became young śrāmaṇeras, asking "Teach us now!"

"Expound the Great Vehicle Dharma, with wisdom clear and bright,
We and our whole retinue, will see the Buddha's light.
We wish to be like you, World-Honored One, so pure and grand,
Whose wisdom eye is supreme, across this troubled land."

The Buddha knew their hearts, the practices they'd known,
With immeasurable causes, the seeds that they had sown.
With all kinds of parables, he made the message clear,
Preached the six pāramitās, banishin' all fear.

And the matter of supernatural powers, mysteries revealed,
Differentiated true Dharma, on this sacred field.
The path that Bodhisattvas practice, with strength and gentle hand,
He preached this Lotus Sutra, across the troubled land.

In verses like the Ganges' sands, a never-ending flow,
When that Buddha finished preaching, a quiet room he did go.
Into deep meditation, for eighty-four thousand kalpas, long and still,
While the śrāmaṇeras knew, he hadn't moved his will.

For immeasurable millions, they preached his wisdom high,
Each sat on a Dharma seat, beneath the boundless sky.
Preaching this Great Vehicle sutra, while the Buddha kept his pace,
Expounded and helped in his Dharma conversion, with an easy, gentle grace.

Each and every śrāmaṇera, converted all they found,
From six hundred million million, on holy, sacred ground.
To as many as the Ganges' sands, when that Buddha passed away,
All who heard the Dharma, saw a brand new day.

In all the Buddha lands, born together with their guides,
These sixteen śrāmaṇeras, where the wisdom now resides.
After practicing the Buddha Way, completely, true, and bright,
Are now in the ten directions, shining forth their light.

Each attained true enlightenment, a beacon in the night,
Those who heard the Dharma then, are now bathing in their light.
At the place of each of those Buddhas, where their wisdom freely flows,
Those who dwell as śrāvakas, the Buddha Way now grows.

I was among the sixteen, I once preached to you all,
For this reason, with expedient means, I answered every call.
I guided you to Buddha's wisdom, a path both pure and deep,
It's because of this past connection, the promises I keep.

That I now preach the Lotus Sutra, so listen to my plea,
To cause you to enter the Buddha Way, just follow me.
You must not be surprised, no reason to be afraid,
A journey through the darkness, a life completely made.

It's like a dangerous and evil road, where shadows creep and crawl,
A distant, desolate place, where poisonous beasts enthrall.
Without water or grass, a place that people fear,
But a guide can lead you through, when the path is rough and sheer.

An immeasurable number of millions, on this perilous track,
Wish to pass through this dangerous road, there's no turning back.
The road is vast and far, five hundred yojanas long,
But a strong, intelligent guide, will help you overcome the wrong.

His mind is clear and firm, he helps the multitude in danger's way,
But the multitude is weary, they cry out, "No more today!"
They say to the wise guide, "We're completely exhausted now,
And wish to turn back from here, we're ready to take a bow."

The guide thinks to himself, with a pitiful, sad sigh,
"How can they wish to turn back, and let the great treasures lie?"
He immediately thinks of an expedient means, a plan so wise and bold,
And uses his supernatural power, a story to be told.

He creates a great city, with an outer wall so grand,
Adornin' it with houses, across the barren land.
Around, there are gardens and forests, canals and bathing ponds,
With tall gates and towers, a city that responds.

Filled with men and women, a phantom, sweet and kind,
He comforts the multitude, tells them "Peace of mind!"
"You can enter this city, do whatever you wish to do,"
And when the people enter, their hearts are filled with joy anew.

They feel at peace and at ease, they think they've found their rest,
The guide knows they are rested, put to the ultimate test.
He gathers all the multitude, says, "You should go on now, my friend,
This is just a phantom city, not the journey's end."

"I saw that you were weary, wished to turn back from the start,
So with the power of expedient means, I healed your broken heart.
I temporarily created this city, a rest stop on the way,
You must now diligently progress, and we'll reach a brighter day."

"We will go together, to the place where treasures gleam,"
I am also like this, the guide in every dream.
I see all who seek the Way, get lazy, give up hope,
Unable to pass through the road, with its dangerous, slippery slope.

Of life, death, and all afflictions, the burdens that we bear,
So with the power of expedient means, for their rest, I declare:
I preach nirvana, "Your suffering is extinguished, don't you see?
What you had to do is completed, now you can be free."

When they know they've reached nirvana, and all have come to be,
Arhats, pure and shining, for all the world to see,
Then I gather the great assembly, preach the true Dharma's light,
The Buddhas use the power of expedient means, to make the wrong things right.

To differentiate and speak, of the three vehicles so grand,
But there is only the One Buddha Vehicle, across this weary land.
The two were spoken of as a rest stop, a temporary, sweet release,
Now I will tell you the truth, to bring your soul to peace.

What you have attained is not true extinction, a lesson to behold,
To attain the Buddha's All-Knowing Wisdom, a story to be told.
You must give rise to great diligence, let your spirit softly gleam,
When you have realized All-Knowing Wisdom, like a sweet and gentle dream.

The ten powers, and other Dharmas, of the Buddha, pure and bright,
And are complete in the thirty-two marks, that is the true extinction's light.
The guides of all Buddhas, preach nirvana as a stop,
When they know it is a rest stop, they lead them to the top.

Into the Buddha's wisdom, where peace and joy reside,
With open hearts and spirits, and nothing left to hide.

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Volume Four
Translated by Tripitaka Master Kumarajiva of the Kucha Kingdom in the Later Qin Dynasty, by imperial decree.


Chapter 8: Bestowal of Prophecies upon Five Hundred Disciples

At that time, Pūrṇa-Maitrāyaṇīputra, having heard from the Buddha this wisdom of expedient means, this preaching of the Dharma according to what is appropriate, and having heard the prophecies for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi for the great disciples, and having heard of the past life karmic connections, and having heard of the great supernatural powers of the Buddhas, felt an unprecedented joy and purity in his heart.
He immediately rose from his seat, went before the Buddha, bowed his head at the Buddha's feet, and then stood to one side, looking up at the revered face of the Buddha without taking his eyes off him. He thought: "The World-Honored One is so wonderful and rare! He follows the various natures of the world and preaches the Dharma with the wisdom of expedient means, pulling sentient beings out of their attachments everywhere. We cannot express the merits of the Buddha in words. Only the World-Honored One can know our deepest hearts and our original vows."
At that time, the Buddha said to all the monks: "Do you all see this Pūrṇa-Maitrāyaṇīputra? I always praise him as the foremost among those who preach the Dharma. I also constantly praise his various merits. He is diligent in protecting and assisting in the preaching of my Dharma. He can guide and benefit the four groups of the assembly, fully explaining the true Dharma of the Buddha and bringing great benefit to those who practice the same pure conduct. Other than the Tathagata himself, there is no one who can exhaust his eloquence and debate."
"You should not think that Pūrṇa is only able to protect and assist in the preaching of my Dharma. In the past, under ninety million Buddhas, he also protected and assisted in the preaching of the true Dharma of the Buddhas. Among those who preached the Dharma, he was also the foremost. Moreover, he has a clear and unhindered understanding of the Dharma of emptiness preached by the Buddhas, and he has attained the four unhindered wisdoms. He can always preach the Dharma purely with careful consideration, without any doubt, and is complete in the supernatural powers of a Bodhisattva. Throughout his life, he always cultivated pure conduct. The people of those Buddha worlds all truly believed him to be a śrāvaka. But Pūrṇa, with these expedient means, brought benefit to immeasurable hundreds of thousands of sentient beings, and he also converted immeasurable asaṃkhyeya people, causing them to establish the resolve for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. For the sake of purifying a Buddha land, he constantly does the work of a Buddha and converts sentient beings."
"Monks, Pūrṇa was also the foremost among those who preached the Dharma under the Seven Buddhas of the past, and he is the foremost among those who preach the Dharma under me today. Among the Buddhas who will appear in the Bhadrakalpa (the present auspicious kalpa), he will also be the foremost among those who preach the Dharma. He will also protect and assist in the preaching of the Dharma of immeasurable and boundless Buddhas in the future, converting and benefiting immeasurable sentient beings and causing them to establish the resolve for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. For the sake of purifying a Buddha land, he will always diligently progress in converting sentient beings and will gradually be complete in the Bodhisattva Way. After immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, he will, in this very land, attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, with the title Dharma-Light Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One."
That Buddha will have a Buddha land as vast as the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, and the ground will be made of the seven treasures, level as a palm, without any mountains, hills, streams, valleys, or ditches. Jeweled towers and pavilions will fill it. The palaces of the gods will be close to the sky, and humans and gods will be able to see one another. There will be no evil destinies and no women. All sentient beings will be born by transformation and will have no sexual desire. They will have great supernatural powers, and light will emanate from their bodies. They will be able to fly freely, their resolve will be firm, they will be diligent in their wisdom, and all of them will have golden bodies adorned with the thirty-two marks. The sentient beings in that land will always have two kinds of food: one, the food of Dharma joy, and two, the food of meditation joy. There will be an immeasurable number of asaṃkhyeya tens of millions of nayuta Bodhisattva assemblies, who have attained great supernatural powers and the four unhindered wisdoms, and who are skilled at converting all kinds of sentient beings. The śrāvaka assemblies will be so numerous they cannot be known by calculation. They will all be complete in the six supernatural powers, the three wisdoms, and the eight liberations. That Buddha land will be adorned with these immeasurable merits. The kalpa will be named Jewel-Light, and the land will be named Good-Purification. The Buddha's life span will be immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas. The Dharma will remain for a very long time. After the Buddha's passing, seven-jeweled stupas will be erected, filling his land.
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Monks, lend an ear, let the truth unfold,
The Buddha's son, a story to be told.
He walks the path, with means so sly and deep,
His every move, a secret he does keep.
He sees the souls, who crave the small delight,
And fear the wisdom, grand and shining bright.
So Bodhisattvas, with a humble guise,
Like śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas rise.
With countless tricks, they turn the hearts of man,
Converting all, according to their plan.
They say they're śrāvakas, far from the Buddha's call,
But countless beings they save, and stand up tall.
Though small their wants, and lazy they may seem,
They'll rise to Buddhas, fulfilling every dream.
Inside, the practice of a Bodhisattva's kept,
Outside, a śrāvaka, while the world has slept.
They crave so little, from this life they shrink,
Yet purifying lands, on the very brink.
They show the poisons, three in number strong,
And even wrong views, where they don't belong.
My own disciples, they are just the same,
Using sly means, to spread the saving flame.
If I told all, their changes, every one,
Doubt would fill hearts, before the day was done.
Now Pūrṇa here, a man of steadfast ways,
Served countless Buddhas, through a thousand days.
He helped them preach, their Dharma clear and true,
For wisdom's sake, beneath the sky so blue.
He stood above, the disciples of his time,
Heard much and learned, with wisdom so sublime.
He preached without fear, made the assembly cheer,
Never grew weary, banishing all fear.
Great powers he gained, with wisdom, sharp and keen,
Knowing all minds, the dull, the bright, unseen.
He preached the Dharma, pure and free from stain,
Teaching millions, easing all their pain.
Leading to the Vehicle, grand and wide,
His own Buddha land, where good things will abide.
In future times, more Buddhas he will meet,
Offering gifts, from head down to his feet.
He'll guard the Dharma, true and ever bold,
And purify his land, a story to unfold.
With skillful means, he'll preach without a doubt,
Saving countless souls, putting fear to rout.
To All-Knowing Wisdom, he'll lead them on their way,
Serving Tathagatas, until the break of day.
Protecting Dharma's treasures, old and new,
Then Buddhahood he'll gain, with a light so true.
Dharma-Light his name, when his time is near,
Good-Purification, his land, banishing all fear.
Seven treasures gleaming, a sight to behold,
Jewel-Light the kalpa, a story to be told.
Bodhisattvas gather, a multitude so grand,
With mighty powers, filling all the land.
Śrāvakas countless, with wisdom and release,
His monastic gathering, finding inner peace.
No sexual longing, in that land so bright,
Born pure and transformed, in the Dharma's light.
Their bodies adorned, with marks of grace and might,
Dharma joy their food, day and through the night.
No other craving, for what the world can bring,
No women there, no evil, everything's a spring. 
Pūrṇa-Maitrāyaṇīputra, his merits all complete, 
This pure land he'll gain, with sages at his feet.
These countless matters, I've spoken but a few,
The depth and glory, shining ever new.
At that time, the twelve hundred Arhats, whose minds were free, thought: "We are so joyful and have gained what we have never had. If the World-Honored One were to give each of us a prophecy like he did the other great disciples, would that not also be wonderful?"
The Buddha knew the thoughts in their hearts and said to Mahākāśyapa: "I will now give prophecies to these twelve hundred arhats, one by one, in your presence, for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. In this assembly, my great disciple, the monk Ajñāta-Kauṇḍinya, will make offerings to six hundred and twenty thousand million Buddhas and will then attain Buddhahood, with the title Universal-Light Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The five hundred arhats—Uruvilva-Kāśyapa, Gayā-Kāśyapa, Nadī-Kāśyapa, Kāludāyin, Udayin, Aniruddha, Revata, Kapphiṇa, Bakkula, Cunda, Svāgata, and others—will all attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, and their titles will all be the same, Universal-Light.”
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Now listen here, to a tale I'll impart,
Of Ajñāta-Kauṇḍinya, with a pure, searching heart.
He gonna see Buddhas, a sight to behold,
Through countless long kalpas, a story untold.
Yeah, he'll find true enlightenment, shining so bright,
Gonna beam out great light, day and through the long night.
Got them supernatural powers, complete and so grand,
His fame gonna echo, throughout every land.

Hear his name in the ten directions, a sweet, soulful sound,
Revered by all beings, wherever they're found.
He'll preach the supreme Way, with a wisdom so deep,
Universal-Light his title, secrets to keep.

His land gonna be pure, like a clear, morning dew,
Bodhisattvas so valiant, fierce and so true.
They'll climb them high towers, them pavilions so grand,
Travel through the ten directions, hand in glorious hand.

To offer up offerings, to the Buddhas above,
With hearts full of joy, and a whole lot of love.
Then back to their homeland, in a blink of an eye,
Such great supernatural power, reaching for the sky.

The Buddha's life span, sixty thousand kalpas strong,
The True Dharma double that, where it truly belongs.
The Dharma-Image double again, a sight to perceive,
When Dharma is gone, gods and humans gonna grieve.

Now the five hundred monks, one after the other,
Gonna reach Buddhahood, like a dear, loving brother.
Their title the same, Universal-Light they will be,
Prophecies given, for all eyes to see.

After my passing, someone's gonna rise,
Become a great Buddha, with wisdom in his eyes.
The world he converts, gonna look just like mine,
Adornments and purity, a truly divine design.

All them supernatural powers, shining so free,
Bodhisattva and śrāvaka, for all souls to see.
The True Dharma, Dharma-Image, a spiritual art,
The life span and kalpas, played right from the start.

Just like I said, it's gonna be just so,
Kāśyapa, you hear me, gotta let you know.
The five hundred arhats, free in their mind,
And them śrāvaka assemblies, of the same blessed kind.

For those not here with us, lost in the blue,
You gotta preach this message, carry it through.
At that time, the five hundred arhats, having received a prophecy in the presence of the Buddha, were filled with joy and delight. They immediately rose from their seats, went before the Buddha, and bowed their heads at his feet, repenting and reproaching themselves.
“World-Honored One, we always thought: ‘We have already attained ultimate extinction.’ But now we know we were like ignorant people. Why? We should have attained the Buddha's wisdom, but we were content with our little wisdom.”
The Parable of the Pearl in the Robe
“World-Honored One, it is like a person who goes to a friend's house and, having become drunk, falls asleep. At that time, the friend had an official matter to attend to and was about to leave. He took a priceless jewel and sewed it inside the person's robe and then went away. The person, being drunk and asleep, was completely unaware of it. When he woke up, he traveled to another country. For the sake of clothing and food, he diligently struggled to make a living. It was extremely difficult, and if he gained a little, he would be content with that.
Later, the friend met him by chance and said: ‘Hey, my good man! Why do you struggle for clothing and food like this? I wanted you to be happy and at ease and enjoy the five desires. On a certain day of a certain month in a certain year, I sewed a priceless jewel inside your robe, and it is still there now. But you do not know it, and you labor with great difficulty and worry to sustain your life. This is so foolish! You can now use this jewel to trade for whatever you need and can always have what you wish for, without any lack.’”
The Application of the Parable
“The Buddha is also like this. When you were a Bodhisattva, you taught and converted us, causing us to give rise to the mind for All-Knowing Wisdom. But we soon became neglectful and forgot it, and we were unaware of it. When we attained the arhat Way, we thought we had attained extinction. Like that man struggling to live, we gained a little and were content with it. But our vow for All-Knowing Wisdom was still there and was not lost.
Today, the World-Honored One has awakened us and said: ‘Monks, what you have attained is not ultimate extinction. I have long ago caused you to plant the good roots of a Buddha, and with expedient means, I showed you the form of nirvana, but you thought that you had truly attained extinction.’
World-Honored One, we now know that we are truly Bodhisattvas who will receive the prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Because of this, we are filled with great joy and have gained what we never had before.”
At that time, Ajñāta-Kauṇḍinya and others, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Peace in our hearts, nowhere else to be found.
Joy overflowing, a feeling so new,
Homage to Buddha, His wisdom so true.

Lord of the World, we stand here today,
Repent all our faults, then we kneel and we pray.
Buddha's rich treasures, a small bit we knew,
Thought it was enough, like a fool through and through.

Like a poor soul at a rich friend's door,
Feasting on goodies, then wanting no more.
Friend sews a jewel, deep in his robe's fold,
Gives it in silence, a story untold.

He sleeps through it all, then he wakes and he roams,
Seeks food and clothing, far from his own homes.
Life's a hard road, just a struggle to see,
Content with a pittance, as poor as can be.

Unaware of the jewel, hidden away,
In his own garment, come what may.
Friend finds him later, heart heavy with pain,
Shows him the jewel, again and again.

Poor man sees it, his spirit takes flight,
Joy fills his being, with all of its might.
With these possessions, all five desires he'll find,
Freedom to revel, leaving troubles behind.

We are the same, in this long, lonely night,
World-Honored One taught us, with love and with light.
Planted the vow, though we didn't quite know,
Ignorant, foolish, we watched our lives flow.

Small piece of nirvana, we thought it was grand,
Content with our lot, across this wide land.
Now Buddha awakens, says "This ain't the end,
True wisdom you'll find, on that, you depend."

Now we hear the prophecies, clear as a bell,
Glorious futures, a story to tell.
Bodies and minds, filled with joy, it is true,
Buddha's own wisdom, shining through and through.


Chapter 9: Bestowal of Prophecies upon Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas

At that time, Ānanda and Rāhula thought to themselves: "If we were to receive a prophecy, would that not also be wonderful?"
They immediately rose from their seats, went before the Buddha, bowed their heads at his feet, and together said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we too should have a share in this. Only in the Tathagata do we find our refuge. Moreover, we are known by all the worlds of gods, humans, and asuras. Ānanda has always been your attendant and has protected the Dharma treasury. Rāhula is your son. If the Buddha gives us a prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, our wishes will be fulfilled, and the hopes of the assembly will also be met."
At that time, the two thousand disciples who were still "learners" or were "non-learners" all rose from their seats, bared their right shoulders, went before the Buddha, joined their palms with a single mind, and looked up at the World-Honored One. Just like Ānanda and Rāhula, they stood to one side, holding the same wish.
Prophecy for Ānanda
At that time, the Buddha said to Ānanda: "In a future life, you will attain Buddhahood. Your title will be King of All-Penetrating-Wisdom of Mountains and Oceans Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.
You will serve sixty-two hundred million Buddhas and protect the Dharma treasury, and only then will you attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. You will convert twenty thousand million nayuta Bodhisattvas, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, and cause them to attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Your land will be named Banner of Constant-Victory, and its ground will be pure and made of lapis lazuli. The kalpa will be named Sound-Filling-Everything. The life span of that Buddha will be immeasurable millions of millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas. If a person were to try to calculate it over millions of millions of immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, they would not be able to know its length. The True Dharma will remain in the world for a period double his life span, and the Dharma-Image will last for double the True Dharma. Ānanda, this King of All-Penetrating-Wisdom of Mountains and Oceans Buddha will be universally praised by the immeasurable millions of millions of Tathagatas, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, in the ten directions, who will extol his merits."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Listen close now, hear what I say,
Among the monks, I declare this day:
Ānanda, keeper of the righteous way, 
He'll serve the Buddhas, come what may.
Then true enlightenment, he will find,
Leave all his earthly troubles behind.
King of All-Penetrating-Wisdom, they'll call his name,
Of Mountains and Oceans, fueling his sacred flame.
His land will be pure, a sight to behold,
Banner of Constant-Victory, a story untold.
Bodhisattvas he'll convert, like sands on the shore,
Their numbers are countless, seeking something more.
That Buddha's got majesty, a virtue so deep,
His fame fills ten directions, while the whole world does sleep.
His life span's immeasurable, a truth to embrace,
Compassion for all beings, in time and in space.
The True Dharma will double his life, so they say,
And the Dharma-Image doubles again, come what may.
Countless beings, like Ganges sands, so vast and wide,
In that Buddha's Dharma, the Buddha Way, they'll abide.
At that time, eight thousand newly resolved Bodhisattvas in the assembly all thought: "We have not even heard of great Bodhisattvas receiving such prophecies. What is the reason that these śrāvakas are receiving such a definitive promise?"
At that time, the World-Honored One, knowing the thoughts in the hearts of the Bodhisattvas, said to them: "Noble men, Ānanda and I gave rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi at the same time, under the Buddha King of Emptiness. Ānanda always delighted in hearing much, and I always cultivated diligent progress. For this reason, I have already attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, while Ānanda protects my Dharma and will also protect the Dharma treasury of all future Buddhas, converting and bringing to completion the assemblies of Bodhisattvas. His original vow was like this, and so he receives this prophecy."
When Ānanda heard the Buddha give him a prophecy in his presence and describe the adornments of his future land, all his wishes were fulfilled. His heart was filled with great joy and he felt an unprecedented happiness. He immediately recalled the Dharma treasuries of immeasurable millions of Buddhas from the past, and he understood them all without hindrance, just as he had heard the present Dharma, and he also remembered his original vow. At that time, Ānanda spoke in verse:
The World-Honored One, so rarely seen,
Got me lookin' back at where I've been.
Buddhas' teachings, a countless, flowing tide,
Like I'm hearing 'em for the first time, deep inside.

Now my doubts have all just faded away,
Settled on the Buddha's path, come what may.
I've served as an attendant, with a helpful hand,
Protecting those Dharmas, across the land.
Prophecy for Rāhula and the 2,000 Disciples
At that time, the Buddha said to Rāhula: "In a future life, you will attain Buddhahood. Your title will be Treading-on-Seven-Jeweled-Flowers Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. You will make offerings to a number of Buddhas as numerous as the dust motes in ten worlds. You will always be the eldest son of all the Buddhas, just as you are now. The land of this Treading-on-Seven-Jeweled-Flowers Buddha, his life span, the kalpa, the disciples he converts, the True Dharma, and the Dharma-Image will be no different from that of King of All-Penetrating-Wisdom of Mountains and Oceans Tathagata, and you will also be the eldest son of this Buddha. After this, you will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
When I was a young prince, a long time ago,
Rāhula, my eldest, watched my spirit grow.
Now I've found the Buddha Way, a truth deep and old,
And he's my Dharma son, a story to be told.

In lifetimes yet to come, a vision I can see,
He'll meet countless Buddhas, for all eternity.
He'll be their eldest son, with a heart pure and true,
Seeking the Buddha Way, in all that he will do.

Rāhula's secret walk, a path only I discern,
He plays my eldest son, for all the world to learn.
His merits, vast and grand, beyond all numbers known,
Settled in the Dharma, on wisdom's sacred throne.
At that time, the World-Honored One saw the two thousand disciples, both learners and non-learners, whose intentions were gentle, still, and pure, and who were looking at the Buddha with a single mind. The Buddha said to Ānanda: "Do you see these two thousand learners and non-learners?"
"Yes, I do," he replied.
"Ānanda, these people will make offerings to a number of Tathagatas as numerous as the dust motes in fifty worlds. They will show them respect and reverence and protect the Dharma treasury. In their final life, they will all simultaneously attain Buddhahood in the lands of the ten directions. Their title will all be the same: Jewel-Form Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. Their life span will be one kalpa. The adornments of their lands, their śrāvakas and Bodhisattvas, and their True Dharma and Dharma-Image will all be the same."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
These two thousand śrāvakas, standin' right before my eyes,
Gonna get their prophecies, reachin' for the skies.
Buddhas they will serve, countless as the dust, you see,
Guardin' Dharma's treasure, for all eternity.

In their lands so far, in directions ten they'll roam,
Same old title they will share, feelin' right at home.
Gonna sit in enlightenment, at the self-same time,
Reachin' for that wisdom, in a holy, sacred climb.

Jewel-Form their name will be, shinin' ever bright,
Lands and all their people, bathed in holy light.
True Dharma, Dharma-Image, all the same, no doubt,
Every single thing in common, shoutin' it all about.

With their wondrous powers, savin' every soul,
Hear their fame echo, makin' spirits whole.
Slowly into nirvana, they'll softly fade away,
Leavin' peace and wisdom, to light up every day.
At that time, the two thousand learners and non-learners, having heard the Buddha's prophecy, were filled with joy and delight and spoke in verse:
The World-Honored One, the lamp of wisdom bright,
We heard your prophecy, shinin' in the night.
Our hearts are filled with joy, it's plain to see,
Like sweet dew anointed, settin' our spirits free.



Chapter 10: A Teacher of the Dharma
At that time, the World-Honored One, addressing Bodhisattva Medicine King, said to the eighty thousand great beings: "Medicine King, do you see in this great assembly the immeasurable gods, dragon kings, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen? There are also those who seek the śrāvaka path, those who seek the pratyekabuddha path, and those who seek the Buddha Way. All of them, in my presence, who hear even one verse or one line of the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, or even rejoice for a single thought, I will give them all a prophecy that they will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."
The Buddha said to Medicine King: "Furthermore, after the Tathagata's passing away, if there is a person who hears even one verse or one line of the Lotus Sutra and rejoices for a single thought, I will also give them a prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. If there is a person who upholds, reads, recites, explains, or copies the Lotus Sutra, even a single verse, and reveres this scripture as if it were the Buddha himself, making various offerings—of flowers, incense, garlands, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silken canopies, banners, streamers, robes, and music—and even joins their palms in reverence, Medicine King, you should know that these people have already made offerings to a hundred thousand million Buddhas in the past. Under those Buddhas, they have fulfilled their great vows and, out of compassion for sentient beings, are born in this human world."
"Medicine King, if someone asks what kind of sentient beings will attain Buddhahood in a future life, you should show them these people and say that they will surely attain Buddhahood in a future life. Why? If a noble man or noble woman upholds, reads, recites, explains, or copies even a single line of the Lotus Sutra, and makes various offerings to the sutra scrolls—of flowers, incense, garlands, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silken canopies, banners, streamers, robes, and music, and joins their palms in reverence—this person should be looked up to by the entire world. He should be offered the same kind of offerings that are made to a Tathagata. You should know that this person is a great Bodhisattva who has fulfilled Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi and, out of compassion for sentient beings, has vowed to be born in this world to widely preach and differentiate the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma. How much greater is the merit for one who can fully uphold it and make all kinds of offerings?"
"Medicine King, you should know that this person, leaving the reward of his pure karma behind, is born into this evil world after my passing away, out of compassion for sentient beings, to widely preach this sutra. If this noble man or noble woman, after my passing away, is able to secretly preach the Lotus Sutra, even a single line, to one other person, you should know that this person is the Tathagata's envoy, sent by the Tathagata to do the Tathagata's work. How much more so for one who widely preaches it to a great assembly?"
"Medicine King, if there is an evil person who, with an unwholesome mind, constantly slanders and abuses the Buddha in the Buddha's presence for an entire kalpa, his sin is still light. But if a person, with a single evil word, slanders a layman or laywoman, or a monk or nun, who reads and recites the Lotus Sutra, their sin is much heavier."
"Medicine King, if a person reads and recites the Lotus Sutra, you should know that this person is adorning himself with the Buddha's adornments and is being carried on the Tathagata's shoulders. Wherever he goes, people should follow him and pay reverence, join their palms with a single mind, and make offerings to him with reverence, respect, and praise, with flowers, incense, garlands, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silken canopies, banners, streamers, robes, fine food, and music. They should make the most supreme offerings of humans to him. They should hold heavenly treasures and scatter them, and heavenly jewels should be offered to him. Why? Because this person preaches the Dharma with joy, and by listening to it for a moment, one can attain ultimate Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
If you want to walk the Buddha Way, child,
And find that wisdom, self-enlightened,
You gotta make your offerings, keep 'em strong and mild,
And hold that Lotus Sutra, day and night, unbrightened.

Now if you're lookin' for that All-Knowing mind,
Gotta hold this sutra close, you see,
And give to those who hold it, the generous, kind,
For they're preachin' truth for you and me.

Yeah, if there's one who can uphold, with a steady hand,
That Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, deep and true,
You know they're the Buddha's envoy, across the land,
Thinkin' of all beings, in shades of blues and gold, it's true.

All who can hold that Lotus Sutra, pure and bright,
They leave their heaven, so sweet and calm,
And they're born in this evil world, through the darkest night,
Out of compassion for others, keepin' us safe from harm.

You oughta know, such a soul, they're free to roam,
Wherever their spirit calls, they can be found,
And in this troubled world, they'll make their home,
Preachin' the highest Dharma, on holy ground.

So use your heavenly flowers, let the incense rise,
And those jeweled robes, from skies above,
And the wonderful treasures, before your very eyes,
To offer to the preacher, with all your love.

After I'm gone, in this world so hard and mean,
Those who can hold this sutra, strong and bold,
Greet 'em with joined palms, a reverent scene,
Like you're offerin' to the World-Honored, stories yet untold.

With fine food, sweet delicacies, a feast for the soul,
And robes of every color, a beautiful sight,
Offer to this Buddha's son, makin' him whole,
Just hopin' for a moment of Dharma, bathed in golden light.

If there's one in a future age, listen close and hear,
Who can hold this sutra, brave and grand,
I'll send him among humans, dispellin' every fear,
To do the Tathagata's work, across the troubled land.

Now for a whole long kalpa, if your mind ain't straight,
And with an angry face, you curse the Buddha's name,
You'll gather heavy sins, seals of a bitter fate,
An immeasurable burden, a burning, endless flame.

But if a soul who reads, recites, and holds this holy text,
That Lotus Sutra, precious and divine,
Is slandered with a single word, troubled and perplexed,
That sin is even heavier, a burden more malign.

If there's a soul who seeks the Buddha Way, so grand,
And for a whole long kalpa, with palms held high,
Joins 'em in my presence, across the land,
Praisin' me with countless verses, beneath the sky.

Because of this praise, the Buddha's name so sweet,
They'll gain immeasurable merits, a blessed reward,
But the merit of praisin' the one who holds this sutra, complete,
Is even greater, by far, revered and adored.

For eighty million kalpas, with colors bright and bold,
And the most wonderful sounds, a symphony to hear,
With smells and tastes and touches, stories to be told,
They make their offerings to the sutra holder, year after year.

After makin' such offerings, humble and sincere,
If they hear a moment of the Dharma, oh so sweet,
They oughta congratulate themselves, banishin' every fear,
"I've gained a great benefit now," from my head down to my feet.

Medicine King, I'm tellin' you now, listen to what I say,
Of all the sutras I have preached, near and far,
Among them, the Lotus Sutra, it lights the way,
The most supreme, my friend, like a shining, guiding star.
At that time, the Buddha again said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Medicine King: "Of the immeasurable millions of sutras that I have preached, am now preaching, and will preach, among them, this Lotus Sutra is the most difficult to believe and difficult to comprehend. Medicine King, this sutra is the secret treasury of the Buddhas. It should not be distributed or casually given to others. It is protected by the World-Honored Buddhas and has never been revealed until now. But even when the Tathagata is in the world, this sutra still draws many grudges and jealousies. How much more so after my passing away?"
"Medicine King, you should know that after the Tathagata's passing, anyone who is able to copy, uphold, read, recite, make offerings to, and preach this sutra to others, will be covered by the Tathagata’s robe and will be protected and remembered by the present Buddhas of the other directions. This person has great power of faith, the power of a great vow, and the power of all good roots. You should know that this person dwells with the Tathagata and that the Tathagata's hand has touched his head."
"Medicine King, in every place where this sutra is preached, read, recited, or copied, or wherever a scroll of this sutra is kept, you should erect a stupa of seven treasures. It should be made extremely tall, vast, and beautifully adorned. There is no need to place relics inside. Why? Because the full body of the Tathagata is already there. This stupa should be revered and worshipped with all kinds of flowers, incense, garlands, silken canopies, banners, streamers, music, and songs. If a person sees this stupa, bows, and makes offerings to it, you should know that these people are all close to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."
"Medicine King, there are many people, both lay and monastic, who practice the Bodhisattva Way. If they are unable to see, hear, read, recite, copy, uphold, or make offerings to this Lotus Sutra, you should know that these people have not yet properly practiced the Bodhisattva Way. But if a person is able to hear this scripture, they are then able to properly practice the Bodhisattva Way. If there are sentient beings who seek the Buddha Way and who see or hear this Lotus Sutra, and having heard it, believe in it, understand it, and uphold it, you should know that this person is close to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."
"Medicine King, it is like a person who is thirsty and needs water. In a high, dry plateau, he digs and searches for it. If he still sees dry soil, he knows the water is still far away. But he continues to work, and when he starts to see wet soil, and then gradually mud, his mind is certain that the water is near. A Bodhisattva is also like this. If they have not heard, understood, or been able to practice this Lotus Sutra, you should know that this person is still far from Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. But if they can hear, understand, contemplate, and practice it, they will surely know that they are close to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Why? All the Bodhisattvas' Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi belongs to this sutra. This sutra opens the gate of expedient means and reveals the true nature of reality. This treasury of the Lotus Sutra is profound, firm, and remote, and no one can reach it. But now, the Buddha, having converted and brought the Bodhisattvas to completion, is revealing it for them."
"Medicine King, if a Bodhisattva hears this Lotus Sutra and is shocked, doubtful, and afraid, you should know that he is a newly resolved Bodhisattva. If a śrāvaka hears this sutra and is shocked, doubtful, and afraid, you should know that he is arrogant. Medicine King, if a noble man or noble woman, after the Tathagata’s passing, wishes to preach this Lotus Sutra to the four groups of the assembly, how should they do it? This noble man or noble woman should enter the Tathagata’s room, wear the Tathagata’s robe, and sit on the Tathagata’s seat. Only then should they widely preach this sutra to the four groups. The Tathagata’s room is a mind of great compassion for all sentient beings. The Tathagata’s robe is a mind of gentleness and patience. The Tathagata’s seat is the emptiness of all phenomena. When one dwells in this, then with a tireless mind, one should widely preach this Lotus Sutra for the Bodhisattvas and the four groups."
"Medicine King, in other lands, I will send a phantom person to gather an assembly to listen to the Dharma. I will also send phantom monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen to listen to him preach the Dharma. These phantom people, when they hear the Dharma, will believe it, accept it, and follow it without opposition. If the preacher is in a secluded place, I will then send gods, dragons, ghost-spirits, gandharvas, asuras, and others in great numbers to listen to his Dharma. Although I am in another world, I will, from time to time, cause the preacher to see my body. If he forgets a phrase or a line, I will preach it to him again, so he can have it completely."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
If you wanna shake off that lazy haze,
Gotta lend an ear to these ancient ways.
This sutra's hard, it ain't for the faint of heart,
Few believe, fewer still play a righteous part.

Like a thirsty soul on a dry, high plain,
Diggin' a narrow well, feelin' the strain.
Seein' naught but dust, he knows deep down,
That life-givin' water ain't yet in this town.

But when that earth gets damp, that mud appears,
He knows the water's close, calmin' his fears.
Medicine King, you gotta understand,
Folks are the same, wanderin' this land.

If they ain't heard the Lotus, a long, long road,
Far from the Buddha's wisdom, a heavy load.
But when this deep sutra rings in their ears,
The śrāvakas' Dharma, it washes away tears.

This is the king, yes, of all the lore,
Hear it, and ponder, right to your core.
Know these folks, with a soul so true,
Are close to the Buddha's wisdom, me and you.

If you preach this sutra, with a heart so bold,
Enter the Tathagata's room, stories untold.
Wear his gentle robe, on his seat you'll rest,
In the assembly, fearless, standin' the test.

Preach the Dharma wide, let it spread like a song,
Great compassion's the room, where you truly belong.
Gentleness, patience, that's the robe you wear,
Emptiness of all things, the seat beyond compare.
Dwelling in this truth, the Dharma you'll teach,
If slanders come your way, beyond your reach.

Evil words, or a knife, a stick, or a stone,
Endure it, child, for the Buddha's throne.
I'll appear, pure and firm, in lands far and wide,
Millions of millions, with nowhere to hide.

For kalpas untold, I'll preach till the end,
For all sentient beings, a true, faithful friend.
After I'm gone, if one preaches this word,
My phantom forms I'll send, for all to be heard.

Monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen too,
Making offerings, for the teacher, so true.
Guiding all beings, gathering them near,
To listen to Dharma, banishing all fear.

If evil folks come, with a knife or a stick,
My phantom people I'll send, to protect them quick.
If the preacher's alone, in a place so still,
No human sound, just the breeze on the hill.

Reading, reciting, with a peaceful mind,
I'll appear for him then, a vision defined.
Pure and luminous body, a light in the dark,
If a phrase is forgotten, I'll leave my mark.

I'll preach it again, make it crystal clear,
If one has these merits, banish all fear.
Preaching to four groups, or in quiet space,
They'll all see my body, by my grace.

If a soul is secluded, with no one around,
Kings of gods and dragons, I'll send to that ground.
Yakshas, ghost-spirits, a silent, deep throng,
To be his assembly, where they all belong.

This soul will delight, preaching with ease,
Differentiating Dharma, bringing hearts to peace.
Protected by Buddhas, remembered so well,
Making the assembly joyful, casting a spell.
Close to a Dharma teacher, a path so bright,
Quickly attaining Bodhisattva's light.
Following this teacher, learning the way,
Seein' Buddhas like Ganges sands, every day.




Chapter 11: The Appearance of the Jeweled Stupa
At that time, in front of the Buddha, a seven-jeweled stupa, five hundred yojanas high and two hundred and fifty yojanas in both length and width, rose from the ground and hung in the air. It was adorned with various treasures. It had five thousand railings and thousands of millions of pavilions. It was adorned with countless banners and streamers, and hundreds of thousands of millions of precious bells and jeweled garlands hung from it. From its four sides, it emitted the fragrance of tāmalapattra and sandalwood, which filled the world.
The banners and canopies were made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, tridacna, agate, pearls, and rose quartz—the seven treasures—and they reached up to the palaces of the Four Heavenly Kings. The gods of the Thirty-three Heavens rained down heavenly maṇḍārava flowers to make offerings to the jeweled stupa. The other gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans, numbering in the millions and millions, made offerings to the jeweled stupa with all kinds of flowers, incense, garlands, banners, canopies, and music. They showed reverence, respect, and praise.
At that time, a great voice came from within the jeweled stupa, praising: "Excellent! Excellent, Śākyamuni World-Honored One! You are able to preach this Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma for the great assembly, which is the Dharma of the Bodhisattvas, protected and remembered by the Buddhas, with your equal and great wisdom. It is just so, it is just so, Śākyamuni World-Honored One. All that you have preached is true."
At that time, the four groups of the assembly saw the great jeweled stupa hanging in the air and heard the voice coming from within it. They were all filled with Dharma joy and astonished by this unprecedented event. They rose from their seats, respectfully joined their palms, and stood to one side.
At that time, a Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva named Great-Joyful-Eloquence, knowing the doubts in the hearts of all the gods, humans, and asuras in the world, said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what is the reason for this jeweled stupa to have risen from the ground, and for this voice to have come from within it?"
At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva Great-Joyful-Eloquence: "Within this jeweled stupa is the complete body of a Tathagata. It was in the past, in the east, in immeasurable millions of millions of asaṃkhyeya worlds, that there was a land named Jewel-Purity. In that land there was a Buddha named Abundant Treasures. When that Buddha practiced the Bodhisattva Way, he made a great vow: 'When I attain Buddhahood and pass away, my stupa will appear before any place in the ten directions where the Lotus Sutra is preached, to bear witness and to praise: "Excellent!"'"
"After that Buddha attained the Way, when he was about to pass away, he told all the monks in the assembly of gods and humans: 'After my passing away, if you wish to make offerings to my complete body, you should erect a great stupa.' With that Buddha's supernatural powers and vow, wherever in the worlds of the ten directions the Lotus Sutra is preached, that jeweled stupa appears before it, and his complete body is within the stupa, praising: 'Excellent! Excellent!'"
"Great-Joyful-Eloquence, this stupa of Abundant Treasures Tathagata has risen from the ground and is praising: 'Excellent! Excellent!' because it heard the preaching of the Lotus Sutra."
At that time, Bodhisattva Great-Joyful-Eloquence, by the Tathagata's supernatural power, said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we wish to see this Buddha's body."
The Buddha said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Great-Joyful-Eloquence: "This Abundant Treasures Buddha has a profound and heavy vow. When my jeweled stupa appears before all the Buddhas for the sake of hearing the Lotus Sutra, if someone wishes to show my body to the four groups of the assembly, the Buddhas who are my emanations and are preaching the Dharma in the worlds of the ten directions must all be gathered in one place. Only then will my body appear."
"Great-Joyful-Eloquence, my emanations—the Buddhas who are preaching the Dharma in the worlds of the ten directions—should now be gathered."
Great-Joyful-Eloquence said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we also wish to see the World-Honored One’s emanations, the Buddhas, to pay homage to them and make offerings."
At that time, the Buddha released a single ray of light from the white hair between his eyebrows and immediately saw the Buddhas of the five hundred million million nayuta worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in the east. In those lands, the ground was made of crystal, adorned with jeweled trees and jeweled robes. Innumerable millions of millions of Bodhisattvas filled them. They were covered everywhere with jeweled canopies and jeweled nets were spread above. The Buddhas in those lands preached the various Dharmas with a great and wonderful voice, and countless millions of millions of Bodhisattvas filled all those lands, preaching the Dharma for the assembly. The places illuminated by the light from the white hair in the south, north, west, the four diagonals, and above and below were also like this.
At that time, all the Buddhas of the ten directions each said to their assembly of Bodhisattvas: "Noble men, we should now go to the Saha world, to Śākyamuni Buddha’s place, and also make offerings to the jeweled stupa of Abundant Treasures Tathagata."
At that time, the Saha world transformed and became pure. The ground was of lapis lazuli, adorned with jeweled trees, and golden ropes lined the eight roads. There were no villages, towns, cities, great oceans, rivers, mountains, streams, or forests. A great, precious fragrance was burned, and maṇḍārava flowers were spread all over the ground. A jeweled net canopy was spread above, and precious bells hung from it. Only the assembly that was there was left. The gods and humans were moved to other lands.
At that time, the Buddhas, each with one great Bodhisattva as an attendant, arrived in the Saha world, and each came to a jeweled tree. Each jeweled tree was five hundred yojanas high, and its branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits were adorned in a beautiful order. Under each of the jeweled trees was a lion’s seat, five yojanas high, also decorated with great treasures. At that time, the Buddhas each sat in the lotus posture on these seats. They spread out in this way and filled the entire three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world. But the emanations of Śākyamuni Buddha from a single direction were still not exhausted.
Śākyamuni Buddha, wishing to make room for his emanations, the Buddhas, transformed two hundred million million nayuta worlds in each of the eight directions, making them all pure. There were no hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras. He also moved the gods and humans and placed them in other lands. These transformed lands also had a ground of lapis lazuli, were adorned with jeweled trees, and the trees were five hundred yojanas high. Their branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits were adorned in a beautiful order. Under each tree was a jeweled lion’s seat, five yojanas high, also decorated with various treasures. There were also no great oceans, rivers, or the kings of mountains like Mount Mucilinda, Mount Mahāmucilinda, the Iron Ring Mountains, the Great Iron Ring Mountains, or Mount Sumeru. It all became one Buddha land. The jeweled ground was level, and a jeweled net canopy covered it everywhere. Banners and canopies hung down, a great, precious fragrance was burned, and all kinds of heavenly jeweled flowers were spread all over the ground.
Śākyamuni Buddha, for the sake of the Buddhas who were to come and sit, again transformed two hundred million million nayuta worlds in each of the eight directions, making them all pure. There were no hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras. He also moved the gods and humans and placed them in other lands. These transformed lands also had a ground of lapis lazuli, were adorned with jeweled trees, and the trees were five hundred yojanas high. Their branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits were adorned in a beautiful order. Under each tree was a jeweled lion’s seat, five yojanas high, also decorated with various treasures. There were also no great oceans, rivers, or the kings of mountains like Mount Mucilinda, Mount Mahāmucilinda, the Iron Ring Mountains, the Great Iron Ring Mountains, or Mount Sumeru. It all became one Buddha land. The jeweled ground was level, and a jeweled net canopy covered it everywhere. Banners and canopies hung down, a great, precious fragrance was burned, and all kinds of heavenly jeweled flowers were spread all over the ground.
At that time, the Buddhas who were the emanations of Śākyamuni Buddha from the hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in the east, each came here after preaching the Dharma. In this way, the Buddhas of the ten directions all came and gathered, sitting in the eight directions. At that time, each direction was filled with four hundred million million nayuta Tathagatas. At that time, the Buddhas, each sitting on a lion’s seat under a jeweled tree, all sent their attendants to ask Śākyamuni Buddha about his well-being. They each brought a handful of jeweled flowers and said:
"Noble man, please go to Śākyamuni Buddha at Mount Gridhrakuta and greet him on my behalf: 'Are you in good health and without much sickness? Are you at ease in your energy? Are the Bodhisattva and śrāvaka assemblies also at peace?' Scatter these jeweled flowers as an offering to the Buddha and say: 'The Buddha of a certain land, wishes to open this jeweled stupa.'" The envoys of all the other Buddhas also did the same.
At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha, seeing that all his emanations had gathered and were all sitting on a lion’s seat, and hearing all the Buddhas wish to open the jeweled stupa, rose from his seat and stood in the air. The entire four groups of the assembly rose, joined their palms, and looked at the Buddha with a single mind.
Then, Śākyamuni Buddha, with his right finger, opened the door of the seven-jeweled stupa. A great sound was heard, like removing a bolt and opening a great city gate. Immediately, the entire assembly saw Abundant Treasures Tathagata sitting on a lion’s seat inside the jeweled stupa, his complete body intact as if he were in meditation. They also heard his words: "Excellent! Excellent, Śākyamuni Buddha! You have preached the Lotus Sutra so wonderfully. I have come here to hear this sutra."
At that time, the four groups of the assembly and others saw the Buddha who had passed away countless millions of kalpas ago speak these words. They praised this unprecedented event and scattered a shower of heavenly jeweled flowers upon Abundant Treasures Buddha and Śākyamuni Buddha.
Then, Abundant Treasures Buddha, in the jeweled stupa, offered half of his seat to Śākyamuni Buddha and said: "Śākyamuni Buddha, you may sit on this seat." Immediately, Śākyamuni Buddha entered the stupa and sat on the other half of the seat, in the lotus posture. At that time, the great assembly saw the two Tathagatas sitting in the lotus posture on the lion's seat in the seven-jeweled stupa. They all thought: "The Buddha's seat is high and far away. We only wish that the Tathagatas, with their supernatural powers, would cause us to also be in the air."
Immediately, Śākyamuni Buddha, with his supernatural power, took the great assembly and placed them all in the air. With a great voice, he universally announced to the four groups: "Who, in this Saha world, is able to widely preach the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma? The time is now. The Tathagata will soon enter nirvana, and the Buddha wishes to entrust this Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma to a worthy person."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
The holy master, World-Honored One, though he passed away so long ago,
Dwells in the jeweled stupa, and for the Dharma, he does show.
So why you all ain't diligent, for the Dharma, don't you see?
This Buddha left this world, for kalpas, endlessly.

He came to every corner, just to hear the Dharma sound,
'Cause a precious thing like this, ain't often to be found.
His vow was strong and clear, after my spirit takes its flight,
Wherever this sutra's preached, I'll be there day and night.

And all my emanations, Buddhas by the countless throng,
Like sands of old man Ganges, they've been comin' all along,
To listen to the Dharma, and to witness, it is true,
The Abundant Treasures Tathagata, passed away for me and you.

They left their wondrous lands, their disciples, and their kin,
Gods, humans, dragon-spirits, offerings they brought right in.
They came to make the Dharma, last for ages, strong and deep,
I moved assemblies, countless souls, the land to cleanse and keep.

The Buddhas found their seats, beneath a jeweled tree,
Like a pond of pure lotus, for all the world to see.
Underneath those branches, on the lion's mighty throne,
The Buddhas sit in splendor, with a light that's all their own.

Like a great torch burning bright, in the dark of night's embrace,
A wondrous scent surrounds them, fills all of time and space.
Sentient beings who breathe it, joy so deep they can't control,
Like a strong wind on a small tree, stirring up the very soul.

With this expedient means, the Dharma's made to stay,
I tell this great assembly, after I pass away,
Who will uphold, read, and preach this sutra, strong and bold?
Now, before the Buddha, let your sacred vows unfold.

Abundant Treasures Buddha, though he passed so long ago,
With his mighty vow, a lion's roar, he lets his wisdom flow.
The Abundant Treasures Tathagata, and this body you see here,
And all the emanations gathered, make their true intention clear.

All you sons of Buddha, who will stand to guard the way?
You must make a mighty vow, to make it last another day.
Those who can uphold this Dharma, this sutra, pure and grand,
Will be making offerings, to me and Abundant Treasures in this land.

This Abundant Treasures Buddha, in his jeweled stupa dwells,
Always travels ten directions, for this sutra, all it tells.
He makes his offerings also, to the emanations gathered near,
Adorns them with his light, in every world, banishing all fear.

If a person preaches this sutra, it's like they're seeing me,
Abundant Treasures Tathagata, and emanations, wild and free.
All you noble men and women, contemplate with thoughtful mind,
This is a task so heavy, a great vow you're bound to find.

All the other scriptures, like the Ganges' sands they roam,
Though one may preach them, it ain't like bringin' this one home.
If one could take Mount Sumeru, and throw it to another shore,
Countless Buddha lands beyond, that ain't difficult, no more.

If one could move the great wide world, with just a single toe,
And throw it to a distant land, that ain't difficult, you know.
If one could stand in highest heaven, preach for an assembly's ear,
Countless other sutras, that ain't difficult, never fear.

But if, after the Buddha's gone, in an age of evil's sway,
One can preach this sutra, that's the difficult task today.
If a person grabs the empty space, and walks upon the air,
That ain't difficult at all, beyond all earthly care.

After my passing, if you can copy, hold this sutra tight,
Or cause another soul to copy, that's the difficult light.
If one could place the great wide earth, upon a fingernail's tip,
And climb to Brahma heavens, that ain't no difficult trip.

After the Buddha's passing, in an age that's dark and grim,
If one can read this sutra, just for a moment, on a whim,
That's the difficult task, my friends, the hardest you will face.
If, in the great conflagration, with dry grass, you find your place,

And walk right in, without a burn, that ain't no difficult deed.
After my passing, if you can hold this sutra, plant this seed,
And preach it to just one soul, that's the difficult, it's true.
If one upholds the eighty-four thousand Dharmas, through and through,

Twelve divisions of the scriptures, expound them for all to see,
Cause all who listen, gain six powers, wild and magically,
Although one can do this, that ain't difficult, not a bit.
After my passing, if you can hear and take this sutra, lit,

And ask about its meaning, that's the difficult you crave.
If a person preaches Dharma, and countless beings they can save,
Hundreds, thousands, millions, like the Ganges' flowing sand,
To attain arhatship, with six powers in their hand,

Although there's all this benefit, that ain't difficult, not by far.
After my passing, if one can uphold these kinds of scriptures, star
Of all your deeds and efforts, that's the difficult, indeed.
I, for the Buddha Way, in countless lands, planted every seed.

From the beginning till right now, I've preached the sutras, far and wide,
But among them all, this sutra, is the first, with naught to hide.
If a person can uphold it, they hold the Buddha's very frame.
All you noble men and women, after I call out my name,

Who will receive, uphold, read, recite this sutra, strong and free?
Now, in the Buddha's presence, make your solemn vow to me.
This sutra's hard to hold onto, if for a moment, you succeed,
I will rejoice, and all the Buddhas, will truly heed.

Such a person, praised by Buddhas, every single one,
This is the brave and fierce one, when the day is done.
This is the diligent one, who keeps the precepts, practices with might,
He will quickly gain the Buddha Way, shining ever bright.

One who's able, in a future age, to read and hold this text,
Is a true son of the Buddha, on grounds of goodness, never vexed.
After the Buddha's passing, one who understands its soul,
Is the eye of gods and humans, and the world, making it whole.

In an age of fear and darkness, if he preaches, just a moment's span,
All the gods and humans, should make offerings to that man.


Chapter 12: Devadatta
At that time, the Buddha said to all the Bodhisattvas, gods, and the four groups of the assembly: "In the past, in immeasurable kalpas, I sought the Lotus Sutra without ever being lazy. For many kalpas, I was a king and made a vow to seek supreme enlightenment, and my mind did not waver. To fulfill the six pāramitās, I diligently practiced giving with a mind that was not stingy. I gave away my elephants, horses, seven treasures, country, cities, wife, and children, as well as my slaves and servants. I even gave away my head, eyes, marrow, brain, body, flesh, hands, and feet, and did not begrudge my life.
The people of that time had immeasurable life spans. For the sake of the Dharma, I gave up my royal position and entrusted the government to my crown prince. I had drums beaten and a proclamation sent in all four directions to seek the Dharma: 'Whoever can preach the Great Vehicle for me, I will be their servant and serve them for my entire life.' At that time, a hermit came and said to the king: 'I have a Great Vehicle sutra named the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma. If you do not oppose me, I will preach it to you.'
When the king heard the hermit's words, his heart was filled with joy and delight. He immediately followed the hermit and supplied all his needs. He picked fruit, drew water, gathered firewood, and prepared meals, and he even offered his own body as a bed. His body and mind were never weary. For a thousand years, he served the hermit. For the sake of the Dharma, he diligently attended to him, ensuring he had no lack."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
In a kalpa long ago, a king I used to be,
Not for worldly pleasures, but for truth, I longed to be free.
I sent my bells a-ringing, in the North, South, East, and West,
"Who holds the mighty Dharma? I'll be their servant, put me to the test."

Then came a hermit, Asita, with wisdom in his eyes,
"I know a Dharma subtle, a treasure to surprise.
If you can truly seek it, I'll preach it just for you,"
The king's heart swelled with gladness, his spirit shining through.

He followed that old hermit, with a humble, faithful soul,
Gathered wood and fruit, to make the wanderer whole.
His heart set on the Dharma, his body knew no pain,
Seeking truth for all beings, again and yet again.

Not for his own body, nor for pleasures that would fade,
But as a mighty monarch, a spiritual parade.
He found the great awakening, beneath a starlit sky,
And that's why I'm here singing, to tell you reasons why.
The Buddha said to all the monks: "The king at that time was myself. The hermit at that time is Devadatta today. It was because of the good friendship of Devadatta that I was able to fully complete the six pāramitās, compassion, joy, giving up, the thirty-two marks, the eighty subtle characteristics, the deep golden color, the ten powers, the four kinds of fearlessness, the four embracing Dharmas, the eighteen unique Dharmas, and the power of supernatural abilities. I attained true enlightenment and widely saved sentient beings, all because of the good friendship of Devadatta."
He said to the four groups of the assembly: "Devadatta, after an immeasurable number of kalpas from now, will attain Buddhahood. His title will be King of Heaven Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His world will be named Heavenly Path.
At that time, King of Heaven Buddha will remain in the world for twenty middle kalpas, widely preaching the wonderful Dharma for sentient beings. Sentient beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges will attain the fruit of an arhat. Immeasurable sentient beings will give rise to the mind of a pratyekabuddha. Sentient beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges will give rise to the mind for the supreme Way, attain the patience of non-arising, and reach the state of non-retrogression."
"After King of Heaven Buddha passes into parinirvāṇa, the True Dharma will remain in the world for twenty middle kalpas. A seven-jeweled stupa will be erected for his complete body-relics, sixty yojanas high and forty yojanas in both length and width. All the gods and people will use various flowers, powdered incense, burning incense, paste incense, robes, garlands, banners, canopies, music, and songs to pay homage and make offerings to this wonderful seven-jeweled stupa. Immeasurable sentient beings will attain the fruit of an arhat. Immeasurable sentient beings will be awakened as pratyekabuddhas, and an inconceivable number of sentient beings will give rise to the mind of enlightenment and reach the state of non-retrogression."
The Buddha said to all the monks: "In the future, if there is a noble man or noble woman who hears this Devadatta chapter of the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma with a pure heart of faith and respect and without giving rise to doubt, they will not fall into the hells, the hungry ghost realm, or the animal realm. They will be born in the presence of Buddhas in the ten directions, and wherever they are born, they will always hear this sutra. If they are born among humans or gods, they will receive supreme and wonderful joy. If they are born in the presence of a Buddha, they will be born by transformation in a lotus flower."
The Story of the Dragon King’s Daughter
At that time, the Bodhisattva who had followed Abundant Treasures World-Honored One from the lower direction, named Accumulated Wisdom, said to Abundant Treasures Buddha: "We should now return to our home land."
Śākyamuni Buddha said to Accumulated Wisdom: "Noble man, please wait for a moment. Here is a Bodhisattva named Mañjuśrī whom you can meet and discuss the wonderful Dharma with. Then you can return to your homeland."
At that time, Mañjuśrī, sitting on a lotus flower with a thousand petals as large as a chariot wheel, along with the Bodhisattvas who came with him, also sitting on jeweled lotus flowers, naturally arose from the great ocean, from the dragon king Sāgara’s palace. They dwelt in the air and went to Mount Vulture Peak. They descended from their lotus flowers, went to the Buddha’s place, and bowed their heads in reverence at the feet of the two World-Honored Ones. Having completed their respects, they went to Accumulated Wisdom and greeted him, then sat to one side.
Bodhisattva Accumulated Wisdom asked Mañjuśrī: "How many sentient beings have you converted in the dragon palace?"
Mañjuśrī said: "The number is immeasurable, incalculable, beyond what can be expressed in words or measured by the mind. Just wait for a moment, and you will see and know for yourself."
Before he had finished speaking, countless Bodhisattvas, sitting on jeweled lotus flowers, arose from the ocean. They went to Mount Vulture Peak and dwelt in the air. All these Bodhisattvas were converted by Mañjuśrī. They were all complete in the practices of a Bodhisattva and were all discussing the six pāramitās. Those who were originally śrāvakas, who were in the air, spoke of the śrāvaka practices, but now they all practiced the great vehicle Dharma of emptiness.
Mañjuśrī said to Accumulated Wisdom: "My work of converting beings in the ocean is like this."
At that time, Bodhisattva Accumulated Wisdom spoke in verse:
Great wisdom, virtue, courage, and power,
Converted so many, hour after hour.
Now this whole big crowd, and me too, you see,
We done all witnessed, for eternity.

You lay out the truth, plain for us to hear,
Unveil the One Vehicle, makin' it clear.
You guide all the lost, with a gentle hand,
Bring 'em to bright enlightenment, across the land.
Mañjuśrī said: "In the ocean, I always preach the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma."
Accumulated Wisdom asked Mañjuśrī: "This sutra is so profound and subtle, a treasure among all sutras, and it is rare in the world. Are there any sentient beings who, by diligently cultivating and practicing this sutra, can quickly attain Buddhahood?"
Mañjuśrī said: "There is the daughter of Sāgara, the dragon king. She is only eight years old, but she has sharp faculties and wisdom. She is skilled in knowing the faculties and practices of all sentient beings. She has attained dhāranīs, and all the profound and secret treasuries preached by the Buddhas, she can receive and uphold. She has entered deep meditation, thoroughly understood all phenomena, and in a single moment, gave rise to the mind of enlightenment, attained non-retrogression, and has unhindered eloquence. She has a mind of compassion for sentient beings just like a loving mother has for her baby. She is complete in all merits, and her heart and words are subtle, wonderful, and vast. She is compassionate, benevolent, and gentle, and her resolve is harmonious and elegant. She can reach enlightenment."
Bodhisattva Accumulated Wisdom said: "I see Śākyamuni Tathagata, who, for immeasurable kalpas, practiced difficult and painful austerities, accumulating merits and virtues to seek the Way of enlightenment, without ever stopping. I have looked at the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, and there is not even a space the size of a mustard seed that is not a place where a Bodhisattva gave up his body and life for the sake of sentient beings. Only after this could he attain the Way of enlightenment. I do not believe that this girl can attain true enlightenment in a moment."
Before he had finished speaking, the Dragon King's daughter suddenly appeared before him. She bowed her head in reverence and then stood to one side, speaking in verse:
I know 'bout sin, yeah, and I know 'bout grace,
My light shines out, all over the place.
My body's pure, subtle and true,
Got thirty-two marks, and eighty more too.

Gods and humans, they all look my way,
Dragons and spirits, they bow and they pray.
All suffering souls, they come to my side,
Heard I'll reach enlightenment, nowhere to hide.

Only the Buddha, he can see,
This great teaching I'm bringin', for all to be free.
To save troubled souls, from their sorrow and pain,
I'm preachin' the Dharma, again and again.
At that time, Śāriputra said to the dragon girl: "Your belief that you will quickly attain the supreme Way is difficult to believe. Why? A woman's body is defiled and is not a vessel for the Dharma. How can you attain supreme enlightenment? The Buddha Way is vast and far away, and it is attained only after cultivating diligently for immeasurable kalpas and completing all the pāramitās. Furthermore, a woman's body has five hindrances: first, she cannot become a Brahma King; second, a Śakra; third, a Māra King; fourth, a wheel-turning holy king; and fifth, a Buddha. How can a woman's body quickly attain Buddhahood?"
At that time, the dragon girl had a precious jewel, worth the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, which she held up and offered to the Buddha. The Buddha immediately accepted it. The dragon girl said to Bodhisattva Accumulated Wisdom and the venerable Śāriputra: "I offered the jewel, and the World-Honored One accepted it. Was that fast?"
They replied: "Very fast!"
The girl said: "With your supernatural power, observe my attainment of Buddhahood, which will be even faster than that."
At that moment, everyone in the assembly saw the dragon girl, in an instant, transform into a man. He was complete in the practices of a Bodhisattva, and he immediately went to the world of Stainless-Purity in the south, where he sat on a jeweled lotus flower and attained true enlightenment. He was complete with the thirty-two marks and the eighty subtle characteristics, and he universally preached the wonderful Dharma for all sentient beings in the ten directions.
At that time, the Bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, gods, dragons, eight kinds of non-human beings, and the humans and non-humans of the Saha world all saw the dragon girl from a distance, becoming a Buddha. He universally preached the Dharma to the assembly of humans and gods at that time. Their hearts were filled with great joy, and they all bowed in reverence from a distance. Immeasurable sentient beings heard the Dharma, understood it, and attained non-retrogression. Three thousand sentient beings attained the prophecy for the Way. The land of Stainless-Purity shook in six ways, and three thousand sentient beings of the Saha world attained the ground of non-retrogression. Three thousand sentient beings gave rise to the mind for enlightenment and received a prophecy. Bodhisattva Accumulated Wisdom, Śāriputra, and the entire assembly silently believed and accepted it.



Chapter 13: Encouragement for Upholding the Sutra
At that time, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Medicine King and Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Great-Joyful-Eloquence, together with their retinue of twenty thousand Bodhisattvas, all made this vow in the presence of the Buddha: "We only wish, World-Honored One, that you would not be concerned. After the Buddha's passing, we will receive, uphold, read, recite, and preach this scripture. In the evil age to come, sentient beings' roots of goodness will dwindle, and their arrogance will increase. They will be greedy for offerings and gains, and their unwholesome roots will grow. They will be far from liberation. Although they will be difficult to convert, we will give rise to great power of patience and will read, recite, uphold, preach, copy, and make various offerings to this sutra without begrudging our bodies or lives."
At that time, the five hundred Arhats in the assembly who had received prophecies said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we also vow that we will widely preach this sutra in other lands."
And the eight thousand learners and non-learners who had received prophecies rose from their seats, joined their palms toward the Buddha, and made this vow: "World-Honored One, we also will widely preach this sutra in other lands. Why? Because the people in this Saha world are very evil, filled with arrogance, shallow in their merit, and full of anger, impurity, flattery, and deceitfulness in their hearts."
Prophecies for the Nuns
At that time, the Buddha's foster mother, Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, the nun, with her retinue of six thousand nuns who were learners and non-learners, rose from her seat. With a single mind, she joined her palms, and looked up at the Buddha’s revered face without taking her eyes off him.
Then the World-Honored One said to Gautamī: "Why do you look at the Tathagata with a sorrowful expression? Do you think that I did not mention your name and give you a prophecy for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?"
"Gautamī, I previously said that all the śrāvakas have already received a prophecy. But now, if you wish to know your prophecy, in a future life, you will be a great Dharma teacher in the Dharma of sixty-eight thousand million Buddhas. You, and the six thousand learners and non-learners who are nuns, will all be Dharma teachers. In this way, you will gradually complete the Bodhisattva Way and will attain Buddhahood, with the title All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. Gautamī, this All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See Buddha and the six thousand Bodhisattvas will all, in succession, receive a prophecy and attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."
At that time, Yaśodharā, the nun and mother of Rāhula, thought: "The World-Honored One has not mentioned my name in the prophecies."
The Buddha said to Yaśodharā: "In a future life, in the Dharma of hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, you will practice the Bodhisattva Way and be a great Dharma teacher, gradually completing the Buddha Way. In a pure land, you will attain Buddhahood, with the title King of a Thousand Million Lights Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The Buddha’s life span will be immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas."
At that time, Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, and Yaśodharā, the nun, along with their retinues, were all filled with great, unprecedented joy. They then spoke in verse in the presence of the Buddha:
Our Guide, World-Honored One,
Brings peace to everyone.
Our prophecy now heard and clear,
Calms every heart, dispels all fear.
After the nuns spoke this verse, they said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we also will be able to widely preach this sutra in other lands."
The Vow of the Bodhisattvas
At that time, the World-Honored One looked at the eighty million million nayuta Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas. These Bodhisattvas had all attained non-retrogression, turned the non-retrogressing Dharma wheel, and attained all the dhāranīs. They immediately rose from their seats, went to the Buddha's presence, and joined their palms with a single mind. They thought: "If the World-Honored One commands us to uphold and preach this sutra, we will, as commanded by the Buddha, widely preach this Dharma." They thought again: "The Buddha is now silent and does not command us. What should we do?"
Then the Bodhisattvas, respectfully following the Buddha's will and also wishing to fulfill their own original vows, made a lion's roar in the Buddha’s presence and made this vow:
“World-Honored One, after the passing of the Tathagata, we will travel and wander in all the worlds of the ten directions and will enable sentient beings to copy this sutra, uphold it, read and recite it, explain its meaning, practice it according to the Dharma, and remember it properly. This will all be due to the Buddha's majestic power. We only wish that the World-Honored One, from another land, would watch over us from afar."
At that time, all the Bodhisattvas together spoke in verse, saying:
After the Buddha's gone, a truth we never learned,
In this mean old world we face, with trouble all around,
We'll preach the Dharma wide, with grace that can't be burned.
Ignorant folks will rise, with spite in their cold eyes,
Slander and abuse us, morning, noon, and night,
With evil words and blows, they'll bring us down with lies,
But we'll endure it all, with patience and with might.

In this wicked world, some monks will talk so bold,
With false wisdom in their hearts, and flattery they'll spew,
Claimin' what they ain't achieved, stories to be told,
Their arrogance will swell, for all the world to view.

Some will live alone, in rags upon their back,
Claimin' the true Way, like banners torn and frayed,
But they despise the folks, who walk the common track,
Lost in their lonely pride, a game they've sadly played.

Attached to earthly gain, and offerings they preach the call,
Revered by all the world, standin' proud and tall,
Like they were Arhats true, with powers to enthral,
Their false piety, a deceptive, bitter gall.

These folks with evil minds, they'll stray from day to day,
Thinkin' 'bout worldly things, in shadows and in light,
Claimin' to be holy, in a cunning, twisted way,
They love to find our faults, and point 'em out with spite.

And they will speak these words, with tongues so sharp and keen,
"These monks, for gain and fame, are tangled in their greed,
They preach outside the path, a twisted, wicked scene,
They wrote this scripture themselves, to plant a bitter seed."

"They fool the world for fame, a selfish, sorry plight,"
To slander this here sutra, as the day turns into night,
They'll gather in a crowd, with all their hateful might,
Wishin' to destroy us, in the fading, dimming light.

They'll go to kings and lords, and Brahmins old and wise,
And other monks assembled, answerin' their call,
They'll slander us with evil, spreadin' wicked lies,
Sayin' we got wrong views, beneath a cloudy pall.

Who preach outside the path, a grave and heavy sin,
Because we love the Buddha, this burden we must bear,
Scornful words we'll hear, from deep within,
"You'll all become Buddhas!" banishin' all fear.

All such scornful words, we'll swallow with a sigh,
In this turbid, evil age, troubles we will face,
Evil ghosts will whisper low, as wicked winds pass by,
And slander and abuse us, without a moment's grace.

We'll wear the armor of patience, for the Buddha's holy name,
For preachin' this here sutra, with calm and steady hand,
We don't love our bodies, or this transient, fleeting flame,
But we cherish the supreme Way, shinin' through the land.

In a future life, we'll guard what Buddha did bestow,
The World-Honored One, He surely knows our trod,
The evil monks of this mean age, who just don't wanna know,
Buddha's expedient means, a sacred gift from God.

And His preachin' of the Dharma, so perfectly aligned,
Will bring abuse and frowns, from hearts so cold and mean,
They'll be banished from the stupas, and temples grand and kind,
All these evil things we'll bear, in this earthly, weary scene.

We endure, rememberin' Buddha's command, so deep and true,
In all the towns and cities, where weary souls do sleep,
Where folks are seekin' Dharma, we'll go and see it through,
To preach the Dharma Buddha gave, a promise we will keep.

We are the World-Honored One's envoys, with hearts so free and bold,
And we won't fear the assembly, no, not one little bit,
We'll skillfully preach the Dharma, with stories to be told,
We wish the Buddha would be at peace, in pure, clear light, where He sits.

In the presence of the Buddha, our hearts align and pray,
And all the Buddhas from ten directions, a sacred, holy sign,
We make this vow, with spirits strong, to light the darkest day,
The Buddha Himself knows our hearts, makin' us truly shine.


The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Volume Five
Translated by Tripitaka Master Kumarajiva of the Kucha Kingdom in the Later Qin Dynasty, by imperial decree.



Chapter 14: Peaceful and Joyful Practices
At that time, the Dharma Prince Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Mañjuśrī said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, these Bodhisattvas are very rare. Out of reverence for the Buddha, they have made a great vow to protect, uphold, read, and preach this Lotus Sutra in the evil age to come. World-Honored One, how should the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas preach this sutra in the evil age to come?"
The Buddha said to Mañjuśrī: "If the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva wishes to preach this sutra in the evil age to come, he must dwell in four Dharmas. First, he must dwell in the sphere of actions and the sphere of proximity of a Bodhisattva, and then he can expound this sutra for sentient beings."
"Mañjuśrī, what is called the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva's sphere of actions? The Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva must dwell on the ground of patience, be gentle and yielding, without being abrupt, and their mind should not be agitated. Furthermore, for the Dharma, he should not take any action, but should contemplate all Dharmas as their true nature. He should not act or differentiate. This is called the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva's sphere of actions."
"What is called the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva's sphere of proximity? The Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva should not be close to kings, princes, ministers, or officials. He should not be close to heretics, Brahmins, or the Nirgranthas, or those who write worldly literature, who praise outside scriptures, or the Lokāyatas and their opponents. He also should not be close to those who engage in dangerous games, wrestling, or wrestling with animals, and all kinds of theatrical performances. He should also not be close to caṇḍālas, or those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens, or dogs, and those who hunt, fish, and engage in all unwholesome professions. If such people happen to come, he should preach the Dharma for them without any hope for a return. He should also not be close to or greet the monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen who seek the śrāvaka path. Whether in their rooms, in their walking meditation area, or in the Dharma hall, he should not live with them. If they happen to come, he should preach the Dharma to them according to what is appropriate, without any hope for a return."
"Mañjuśrī, furthermore, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva should not look at a woman in a way that gives rise to thoughts of desire and should preach the Dharma for them. He should also not take pleasure in seeing them. If he enters another person's home, he should not speak alone with young girls, virgins, or widows. He should also not be close to the five kinds of people who are not fully men. He should not enter another person's home alone. If there is a reason for him to enter alone, he should only think of the Buddha with a single mind. If he preaches the Dharma for a woman, he should not show his teeth in laughter, or show his chest. Even for the Dharma, he should not be too intimate, let alone for other matters. He should not take pleasure in having young disciples, śrāmaṇeras, or small children, or in having the same teacher as them. He should always enjoy sitting in meditation and, in a secluded place, cultivate and gather his mind. Mañjuśrī, this is called the first sphere of proximity."
"Furthermore, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva should contemplate that all Dharmas are empty, just as their true nature is. They are not upside down, motionless, non-retrogressing, and unchangeable. They are like empty space, without any fixed nature. All verbal expressions are cut off. They do not arise, are not created, do not appear. They have no name and no form. They are truly without any fixed existence. They are immeasurable, boundless, unhindered, and without obstacles. They are only said to exist due to conditions, and they arise from upside-down views. He should always delight in contemplating the true nature of the Dharma. This is called the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva's second sphere of proximity."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
If a Bodhisattva comes, in them evil days to be,
Without a fearful heart, a preacher of the truth for all to see,
He's gotta walk the righteous path, in action and in near,
Keepin' far from kings and princes, lettin' go of all his fear.

Ministers and officials, dangerous folk who like to play,
Caṇḍālas and the heretics, he'll turn and walk away.
Arrogant and prideful, them of the Small Vehicle's mind,
Monks who've broke their precepts, the false Arhats he will find,
And keep a distance from them, yeah, leave them far behind.

Nuns who like to joke and laugh, with a heart so light and free,
Those attached to five desires, seekin' extinction, wild and free,
And every single laywoman, he ain't to be close, you see.

But if they come with a good heart, to hear the Buddha's way,
That Bodhisattva, brave and bold, with nothing to repay,
He'll preach the Dharma to them, chase the darkness from the day.
Widows, virgins, those not fully men, he'll keep them at a bay,
No intimacy, no closeness, just the truth he'll gently say.

Butchers, slaughterers, hunters who kill for gain,
Fishers and the meat sellers, those who live in worldly pain,
Or those who sell a woman's beauty, yeah, from them he must refrain.
Wrestlers and the gamblers, with their games of chance and might,
And all the loose women, he'll keep 'em out of sight.

He won't be alone with no woman, in a place secluded and so deep,
To preach the sacred Dharma, secrets he must keep.
When he preaches, no jokin' laughter, from his lips it won't leap.
To a village for his alms, a fellow monk he'll take along,
If no one's there to join him, to the Buddha's name he'll strongly long.

This is the sphere of action, and proximity, it's true,
Dwellin' in these two spheres, peacefully the Dharma he'll pursue.
No superior, medium, inferior, no conditioned, no unreal,
No real, no unreal Dharmas, no man or woman, that's the deal.
No grasp of any phenomena, no knowledge, nothing he can feel.

This is the Bodhisattva's way, the sphere of action, understand,
All Dharmas are but empty, like the shifting desert sand.
No permanent existence, no arising, no decease,
This is the place of wisdom, where the wise can find their peace.

No upside-down contemplation, if phenomena exist or not,
No real or unreal somethin', no arising, that's his lot.
In a secluded place he'll sit, his mind he'll cultivate and bind,
Peaceful and unmoving, like Mount Sumeru, he'll always find.

All Dharmas are like empty space, no substance, it is known,
They ain't firm, they don't arise, no appearance has been shown.
Motionless and never retrogressin', in a single form they dwell,
This is called the sphere of proximity, a story it can tell.

If a monk, after my passing, enters these spheres so clear,
When he preaches this here sutra, he'll have no weakness, no fear.
A Bodhisattva, in a quiet room, with mindfulness so right,
Contemplates the Dharma's meaning, bathed in sacred light.
When he rises from his meditation, for kings and princes grand,
Ministers and citizens, and Brahmins across the land,
He'll reveal, convert, expound, this scripture in his hand.
His heart will be so peaceful, no fear, no weakness, understand.

Mañjuśrī, this is the Bodhisattva, in the first Dharma he'll reside,
And he'll preach the Lotus Sutra, with nothing left to hide,
In that future evil age, with wisdom as his guide.
"Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, after the Tathagata's passing, in the period of the final Dharma, if a person wishes to preach this sutra, he should dwell in the peaceful and joyful practice. When he preaches the Dharma or reads the sutra, he should not delight in speaking of the faults of others or of other scriptures. He should not be disrespectful to other Dharma teachers, or speak of the good and bad or the long and short of others. For the śrāvaka followers, he should not call them by name and speak of their faults, nor should he call them by name and praise their good qualities. He should also not give rise to a mind of resentment or dislike. By cultivating this kind of peaceful and joyful mind, those who listen will not oppose his wishes. If they have a difficult question, he should not answer with the Small Vehicle Dharma, but should only explain with the Great Vehicle, causing them to attain All-Knowing Wisdom."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
The Bodhisattva, with a peaceful soul,
Preaches the Dharma, makes the spirit whole.
On pure ground he takes his seat,
Washes off the dust, from head to feet.
New robes he wears, so clean and bright,
Pure inside and out, shining light.

He sits so easy, on his Dharma throne,
Answers all the questions, makes the truth be known.
Monks and nuns, lay folk too,
Kings and princes, me and you,
With gentle words and meaning deep,
Secrets of the Dharma, he will keep.

If hard questions come, he won't delay,
He'll answer with wisdom, light up the way.
With parables and stories, he makes it plain,
Explains the Dharma, through sun and rain.
These expedient means, a helping hand,
Awaken enlightenment, across the land.
They grow in spirit, day by day,
Walk that Buddha Way, come what may.

No lazy mind, no weary sigh,
He casts off worries, beneath the sky.
With a heart of compassion, strong and true,
He preaches the Dharma, for me and for you.
Day and night, the supreme Way he shows,
With countless stories, as the river flows.

He reveals it to all, makes their hearts rejoice,
Not seeking comfort, or a material choice.
Just one thought, deep in his soul,
"Preaching the Dharma, makes me whole,
I wish to attain the Buddha's light,
And lead all beings, out of the night."

This is the great benefit, pure and sweet,
A peaceful offering, complete.
After my passing, if a monk be found,
Who expounds this Lotus Sutra, on holy ground,
No jealousy or hatred in his heart,
Free from all afflictions, right from the start.

No worries vex him, no curses sting,
No fear of weapons, or what they bring.
He's not banished, through patience he stays,
A wise man like this, through all his days.
He skillfully cultivates his mind so clear,
Dwells in peaceful joy, year after year.
The merits of this person, so vast and wide,
Cannot be counted, no place to hide.
Millions of kalpas, they stretch on and on,
Beyond all telling, from dusk till dawn.
"Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Mañjuśrī, in the future, at the time of the final Dharma, when the Dharma is about to be extinguished, those who uphold, read, and recite this scripture should not have a mind of jealousy, flattery, or deceit. He should also not be disrespectful or abuse those who seek the Buddha Way, or look for their good and bad qualities. If they are monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen, or those who seek the śrāvaka path, the pratyekabuddha path, or the Bodhisattva Way, he should not trouble them or cause them to have doubts and regrets. He should not say to them: 'You are still very far from the Way and will never be able to attain All-Knowing Wisdom. Why? Because you are lazy and slack in the Way.' He also should not engage in verbal games about the Dharma or in any disputes.
He should give rise to a mind of great compassion for all sentient beings. He should give rise to the thought of a compassionate father for all the Tathagatas. He should give rise to the thought of a great teacher for all the Bodhisattvas. For all the great Bodhisattvas of the ten directions, he should always, with a deep heart, bow in reverence. He should preach the Dharma equally to all sentient beings. In accordance with the Dharma, he should not preach too much or too little. Even for those who have a deep love for the Dharma, he should not preach too much for them."
"Mañjuśrī, if the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva in the future, at the time of the final Dharma, when the Dharma is about to be extinguished, is complete in this third peaceful and joyful practice, no one will be able to trouble or confuse him when he preaches this sutra. He will get good fellow students to read and recite this sutra together, and he will also get a great assembly to come and listen. When they have listened, they will be able to uphold it. Having upheld it, they will be able to recite it. Having recited it, they will be able to preach it. Having preached it, they will be able to copy it, or cause others to copy it, and make offerings to the sutra scrolls with reverence, respect, and praise."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
If you wanna preach this sutra, hear my words, it's true,
Lay aside that jealousy, hatred, and arrogance too.
No flattery, no falsehood, just honest, upright ways,
Gotta walk that righteous path through all your livin' days.

Don't be lookin' down on nobody, don't play no verbal games,
'Bout the Dharma, keep it real, callin' folks by their true names.
Don't cause no doubt or regret, don't ever say with scorn,
"You ain't gonna be a Buddha," from the day that you were born.

The Buddha's son, when he preaches, gotta be gentle, soft, and slow,
Patient with all creation, lettin' his compassion flow.
No lazy mind, my brother, gotta keep that spirit bright,
Shinin' like a beacon in the darkest, deepest night.

Great Bodhisattvas from the ten directions, they practice for all man,
Out of pure compassion, holdin' out a helpin' hand.
Gotta show them due respect, they're teachers, wise and grand,
Preachin' that sweet Dharma across this troubled land.

For all the World-Honored Buddhas, think of 'em as a father so supreme,
Cast away that arrogant mind, just live within the dream.
Preach that Dharma freely, let the truth ring out and soar,
No hindrance, no obstruction, knockin' on every door.

This third Dharma, it's the way, the wise ones understand,
Guard it with a single mind, across this weary land.
Practice peaceful, joyful conduct, till your time on earth is through,
And immeasurable beings, they gonna reverence you.
"Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, if the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva, in the future, at the time of the final Dharma, when the Dharma is about to be extinguished, upholds this Lotus Sutra, he should give rise to a mind of great compassion for the laypeople and monastics. For those who are not Bodhisattvas, he should give rise to a mind of great pity. He should think: 'Such people are at a great loss. The Tathagata used expedient means to preach the Dharma according to what was appropriate, but they have not heard it, known it, awakened to it, asked about it, believed in it, or understood it. Even though they do not ask about, believe in, or understand this sutra, when I attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, I will, wherever they are, use the power of my supernatural abilities and wisdom to guide them and cause them to dwell in this Dharma.'
Mañjuśrī, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva who is complete in this fourth Dharma after the Tathagata’s passing, will have no faults when he preaches this Dharma. He will always be respected and worshiped by the monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, kings, princes, ministers, citizens, Brahmins, and elders. The heavenly beings in the sky, for the sake of hearing the Dharma, will also constantly follow him. If he is in a village, city, or secluded forest, and someone comes to ask him a difficult question, the heavenly beings, day and night, will protect him for the sake of the Dharma, and will cause all who listen to rejoice. Why? Because this sutra is protected by the supernatural power of all the Buddhas of the past, present, and future.
Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is so rare that in immeasurable lands, even its name is not heard, let alone being able to see, uphold, read, or recite it."
The Parable of the King’s Jewel
"Mañjuśrī, it is like a powerful wheel-turning holy king who, with his majestic power, wishes to conquer many lands. But the small kings do not obey his command. The wheel-turning king then raises various armies and goes to fight and punish them. The king, seeing his soldiers who have performed great feats in battle, is filled with great joy and rewards them according to their merits. He may give them land and houses, villages and cities, or robes and personal adornments, or various precious treasures, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, tridacna, agate, coral, amber, elephants, horses, carriages, slaves, and people. But the one jewel that is in his topknot, he does not give away. Why? Only the king has this one jewel on his head. If he were to give it away, his relatives would be greatly surprised and alarmed."
"Mañjuśrī, the Tathagata is also like this. With the power of meditation and wisdom, he has attained the land of the Dharma and reigns over the three realms. But all the demon kings do not obey him. The holy and virtuous generals of the Tathagata fight with them—with the demon of the five aggregates, the demon of afflictions, and the demon of death. Those who perform great feats, who extinguish the three poisons, leave the three realms, and break the nets of Māra, the Tathagata is also filled with great joy. The Lotus Sutra is the one Dharma that can cause sentient beings to attain All-Knowing Wisdom. The world is filled with many who resent it and find it difficult to believe. It is a Dharma that was not spoken of before, but now it is being spoken."
"Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the first of all the Tathagata's sermons. Among all the preachings, it is the most profound and subtle. He gives it away at the very end, just like that powerful king who protected the luminous jewel for a long time and only now gives it away. Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the secret treasury of all the Tathagatas. Among all the sutras, it is the most supreme. He has protected it for a long night of existence and has not preached it casually, but only today, he is revealing it for you."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Now listen here, in the future, when the times get rough,
The ones who hold this sutra, they'll show their loving stuff.
Lay or monastic, or just a soul so free,
Gotta find compassion, for all the world to see.

Now some folks ain't heard it, some just don't believe,
But they're at a great loss, my heart it does grieve.
When I find the Buddha Way, with my expedient means so grand,
I'll preach this here Dharma, across the whole wide land.

Like a Wheel-turning king, with his soldiers brave and bold,
Rewards them with treasures, a story to be told.
Elephants and horses, carriages so fine,
Adornments for their bodies, and lands that truly shine.

Houses and villages, cities by the score,
Robes and precious jewels, and so much more.
Slaves and all their riches, given with a joyful hand,
A mighty good feeling, across the whole wide land.

But if there's a brave soldier, who does a mighty deed,
The king takes his topknot jewel, plantin' a royal seed.
The Tathagata's like that, the King of all that's true,
With mighty patience, and wisdom shinin' through.

With great compassion, he teaches the world his way,
Sees all human suffering, from night until the day.
They're fightin' all the demons, seekin' to be free,
For these weary souls, he preaches eternally.

With great expedient means, he preaches these sutras deep,
When folks gain their power, secrets he will keep.
Then finally he preaches, this Lotus Sutra bright,
Like the king's topknot jewel, shinin' in the light.

This sutra's the most revered, the highest of them all,
I've always protected it, ready for your call.
Today's the right moment, for me to let it fly,
After my departure, if you seek the Buddha high.

Want to preach this sutra, with peace and joy to find,
Gotta stick to these four Dharmas, and leave all worries behind.
Read this sacred sutra, no worries, no despair,
No sickness in your body, just a complexion fresh and fair.

No poverty or low status, no ugly face you'll see,
Folks will love to see you, like a sage they long to be.
The sons of all the gods, they'll serve you night and day,
Knives and sticks won't harm you, poisons can't hold sway.

If someone dares abuse you, their mouth will then be blocked,
You'll travel without fear, like a lion, strong and rocked.
Your wisdom light will shine, like the sun up in the sky,
If you dream, it's wondrous visions, passin' by.

See all the Tathagatas, on a lion's seat so grand,
Monks gathered all around, listenin' to understand.
Dragons and the spirits, asuras in their might,
Numerous as Ganges sands, joinin' palms in sacred light.

See your own body preachin', the Dharma for them all,
Buddhas with golden bodies, answerin' every call.
Emmitting boundless light, shinin' everywhere,
With Brahma's voice they teach, with wisdom beyond compare.

Buddha preaches Dharma, for all four groups to hear,
See yourself in the assembly, holdin' hands so dear.
Hear the Dharma with joy, offerings you will make,
Attain dhāranīs of wisdom, for goodness gracious sake.

Buddha knows your heart, deep in the Buddha Way,
Gives you a prophecy, for enlightenment that day.
"You, noble soul, in a life that's yet to be,
Will gain boundless wisdom, and the Buddha Way so free.

Your land will be adorned, so pure and grand and vast,
Four groups will gather 'round, their devotion built to last."
See yourself in the forest, cultivatin' good and true,
Realizin' all true natures, for me and for you.

Enter deep meditation, see Buddhas far and wide,
Golden bodies shinin', with hundred marks inside.
Hear the Dharma, preach it, always good dreams you'll find,
Dream you are a king, leavin' your palace behind.

Give up all your desires, walk to enlighten's shore,
Under the bodhi tree, and ask for nothing more.
For seven days you seek the Way, with Buddhas' wisdom bright,
Then you rise and turn the wheel, shinin' in the light.

Preach the Dharma for ages, for millions of kalpas long,
Subtle, unconditioned Dharma, where all souls belong.
Then you'll enter nirvana, like a lamp when smoke is gone,
If in evil ages, you preach this sacred dawn.

This person gains great benefit, all the merits I have shown,
A bluesy kind of blessing, right here in your home.



Chapter 15: Welling Up from the Earth
At that time, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas who had come from other lands, numbering more than eight times the sands of the Ganges, rose from the assembly, joined their palms in reverence, and said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, if you would permit us, after the Buddha's passing, we will diligently and with great effort, protect, uphold, read, recite, copy, and make offerings to this scripture in this Saha world. We will then widely preach it in this land."
At that time, the Buddha said to the assembly of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas: "Stop, noble men. There is no need for you to protect this sutra. Why? In my Saha world, there are already Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers. Each of these Bodhisattvas has a retinue of as many sentient beings as the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers. These people are able, after my passing, to protect, uphold, read, recite, and widely preach this sutra."
When the Buddha said this, the ground of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world split open and trembled. From within, countless millions of millions of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas rose all at once. These Bodhisattvas all had golden bodies, were adorned with the thirty-two marks, and radiated immeasurable light. They had all been living below the Saha world in the empty space of this realm. These Bodhisattvas heard the voice of Śākyamuni Buddha and came forth from below.
Each of these Bodhisattvas was the leader of a great assembly and had a retinue of sentient beings as numerous as the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers. How much more so for those who had retinues of fifty thousand, forty thousand, thirty thousand, twenty thousand, or ten thousand Ganges River sands? How much more still for those with even one Ganges River sand, a half, a quarter, or even one part of ten million nayuta? How much more for those with a retinue of millions and millions, or thousands and thousands, or hundreds, or tens, or even five, four, three, two, or one disciple? How much more for those who were alone and delighted in the practice of solitude? Such Bodhisattvas were immeasurable and boundless, beyond the reach of calculation and parables.
When these Bodhisattvas had emerged from the earth, they each went into the air to the wonderful seven-jeweled stupa, to the place of Abundant Treasures Tathagata and Śākyamuni Buddha. When they arrived, they bowed their heads at the feet of the two World-Honored Ones, and also paid reverence to the Buddhas on the lion’s seats under all the jeweled trees. They circled the Buddhas three times, joined their palms in reverence, and praised them with the various methods of Bodhisattva praise. They stood to one side, joyfully looking up at the two World-Honored Ones.
From the moment these Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas first emerged, they praised the Buddhas with various methods of Bodhisattva praise. In this way, a period of fifty minor kalpas passed. At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha sat in silence, and the four groups of the assembly also sat in silence for fifty minor kalpas. But by the supernatural power of the Buddha, the great assembly felt that it had been only a half day. At that time, the four groups of the assembly, also by the supernatural power of the Buddha, saw these Bodhisattvas filling the air of immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of worlds.
Among this assembly of Bodhisattvas, there were four leaders: first, Superior Conduct; second, Limitless Conduct; third, Pure Conduct; and fourth, Firmly-Established Conduct. These four Bodhisattvas were the foremost guides of the assembly. In front of the great assembly, they each joined their palms, looked at Śākyamuni Buddha, and asked him about his well-being: "World-Honored One, are you in good health and without much sickness? Are you at ease in your practice? Are those who should be saved easy to convert? Have they not caused the World-Honored One to become weary?"
At that time, the four great Bodhisattvas spoke in verse:
World-Honored One, tell me true, are you at ease?
In good health, without much sickness, if you please?
When you're converting souls, do you not feel the strain,
Or do they wear you out again and again?
And all these folks you're tryin' to save, are they easy to sway?
Or do they try your patience, every single day?
Don't they cause the World-Honored One, to sigh and moan,
Leaving you feeling weary, down to the bone?
At that time, the World-Honored One spoke to the great assembly of Bodhisattvas, saying: "It is so, it is so, noble men. The Tathagata is at ease, in good health and without much sickness. All sentient beings are easy to convert, and they do not cause me to become weary. Why? These sentient beings, from lifetime to lifetime, have always received my conversion. They have also, in the presence of past Buddhas, shown reverence and respect and planted all kinds of roots of goodness. When these sentient beings first see my body and hear what I preach, they immediately believe it and enter the wisdom of the Tathagata. For those who have first cultivated the Small Vehicle, I now also cause them to hear this sutra and enter the Buddha's wisdom."
At that time, all the great Bodhisattvas spoke in verse:
Oh, excellent, excellent, it's true,
Great, valiant World-Honored One, through and through.
All these sentient beings, they ain't hard to sway,
Gonna hear that wisdom, come what may.
You preach the Buddha's deep wisdom, a profound, sweet sound,
We rejoice when they hear it, on hallowed ground.
They believe and they practice, a new path they find,
Leaving all that old trouble, far behind.
At that time, the World-Honored One praised the four great Bodhisattvas: "Excellent, excellent, noble men! You are able to give rise to a mind of joy for the Tathagata."
At that time, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya and his assembly of Bodhisattvas as numerous as the sands of eight thousand Ganges Rivers, all thought: "From the past until now, we have never seen or heard of such a great assembly of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas rising from the earth, dwelling before the World-Honored One, joining their palms, making offerings, and asking about the Tathagata’s well-being."
At that time, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya, knowing the thoughts in the hearts of the Bodhisattvas, as numerous as the sands of eight thousand Ganges Rivers, and wishing to resolve his own doubts, joined his palms toward the Buddha and spoke in verse:
Countless Bodhisattvas, a sight to behold,
Never seen such a gathering, stories untold.
We beg of the Honored One, with two feet on the ground,
Tell us, where did they come from, and why are they around?  
With giant bodies and power, supernatural and grand,
Wisdom flows like a river, across the whole wide land.
Their resolve is solid, patience strong and deep,
A joy for all beings, secrets they keep.
Where did they come from, this magnificent crew?
Each Bodhisattva, with a retinue so vast,
Like sands of the Ganges, their numbers surely last.
Some great Bodhisattvas, with sixty thousand strong,
Seeking the Buddha Way, singing a single song.
These teachers so mighty, with their sixty thousand crew,
Came to make offerings, and see this sutra through.
Fifty thousand, forty thousand, thirty, twenty, and ten,
A thousand, a hundred, the numbers just extend.
One Ganges sand, a half, a quarter, a millionth part,
Ten thousand nayuta, right from the very start. 
Millions of millions of disciples, half a million too,
Their numbers just keep growing, for me and for you.
From a million down to ten thousand, then a thousand, a hundred,
Fifty, then just ten, numbers still unfettered.
Even three, two, or one, alone without a band,
Delighting in their solitude, across this weary land.
All have come to the Buddha's place, more than I can say.
If a person tried to count, through kalpas long and deep,
Like sands of the Ganges, secrets they would keep.
These Bodhisattvas, with majesty and grace,
Who preached the Dharma to them, in time and in space?
Who converted and completed, their souls so bright and keen?
From whom did they first rise, with a mind so pure and clean?
Whose Buddha Dharma did they praise, with voices loud and clear?
Whose sutras did they uphold, banishing all fear?
What Buddha Way did they cultivate, under the moon and sun?
These Bodhisattvas, with power and wisdom's might,
Caused the earth to tremble, in the fading light.
From within the ground they sprung, a sight I've never known,
World-Honored One, please tell me, where have they truly flown?
And the names of their lands, tell me if you please.
I've traveled to all lands, through the sky and through the trees,
But never seen this assembly, not a single face I know.
Suddenly from the earth they came, putting on a show.
World-Honored One, please tell me, the reason why they're here.
This great assembly now, countless, holding back no fear.
All these Bodhisattvas, want to know the truth,
The causes and conditions, from beginning to our youth.
Oh World-Honored One, with virtue beyond compare,
Please resolve our doubts, hanging in the air.
At that time, the emanations of Śākyamuni Buddha who had come from countless millions of millions of lands in other directions, were sitting on the lion’s seats under the jeweled trees in the eight directions. Their attendants each saw this great multitude of Bodhisattvas emerging from the ground in all four directions of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world and dwelling in the air. They each said to their Buddha: "World-Honored One, from where has this immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable assembly of Bodhisattvas come?"
At that time, all the Buddhas each said to their attendants: "Noble men, just wait for a moment. There is a Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva named Maitreya, who has been given a prophecy by Śākyamuni Buddha to be the next Buddha. He has already asked this question. The Buddha will now answer it. You will all be able to hear it on your own."
At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha said to Bodhisattva Maitreya: "Excellent, excellent, Ajita! You have been able to ask the Buddha such a great matter. You should all be of one mind, put on the armor of diligence, and give rise to a firm resolve. The Tathagata now wishes to reveal and declare the wisdom of all Buddhas, the independent supernatural power of all Buddhas, the lion's roar power of all Buddhas, and the powerful and majestic power of all Buddhas."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Be diligent, be of one mind, y'all hear what I say,
'Bout to speak on this matter, don't let no doubt hold sway.
Buddha's wisdom's a mystery, deep as the ocean blue,
So open up your hearts, let that good faith shine through.

Gotta find that power of faith, let it be your guide,
Dwell in goodness and patience, with nothing left to hide.
This Dharma you ain't heard before, gonna lay it on the line,
Now every single one of you, gonna hear it, it's your time.

I'm here to comfort you, now don't you fret or fear,
The Buddha speaks no false words, his wisdom's always clear.
Immeasurable and endless, like a river ever flowing,
So just listen closely now, let that understanding keep growing.

This supreme Dharma I found, it's subtle and it's deep,
Hard to tell it apart, secrets it does keep.
But I'm gonna speak it now, with a soulful, steady hand,
So listen with a single mind, across this troubled land.


At that time, the World-Honored One, having spoken this verse, said to Bodhisattva Maitreya: "I now declare to this great assembly and to you: Ajita, these great Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, immeasurable, countless, and asaṃkhyeya, who have sprung forth from the earth, whom you have never seen before, I, in this Saha world, since attaining Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, have converted, guided, and shown them the Way. I have subdued their minds and caused them to give rise to the mind for the Way. These Bodhisattvas all dwell in the empty space below this Saha world, and they read, recite, and master all the scriptures. They contemplate, differentiate, and remember them properly. Ajita, these noble men do not delight in being in a great assembly or in speaking much. They always delight in quiet places and diligently practice with vigor without ever resting. They do not rely on gods or humans to live. They always delight in profound wisdom and have no hindrances. They always delight in the Dharma of the Buddhas, diligently seeking supreme wisdom with a single mind."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
I, since a long time ago, Have converted these assemblies.
Ajita, listen close now, you oughta know,
These great Bodhisattvas, since long, long ago,
Through countless kalpas, they been workin' it out,
Cultivatin' Buddha's wisdom, no shadow of doubt.

Yeah, I converted 'em all, every single one,
Caused 'em to rise up, with the great mind for the Sun.
These are my children, they walkin' this earth,
Always practicin' hard, showin' their true worth.

Their spirits find comfort in a quiet, lonely place,
Left the noisy crowds behind, ain't no rush, no race.
Don't delight in much talkin', they got wisdom to find,
Leavin' the chatter behind 'em, settin' their soul free, mind by mind.

Such children, they learnin' the Dharma, my sacred song,
Progressin' day and night, where they truly belong.
Seekin' the Buddha Way, with a tireless, steady beat,
Movin' on down the road, on their weary feet.

They dwell in the empty space, beneath this Saha world,
Their resolve and their power, strong, they never unfurled.
Constantly seekin' wisdom, a light in the dark night,
Shinin' like a beacon, burnin' ever so bright.

They preach the wonderful Dharmas, with a fearless, joyful sound,
No fear in their hearts, when the truth is all around.
I was in Gaya city, under that bodhi tree,
Found the true enlightenment, for all the world to see.

Turned the supreme Dharma wheel, for the lost and the found,
That's when I converted 'em, from the cold, hard ground.
Caused 'em to first raise their mind, for the path and the light,
Now they're in a steady state, shinin' ever so bright.

They'll all attain Buddhahood, it's the truth I declare,
You gotta believe me, with a single mind and a prayer.
I, since a long, long time ago, with a love so deep and wide,
Converted these assemblies, stayin' right by their side.
At that time, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya and the countless Bodhisattvas felt doubt in their hearts. They were astonished by this unprecedented event and thought: "How could the World-Honored One, in such a short time, convert such immeasurable and countless asaṃkhyeya great Bodhisattvas and cause them to dwell in Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?" He then said to the Buddha:
"World-Honored One, when you were a prince, you left the palace of the Śākyas. Not far from the city of Gaya, you sat at the place of enlightenment and attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Since then, only a little over forty years have passed. World-Honored One, how, in such a short time, have you been able to do such a great work of a Buddha and, with the Buddha's power and merits, convert such an immeasurable assembly of great Bodhisattvas, causing them to attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?"
"World-Honored One, even if a person were to count these great Bodhisattva assemblies for millions of kalpas, they could not exhaust or reach the end of their number. These beings, since ancient times, under immeasurable and countless Buddhas, have planted all kinds of good roots, completed the Bodhisattva Way, and constantly cultivated pure conduct. World-Honored One, this matter is difficult for the world to believe. It is like a person who is handsome and has black hair, and is only twenty-five years old. He points to a hundred-year-old man and says, 'This is my son.' And the hundred-year-old man also points to the young man and says, 'This is my father, who fathered us.' This is a matter that the entire world would find difficult to believe."
"The Buddha is also like this. The time since you attained the Way is truly not long, and yet this great assembly of Bodhisattvas has, for immeasurable millions of kalpas, diligently practiced for the sake of the Buddha Way. They have skillfully entered, dwelt in, and come out of immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of samadhis, attained great supernatural powers, cultivated pure conduct for a long time, and are skilled in gradually learning all wholesome Dharmas. They are eloquent in asking and answering questions, they are the treasures of the world, and are extremely rare in all the worlds. Yet today, the World-Honored One says that when he attained the Buddha Way, he first caused them to give rise to the mind of enlightenment, and he converted and guided them, causing them to aspire to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. The World-Honored One attained Buddhahood not long ago, and yet you were able to do this great and meritorious deed.
Although we believe what the Buddha says, that his words are spoken with expedient means and are never false, and that the Buddha knows and has a thorough understanding of everything, if the new Bodhisattvas, after the Buddha’s passing, were to hear these words, they might not believe them and thus commit the sin of rejecting the Dharma. For this reason, World-Honored One, we ask that you explain this matter to remove our doubts, so that in the future, when noble men hear this, they will also not give rise to doubt."
At that time, Bodhisattva Maitreya, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Lord Buddha left his clan, it's true,
By Gaya's city, 'neath the Bodhi, too.
It wasn't long ago, that much is clear,
But his many sons, they conquer fear.

These countless sons, they walk the Way,
With powers mystic, come what may.
Like lotuses pure, from mud they rise,
Undefiled by the world, beneath the skies.

With hearts so humble, they stand tall,
Before the World-Honored, hearing his call.
This mystery deep, it's hard to see,
How can such wonders truly be?

The Buddha's Way, so newly found,
Yet such achievements on holy ground.
Please clear our doubts, and make it plain,
Unveil the truth, again and again.

Like a young man, twenty-five years old,
Shows a son of a hundred, with stories untold.
White hair and wrinkles, a weathered face,
"I fathered these," he says with grace.

The son replies, "My father, you see,
He raised me up, for all to agree."
A young father, old son, a curious sight,
The world would question, with all its might.

The World-Honored, he's like this too,
His time on the Way, so fresh and new.
But these Bodhisattvas, with spirits bold,
Have wisdom and courage, worth more than gold.

For countless ages, they've walked the path,
Skilled in the Dharma, escaping its wrath.
Their hearts are fearless, their answers keen,
The Bodhisattva Way, a glorious scene.

Their patience holds strong, their forms so grand,
Praised by the Buddhas, across every land.
They preach the Dharma, with skillful art,
And keep to themselves, deep in the heart.

No joy in crowds, but meditation's call,
They seek the Buddha Way, to give their all.
In empty space below, they make their home,
Till enlightenment's light, helps them to roam.

We've heard the Buddha, and doubt we have none,
But for the future, 'til rising of sun.
Explain it for them, to bring light and grace,
Enlightenment's journey, in every place.

If this sutra brings doubt, and they turn away,
To evil destinies, they'll fall astray.
So please explain now, the how and the why,
These countless Bodhisattvas, reaching for the sky.

In such a short time, they've found their mind's quest,
On non-retrogression's ground, they now will rest.
How did it happen, this change so profound?
Let wisdom and truth, forever resound.


Chapter 16: The Lifespan of the Tathagata
At that time, the Buddha said to all the Bodhisattvas and the entire great assembly: "Noble men, you must believe and understand the Tathagata's honest and truthful words." He again said to the great assembly: "You must believe and understand the Tathagata's honest and truthful words." And again, he said to the great assembly: "You must believe and understand the Tathagata's honest and truthful words."
At that time, the assembly of Bodhisattvas, led by Maitreya, joined their palms and said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we only wish that you would speak. We will believe and accept the Buddha's words." After they made this request three times, they said again: "We only wish that you would speak. We will believe and accept the Buddha's words."
At that time, the World-Honored One, knowing that the Bodhisattvas' three requests would not stop, said to them: "You must listen carefully to the secret and supernatural power of the Tathagata. All the worlds of gods, humans, and asuras believe that Śākyamuni Buddha left the palace of the Śākya clan, and not far from the city of Gaya, sat at the place of enlightenment and attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. But noble men, I have, in fact, attained Buddhahood since immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta asaṃkhyeya kalpas ago."
"It is like five hundred million million nayuta asaṃkhyeya three-thousand-great-thousand-fold worlds. If there was a person who ground them into fine dust, and then, after passing five hundred million million nayuta asaṃkhyeya worlds to the east, he dropped one speck of dust. In this way, he continues eastward until all the fine dust is used up. Noble men, what do you think? Can these worlds be calculated or can their number be known by a thought?"
Bodhisattva Maitreya and the others all said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, these worlds are immeasurable and boundless. They are not known by calculation, nor can they be reached by the power of the mind. All the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, with their pure wisdom, cannot contemplate or know their number. We, who dwell on the ground of non-retrogression, also cannot reach this. World-Honored One, such worlds are truly immeasurable and boundless."
At that time, the Buddha said to the great assembly of Bodhisattvas: "Noble men, I will now clearly declare this for you. All these worlds, whether a speck of dust was dropped on them or not, if they were all made into dust, and each speck of dust were a kalpa, the time since I attained Buddhahood would be more than that by hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta asaṃkhyeya kalpas. Since that time, I have constantly been in this Saha world, preaching the Dharma and converting beings. I have also, in other places, in hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta asaṃkhyeya worlds, guided and benefited sentient beings."
"Noble men, in this interim, I have spoken of Buddhas such as Burning Lamp and have also said that they entered nirvana. All of this was differentiated through expedient means. Noble men, if there are sentient beings who come to me, I use my Buddha eye to observe their faith and their sharpness or dullness of faculties. According to who needs to be saved, I manifest myself in different places, with different names and ages. I also declare that I am about to enter nirvana, and I use all kinds of expedient means to preach the subtle and wonderful Dharma, which can cause sentient beings to give rise to a joyful heart. Noble men, when the Tathagata sees sentient beings who delight in the small Dharma and have little virtue and heavy defilements, he preaches for these people, saying: 'I renounced my home when I was young and attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.' However, I have actually attained Buddhahood for a long, long time, but for the sake of converting sentient beings and causing them to enter the Buddha Way, I speak in this way."
"Noble men, all the scriptures expounded by the Tathagata are for the sake of saving and liberating sentient beings. Sometimes he speaks of his own body, and sometimes he speaks of other bodies. Sometimes he shows his own deeds, and sometimes he shows the deeds of others. All that he says is truthful and not false. Why? The Tathagata truly knows and sees the nature of the three realms. There is no such thing as life and death, or leaving and returning. There is also no such thing as dwelling in the world or passing away. It is neither real nor false, neither the same nor different. It is not like the three realms, which are seen as the three realms. Such matters are clearly seen by the Tathagata, without any error. Because sentient beings have various natures, various desires, various practices, and various thoughts and differentiations, wishing to cause them to give rise to roots of goodness, I use various causes, parables, and words to preach the Dharma in various ways. The work of a Buddha has never ceased, not even for a moment. In this way, the time since I attained Buddhahood has been very long. My life span is immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, and I constantly dwell in the world and do not pass away."
"Noble men, the life span I attained through my practice of the Bodhisattva Way is still not exhausted, and it is more than double the number I gave above. However, I am not truly entering extinction, but I declare that I am about to attain extinction. The Tathagata uses this expedient means to convert sentient beings. Why? If the Buddha were to dwell in the world for a long time, people with little virtue would not plant roots of goodness. They would be poor and of low status, and would be attached to the five desires, falling into a net of thoughts and false views. If they saw that the Tathagata always exists and does not pass away, they would become arrogant and lazy. They would not give rise to the thought that he is difficult to encounter or a respectful mind. For this reason, the Tathagata, using expedient means, says: 'Monks, you should know that the appearance of the Buddhas in the world is difficult to encounter.' Why? For those with little virtue, after countless millions of kalpas, they may see a Buddha, or they may not. Because of this, I say: 'Monks, the Tathagata is difficult to see.' When these sentient beings hear such words, they will surely give rise to the thought that he is difficult to encounter, and their hearts will be filled with longing and thirst for the Buddha. They will then plant roots of goodness. For this reason, even though the Tathagata does not truly pass away, he says he is entering extinction."
"Furthermore, noble men, the Dharmas of all the Tathagatas are all like this. For the sake of saving sentient beings, their words are all true and not false.
The Parable of the Good Doctor
"Imagine a good doctor who is intelligent and wise, and who is well-versed in prescriptions and medicines, and skilled at curing all kinds of sicknesses. This man has many children, perhaps ten, twenty, or even a hundred. Because of a business matter, he goes far away to another country. Later, his children drink poison that was given to them by someone else. When the poison takes effect, they become confused and lie on the ground, rolling in agony.
At that time, their father returns home. Some of the children who drank the poison have lost their original minds, and some have not. When they see their father from a distance, they are all filled with great joy. They bow down and ask about his safe and peaceful return: 'We were foolish and accidentally drank poison. We wish that you would save and cure us and grant us a longer life.' The father sees his children suffering like this. He follows the prescriptions in the scriptures, finds good medicinal herbs, and has them prepared with all the right colors, fragrances, and tastes. He grinds and sifts them and gives them to his children to take, saying: 'This is a great, good medicine. Its color and fragrance are both wonderful, and it is complete with all good tastes. You should all take it. It will quickly remove your suffering and afflictions, and you will have no more sickness.'
"Among the children, those who had not lost their minds saw that this good medicine had a wonderful color and fragrance, and they immediately took it. Their sickness was completely cured. The others, who had lost their minds, although they saw their father return and were happy to ask about his well-being and seek a cure for their sickness, refused to take the medicine when it was given to them. Why? Because the poison had gone deep and they had lost their original minds. They thought that this medicine, with its wonderful color and fragrance, was not good.
The father thought: 'These children are pitiful. They have been poisoned, and their minds are all upside-down. Although they see me and are happy, and they seek to be saved and cured, they will not take this wonderful medicine. I must now devise an expedient means to cause them to take this medicine.' He then said: 'You should all know that I am now old, and my time to die has come. This good, great medicine will be left here. You can take it and take it. Do not worry that you will not be cured.'
Having given this instruction, he went to another country. He sent a messenger back to his home to say: 'Your father has died.' When the children heard of their father's passing, their hearts were filled with great sorrow and affliction. They thought: 'If our father were still alive, he would have compassion for us and be able to save and protect us. But now he has left us and passed away in a distant land.' They felt orphaned and alone, with no one to rely on. A constant feeling of grief filled their hearts, and their minds gradually became clear. They then realized that the medicine was good in its color, taste, and fragrance. They took it immediately, and the sickness from the poison was all cured. Their father heard that his children had all recovered, so he returned home and let them all see him."
"Noble men, what do you think? Is there anyone who could say that this good doctor committed a crime of falsehood?"
"No, World-Honored One."
The Buddha said: "I am also like this. The time since I attained Buddhahood has been an immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta asaṃkhyeya kalpas. For the sake of sentient beings, I use the power of expedient means to say that I am about to enter extinction. There is no one who can, according to the Dharma, accuse me of a fault of falsehood."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Since I found my true Buddha way, many eons have flown by,
Countless millions, I've guided on their path beneath the sky.
I preach the Dharma, clear and strong, for souls lost in the night,
To bring 'em to the Buddha's light, and make their burdens light.

I use my means, a gentle trick, to show 'em I have gone,
But I'm right here, preachin' on, from dusk 'til early morn.
Though they don't see me, close at hand, with eyes that still are blind,
My power keeps me ever near, for those with open mind.

When they believe I've passed away, they bring their offerings true,
Their hearts are filled with longing deep, for a glimpse of me and you.
When faithful hearts turn soft and pure, no worldly goods they crave,
They give their bodies, lives and all, for the truth I came to save.

Then me and all my holy crew, on Vulture Peak appear,
I tell 'em then, "I'm always here, banish all your fear."
I use my means, a spirit strong, to show I'm here and gone,
For respectful souls in distant lands, who sing my joyful song.

I preach the Dharma, high and deep, though you don't hear my call,
You just believe I've passed away, standin' tall through it all.
When I see suffering in their eyes, and sorrow in their soul,
I hide away, to make 'em yearn, and make their spirits whole.

When longing fills their weary hearts, I show my face again,
My mystic power, like a river, flows without end.
On Vulture Peak, I make my home, and other places too,
When kalpas end, and fires rage, my land remains for you.

My land is peaceful, sweet and calm, with angels all around,
Gardens bright and halls so grand, where treasures can be found.
Jeweled trees with flowers bloom, for happy souls to play,
Heaven's drums keep beat and time, from night 'til break of day.

Mandara flowers, soft and light, on Buddha and the crowd,
My pure land ain't destroyed, my friend, though they see a fiery cloud.
Worries, fears, and troubles deep, these sinful souls they bear,
Because of their own wicked ways, and burdens hard to share.

For endless kalpas, they don't hear, the Jewels, a sacred sound,
But those who walk a righteous path, with gentleness profound,
They see my body, right and true, preachin' the Dharma's word,
Sometimes I say my life is long, a truth they've never heard.

For those who find me after long, I say I'm hard to see,
My wisdom light shines, far and wide, for all eternity.
My life, it spans a million years, from countless deeds I've done,
So wise ones, cast your doubts away, beneath the risin' sun.

For Buddha's words are never false, a truth that rings so clear,
Like a good doctor, with his tricks, to calm his children's fear.
He says he's gone, though he's alive, no lie can touch his name,
I am the father of this world, quenching suffering's flame.

For foolish souls, with minds astray, I say I've passed away,
'Cause when they see me all the time, they grow so proud each day.
Lazy, bound by worldly things, to evil paths they fall,
But I know who walks the righteous path, and who will heed my call.

I preach the Dharma, in its forms, for every soul in need,
I always think, "How can I sow, that wisdom's precious seed?"
To lead 'em to the highest truth, and swiftly, on that day,
To help 'em find the Buddha's form, and walk the righteous way.






Chapter 17: Merits of Distinction
At that time, the great assembly, having heard the Buddha speak of his life span as being so long and far-reaching, found that immeasurable, boundless, and asaṃkhyeya sentient beings gained great benefits. Then the World-Honored One said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya:
"Ajita, when I preached that the Tathagata's life span is long and far-reaching, sentient beings, as numerous as the sands of six hundred and eighty million million nayuta Ganges Rivers, attained the patience of non-arising. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, one thousand times that number, attained the Dharma-gate of total recall (dhāranī). Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of one world attained the unhindered eloquence of joyful speech. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of one world attained the total recall of the whirling Dharma, with its hundreds of thousands of millions of varieties. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of a three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world were able to turn the non-retrogressing Dharma wheel. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of two thousand middle worlds were able to turn the pure Dharma wheel. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of a thousand small worlds will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi in eight lifetimes. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of four four-continents will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi in four lifetimes. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of three four-continents will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi in three lifetimes. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of two four-continents will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi in two lifetimes. Furthermore, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of one four-continent will attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi in one lifetime. Furthermore, sentient beings as numerous as the dust motes of eight worlds all gave rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."
"When the Buddha spoke of these Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas gaining the great benefits of the Dharma, heavenly maṇḍārava and mahāmaṇḍārava flowers rained down from the air. They were scattered upon the Buddhas sitting on the lion's seats under the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of jeweled trees, and also upon Śākyamuni Buddha and the long-passed-away Abundant Treasures Tathagata in the seven-jeweled stupa. They were also scattered upon all the great Bodhisattvas and the four groups of the assembly.
"Fine sandalwood and incense like agarwood also rained down from the air. Heavenly drums sounded by themselves, with a subtle and profound sound. A thousand kinds of heavenly robes also rained down, along with garlands of pearls, garlands of mani jewels, and garlands of wish-fulfilling jewels. They filled the nine directions. Jeweled incense burners of many kinds, burning priceless incense, naturally spread everywhere as offerings to the great assembly. Above each Buddha, there were Bodhisattvas holding banners and canopies, moving in order, all the way up to the Brahma heavens. These Bodhisattvas, with their wonderful voices, sang countless verses, praising all the Buddhas."
At that time, Bodhisattva Maitreya rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, joined his palms toward the Buddha, and spoke in verse:
The Buddha done preached a Dharma so rare,
A truth we ain't never heard, beyond compare.
The World-Honored One, with power so deep,
His life span, Lord, a secret he does keep.

His countless sons, they hear his voice so sweet,
Of Dharma's merits, joy from head to feet.
Some stand on ground where they can't fall behind,
Some grab that dhāranī, to ease their troubled mind.

Some speak with joyful words, like a river's flow,
Or recall a million whirlings, watchin' memories grow.
Bodhisattvas, like dust motes in the air,
Turn the Dharma wheel, beyond all care.

From a great-thousand-fold world, they rise and shine,
Turnin' that wheel, a cosmic, righteous design.
Then from a middle-thousand, they do appear,
Turnin' the pure Dharma wheel, banishin' all fear.

From a small-thousand-fold world, they come along,
Eight more lifetimes, Lord, then they'll sing their Buddha song.
And from four, three, or two four-continents wide,
They'll reach Buddhahood, with nowhere to hide.

Or from one four-continent, a dusty, single plea,
One more lifetime, Lord, then All-Knowing Wisdom they'll see.
All these beings, hearin' his long, long span,
Got pure karmic rewards, a divine master plan.

Dust motes of eight worlds, they hear his sweet decree,
His life span spoken, oh Lord, for all to see.
They raise their minds supreme, in a soulful, thankful way,
For the World-Honored One, brighten' every day.

He preaches Dharmas, immeasurable and grand,
Benefits vast, like empty space, across the land.
Heavenly maṇḍārava, and mahāmaṇḍārava too,
Rainin' down like blessings, from skies of darkest blue.

Śakras and Brahmās, like Ganges sands they throng,
From countless Buddha lands, joinin' the joyful song.
Sandalwood and agarwood, a sweet, sweet perfume,
Fallin' scattered everywhere, chasin' away the gloom.

Like birds from the sky, they come flyin' low,
To make their offerings, Lord, to all the Buddhas we know.
Heavenly drums in the air, a natural, soulful sound,
Tens of thousands of robes, whirlin' all around.

Jeweled incense burners, precious and so bright,
Burnin' priceless incense, fillin' the world with light.
Naturally spreadin' everywhere, a fragrant, holy haze,
Makin' offerings to World-Honored Ones, throughout their endless days.

Great Bodhisattva assemblies, banners in their hand,
Hundreds of millions of kinds, across the sacred land.
They rise to the Brahma heavens, in a majestic, holy line,
Before each and every Buddha, a truly blessed sign.

Jeweled banners and canopies, hangin' low and deep,
Millions of verses sung, while the heavens weep.
They sing and praise Tathagatas, with a bluesy, soulful moan,
Such things we ain't never seen, Lord, we're not alone.

Hearin' his life span, immeasurable and free,
Everyone's joyful, Lord, for all eternity.
The Buddha's fame rings out, in the ten directions wide,
Benefitin' all beings, with nowhere left to hide.
All are complete in good roots, a righteous, holy quest,
To attain the supreme mind, and finally find their rest.
At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya: "Ajita, if there is a sentient being who hears that the Buddha's life span is so long and far-reaching, and is able to give rise to a single thought of belief and understanding, the merit they attain is without any limit. If a noble man or noble woman, for the sake of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, practices the five pāramitās for eighty million million nayuta kalpas—the pāramitā of giving, the pāramitā of precepts, the pāramitā of patience, the pāramitā of diligence, and the pāramitā of meditation, but not the pāramitā of wisdom—and you compare this merit to the previous merit, it is not even one hundredth, one thousandth, one hundred-millionth of it. It cannot be known by any calculation or parable. If a noble man or noble woman has such a merit, it is impossible for them to retrogress from Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Such people, Will have no doubt about this.
If a soul seeks the Buddha's light,
Through eighty million kalpas, day and night,
And five pāramitās, so strong and true,
Yeah, that's what a seeker's got to do.

Through those long kalpas, he gives and he prays,
To Buddhas and pratyekas, in a spiritual haze,
To Bodhisattva assemblies, a glorious sight,
Offerings made with all his might.

Rare food and precious, a feast for the soul,
Fine robes and bedding, making spirits whole,
Sandalwood halls for their peaceful rest,
Gardens around them, put to the test.

Such acts of giving, subtle and sweet,
Through all these kalpas, on weary feet,
To the Buddha Way, his heart he lays,
Yeah, through all those long and winding days.

If he upholds the precepts, pure and clean,
No flaws within him, a righteous scene,
And seeks the supreme Way, so high and grand,
All Buddhas will praise him, across the land.

If patience he practices, a gentle soul,
Harmony's ground, making his spirit whole,
Though evils surround him, a troublesome fray,
His mind won't be moved, come what may.

If arrogant ones, with Dharma's claim,
Torment and despise him, bringing him shame,
He'll endure it all, with a steady hand,
Yeah, that's the true spirit, across the land.

If he's diligent, his resolve stands firm,
For millions of kalpas, through every storm,
His mind is one, no laziness there,
Just steady devotion, beyond compare.

For countless kalpas, in a secluded spot,
Whether sitting or walking, whatever he's got,
Sleepiness banished, his mind he keeps clear,
Yeah, banishing doubt and every fear.

Because of this cause, meditations he'll find,
For eighty million kalpas, a peaceful mind,
No scattering thoughts, just a tranquil place,
Blessed with one mind, showing his grace.

With blessings of this mind, the Way he'll seek,
Till All-Knowing Wisdom, his spirit will speak,
Exhausting all states of meditation deep,
Yeah, those promises he's bound to keep.

This person, for hundreds of thousands of years,
Will cultivate merits, drying all tears,
As I have spoken, from way up above,
With wisdom and mercy, and endless love.

If a noble man or woman, hears my tale,
Of my life's long journey, they won't fail,
With faith for a single thought, pure and true,
Their blessings will surpass all that they do.

If a person has no doubt, no regret,
Believes with a deep heart, they won't forget,
Their blessings will flow, like a mighty stream,
Yeah, like a beautiful, sweet, soulful dream.

If Bodhisattvas, for kalpas untold,
Have practiced the Way, brave and bold,
When they hear my life span, so long and wide,
They'll believe and accept it, deep inside.

Such people, who receive this word from on high,
Vow for a long life, beneath the sky,
To save sentient beings, with hearts so pure,
Yeah, their compassion will surely endure.

Just like the World-Honored, today we see,
The King among Śākyas, wild and free,
Roaring a lion's roar, at the sacred place,
Preaching the Dharma, with fearless grace.

We in the future, revered we'll be,
When we sit where enlightenment sets us free,
We'll speak of our life span, the very same way,
Yeah, we'll sing our own blues, come what may.

If people with deep hearts, honest and bright,
Heard much and uphold it, with all their might,
Understand Buddha's words, in every true sense,
Yeah, they'll have no doubt, building their defense.
"Furthermore, Ajita, if there is a person who hears that the Buddha's life span is long and far-reaching and understands its meaning, the merit this person attains is without any limit. They are able to give rise to the Buddha's supreme wisdom. How much more so for one who widely hears this sutra, or causes others to hear it? Or if they uphold it themselves, or cause others to uphold it? Or if they copy it themselves, or cause others to copy it? Or if they make offerings to the sutra scrolls with flowers, incense, garlands, banners, canopies, fragrant oil, and ghee lamps? The merit of this person is immeasurable and boundless. He is able to give rise to All-Knowing Wisdom.
"Ajita, if a noble man or noble woman hears me speak of my long and far-reaching life span and believes and understands it with a deep heart, they will be as if they see the Buddha constantly on Mount Vulture Peak, surrounded by great Bodhisattvas and śrāvaka assemblies, preaching the Dharma. They will also see this Saha world with a ground of lapis lazuli, level and smooth, with golden ropes lining the eight roads. Jeweled trees will stand in rows, and all the towers and pavilions will be made of jewels. The Bodhisattva assemblies will all be dwelling within it. If a person can contemplate in this way, you should know that this is a sign of deep belief and understanding."
"Furthermore, after the Tathagata’s passing, if a person hears this sutra and does not slander it but gives rise to a joyful heart, you should know that this is also a sign of deep belief and understanding. How much more so for one who reads, recites, and upholds it? Such a person is bearing the Tathagata on his head.
"Ajita, this noble man or noble woman does not need to build a stupa or monastery for me or make the four kinds of offerings to the monastic community. Why? This noble man or noble woman who receives, upholds, reads, and recites this scripture has already built a stupa, erected monasteries, and made offerings to the monastic community. They have already built a seven-jeweled stupa with the Buddha’s relics, which is tall and vast, gradually becoming smaller as it reaches the Brahma heavens. They have hung banners and canopies and all kinds of jeweled bells from it, with flowers, incense, garlands, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, all kinds of drums, music, flutes, and harps. With wonderful voices, they sing and praise it. This is as if they have made these offerings for immeasurable millions of kalpas."
"Ajita, after my passing, if a person hears this scripture and is able to uphold it, or copies it himself, or causes others to copy it, he has already built monasteries. He has built thirty-two halls and pavilions with red sandalwood, which are eight tāla trees high, vast, and beautifully adorned. A hundred thousand monks will dwell within them. The gardens, bathing ponds, walking meditation areas, and meditation caves will all be complete with various wonderful things. Such monasteries and pavilions, numbering hundreds of thousands of millions, are immeasurable. With these, he makes offerings to me and the monastic community. For this reason, I say that after the Tathagata’s passing, if a person upholds, reads, recites, and preaches this sutra for others, or copies it himself, or causes others to copy it and make offerings to the sutra scrolls, he does not need to build a stupa or monastery and make offerings to the monastic community.
"How much more so for a person who can uphold this sutra and also practice giving, precepts, patience, diligence, a single mind, and wisdom? Their virtues are the most supreme, immeasurable, and boundless. Just as empty space—east, west, south, north, the four diagonals, above, and below—is immeasurable and boundless, the merit of this person is also immeasurable and boundless. He will quickly attain All-Knowing Wisdom. If a person reads and recites this sutra, upholds it, preaches it for others, copies it himself, or causes others to copy it, and is also able to erect a stupa, build monasteries, and make offerings to and praise the śrāvaka monastic community, and also uses hundreds of thousands of millions of methods to praise the merits of the Bodhisattvas, and for the sake of others, uses various causes and conditions to explain this Lotus Sutra according to its meaning, and is also able to purely uphold the precepts and live with those who are gentle, is patient and without anger, his resolve is firm, he always values sitting in meditation and attains various profound meditations, he is diligent and valiant, gathering all good Dharmas, and he has sharp wisdom and is skilled in answering difficult questions..."
"Ajita, after my passing, if a noble man or noble woman receives and upholds this scripture and has these wholesome merits, you should know that this person has already reached the place of enlightenment and is close to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, sitting under the bodhi tree. Ajita, if a noble man or noble woman is sitting, standing, or in a walking meditation area, a stupa should be erected right there. All the gods and humans should make offerings to it, as if it were the Buddha's stupa."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
If after my passing, one can uphold this sutra,
The blessings of this soul, they're immeasurable, sure.
Just like I done told ya, said it plain and true,
The good that comes from this, gonna see you through.

This person, they done finished, all the offerings grand,
Built a stupa with relics, across the whole wide land.
Adorned with seven treasures, shining bright and bold,
A story of devotion, forever to be told.

Its jeweled shaft so tall, reaching for the sky,
Getting smaller as it climbs, way up where the Brahmins lie.
Precious bells in the millions, a sweet sound they make,
When the wind comes blowin', for goodness gracious sake.

For kalpas without number, they offer to this shrine,
With flowers and with incense, a love so divine.
Heavenly robes and music, a joyful, soulful praise,
And lamps of fragrant oil, burning through all days.

To constantly illuminate, all around the place,
In this evil age of Dharma, with its troubled pace.
One who can uphold this sutra, when the darkness calls,
Is like one who's done completed, all these offerings in the halls.

If one can uphold this sutra, it's as if the Buddha's near,
Dispelling all the shadows, calming every fear.
He makes offerings to a monastery, built with sandalwood so fine,
Thirty-two halls standing tall, eight tāla trees in a line.

With food so good and robes so grand, and bedding soft and deep,
A place for hundreds of thousands, secrets to keep.
With gardens bright and ponds for bathing, where the cool waters flow,
Walking meditation areas, where peaceful spirits grow.

Meditation caves so quiet, adorned in every way,
If a heart believes and understands, come what may.
Receives, upholds, or reads it, recites or makes a copy, too,
Or gets some others to copy, for me and for you.

And makes offerings to these scrolls, with flowers and incense sweet,
With powdered incense rising, beneath their holy feet.
With sumana and campaka, and atimukta flowers bright,
He keeps those lamps a-burning, through the long, dark night.

A person who makes these offerings, gets blessings without end,
Like empty space unending, a true and faithful friend.
His blessings are like that, immeasurable and wide,
How much more for one who holds this sutra, deep down inside.

And practices his giving, and keeps the precepts true,
With patience and with meditation, for me and for you.
Is not angry, speaks no evil, respects the stupas tall,
Is humble to the monks, standing up for one and all.

Far from arrogance he walks, contemplating wisdom's light,
If questions come a-calling, in the dark and weary night,
He's not angry, but compassionate, explains it clear and slow,
If one can practice this conduct, their merits truly grow.

If you see this Dharma teacher, with virtues so complete,
You should scatter heavenly flowers, right there at his feet.
And cover him with robes from heaven, a sight for weary eyes,
Bow your head before him, as if a Buddha from the skies.

You should think, "He's bound for glory, to enlightenment so true,
Attain the unconditioned, for me and for you.
And widely benefit the gods, and all of humankind,"
Such a spirit walking, a peaceful, loving mind.

His dwelling place, his walking, his sitting or his rest,
Or even where he preaches, a single verse, put to the test.
A stupa should be built there, adorned and wondrous to see,
And offerings received there, for all eternity.

A son of the Buddha dwelling, upon this sacred ground,
Is using Buddha's own tools, where truth can be found.
He's always in this place, through sunshine and through rain,
Walking, sitting, or lying, easing all the pain.



Chapter 18: Merits of Joyful Following
At that time, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, if a noble man or noble woman hears this Lotus Sutra and rejoices in it, how much merit do they attain?" He spoke in verse, asking:
Since the Buddha done walked away,
Yeah, since the World-Honored One has passed on,
If a soul should chance to hear this Dharma today,
And find their heart rejoicin' 'fore the break of dawn,
Tell me, what kind of good fortune will that person claim?
What blessings fall upon 'em, speak the sacred name?
At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya: "Ajita, after the Tathagata's passing, if a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman, or any other wise person, whether old or young, hears this sutra, and having rejoiced in it, leaves the Dharma assembly and goes to another place—whether in a monastery, a secluded place, a city, a street, a village, or a field—and for their parents, relatives, good friends, or acquaintances, preaches what they heard according to their ability, and these people hear it and rejoice, and then in turn preach to others, and others hear it and also rejoice and preach in turn, and so on, until the fiftieth person in this chain. Ajita, I will now speak of the merit of the fiftieth person who rejoices. You should listen well."
The Merit of the Fiftieth Person
"Imagine in four hundred million million asaṃkhyeya worlds, there are all the sentient beings of the six destinies and four types of birth—those born from eggs, from wombs, from moisture, and from transformation; those with form and those without form; those with thought, those without thought, and those with neither thought nor no thought; and those with no feet, two feet, four feet, or many feet. In this great number of sentient beings, there is a person who seeks to plant blessings and gives them all the means of enjoyment they desire. He gives each and every one of these sentient beings enough gold, silver, lapis lazuli, tridacna, agate, coral, amber, and other wonderful precious treasures to fill the entire Jambudvīpa (the entire world). He also gives them elephants, horses, carriages, and jeweled palaces and pavilions. This great giver practices this charity for eighty years. He then thinks: 'I have given all sentient beings the means of enjoyment they wished for, but now these sentient beings are all old, over eighty years of age, with white hair and wrinkled faces, and will soon die. I should now instruct and guide them with the Buddha Dharma.' He then gathers all these sentient beings and proclaims the Dharma, revealing and teaching it to them, bringing them benefit and joy. They all, at once, attain the fruit of a srotāpanna, a sakṛdāgāmin, an anāgāmin, and an arhat. They end all their defilements, attain freedom in profound meditation, and are complete in the eight liberations.
What do you think, Maitreya? Is the merit gained by this great giver great?"
Maitreya said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, the merit of this person is very great, immeasurable, and boundless. If this giver had only given all sentient beings the means of enjoyment, his merit would be immeasurable, let alone causing them to attain the fruit of an arhat."
The Buddha said to Maitreya: "I will now tell you clearly. The merit of that person who gave all the means of enjoyment to the sentient beings of the six destinies in four hundred million million asaṃkhyeya worlds and also caused them to attain the fruit of an arhat, is not even one-hundredth, one-thousandth, or one-hundred-millionth of the merit of the fiftieth person who hears a single verse of the Lotus Sutra and rejoices in it. It is beyond the reach of any calculation or parable. Ajita, the merit of this fiftieth person in the chain who rejoices in the Lotus Sutra is still immeasurable, boundless, and asaṃkhyeya, how much more so for the person who first heard it in the assembly and rejoiced? Their blessings are even greater, immeasurable, boundless, and asaṃkhyeya, and cannot be compared."
The Merit of Simple Acts
"Furthermore, Ajita, if a person, for the sake of this sutra, goes to a monastery and, whether sitting or standing, listens for a moment and accepts it, because of this merit, in their next life, they will be reborn with good and wonderful elephants, horses, carriages, jeweled palanquins, and will even ride in a heavenly palace. If a person is sitting in a place where the Dharma is being preached and another person comes and is encouraged to sit and listen, or if they give a part of their seat to them, the merit of this person is such that in their next life, they will be reborn in the seat of Śakra, or on the seat of the Brahma King, or on the seat of a wheel-turning holy king."
"Ajita, if a person says to another person: 'There is a sutra named the Lotus Sutra; we should go and listen to it together,' and that person accepts the instruction and goes and listens for even a moment, the merit of this person is such that in their next life, they will be reborn in the same place as a Bodhisattva with dhāranīs. They will have sharp faculties and wisdom, and for hundreds of thousands of lifetimes, they will never be mute. Their breath will never be foul, their tongue will always be free of sickness, and their mouth will also be free of sickness. Their teeth will not be dirty, black, or yellow; they will not be gapped, crooked, or missing. Their lips will not be drooping, retracted, coarse, or chapped. They will not be broken or slanted. They will not be thick or large, or dark and black. They will not have any unpleasant characteristics. Their lips, tongue, and teeth will all be beautifully adorned. Their nose will be long, high, and straight. Their face will be round and full. Their eyebrows will be high and long. Their forehead will be broad, level, and straight. They will be complete in the marks of a human being. In every life in which they are born, they will see the Buddha, hear the Dharma, and believe and accept his teachings."
"Ajita, you should consider this: the merit of encouraging a single person to go and listen to the Dharma is like this. How much more so for one who listens with a single mind, preaches and recites it, and for the great assembly, explains it for others and practices it as it is taught?"
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
If a soul, at a sacred assembly, hear this holy word,
Yeah, even just one verse, that's all that's heard.
They feel that joy deep down, and they pass that word along,
From one to fifty folks, singin' the blessed song.
Now the last one, number fifty, the blessings that they gain,
I'm gonna lay it out now, gonna make it plain.

Imagine a man with a giving heart, a generous soul indeed,
For eighty long years he met every single need.
Countless folks he looked after, gave 'em all they desired,
But then he saw the twilight, the lamp that's been expired.
White hair and faces wrinkled, the signs of fading light,
Gaps in their teeth, bodies weary, near the endless night.
He said, "I gotta teach 'em now, gotta lead 'em to the Way,"
Used clever words and wisdom, on that very day.
Preached that true Dharma of peace, called nirvana's sweet release:
"This world ain't built to last, no, it's just foam and fleeting flame,
You gotta shake off these burdens, cry out freedom's name."
When those weary people heard that truth ringin' clear,
They all found the arhat's fruit, wiped away every tear.
They got those six magic powers, three wisdoms shinin' bright,
And eight sweet liberations, walkin' in the pure light.

But that fiftieth person, who just heard one sweet line,
Man, their blessings are bigger, they truly shine.
No way to compare it, no story I can tell,
They're higher than that great giver, free from the painful spell.
And the blessings of those who hear it, passed down from hand to hand,
They're still too vast to measure, across this weary land.
How much more for the first ones, right there in the sacred place,
Who heard it and rejoiced, showin' that joyful face?

If a body tells another, "Come on and lend an ear,
To the Lotus Sutra's wisdom, banish all your fear."
Sayin', "This book is deep and subtle, a treasure hard to find,
Through thousands of long ages, it weighs heavy on the mind."
And that person takes the lesson, and they go and take a seat,
Hearin' it just for a moment, oh, that sound so sweet.
The good karma they pile up, the reward they're gonna know,
I'm gonna break it down for you, watch that blessing grow.

No sickness in their mouth, Lord, never a troubled sound,
Teeth straight and white and perfect, never gapped or turned around.
No thick or shrunken lips, nothin' that looks amiss,
No ugly sight upon them, just beauty in their kiss.
Tongue ain't dry or black or short, but graceful and alive,
Nose is high and long and straight, a blessing to survive.
Forehead's broad and smooth and level, the picture of good grace,
And a majestic, lovely beauty shines right out of their face.
Folks will love to look upon them, their breath will be so clean,
Sweet as the utpala flower, the finest you have seen,
That fragrance comin' from their mouth, a wonder to behold.

If someone walks to the monastery, a story to be told,
Just to hear the Lotus Sutra, takes a step inside the door,
And for a moment they feel glad, they ask for nothing more.
I'm gonna talk about their blessings, the harvest they will reap,
In a life yet to come, Lord, while the world's asleep.
Among the gods or humans, they'll be reborn with style and might,
With chariots and fine horses, and jeweled things shining bright.
Ridin' in a heaven palace, a place of pure delight.

If in the preaching hall, one tells a soul to stay,
"Sit down and listen to the Sutra," and they point out the Way.
The blessings from that small kindness, what they're gonna gain,
A royal throne is waiting, Śakra or Brahmā's reign.
Or a wheel-turning king's high seat, mighty and serene.
How much more for the one who listens, with a heart sincere and true,
Explains what the words mean, and then they live it too?
Their blessings, they're beyond measure, like the stars above the blue.



Chapter 19: Merits of a Teacher of the Dharma
At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Constant Diligence: "If a noble man or noble woman receives and upholds this Lotus Sutra, or reads, recites, explains, or copies it, this person will attain eight hundred merits for the eye, twelve hundred merits for the ear, eight hundred merits for the nose, twelve hundred merits for the tongue, eight hundred merits for the body, and twelve hundred merits for the mind. With these merits, their six sense faculties will be adorned and made completely pure.
"This noble man or noble woman, with their pure physical eyes, born from their parents, will see all the mountains, forests, rivers, and seas, both inside and outside the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world. He will see down to the Avīci hell and up to the highest heaven. He will also see all the sentient beings within them, and their karmic causes, effects, and places of rebirth. He will see and know all of this."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
If in the great hall, oh, a great assembly,
A fearless heart preaches the Sutra, you see.
You oughta listen close to the good he can do,
Eight hundred supreme eye merits gonna follow through.

With those bright blessings, his eyes get mighty pure,
Eyes born of his folks, oh, they're gonna endure.
They'll see the whole world, three thousand wide and deep,
From Mount Meru's insides to the secrets it keeps.

The Iron Ring Mountains, the forests and the trees,
The great big ocean, oh, down on his knees.
Down to the Avīci hell, way down below,
Up to the highest heaven, where the good winds blow.

All the souls in between, he'll see 'em all around,
Ain't got the heavenly eye, but the power abounds.
That physical eye power, it's somethin' like this,
Oh, the truth is laid open with a mighty fine kiss.

The Merits of the Ear
"Furthermore, Constant Diligence, if a noble man or noble woman upholds this sutra, or reads, recites, explains, or copies it, they will attain twelve hundred merits for the ear. With this pure ear, they will hear all kinds of languages and sounds, both inside and outside the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, from the lowest Avīci hell to the highest heaven. The sounds of elephants, horses, cattle, and carriages; the sounds of crying and sighing; the sounds of conches, drums, bells, and chimes; the sounds of laughter and speech; the sounds of men, women, boys, and girls; the sounds of the Dharma and the sounds of non-Dharma; the sounds of suffering and the sounds of joy; the sounds of ordinary people and the sounds of sages; the sounds of happiness and the sounds of unhappiness; the sounds of gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, and mahoragas; the sounds of fire, water, and wind; the sounds of the hells, the animal realm, and the hungry ghost realm; the sounds of monks and nuns; the sounds of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; the sounds of Bodhisattvas and the sounds of the Buddhas. To put it simply, with their pure, ordinary ear born of their parents, they will hear and know all sounds, both inside and outside the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world. In this way, they will differentiate all kinds of sounds without damaging their ear faculty."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
The ear born of his parents
Is pure and without defilements.
With this ordinary ear, he hears
The sounds of the three-thousand-fold world.
The sounds of elephants, horses, carriages, and cattle,
The sounds of bells, chimes, conches, and drums,
The sounds of lutes, harps, and lyres,
And the sounds of flutes and pipes,
The wonderful sounds of pure songs—
He hears them all without being attached.
Countless kinds of human voices,
He hears and can understand them all.
He also hears the sounds of all the gods,
The subtle and wonderful sounds of their songs,
And he hears the sounds of men and women,
And the sounds of boys and girls.
In the deep and dangerous places of mountains and rivers,
The sounds of the kalaviṅka bird,
The jīvaṃjīvaka bird, and other birds,
He hears all their sounds.
The various sounds of suffering and agony
In the hells, he hears.
The hungry ghosts, pressed by hunger and thirst,
Their sounds of seeking food and drink, he hears.
All the asuras,
Who dwell by the great ocean,
When they speak to one another,
Their great sounds, he hears.
The one who preaches the Dharma is like this,
Dwelling in this place,
He hears these many sounds from afar,
Without damaging his ear faculty.
In the worlds of the ten directions,
The sounds of birds and beasts calling to each other,
The one who preaches the Dharma
Hears all of them from here.
In all the Brahma heavens,
The Abode of Light and the Abode of Purity,
And up to the highest heaven,
The sounds of their languages,
The Dharma teacher dwelling here,
Can hear all of them.
All the assemblies of monks
And all the nuns,
Whether they are reading and reciting the scriptures,
Or preaching to others,
The Dharma teacher dwelling here
Can hear all of them.
Furthermore, there are Bodhisattvas,
Who read and recite the scriptures,
Or preach to others,
Or write and explain their meaning.
All these sounds,
He can hear them all.
The great, holy, World-Honored Buddhas,
Who convert sentient beings,
In all the great assemblies,
Expound the subtle and wonderful Dharma.
The one who upholds this Lotus Sutra
Can hear all of them.
The sounds, both inside and outside,
Of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world,
From the lowest Avīci hell,
To the highest heaven,
He hears all their sounds,
Without damaging his ear faculty.
Because his ear is so sharp and subtle,
He can differentiate and know them all.
The one who upholds this Lotus Sutra,
Although he has not yet attained the heavenly ear,
By using the ear born of his parents,
The merit is already like this.

The Merits of the Nose
"Furthermore, Constant Diligence, if a noble man or noble woman upholds this sutra, or reads, recites, explains, or copies it, they will attain eight hundred merits for the nose. With this pure nose, they will smell all kinds of fragrances, both inside and outside the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, from above and below. The fragrances of sumana flowers, jāti flowers, mallikā flowers, campaka flowers, and parūṣaka flowers; the fragrances of red, blue, and white lotus flowers; the fragrances of flowering trees and fruit trees; the fragrances of sandalwood, agarwood, tāmalapattra incense, and tagara incense; and thousands of kinds of blended incenses, whether in powder, ball, or paste form.
"The one who upholds this sutra, dwelling in this place, can differentiate all of these. He can also differentiate the fragrances of sentient beings—the fragrance of elephants, horses, cattle, and sheep; the fragrance of men, women, boys, and girls; and the fragrance of shrubs and forests. All fragrances, whether near or far, he can hear them all and differentiate them without any error.
"The one who upholds this sutra, although dwelling here, can also smell the fragrances of the heavenly beings—the fragrance of the pārijāta and kovidāra trees, and the fragrances of maṇḍārava flowers, mahāmaṇḍārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, and mahāmañjūṣaka flowers; and the fragrances of sandalwood, agarwood, and various powdered incenses and blended floral incenses. He can hear all of these fragrances. He also hears the body fragrance of the heavenly beings. He hears the fragrance of Śakra, the king of the gods, when he is in his wonderful palace enjoying the five desires. He hears the fragrance of when he is in the wonderful Dharma hall preaching the Dharma for the gods of the Thirty-three Heavens. He hears the fragrance of when he is playing in the gardens. He also hears the body fragrance of the other gods, men, and women, from a distance. In this way, he can hear the body fragrances of the heavenly beings, all the way up to the Brahma world and the highest heaven. He can also smell the incense that the heavenly beings burn, and the fragrances of the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, and all the Buddhas’ bodies, and he knows where they are. Although he hears all these fragrances, his nose faculty is not damaged or confused. If he wishes to differentiate them and preach them for others, he can remember them without error."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Oh, that person's nose is pure, yes indeed,
It smells every kind of thing, that's what he can read.
Fragrant and foul, they all come through the air,
He knows the sweet perfume and the stink that's there.

Sumana, jāti, tāmalapattra so fine,
Sandalwood and agarwood, make your spirit shine.
Cassia and flowers, and the fruits from the vine,
He smells every living thing, he draws the line.

Man and woman's scent, he knows it where they be,
Dharma teacher far away, he knows by the decree.
Wheel-turning king and his sons, ministers too,
Palace women's perfume, he smells 'em comin' through.

Precious things they wear, and the treasure in the ground,
Precious queen of the king, he knows where she is found.
Robes and garlands they got on, perfumed oils they use,
He knows the very person, when he catches those blues.

Gods walkin' and sittin', playin' games on high,
Sutra holder knows it all, when that sweet scent drifts by.
Trees and flowers and fruit, the ghee and the oil,
Sutra holder right here, knows the fruit of the soil.

Deep in the mountains, dangerous and dark,
Sandalwood trees are bloomin', leavin' their mark.
Sentient beings inside, hidden from the eye,
He smells every single one, as the long years go by.

Iron Ring Mountains, and the oceans so wide,
Creatures in the earth, nowhere can they hide.
Sutra holder can smell 'em, know just where they are,
He's got that power of the nose, shinin' like a star.

Asuras fightin' and playin', both man and the wife,
He knows all their secrets, through the scent of their life.
Wilderness secluded, lions and wolves roam,
Tigers and elephants, far away from home.

Wild oxen, water buffalo, wanderin' around,
He knows where they're hidin', on the dusty ground.
Pregnant woman standin', he can tell you for sure,
If it's a boy or a girl, knockin' at the door.

Not men and non-humans, he knows their kind,
He smells all their presence, leaves nothin' behind.
Power of the smellin', he knows conception's start,
If the birth will be peaceful, a blessin' for the heart.

Good or not successful, he smells the whole long tale,
That powerful sense of smell, will never fail.
Thoughts of men and women, he knows 'em like a book,
Greed and desire, and the hateful, foolish look.

Cultivatin' goodness, he smells that sweet release,
He knows what's in their spirit, and brings 'em inner peace.
Hidden treasures underground, silver and the gold,
Copper vessels holdin' 'em, stories to be told.

He smells the jewels layin' there, knows the heavy cost,
Nothin' in the world of scents, is ever lost.
Garlands of all kinds, their value hard to say,
He knows if they're precious, come what may.

Precious or cheap, he knows their startin' line,
He knows their location, by a scent so fine.
Heavenly flowers bloomin', maṇḍārava sweet,
Mañjūṣaka and pārijāta, can't be beat.

He knows all those blossoms, by the scent they give,
He knows where the angels, and the holy spirits live.
Heavenly palaces, better and worse,
Jeweled flowers adornin' 'em, shakin' off the curse.

He smells all the mansions, up in the sky so vast,
From the first to the lowest, their power will last.
Heavenly gardens and halls, where the Dharma is told,
They enjoy their time there, precious as the gold.

He smells all the pleasure, and the peace they possess,
That powerful nose of his, can't confess nothin' less.
Gods listenin' to the Dharma, or enjoyin' the five desires,
Comin', goin', sittin' down, burnin' with those fires.

He knows all their actions, from the scent in the air,
He knows what they're up to, without a care.
Clothes of the maidens, flowers in their hair,
Travelin' and playin' games, without a care.

He knows all their beauty, and the places they roam,
That power of smellin', brings the truth back home.
Ascendin' up higher, to the Brahma world above,
He knows who's in meditation, with that peaceful love.

He smells 'em enterin' and leavin', knows the time and the place,
He sees the light around 'em, by the scent of their grace.
Abode of Light and Purity, up to the highest height,
He knows their birth and passin', in the dark and the light.

He smells their whole journey, from the cradle to the grave,
He's got that special power, he is strong and brave.
Monks in assembly, diligent and true,
Sittin' or walkin', knowin' what to do.

Readin' and recitin', concentrated mind,
Underneath the tall tree, the peace they find.
Sutra holder smells 'em, knows where they all dwell,
He's got that sacred power, that breaks the cruelest spell.

Bodhisattvas with resolve, steady as a rock,
Sittin' or readin', watchin' the tickin' clock.
Preachin' the Dharma to others, tellin' the holy word,
He smells all their good works, like a sweet singin' bird.

World-Honored Ones in every land, revered by all,
Preachin' out of pity, heedin' the world's sad call.
He knows all their teachin', and the wisdom they impart,
He smells the pure compassion, held within their heart.

Sentient beings listenin', hearin' the sacred song,
Joyful in the presence, where they truly belong.
Practicin' the Dharma, exactly as it's been taught,
He smells their true devotion, a battle bravely fought.

Hasn't got the Bodhisattva nose, of unconditioned truth,
But the holder of this sutra, has attained it in his youth.
He's got that first sweet smellin', a blessing to behold,
The power of the nose, worth more than finest gold.

The Merits of the Tongue
"Furthermore, Constant Diligence, if a noble man or noble woman upholds this sutra, or reads, recites, explains, or copies it, they will attain twelve hundred merits for the tongue. If they eat something that is good or bad, beautiful or not beautiful, or all things that are bitter and astringent, on their tongue faculty, they all become a supreme flavor, like the ambrosia of the heavens. Nothing is not delicious.
"If, with their tongue faculty, they expound anything in a great assembly, a profound and subtle voice will come forth that can enter the hearts of all and cause them to be joyful and happy. Furthermore, the heavenly gods and goddesses, and the gods of the Śakra and Brahma heavens, when they hear this profound and subtle voice, and his orderly explanation and words, they will all come to listen. And the dragons and dragon maidens, yakshas and yaksha maidens, gandharvas and gandharva maidens, asuras and asura maidens, garudas and garuda maidens, kinnaras and kinnara maidens, and mahoragas and mahoraga maidens, for the sake of hearing the Dharma, will all come to be close to him and make respectful offerings. And the monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, kings, princes, ministers, and their families; the small and great wheel-turning kings, with their thousands of sons and all their relatives, will ride in their palaces and all come to listen to the Dharma, because this Bodhisattva preaches the Dharma so well. The Brahmins, elders, and the people of the land will serve and make offerings to him for their entire lives. Furthermore, the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, and all the Buddhas always delight in seeing him. In whatever direction this person is, all the Buddhas will preach the Dharma toward that place. He can receive and uphold all the Buddha Dharmas and can also emit a profound and subtle sound of Dharma."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
His tongue is pure, yeah, that much is true,
Never taste no evil, nothing bad to chew.
Every little morsel, every sip he takes,
Turns to sweet, sweet nectar, for goodness sakes.

He got a voice so deep, a sound so clear,
Preachin' the good Dharma for all to hear.
With stories and with wisdom, he shows the way,
Guiding troubled souls to a brighter day.

Folks hear his words, oh, they feel so fine,
Bringin' all their offerings, everything divine.
Gods and dragons listen, yeah, the whole wide crew,
Come with respect and listen to what he gotta do.

If this man wants his voice to rise and call,
Fillin' up the whole wide world, standin' up tall,
He just thinks it and it happens, don't you see,
A voice that shakes the heavens, wild and free.

Kings and their sons, a thousand strong and true,
Bow down with joined palms, see his message through.
Demons and night creatures, they get joy too,
Always comin' 'round to pay their dues.

Brahma and Mara, they can't stay away,
All them heavenly folks, comin' every day.
Even the Buddhas hear his blessed sound,
Keep him safe and steady on this earthly ground.

The Merits of the Body
"Furthermore, Constant Diligence, if a noble man or noble woman upholds this sutra, or reads, recites, explains, or copies it, they will attain eight hundred merits for the body. They will attain a pure body, like pure lapis lazuli, which sentient beings delight to see. Because their body is pure, all sentient beings of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, from the time of their birth to the time of their death, whether they are superior or inferior, beautiful or ugly, or born in good or evil places, will all be reflected within it. And the Iron Ring Mountains, the Great Iron Ring Mountains, Mount Meru, Mount Mahāmeru, and all such mountains, and all the sentient beings within them, will all be reflected within it. Down to the Avīci hell and up to the highest heaven, all beings and all their surroundings will all be reflected within it. The Dharma preached by the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, and all the Buddhas will all be reflected as images within his body."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
If a soul upholds the Lotus Sutra's call,
That body shines so pure, it stands up tall.
Like crystal lapis lazuli, bright and clean,
The finest sight the people ever seen.

It's like a mirror, polished bright and true,
Reflecting all the forms that pass right through.
The Bodhisattva's body, pure and free,
Sees all the world, but only he can see.

The living things in all the three-fold lands,
The gods and demons held within his hands.
The poor ghosts walkin', and the beasts that creep,
Their shapes reflected, while the world's asleep.

The halls of heaven, up so high they go,
The mountains standing, where the wild winds blow.
The deep blue ocean, and the waters wide,
All things within that body do abide.

The Buddhas preachin', and the followers near,
They're all reflected, banishin' the fear.
Though he ain't got that perfect nature yet,
This common body holds the whole world's debt.

The Merits of the Mind
"Furthermore, Constant Diligence, if a noble man or noble woman, after the Tathagata's passing, upholds this sutra, or reads, recites, explains, or copies it, they will attain twelve hundred merits for the mind. With this pure mind faculty, upon hearing even one verse or one line, they will penetrate the immeasurable and boundless meanings. Having understood this meaning, they can then expound on a single line or a single verse for a month, for four months, or even for a year. What he preaches, according to its meaning, will not be at odds with the true nature of all phenomena.
"If he preaches on worldly scriptures, on the words of governance, or on the work of sustaining life, it will all be in accordance with the true Dharma. The thoughts, actions, and verbal games of all sentient beings in the six destinies of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world, he will know them all. Although he has not yet attained the wisdom of unconditioned reality, his mind faculty is already this pure. Whatever this person thinks, contemplates, or speaks, it is all the Buddha Dharma, and it is all true. It is also what has been preached in the sutras of the Buddhas of the past."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
That mind so pure and clean,
Sharp as a tack, ain't got no mean.
With that sweet mind a-workin' free,
Knows the high and the low, for all to see.

Hears just one verse, hear me now,
Unlocks deep meanings, don't know how.
Preachin' the Dharma, in the right way,
A month, four months, or a whole year, day by day.

All the folks in this wide world 'round,
Inside and outside, on holy ground.
Gods, dragons, and the human race,
Yakshas and the spirits, keepin' up the pace.

All their mixed-up thoughts, deep and low,
In the six pathways where the souls must go.
'Cause he's holdin' fast to the Lotus sound,
He knows 'em all when he looks around.

Countless Buddhas, ten directions bright,
Shinin' with them hundred marks of light.
Preachin' the Dharma for the souls in need,
He hears it all, plants the holy seed.

Thinks on them meanings, wide and vast,
His preachin' goes on, it's built to last.
Don't forget a thing, from start to end,
'Cause he's got that Lotus Sutra, his truest friend.

Knows the true nature of all that is,
Understands the order, that's his biz.
Knows all the names and the words they speak,
Preaches it straight, ain't no need to sneak.

Whatever comes from his lips, you see,
It's the Buddhas' Dharma from history.
Expounds this truth, without no fright,
Standin' in the crowd, shinin' oh so bright.

Mind of the one holdin' this book in hand,
Pure as a bell, right across the land.
Ain't got to Nirvana, not yet today,
But he got these signs, showin' him the way.

This soul who keeps this Sutra near,
Walks on a rare ground, have no fear.
All the livin' creatures, near and far,
They love him, yeah, he's a lucky star.

Uses a thousand kinds of gentle tongue,
Skillful words, a sweet song he's sung.
To break it all down and preach it true,
'Cause he's holdin' that Lotus, me and you.

Chapter 20: The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging

At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Great-Power: "You should now know that if a monk, nun, layman, or laywoman who upholds the Lotus Sutra is slandered and abused with evil words, the great karmic retribution they receive is as I have said before. The merit they gain is the purification of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, as I have also said before.
Great-Power, in the distant past, an immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable asaṃkhyeya kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named King of Awesome Sound Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa was named Leaving-Decay, and the land was named Great-Completion. This King of Awesome Sound Buddha, in that world, preached the Dharma for gods, humans, and asuras. For those who sought the śrāvaka path, he preached the Dharma of the Four Noble Truths to save them from birth, old age, sickness, and death and lead them to ultimate nirvana. For those who sought the pratyekabuddha path, he preached the Dharma of the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. For the Bodhisattvas, he preached the Dharma of the six pāramitās for the sake of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, ultimately leading them to the wisdom of the Buddha.
Great-Power, this King of Awesome Sound Buddha's life span was four hundred thousand million nayuta kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. The number of kalpas that his True Dharma remained in the world was as many as the dust motes of a single Jambudvīpa. The number of kalpas that his Dharma-Image remained in the world was as many as the dust motes of four four-continents. After that Buddha brought great benefit to sentient beings, he passed away. After the True Dharma and Dharma-Image had been completely extinguished, in that land, another Buddha appeared, also named King of Awesome Sound Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. In this way, there were twenty hundred million Buddhas, all with the same title."
The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging
"After the first King of Awesome Sound Tathagata had passed away and his True Dharma had been extinguished, in the period of the Dharma-Image, the arrogant monks were a great force. At that time, there was a Bodhisattva monk named Never Disparaging. Great-Power, for what reason was he named Never Disparaging? This monk, whenever he saw a person—whether they were a monk, nun, layman, or laywoman—he would bow in reverence to them and praise them, saying: 'I deeply revere all of you, and I do not dare to hold you in contempt. Why? Because you will all practice the Bodhisattva Way and will attain Buddhahood.'
"This monk did not exclusively read or recite the scriptures. He only bowed and paid reverence. Even when he saw the four groups of the assembly from a distance, he would still go and bow to them and praise them, saying: 'I do not dare to hold you in contempt. You will all attain Buddhahood.' Among the four groups of the assembly, those who gave rise to a mind of anger and impurity and abused him with evil words said: 'Where has this ignorant monk come from? He claims not to hold us in contempt, but he gives us a prophecy that we will attain Buddhahood. We do not need such a false prophecy.'
"In this way, after many years, he was constantly abused, but he did not give rise to a mind of anger. He always said: 'You will attain Buddhahood.' When he spoke these words, people would sometimes hit him with sticks, wood, tiles, or stones. He would run away and stand at a distance, and would still say in a loud voice: 'I do not dare to hold you in contempt. You will all attain Buddhahood.' Because he always spoke these words, the arrogant monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen gave him the name Never Disparaging."
The Karmic Connection
"When this monk was about to pass away, he heard from the empty sky the Lotus Sutra that King of Awesome Sound Buddha had previously preached, in twenty hundred million verses. He was able to receive and uphold all of it and immediately attained the purification of the six sense faculties—the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, as mentioned above. Having attained this purification of the six sense faculties, he gained a longer life of two hundred million million nayuta years and widely preached the Lotus Sutra to people. At that time, the arrogant four groups who had held him in contempt and given him the name Never Disparaging, saw that he had attained great supernatural power, the power of joyful eloquence, and the power of great stillness. When they heard his preaching, they all believed and submitted, and followed him.
"This Bodhisattva also converted hundreds of thousands of millions of beings, causing them to dwell in Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. After he passed away, he encountered two hundred thousand million Buddhas, all named Sun Moon Lamp Light, and in their Dharma, he preached the Lotus Sutra. Because of this cause, he again encountered two hundred thousand million Buddhas, all named King of Cloud-Sovereign-Lamp. In the Dharma of all these Buddhas, he received and upheld, read, and recited this sutra. Because he preached this scripture for the four groups of the assembly, he attained the constant purity of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. When he preached the Dharma for the four groups, his heart was fearless."
"Great-Power, this Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Never Disparaging made offerings to countless Buddhas in this way, with reverence, respect, and praise, and planted roots of goodness. In a later time, he again encountered thousands of millions of Buddhas, and he also preached this scripture in their Dharma. With the completion of his merits, he was able to attain Buddhahood.
"Great-Power, what do you think? Was the Bodhisattva Never Disparaging of that time a different person? He was myself. If I had not, in my past lives, received and upheld, read, and recited this sutra and preached it for others, I could not have so quickly attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. It was because I, in the presence of past Buddhas, received, upheld, read, and recited this sutra and preached it for others that I quickly attained Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.
"Great-Power, the four groups of the assembly at that time—the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—who, with a mind of anger, held me in contempt, for two hundred million kalpas did not encounter a Buddha, did not hear the Dharma, and did not see the monastic community. For a thousand kalpas, they endured great suffering in the Avīci hell. After their sins were exhausted, they again encountered Bodhisattva Never Disparaging, who converted them to Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.
"Great-Power, what do you think? Were the four groups who held that Bodhisattva in contempt at that time different people? They are the five hundred Bodhisattvas such as Bhadrapāla, the five hundred monks such as Lion-Moon, and the five hundred laymen such as Nisīśvara in this assembly now, who have all attained the state of non-retrogression from Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Great-Power, you should know that this Lotus Sutra brings great benefit to the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas and can cause them to attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. For this reason, all Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, after the Tathagata’s passing, should constantly receive, uphold, read, recite, explain, and copy this sutra."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
Long ago there was a Buddha, yes, a man of mighty fame,
King of Awesome Sound, they called him, yeah, that was his holy name.
His spiritual wisdom was boundless, his light shined through the air,
He guided all the beings, Lord, he showed them how to care.

Gods and humans, dragons, spirits, they all came to pray,
Made their little offerings before he passed away.
After that Buddha left us, when the Dharma was on the wane,
Came a Bodhisattva walkin', through the dusty, weary rain.

Never Disparaging, they named him, a good man on the road,
The four groups of the assembly, they carried a heavy load,
Stuck fast to their own teachings, wouldn't open up their mind,
But this Bodhisattva, he left all his troubles behind.

He walked on over to 'em, didn't hold his head up high,
Said, "I ain't gonna hold you in contempt, not 'til the day I die.
You gonna practice the Way, child, that's what you gonna do,
And you gonna attain Buddhahood, me and you and all your crew."

When those folks heard him talkin', they just laughed and turned to scorn,
They despised and they abused him, from the moment he was born.
But Never Disparaging, he just took it on the chin,
He was able to endure it, Lord, and wash away his sin.

After his bad karma faded, and he was gettin' mighty weak,
He heard this blessed sutra, and the words he had to speak,
His six senses got pure, baby, pure as the driven snow,
'Cause of that supernatural power, his life was slow to go.

He preached that sutra widely, all the folks began to hear,
For all the people standin', to wipe away their fear.
Those assemblies stuck in doctrine, they finally understood,
Got that Bodhisattva's teaching, like every good man should.

They were caused to be complete now, they walked that Buddha Way,
Never Disparaging passed away, saw a brighter, better day.
Met countless, countless Buddhas, 'cause he spread that holy sound,
He attained immeasurable blessings, all over the ground.

He completed all his merits, yeah, he did his very best,
And he quickly found the Buddha Way, and laid his soul to rest.
That Never Disparaging, honey, that man from long ago,
That was me, myself, I tell you, that was me, you oughta know.

The four groups of assembly, with their doctrine held so tight,
They heard me say, "You'll be a Buddha," and they finally saw the light.
Because of that good reason, they found a better place,
They met countless, countless Buddhas, yeah, they ran a good, long race.

The five hundred Bodhisattvas, sittin' right here in this place,
And the four groups of pure laypeople, with grace upon their face,
They the ones now in my presence, listenin' to the Dharma's call,
I, in a life before this one, I lifted them up after they fall.

I told 'em to hear this sutra, yeah, the supreme, holy law,
I showed and taught them everything, let 'em see what they never saw.
Caused them to dwell in nirvana, set their weary spirits free,
From lifetime to lifetime, they upheld the words you hear from me.

It took billions and billions of kalpas, a time you can't conceive,
Before they finally heard it, the truth that they believe,
That Lotus Sutra, baby, it's a mighty, precious thing.
For billions and billions of kalpas, the World-Honored Buddhas sing.

So listen to me, practitioners, after the Buddha's gone,
When you hear this blessed sutra, don't you doubt it 'til the morn.
You gotta be of one mind, child, and preach this sutra wide,
And lifetime after lifetime, the Buddha will be your guide.
You gonna meet the Buddha, honey, yeah, you gonna walk the line,
And you will quickly attain the Buddha Way, and everything will be fine.



Chapter 21: The Transcendent Powers of the Tathagata

At that time, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas as numerous as the dust motes of a thousand worlds, who had sprung forth from the earth, all stood in the presence of the Buddha. With a single mind, they joined their palms and, looking up at the Buddha's revered face, said: "World-Honored One, after the Buddha's passing, in the lands where your emanations have dwelt and passed away, we will widely preach this sutra. Why? We ourselves wish to attain this truly pure great Dharma and to receive, uphold, read, recite, explain, copy, and make offerings to it."
The Manifestation of the Buddha's Transcendent Powers
At that time, the World-Honored One, in the presence of Mañjuśrī and the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of old Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas of the Saha world, and all the monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans, manifested his great supernatural powers. He extended his long and broad tongue up to the Brahma heavens. From all his pores, he emitted immeasurable and countless lights of different colors, which universally shone throughout all the worlds of the ten directions.
The Buddhas who were sitting on the lion's seats under the jeweled trees also did the same: they extended their long and broad tongues and emitted immeasurable light. Śākyamuni Buddha and the other Buddhas under the jeweled trees manifested their supernatural powers in this way for a full hundred thousand years, and then they retracted their tongues. At the same time, they coughed and snapped their fingers. The sound of these two actions reached all the worlds of the ten directions, and the earth shook in six ways.
The sentient beings in those worlds—the gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans—by the Buddha's supernatural power, were all able to see this Saha world. They saw the immeasurable and boundless hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas sitting on lion’s seats under the jeweled trees. They also saw Śākyamuni Buddha and Abundant Treasures Tathagata sitting on a lion’s seat inside the jeweled stupa. They also saw the immeasurable and boundless hundreds of thousands of millions of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas and the four groups of the assembly reverently surrounding Śākyamuni Buddha. Having seen this, they were all filled with great joy and felt an unprecedented happiness.
Immediately, the gods in the air loudly proclaimed: "Beyond these immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of millions of asaṃkhyeya worlds, there is a land named Saha. In this land, there is a Buddha named Śākyamuni, who is now preaching a Great Vehicle sutra for the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, named the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a Dharma for Bodhisattvas protected and remembered by the Buddhas. You should all give rise to a deep heart of joyful following and should also pay homage and make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha."
The sentient beings of those worlds, having heard the voice from the air, joined their palms and, facing the Saha world, said: "Namo Śākyamuni Buddha! Namo Śākyamuni Buddha!" With all kinds of flowers, incense, garlands, banners, canopies, adornments for the body, and precious, wonderful objects, they all scattered them toward the Saha world from afar. All these scattered objects, coming from the ten directions, were like gathering clouds. They became a jeweled canopy that universally covered all the Buddhas here. At that time, all the worlds of the ten directions were connected without hindrance, like one Buddha land.
The Entrustment of the Sutra
At that time, the Buddha said to Superior Conduct and the great assembly of Bodhisattvas: "The supernatural powers of the Buddhas are immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable. If I were to use these supernatural powers to speak of the merits of this sutra for the purpose of entrusting it, for an immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, I still could not exhaust them. To put it concisely, all the Dharmas that the Tathagata possesses, all the Tathagata's supernatural powers of independence, all the secret treasures of the Tathagata, and all the extremely profound matters of the Tathagata, are all revealed and expounded in this sutra.
"For this reason, after the Tathagata's passing, you should all, with a single mind, receive and uphold, read, recite, explain, copy, and practice it as it is taught. In any land where there is one who receives and upholds, reads, recites, explains, or copies it, or practices it as it is taught—or wherever a scroll of this sutra is kept, whether in a garden, a forest, under a tree, in a monastery, in a layman's house, in a hall, or in a mountain valley or wilderness—a stupa should be erected there and offerings should be made. Why? You should know that this place is the very place of enlightenment. The Buddhas attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi here. The Buddhas turn the Dharma wheel here. And the Buddhas enter parinirvāṇa here."
At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:
The world's great saviors, the Buddhas all know,
Got mighty powers, watch 'em make 'em flow.
To please all the beings, they got a deep need,
Unrollin' those wonders, plantin' a mighty good seed.

They stretch out their tongue to the Brahma sky so high,
From their bodies light pours, watchin' the darkness fly.
For folks searchin' for the Buddha Way, feelin' the call,
They show this rare vision, standin' up tall.

The sound of the Buddhas, a little coughin' sound,
A snap of their fingers, rings the world all around.
Heard in ten directions, yeah, in every single place,
The earth starts to shakin', six ways with grace.

'Cause of those who, after the Buddha's long gone,
Can hold onto this sutra, yeah, from dusk till the dawn,
All the Buddhas are joyful, makin' their power appear,
Unrollin' their wonders, castin' out all fear.

To pass down this teaching, so true and so deep,
And praise those who keep it, while the whole world does sleep,
For endless long ages, can't be told in a day,
The praise still ain't finished, watchin' it all slip away.

This good person's merit, it stretches far and wide,
Got no end to it, ain't got no place to hide,
Like the open space, in ten directions it flies,
You can't find the bottom, lookin' up at the skies.

One who can hold this sutra, holdin' it tight and true,
Done already seen me, and the things that I do,
Seen Abundant Treasures Buddha, sittin' right there on the throne,
And all my reflections, ain't nobody alone.

They've seen me today, preachin' the Dharma so strong,
Convertin' the Bodhisattvas, right where they belong.
The one who can keep this sutra, deep down in their soul,
Makes me and my shadows, completely feel whole.

And that Abundant Treasures, passed on long ago,
We all rejoice together, watchin' the good things grow.
The Buddhas of the present, and those of the past and the time yet to be,
You see 'em, you serve 'em, bringin' 'em joy for free.

That secret Dharma, that treasure they found so bright,
Attained at the place of learnin', bathin' in pure light,
The one who holds this sutra, won't have to wait so long,
Gonna get that same wisdom, singin' a joyful song.

The one who keeps this sutra, understands what it means,
The names and the words, the world that intervenes,
Gonna talk with no stoppin', joy risin' from the soul,
Like the wind through the heavens, yeah, takin' its toll.

After the Tathagata's gone, movin' on to his rest,
He knows the old sutras, passin' the ultimate test,
Their how and their why, the order they're laid out to be,
And preaches 'em truly, for all the world to see.

Like the sun and the moon, shinin' so bright and so far,
He drives out the darkness, wherever you are.
This person walks easy, down here on the ground,
Can chase away the shadows, from all the folks around.

He teaches the Bodhisattvas, a countless, mighty crew,
And guides 'em to the One Vehicle, makin' their dream come true.
So you wise ones listen, hear what I'm tellin' you today,
Hear 'bout these merits, don't you dare look away.

After I'm gone, when my time here is through,
You ought to take up this sutra, do what you got to do.
This person on the Buddha Way, walkin' in the light,
Gonna have no more questions, everything's gonna be right.




Chapter 22: The Final Entrustment
At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha rose from his Dharma seat and, manifesting his great supernatural power, used his right hand to touch the heads of the countless Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, and he said: "I have, for immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, cultivated this Dharma of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, which is difficult to attain. I now entrust it to all of you. You must all, with a single mind, spread this Dharma and cause it to be widely benefited."
In this way, he touched the heads of the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas three times and said: "I have, for immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, cultivated this Dharma of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, which is difficult to attain. I now entrust it to all of you. You must receive, uphold, and widely preach this Dharma, causing all sentient beings to hear and know it. Why? The Tathagata has great compassion, no stinginess, and is without fear. He is able to give sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom, the Tathagata's wisdom, and self-attained wisdom. The Tathagata is the great giver of all sentient beings.
You should also follow the Dharma of the Tathagata and not be stingy. In a future life, if there is a noble man or noble woman who believes in the Tathagata's wisdom, you should expound this Lotus Sutra for them, so they may hear and know it, and so they may attain the Buddha's wisdom. If there are sentient beings who do not believe and accept it, you should teach, guide, and give them joy with the other profound Dharmas of the Tathagata. If you are able to do this, you will have repaid the grace of all the Buddhas."
When the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas heard the Buddha speak these words, they were all filled with great joy throughout their bodies. They became even more respectful, bowing and lowering their heads. With joined palms facing the Buddha, they all spoke in one voice, saying: "As the World-Honored One has commanded, we will fully obey and practice. Yes, World-Honored One, please do not be concerned." The assemblies of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, in this way, spoke in one voice three times: "As the World-Honored One has commanded, we will fully obey and practice. Yes, World-Honored One, please do not be concerned."
At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha caused all the emanations of the Buddhas who had come from the ten directions to return to their home lands and said: "All you Buddhas, each of you may return to your lands, and the stupa of Abundant Treasures Buddha may return to what it was." When these words were spoken, the immeasurable emanations of the Buddhas from the ten directions who were sitting on the lion's seats under the jeweled trees, and Abundant Treasures Buddha, and the countless asaṃkhyeya great Bodhisattvas such as Superior Conduct, and the four groups of śrāvakas such as Śāriputra, and all the worlds of gods, humans, and asuras, heard what the Buddha said and were all filled with great joy.


Chapter 23: The Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King

At that time, Bodhisattva Star-King-Flower said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, how does Bodhisattva Medicine King travel and work in this Saha world? World-Honored One, this Bodhisattva Medicine King has performed hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta of difficult and painful ascetic practices. Excellent, World-Honored One! We wish you would explain a little about this." The gods, dragons, spirits, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans, as well as the Bodhisattvas who had come from other lands, and the śrāvaka assembly all heard this and were filled with joy.
The Story of the Bodhisattva's Self-Offering
At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva Star-King-Flower: "In the distant past, an immeasurable number of kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, there was a Buddha named Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.
"That Buddha had eighty million great Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas and seventy-two times the sands of the Ganges of great śrāvaka assemblies. The Buddha's life span was forty-two thousand kalpas, and the Bodhisattvas' life spans were the same. That land had no women, hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras, and was free from all calamities. The ground was as flat as a palm and made of crystal, adorned with jeweled trees. Jeweled canopies hung above, and jeweled flower banners hung down. Jeweled bottles and incense burners were found everywhere in the land. There were jeweled platforms, one under each tree, and the distance between the tree and the platform was the flight of one arrow. Under these jeweled trees, Bodhisattvas and śrāvakas were sitting. On each of the jeweled platforms, there were ten million heavenly beings who played heavenly music and sang praises to the Buddha as an offering.
"At that time, that Buddha preached the Lotus Sutra for the Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See, and for the other Bodhisattvas and the śrāvaka assemblies. This Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See delighted in cultivating difficult ascetic practices. In the Dharma of the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha, he diligently practiced walking meditation. He sought the Buddha with a single mind for twelve thousand years and attained the Samadhi of Manifesting All Forms.
"Having attained this samadhi, his heart was filled with great joy, and he thought: 'My attainment of the Samadhi of Manifesting All Forms is entirely due to the power of hearing the Lotus Sutra. I should now make an offering to the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha and the Lotus Sutra.' He then entered this samadhi, and from the sky, rained down maṇḍārava and mahāmaṇḍārava flowers, and fine powder of a firm, black sandalwood, which filled the sky and fell like a cloud. He also rained down the incense of sandalwood from this side of the ocean. The value of six grains of this incense was the equivalent of the entire Saha world. He used this to make an offering to the Buddha.
"Having made this offering, he arose from the samadhi and thought to himself: 'Although I have made offerings to the Buddha with my supernatural power, it is not as good as making an offering with my own body.' He then ingested all kinds of incense—sandalwood, frankincense, aloe, pine resin, agarwood, and gum incense—and drank the fragrant oil of campaka flowers. After twelve hundred years, he anointed his body with the fragrant oil. In the presence of the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha, he wrapped his body in a heavenly jeweled robe, poured fragrant oils over himself, and with the power of his spiritual vow, set his body on fire. His light shone universally throughout eighty million worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges.
"The Buddhas in those worlds simultaneously praised him, saying: 'Excellent! Excellent! Noble man, this is true diligence! This is called a true Dharma offering to the Tathagata. Offerings of flowers, incense, garlands, burning incense, powdered incense, paste incense, heavenly silks, banners, canopies, and the sandalwood incense from this side of the ocean, or other kinds of offerings, cannot compare to this. Even the giving of one's country, city, wife, and children cannot compare to this. Noble man, this is called the first of all acts of giving. Among all acts of giving, it is the most revered and supreme, because it is a Dharma offering to all the Tathagatas.'
"Having spoken these words, they all fell silent. His body burned for twelve hundred years. After that, his body was completely consumed. After Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See had made such a Dharma offering, he passed away and was reborn in the land of the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha, in the house of King Pure-Virtue, sitting in the lotus posture. He was born instantly by transformation. He immediately spoke in verse to his father, the king, saying:
Now listen here, King, it's the truth I'll tell,
When I walked that path, I walked it well.
Got that Samadhi, saw all forms so clear,
Chased after wisdom, banished all my fear.

Worked real hard, put my body on the line,
Gave it to the World-Honored One, a sacred sign.
Searching for that wisdom, the highest kind,
Left my old self, didn't look behind.
"Having spoken this verse, he said to his father: 'The Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha is still in the world. I previously made an offering to the Buddha and attained the total recall of all sentient beings' languages. I also heard this Lotus Sutra in verses of eight hundred million million nayutas as numerous as jeṅkara, bimvara, and akṣobhya. Great King, I will now go back and make offerings to this Buddha.' Having said this, he immediately sat on a seven-jeweled platform, rose into the air as high as seven tāla trees, went to the Buddha's place, bowed his head at the Buddha's feet, joined his ten fingers, and praised the Buddha in verse:
Your face, oh so wondrous, it shines on through,
Your light, it brightens everything anew.
I just laid my offering down for you,
And now I'm back, Lord, close to you.
"At that time, Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See, having spoken this verse, said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the World-Honored One is still in the world.' At that time, the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha said to Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See: 'Noble man, my time for nirvāṇa has arrived. The time for extinction has come. You should prepare a seat for me. I will pass into parinirvāṇa tonight.'
"He also commanded Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See: 'Noble man, I entrust my Buddha Dharma to you and all the Bodhisattvas and great disciples, as well as the Dharma of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. I also give you the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world of seven treasures, all the jeweled trees, the jeweled platforms, and the gods who serve me. After my passing, I also entrust all my relics to you. You must cause them to be spread and widely make offerings to them. You should erect thousands of stupas.' In this way, the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha, having commanded Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See, passed into nirvāṇa in the latter part of the night.
"At that time, Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See, seeing that the Buddha had passed away, felt grief, sorrow, and longing for the Buddha. He immediately gathered sandalwood from this side of the ocean to make a pyre, made offerings to the Buddha’s body, and burned it. After the fire was extinguished, he collected the relics, made eighty-four thousand jeweled bottles, and erected eighty-four thousand stupas, as tall as the three worlds, adorned with jeweled shafts, with banners, canopies, and various jeweled bells hanging from them.
"At that time, Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See again thought to himself: 'Although I have made these offerings, my heart is still not satisfied. I will now make another offering to the relics.' He then said to the Bodhisattvas, the great disciples, and the gods, dragons, yakshas, and all the great assembly: 'You should all remember with a single mind that I am now making an offering to the relics of the Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue Buddha.' Having said this, he immediately, in front of the eighty-four thousand stupas, set his hundred-blessing-adorned arms on fire for seventy-two thousand years to make an offering. He caused countless beings seeking the śrāvaka path, and immeasurable asaṃkhyeya people, to give rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. He enabled them all to dwell in the Samadhi of Manifesting All Forms."
"At that time, all the Bodhisattvas, gods, humans, and asuras, seeing that his arms were gone, were filled with worry, sorrow, and pity and said: 'This Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See, our teacher who converted us, has now burned his arms and his body is no longer complete.'
"At that time, Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See, in the midst of the great assembly, made this vow: 'I have given up my two arms, and I will surely attain the Buddha's golden body. If this is truly not false, then may my two arms return to what they were before.' When he made this vow, his two arms were naturally restored. This was due to the purity of the Bodhisattva's blessings and wisdom. At that moment, the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world shook in six ways. Heavenly jeweled flowers rained down, and all the gods and humans felt an unprecedented joy."
The Merit of Upholding the Sutra
"The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Star-King-Flower: 'What do you think? Was that Bodhisattva All-Sentient-Beings-Rejoiced-to-See a different person? He is Bodhisattva Medicine King today. The giving of his body was in this way, in immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta of times. Star-King-Flower, if a person who has given rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi can burn their fingers, or even one finger, to make an offering to a Buddha stupa, this is better than giving their country, city, wife, and children, and even the mountains, forests, rivers, and ponds, and all the precious treasures of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world as an offering. If a person were to fill the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world with the seven treasures and offer it to the Buddha, great Bodhisattvas, pratyekabuddhas, and arhats, the merit this person gains is not as great as receiving and upholding this Lotus Sutra, even a single four-line verse. Their blessings are the greatest.'
"Star-King-Flower, it is like the ocean, which is the foremost of all the streams, rivers, and waters. This Lotus Sutra is also like this; among all the sutras preached by the Tathagatas, it is the most profound and supreme. And it is like Mount Sumeru, which is the foremost among all mountains—the earth mountains, black mountains, small and great Iron Ring Mountains, and the ten precious mountains. This Lotus Sutra is also like this; among all the sutras, it is the most supreme. And it is like the moon, which is the foremost among all the stars. This Lotus Sutra is also like this; among the millions of millions of kinds of Dharma scriptures, it is the most illuminating. And it is like the sun, which can dispel all darkness. This sutra is also like this; it can break the darkness of all unwholesome deeds. And it is like a wheel-turning holy king, who is the foremost among all the small kings. This sutra is also like this; it is the king among all sutras. And it is like Śakra, who is the king of the Thirty-three Heavens. This sutra is also like this; it is the king among all sutras. And it is like the great Brahma King, who is the father of all sentient beings. This sutra is also like this; it is the father of all sages, learners, non-learners, and those who give rise to the Bodhisattva mind. And it is like the srotāpanna, sakṛdāgāmin, anāgāmin, arhat, and pratyekabuddha, who are the foremost among all ordinary people. This sutra is also like this; among all the scriptures and Dharmas preached by the Tathagata, the Bodhisattvas, and the śrāvakas, it is the most supreme. It is like the Buddha, who is the King of all Dharmas. This sutra is also like this; it is the King among all sutras."
The Merit for Women and a Final Admonition
"Star-King-Flower, this sutra can save all sentient beings. This sutra can cause all sentient beings to be free from all suffering and affliction. This sutra can bring great benefit to all sentient beings and fulfill their vows. It is like a cool pond that can satisfy all who are thirsty. It is like fire for those who are cold, clothes for those who are naked, a master for a merchant, a mother for a child, a boat for crossing a river, a doctor for the sick, a lamp for the dark, a treasure for the poor, a king for the people, an ocean for a merchant, and a torch that removes darkness. This Lotus Sutra is also like this; it can cause sentient beings to be free from all suffering and sickness, and it can untie all the bonds of life and death. If a person hears this Lotus Sutra, or copies it themselves, or causes others to copy it, the merit they gain is so vast that even with the Buddha's wisdom, one cannot calculate its end. If one copies this sutra scroll and makes offerings of flowers, incense, garlands, burning incense, powdered incense, paste incense, banners, canopies, robes, and all kinds of lamps—ghee lamps, oil lamps, fragrant oil lamps, campaka oil lamps, sumana oil lamps, parūṣaka oil lamps, vārsikā oil lamps, and navamallikā oil lamps—the merit they gain is also immeasurable."
"Star-King-Flower, if a person hears this chapter on the former lives of Bodhisattva Medicine King, they will also attain immeasurable and boundless merits. If a woman hears this chapter on the former lives of Bodhisattva Medicine King and is able to uphold it, this is her last lifetime as a woman; she will not be reborn as a woman again. If, after the Tathagata’s passing, in the latter five hundred years, a woman hears this scripture and practices it as it is taught, upon the end of her life, she will immediately go to the Land of Peace and Joy (Pure Land), and be reborn in a lotus flower on a jeweled seat, surrounded by Amitābha Buddha and the great assembly of Bodhisattvas. She will no longer be tormented by greedy desire, nor by anger and foolishness, nor by arrogance and jealousy. She will attain the supernatural powers of a Bodhisattva and the patience of non-arising.
"Having attained this patience, her eye faculty will be pure. With this pure eye faculty, she will see all the Tathagatas, as numerous as the sands of seven million two hundred thousand million nayuta Ganges Rivers. At that time, these Buddhas will all praise her from a distance, saying: 'Excellent! Excellent, noble woman! You were able, in the Dharma of Śākyamuni Buddha, to receive, uphold, read, recite, contemplate, and preach this sutra for others. The blessings and virtues you have attained are immeasurable and boundless. Fire cannot burn you, and water cannot drown you. Your merits, if a thousand Buddhas were to speak of them together, could not be exhausted. You have now been able to break all the armies of Māra and destroy the armies of life and death. All your other enemies are all crushed and extinguished. Noble woman, hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, with their supernatural powers, are protecting you together. Among all the worlds of gods and humans, there is none who can compare to you, except for a Tathagata. The wisdom and meditation of all the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and even the Bodhisattvas, are not equal to yours.'
"Star-King-Flower, this Bodhisattva is complete in such merits and the power of wisdom."
"If a person hears this chapter on the former lives of Bodhisattva Medicine King and can rejoice and praise it, in this lifetime, the fragrance of a blue lotus flower will constantly come from their mouth, and the fragrance of sandalwood will constantly come from the pores of their body. The merit they attain is as I have spoken above. For this reason, Star-King-Flower, I entrust this chapter on the former lives of Bodhisattva Medicine King to you. After my passing, in the latter five hundred years, you must widely preach and spread it throughout the world of Jambudvīpa and not allow it to be cut off, so that the evil Māra, Māra's followers, the gods, dragons, yakshas, and Kumbhāṇḍas, etc., will not have an advantage over it."
"Star-King-Flower, you must use the power of your supernatural abilities to protect this sutra. Why? This sutra is a good medicine for the illnesses of the people of Jambudvīpa. If a person is sick and hears this sutra, their sickness will immediately be extinguished, and they will not grow old or die. Star-King-Flower, if you see a person who upholds this sutra, you should fill a blue lotus flower with powdered incense and scatter it upon him. Having scattered it, you should think: 'This person will soon gather grass and sit at the place of enlightenment. He will break all the armies of Māra, blow the Dharma conch, beat the great Dharma drum, and save all sentient beings from the great ocean of birth, old age, sickness, and death.' For this reason, those who seek the Buddha Way, when they see a person who upholds this scripture, should give rise to such a respectful heart."
When this chapter on the former lives of Bodhisattva Medicine King was being preached, eighty-four thousand Bodhisattvas attained the total recall of all sentient beings' languages. Abundant Treasures Tathagata, from within the jeweled stupa, praised Bodhisattva Star-King-Flower, saying: "Excellent! Excellent, Star-King-Flower! You have attained inconceivable merits and were able to ask Śākyamuni Buddha such a matter, which benefits all sentient beings without measure."

The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, Volume Seven
Translated by Tripitaka Master Kumarajiva of the Kucha Kingdom in the Later Qin Dynasty, by imperial decree.
Chapter 24: The Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound
At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha emitted light from the tuft of hair on his head, one of the supreme marks of a great being. He also emitted a ray of light from the white hair between his eyebrows, which universally illuminated the worlds of all the Buddhas, as numerous as the sands of a hundred and eighty million million nayuta Ganges Rivers in the east. Beyond that number of worlds, there was a world named Pure-Light Adornment. In that land, there was a Buddha named Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. He was surrounded and revered by an immeasurable and boundless assembly of Bodhisattvas, and he was preaching the Dharma. Śākyamuni Buddha's light from his white hair universally shone upon that land.
At that time, in the world of Pure-Light Adornment, there was a Bodhisattva named Wonderful Sound. He had long ago planted roots of all merits and had made offerings to and been close to immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, and he was complete in a profoundly deep wisdom. He had attained the Samadhi of Wonderful Banner Form, the Samadhi of the Lotus Sutra, the Samadhi of Pure Virtue, the Samadhi of the King of Constellation's Play, the Samadhi of Non-Conditionedness, the Samadhi of the Seal of Wisdom, the Samadhi of Understanding All Sentient Beings' Languages, the Samadhi of Accumulating All Merits, the Samadhi of Purity, the Samadhi of Supernatural Play, the Samadhi of the Wisdom Torch, the Samadhi of the Adornment King, the Samadhi of Pure Light, the Samadhi of the Pure Treasury, the Samadhi of Non-Commonness, and the Samadhi of the Sun's Whirlwind. He had attained such great samadhis, numbering hundreds of thousands of millions of times the sands of the Ganges.
When Śākyamuni Buddha's light shone on his body, he immediately said to the Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha: "World-Honored One, I will now go to the Saha world to pay homage to, be close to, and make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha. I also wish to see the Dharma Prince Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, Bodhisattva Medicine King, Bodhisattva Valiant-Giver, Bodhisattva Star-King-Flower, Bodhisattva Superior-Conduct, Bodhisattva King of Adornment, and Bodhisattva Medicine-on-High."
At that time, the Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha said to Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound: "Do not be scornful of that land and give rise to a lowly thought. Noble man, that Saha world is high and low and uneven. It is filled with dirt, rocks, mountains, and filth. The Buddha's body is small and low, and the Bodhisattva assemblies are also small in form. Your body is forty-two thousand yojanas tall. My body is six hundred and eighty million yojanas tall. Your body is the most majestic, adorned with hundreds of thousands of millions of blessings, and your light is wonderfully beautiful. For this reason, when you go, do not be scornful of that land, or the Buddha, or the Bodhisattvas, or the world by giving rise to a lowly thought."
Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound said to his Buddha: "World-Honored One, my journey to the Saha world is entirely due to the power of the Tathagata. It is the playful supernatural power of the Tathagata and the adornment of the Tathagata's merits and wisdom."
Then, Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound, without rising from his seat and without his body moving, entered a samadhi. With the power of this samadhi, he transformed eighty-four thousand jeweled lotus flowers not far from the Dharma seat on Mount Vulture Peak. Their stems were of Jambunada gold, their leaves were of white silver, their filaments were of diamond, and their platforms were of kimbulaka jewels.
At that time, the Dharma Prince Mañjuśrī, seeing these lotus flowers, said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what is the reason for this auspicious sign to appear first? There are thousands of millions of these lotus flowers, with stems of Jambunada gold, leaves of white silver, filaments of diamond, and platforms of kimbulaka jewels."
At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha said to Mañjuśrī: "Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound, with his retinue of eighty-four thousand Bodhisattvas, wishes to come from the land of the Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha to this Saha world to make offerings to, be close to, and pay homage to me. He also wishes to make offerings to and hear the Lotus Sutra."
Mañjuśrī said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what roots of goodness did this Bodhisattva plant? What merits did he cultivate to have such great supernatural power? What samadhi does he practice? We wish you would tell us the name of this samadhi. We also wish to diligently cultivate it. By practicing this samadhi, one can see the size and form of this Bodhisattva, and his dignified conduct. We only wish, World-Honored One, that with your supernatural power, you would cause us to see that Bodhisattva when he comes."
At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha said to Mañjuśrī: "This long-passed-away Abundant Treasures Tathagata will manifest his form for you all to see him."
Then, Abundant Treasures Buddha said to that Bodhisattva: "Noble man, please come. The Dharma Prince Mañjuśrī wishes to see your body."
At that time, Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound vanished from that land and, along with his eighty-four thousand Bodhisattvas, came forth. As they passed through all the lands, the ground shook in six ways, and they all rained down seven-jeweled lotus flowers. Hundreds of thousands of heavenly music played without being beaten. This Bodhisattva's eyes were like the wide leaves of a blue lotus flower. Even if you were to combine the moon a hundred million times, his face would be even more majestic. His body was of a pure golden color, adorned with immeasurable hundreds of thousands of merits. His majesty was brilliant, and his light was shining. He was complete with all the marks, and his body was as firm as the diamond body of a Narayana. He entered a seven-jeweled tower and rose into the air, seven tāla trees high from the ground. He and his retinue of Bodhisattvas, who were reverently surrounding him, came to Mount Vulture Peak in the Saha world.
When he arrived, he descended from the seven-jeweled tower, held a necklace worth a hundred thousand jewels, and went to Śākyamuni Buddha's place. He bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, offered the necklace, and said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, the Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha asks about the World-Honored One's well-being: 'Are you in good health and without much sickness? Are you at ease in your daily life? Are your four elements in harmony? Is the world endurable? Are sentient beings easy to convert? Do they not have too much greedy desire, anger, foolishness, jealousy, stinginess, and arrogance? Are they not unfilial to their parents, disrespectful of the śramaṇas, and do they not hold wrong views and have unwholesome minds? Do they not restrain their five senses?'
"World-Honored One, are sentient beings able to subdue all the demon armies? Has the long-passed-away Abundant Treasures Tathagata come to listen to the Dharma in his seven-jeweled stupa? He also asks about Abundant Treasures Tathagata's well-being: 'Is he at peace and without much sickness? Can he endure staying for a long time?' World-Honored One, I now wish to see Abundant Treasures Buddha's body. We only wish that the World-Honored One would show me and cause me to see it."
At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha said to Abundant Treasures Buddha: "This Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound wishes to see you."
Then, Abundant Treasures Buddha said to Wonderful Sound: "Excellent! Excellent! You were able to come here to make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha, and to hear the Lotus Sutra, and also to see Mañjuśrī and the others."
At that time, Bodhisattva Flower-Virtue said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what roots of goodness did this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound plant? What merits did he cultivate to have such supernatural power?"
The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Flower-Virtue: "In the past, there was a Buddha named King of Cloud-Thunder-Voice Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land was named Manifesting-All-Worlds, and the kalpa was named Rejoice-in-Seeing.
"Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound, for twelve thousand years, used a hundred thousand kinds of music to make offerings to the King of Cloud-Thunder-Voice Buddha and also offered him eighty-four thousand seven-jeweled bowls. Because of this karmic reward, he is now born in the land of the Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha and has this supernatural power. Flower-Virtue, what do you think? Was the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound who made offerings of music and offered the jeweled bowls to the King of Cloud-Thunder-Voice Buddha a different person? He is this very Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound. Flower-Virtue, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound has made offerings to and been close to immeasurable Buddhas and has long planted roots of virtue. He has also encountered hundreds of thousands of millions of nayuta Buddhas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges."
"Flower-Virtue, you only see Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound's body here, but this Bodhisattva manifests various bodies everywhere to preach this scripture for all sentient beings. He may appear as a Brahma King, as Śakra, as a Sovereign of the Devas, as a Great Sovereign of the Devas, as a great heavenly general, as the heavenly king Vaiśravaṇa, as a wheel-turning holy king, as a small king, as an elder, as a householder, as a government official, as a Brahmin, as a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman. He may appear as the wife of an elder, a householder, or a government official, or as the wife of a Brahmin. He may appear as a boy or a girl. He may appear as a god, a dragon, a yaksha, a gandharva, an asura, a garuda, a kinnara, a mahoraga, a human, or a non-human to preach this sutra. He is able to save those in the hells, the hungry ghost realm, the animal realm, and all difficult places. He can even transform into a woman to preach this sutra in the king's palace."
"Flower-Virtue, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound is able to save and protect all sentient beings in the Saha world. The various forms this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound manifests in this Saha land to preach this scripture for sentient beings do not diminish his supernatural powers, transformations, or wisdom. With various kinds of wisdom, this Bodhisattva illuminates the Saha world and causes all sentient beings to know what they should know. In worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in the ten directions, he also does the same. If a person should be saved by the form of a śrāvaka, he appears as a śrāvaka to preach the Dharma for them. If they should be saved by the form of a pratyekabuddha, he appears as a pratyekabuddha. If they should be saved by the form of a Bodhisattva, he appears as a Bodhisattva. If they should be saved by the form of a Buddha, he appears as a Buddha. In this way, according to who should be saved, he manifests his form for them. Even if they should be saved by entering extinction, he manifests extinction for them. Flower-Virtue, the story of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound's attainment of great supernatural powers and the power of wisdom is like this."
At that time, Bodhisattva Flower-Virtue said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound has planted deep roots of goodness. World-Honored One, in what samadhi does this Bodhisattva dwell that he can manifest such transformations to save and liberate sentient beings?"
The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Flower-Virtue: "Noble man, that samadhi is named the Samadhi of Manifesting All Forms. Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound dwells in this samadhi and is able to bring such benefits to countless sentient beings."
When this chapter on Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound was being preached, eighty-four thousand people who had come with him all attained the Samadhi of Manifesting All Forms. And the countless Bodhisattvas of this Saha world also attained this samadhi and dhāranīs.
At that time, Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound, having made offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha and the stupa of Abundant Treasures Buddha, returned to his home land. As he passed through the various lands, the ground shook in six ways, and jeweled lotus flowers rained down. A hundred million millions of various kinds of music played. When he arrived in his home land, he and his eighty-four thousand Bodhisattvas, surrounded by their retinue, went to the Pure-Flower-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha's place. He said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I went to the Saha world and benefited sentient beings. I saw Śākyamuni Buddha and the stupa of Abundant Treasures Buddha, and I paid homage and made offerings. I also saw the Dharma Prince Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, and I saw Bodhisattva Medicine King, Bodhisattva Diligence, and Bodhisattva Valiant-Giver. I also enabled these eighty-four thousand Bodhisattvas to attain the Samadhi of Manifesting All Forms."
When this chapter on the travels of Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound was being preached, forty-two thousand heavenly beings attained the patience of non-arising, and Bodhisattva Flower-Virtue attained the Samadhi of the Lotus Sutra.

Chapter 25: The Universal Gateway of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara
At that time, Bodhisattva Boundless Intent rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, and, with palms joined, said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, for what reason is Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara called Avalokiteśvara?"
The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Boundless Intent: "Noble man, if there are immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of sentient beings who suffer from all kinds of afflictions, and they hear of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and with a single mind call his name, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will immediately perceive their voices and they will all be liberated.
"If a person upholds the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, and even enters a great fire, the fire will not be able to burn them, because of the majestic and spiritual power of this Bodhisattva. If they are swept away by a great flood, and they call his name, they will immediately reach a shallow place. If there are hundreds of thousands of millions of sentient beings who, for the sake of seeking treasures like gold, silver, lapis lazuli, tridacna, agate, coral, amber, and pearls, enter the great ocean, and if a black wind blows their ships and causes them to drift into the land of the Rakshasa demons, and if even one person among them calls the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, all these people will be liberated from the dangers of the Rakshasas. It is for this reason that he is called Avalokiteśvara (the one who perceives the sound)."
"If there is a person who is about to be harmed, and they call the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, the knives and sticks in the hands of the person trying to harm them will immediately break into pieces, and they will be liberated. If the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world is filled with yakshas and rakshasas who want to torment a person, and they hear that person call the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, these evil ghosts will not even be able to look at them with evil eyes, let alone harm them.
"If there is a person, whether they are guilty or not, whose body is bound by shackles, chains, and manacles, and they call the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, all of these will be broken and they will immediately be liberated. If the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world is filled with hostile bandits, and there is a caravan leader who is guiding many merchants with valuable treasures through a dangerous road, and one person among them proclaims: 'All you noble men, do not be afraid! You should all, with a single mind, call the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara! This Bodhisattva is able to grant fearlessness to sentient beings. If you call his name, you will be liberated from these hostile bandits.' When the merchants hear this, they will all call out: 'Namo Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara!' Because they call his name, they will immediately be liberated."
"Boundless Intent, the majestic and spiritual power of Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is so great. If there is a sentient being who is filled with greedy desire and they constantly remember and revere Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, they will be freed from desire. If they are filled with anger and constantly remember and revere Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, they will be freed from anger. If they are filled with foolishness and constantly remember and revere Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, they will be freed from foolishness.
"Boundless Intent, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara has such great majestic and spiritual power and brings great benefit to many. For this reason, all sentient beings should constantly think of him. If a woman wishes to have a son, and she bows and makes offerings to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, she will give birth to a son who is blessed with virtues and wisdom. If she wishes to have a daughter, she will give birth to a daughter who is beautiful and has good marks, who has planted roots of virtue in past lives, and who is loved and revered by all. Boundless Intent, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara has such power. If a sentient being reverently bows and makes offerings to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, their blessings will not be in vain. For this reason, all sentient beings should receive and uphold the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara."
"Boundless Intent, if a person were to receive and uphold the names of sixty-two million Bodhisattvas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, and for their entire life, they were to make offerings of food, clothing, bedding, and medicine, what do you think? Is the merit of this noble man or noble woman great?"
Boundless Intent said: "Very great, World-Honored One."
The Buddha said: "If a person receives and upholds the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and even for a short time, bows and makes offerings, the blessings of these two people are exactly equal and cannot be exhausted even in hundreds of thousands of millions of kalpas. Boundless Intent, by receiving and upholding the name of Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, one attains such immeasurable and boundless blessings and benefits."
The Manifestations of Avalokiteśvara
Bodhisattva Boundless Intent said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, how does Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara travel in this Saha world? How does he preach the Dharma for sentient beings? What is the matter of his power of expedient means?"
The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Boundless Intent: "Noble man, in a certain land, if sentient beings should be saved by the form of a Buddha, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will immediately manifest as a Buddha to preach the Dharma for them. If they should be saved by the form of a pratyekabuddha, he will immediately manifest as a pratyekabuddha to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a śrāvaka, he will immediately manifest as a śrāvaka to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a Brahma King, he will immediately manifest as a Brahma King to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a Śakra, he will immediately manifest as a Śakra to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a Sovereign of the Devas, he will immediately manifest as a Sovereign of the Devas to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a Great Sovereign of the Devas, he will immediately manifest as a Great Sovereign of the Devas to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a great heavenly general, he will immediately manifest as a great heavenly general to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of Vaiśravaṇa, he will immediately manifest as Vaiśravaṇa to preach the Dharma.
"If they should be saved by the form of a small king, he will immediately manifest as a small king to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of an elder, he will immediately manifest as an elder to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a householder, he will immediately manifest as a householder to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a government official, he will immediately manifest as a government official to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a Brahmin, he will immediately manifest as a Brahmin to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a monk, nun, layman, or laywoman, he will immediately manifest as a monk, nun, layman, or laywoman to preach the Dharma.
"If they should be saved by the form of the wife of an elder, a householder, a government official, or a Brahmin, he will immediately manifest as a woman to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a boy or a girl, he will immediately manifest as a boy or a girl to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a god, a dragon, a yaksha, a gandharva, an asura, a garuda, a kinnara, a mahoraga, a human, or a non-human, he will immediately manifest as such to preach the Dharma. If they should be saved by the form of a vajra-holding deity, he will immediately manifest as a vajra-holding deity to preach the Dharma."
"Boundless Intent, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara is complete in these merits and, with various forms, travels to all lands to save and liberate sentient beings. For this reason, you all should, with a single mind, make offerings to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. This Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is able to grant fearlessness in times of fear and urgent danger. For this reason, in this Saha world, he is also called the Giver of Fearlessness."
Bodhisattva Boundless Intent said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I will now make an offering to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara." He then took off the jeweled necklace from his neck, worth hundreds of thousands of gold, and gave it to him, saying: "Noble One, please accept this precious jeweled necklace, which is a Dharma offering." At that time, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara would not accept it.
Boundless Intent again said to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara: "Noble One, out of compassion for us, please accept this necklace."
At that time, the Buddha said to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara: "You should have compassion for this Bodhisattva Boundless Intent and the four groups of the assembly, the gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans, and accept this necklace."
Immediately, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, out of compassion for the four groups and the gods, dragons, humans, and non-humans, accepted the necklace. He divided it into two parts. He offered one part to Śākyamuni Buddha and the other part to the stupa of Abundant Treasures Buddha.
"Boundless Intent, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara has such free and supernatural power and travels in the Saha world."
The Universal Gateway (Verse)
At that time, Bodhisattva Boundless Intent spoke in verse, asking:
The World-Honored One, with them wonderful marks,
I'm askin' you again, about him in the dark:
Tell me, why this Buddha's child, so true and grand,
Is called Avalokiteśvara, throughout the land?

The Honored One, with them wonderful marks so fine,
Answered Boundless Intent, with a verse and a sign:
"Listen to the practices of Avalokiteśvara, hear my plea!
He skillfully responds, for all the world to see.
His great vow is deep, like the ocean's endless blue,
He's been workin' at it for kalpas, it's true.
Served a hundred thousand million Buddhas, so they say,
And gave rise to a pure vow, come what may.

Just a little somethin' I'll tell you 'bout his grace:
If you hear his name, or see his gentle face,
And you think of him in your heart, it ain't in vain,
He can wash away the suffering, ease all the pain.
If a bad heart rises, full of spite and dread,
And pushes you down, into a fiery bed,
Just think of Avalokiteśvara, his power strong and deep,
That fire pit turns to a pond, while you softly sleep.

Or if you're swept away, in the ocean's mighty hold,
With dragons, fish, and ghosts, a story to be told,
If you think of Avalokiteśvara, his power takes its flight,
The waves won't drag you down, in the darkest night.
Or on Mount Sumeru's top, so high and grand,
And someone shoves you over, with a cruel, harsh hand,
If you think of Avalokiteśvara, his power you will find,
You'll stand still like the sun, leaving troubles behind.

If an evil person chases, with a hateful eye,
And you fall from Diamond Mountain, beneath the sky,
If you think of Avalokiteśvara, his power will take hold,
Not a single hair will be harmed, or so I've been told.
Or if hostile bandits surround you, a fearsome crew,
With knives held sharp to harm you, what will you do?
If you think of Avalokiteśvara, his power will set things right,
They'll feel compassion risin', in the fading light.

If a king brings danger, and the axe is near,
And execution's waitin', filled with doubt and fear,
If you think of Avalokiteśvara, his power will be seen,
That knife will break to pieces, sharp and keen.
Or if you're chained and manacled, your hands and feet are bound,
No freedom in your movement, on the cold, hard ground,
If you think of Avalokiteśvara, his power will shine through,
You'll be freed and liberated, what else can you do?

If curses come to harm you, dark and full of dread,
And all kinds of poisons, buzzing 'round your head,
If you think of Avalokiteśvara, his power will make a turn,
The harm goes back to sender, a lesson they will learn.
Or if you meet them rakshasas, with a fearsome grin,
Poisonous dragons, or ghosts, where do you begin?
If you think of Avalokiteśvara, his power strong and true,
They won't dare to harm you, me and you.

If evil beasts surround you, with sharp teeth and claws,
A frightening sight to see, against all natural laws,
If you think of Avalokiteśvara, his power will take flight,
They'll run to the distance, in the fading light.
Vipers, snakes, and scorpions, with breath like burning smoke,
A poisonous vapor rising, a choking, silent joke,
If you think of Avalokiteśvara, his power will be heard,
They'll go away when they hear you, without another word.

When clouds roll in, with thunder and the lightning's flash,
And hail and heavy rain falls, in a mighty, sudden crash,
If you think of Avalokiteśvara, his power will come fast,
It'll be dispelled immediately, a memory of the past.
Sentient beings in trouble, with suffering all around,
His wonderful, wise power, on holy ground,
Can save 'em from the worldly pains, so deep and vast,
His mercy and his wisdom, forever they will last.

He's got the power of spirits, beyond compare,
Cultivates wisdom widely, and means beyond all care.
In all the lands of ten directions, far and wide they roam,
There's no place he don't manifest, always bringin' it home.
In all the evil destinies, the Hells and ghosts and beasts,
The pain of birth and aging, sickness, and death's feasts,
He gradually extinguishes 'em all, with a gentle hand,
Bringin' peace and solace, across the land.

The true perception, pure and bright, a guiding star,
The great perception of wisdom, shining from afar.
The perception of compassion, and of love so sweet,
We ought to always wish for these, at his sacred feet.
The pure and unconditioned light, a sun so grand and bold,
Breaks all the darkness, a story to be told.
Can conquer winds of disaster, and the fiery flame,
Illuminating the world, whisperin' his name.

His body of compassion, like a thunderous drum's deep sound,
His wonderful, compassionate mind, like clouds upon the ground,
He pours down Dharma rain, like sweet and gentle dew,
Extinguishes afflictions' flames, for me and for you.
When arguments and lawsuits, in the courthouse ring,
Or in a fearful army, a fearful song they sing,
If you think of Avalokiteśvara, his power will descend,
All the enemies scatter, right up to the end.

His is the wonderful voice, Avalokiteśvara's call,
The voice of Brahma, the sea-tide, standing tall.
Superior to all worldly voices, strong and clear and true,
For this reason, you must always think of him, me and you.
In every single thought, don't let no doubt arise,
The pure and holy Avalokiteśvara, before your very eyes,
Can be our refuge, in times of sorrow and of pain,
When death's danger lingers, he'll bring the sun again.

He's got all the merits, a boundless, endless sea,
He sees all sentient beings, with compassion, wild and free.
His sea of blessings, immeasurable and grand,
For this reason, we should pay him homage, throughout the land.
At that time, Bodhisattva Earth-Holder rose from his seat and said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, if a sentient being hears this chapter on Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara's free and independent work, and his power to manifest in a universal gateway, you should know that the merit of this person is not small."
When the Buddha preached this chapter of the universal gateway, eighty-four thousand sentient beings in the assembly all gave rise to the unequaled mind of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.
Chapter 26: Dharanis

At that time, Bodhisattva Medicine King rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, and, with palms joined, said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, if a noble man or noble woman is able to uphold the Lotus Sutra—whether they read, recite, and master it, or copy the sutra scrolls—how much merit do they attain?"
The Buddha said to Medicine King: "If a noble man or noble woman makes offerings to Buddhas as numerous as the sands of sixty-two hundred million Ganges Rivers, what do you think? Is the merit they attain great?"
"Very great, World-Honored One."
The Buddha said: "If a noble man or noble woman is able to uphold even a four-line verse of this sutra, and reads, recites, understands its meaning, and practices it as it is taught, their merit is very great."
At that time, Bodhisattva Medicine King said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I will now give the Dharma teacher a dhāraṇī spell to protect him." He then spoke the spell:
An-er, Man-er, Mo-ni, Mo-mo-ni, Zhi-li, Zha-li-di, She-wei, She-li-duo-wei, Shan-di, Mu-di, Mu-duo-li, Suo-li, A-wei-suo-fu, Sang-li, Suo-li, Cha-yi, A-cha-yi, A-qi-ni, Shan-di, She-li, Tuo-luo-ni, A-lu-qie-po-suo-po-zha-bi-sha-ni, Ni-pi-ti, A-bian-duo-luo-ni-li-ti, A-dan-duo-bo-li-shu-di, Ou-jiu-li, Mu-jiu-li, A-luo-li, Bo-luo-li, Shou-jia-cha, A-san-mo-san-li, Fo-tuo-bi-ji-li-ti, Da-mo-bo-li-cha-ti, Seng-qie-ni-qu-sha-ni, Po-she-po-she-shu-di, Man-duo-luo, Man-duo-luo-cha-ye-duo, You-lou-duo, You-lou-duo-qiao-she-lüe, E-cha-luo, E-cha-ye-duo-ye, A-po-luo, A-mo-ruo-na-duo-ye.
"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī spell was spoken by Buddhas as numerous as the sands of sixty-two hundred million Ganges Rivers. If anyone harms or slanders this Dharma teacher, they are harming and slandering all these Buddhas."
At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha praised Bodhisattva Medicine King, saying: "Excellent! Excellent, Medicine King! Because you have compassionately protected this Dharma teacher, you have spoken this dhāraṇī, which brings great benefit to sentient beings."
At that time, Bodhisattva Valiant Giver said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I also, for the sake of protecting those who read, recite, and uphold the Lotus Sutra, will speak a dhāraṇī. If this Dharma teacher attains this dhāraṇī, no yakshas, rakshasas, pūtanas, kṛtyas, kumbhāṇḍas, or hungry ghosts will be able to find a weakness to attack him." He then spoke the spell in the presence of the Buddha:
Zuo-li, Mo-he-zuo-li, Yu-zhi, Mu-zhi, A-li, A-luo-po-di, Nie-li-di, Nie-li-duo-po-di, Yi-zhi-ni, Wei-zhi-ni, Zhi-chi-ni, Nie-li-chi-ni, Nie-li-chi-po-di.
"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī spell was spoken by Buddhas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. They all rejoiced in it. If anyone harms or slanders this Dharma teacher, they are harming and slandering all these Buddhas."
At that time, the world-protecting Heavenly King Vaiśravaṇa said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I also, out of compassion for sentient beings and to protect this Dharma teacher, will speak a dhāraṇī." He then spoke the spell:
A-li, Na-li, Tuo-na-li, A-na-lu, Na-li, Ju-na-fu.
"World-Honored One, with this divine spell, I will protect the Dharma teacher. I myself will also protect the one who upholds this sutra, so that within a hundred yojanas, they will have no misfortune."
At that time, the Heavenly King Dhṛtarāṣṭra was in the assembly with his retinue of tens of millions of nayuta gandharva beings. With reverence, they all went before the Buddha, joined their palms, and said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I also, with a divine dhāraṇī spell, will protect the one who upholds the Lotus Sutra." He then spoke the spell:
A-jia-ni, Jia-ni, Qu-li, Gan-tuo-li, Zhan-tuo-li, Mo-deng-qi, Chang-qiu-li, Fu-lou-suo-ni, E-di.
"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī spell was spoken by forty-two hundred million Buddhas. If anyone harms or slanders this Dharma teacher, they are harming and slandering all these Buddhas."
The Vow of the Rakshasa Maidens
At that time, there were ten rakshasa maidens, whose names were Lamva, Vilamva, Crooked-Tooth, Flower-Tooth, Black-Tooth, Many-Hairs, Endless-Stomach, Upholder-of-Garlands, Kunti, and Seizer-of-the-Essence-of-All-Beings. These ten rakshasa maidens, along with the Mother of Demon Children, and their sons and retinues, all went to the Buddha's place. With one voice, they said to the Buddha:
"World-Honored One, we also wish to protect those who read, recite, and uphold the Lotus Sutra and to remove their misfortunes. If there are those who seek to find a weakness in the Dharma teacher, we will prevent them from having an advantage." They then spoke the spell in the presence of the Buddha:
Yi-ti-li, Yi-ti-min, Yi-ti-li, A-di-li, Yi-ti-li, Ni-li, Ni-li, Ni-li, Ni-li, Ni-li, Lou-xi, Lou-xi, Lou-xi, Lou-xi, Duo-xi, Duo-xi, Duo-xi, Dou-xi, Nu-xi.
"It is better that someone climb on our heads than to trouble a Dharma teacher. No yakshas, rakshasas, hungry ghosts, pūtanas, kṛtyas, vetālas, gandhas, unmādas, apasmāras, yaksha-kṛtyas, human-kṛtyas, or those with fevers of one day, two days, three days, four days, or up to seven days, or those with constant fevers; whether they have the form of a man, a woman, a boy, or a girl—even in a dream, they shall not trouble him."
They then spoke in verse in the presence of the Buddha:
If you don't heed this righteous plea,
And trouble the one who preaches free,
Your head will split, believe it true,
Like an āralu branch, through and through.

The sin you'll bear, a heavy toll,
Like killing kin, it'll haunt your soul.
Like pressing oil, a grinding plight,
Or cheating folk with scales not right.
Like Devadatta, full of spite,
Who broke the monks, in dark of night.

One who offends this Dharma's guide,
Such karmic pain will be their stride.
After the rakshasa maidens spoke this verse, they said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we will also personally protect those who receive, uphold, read, recite, and practice this sutra and will cause them to be at peace, free from all misfortunes, and we will eliminate all poisons."
The Buddha said to the rakshasa maidens: "Excellent! Excellent! The blessings you attain from only protecting the name of the Lotus Sutra are immeasurable, how much more so for protecting one who fully upholds, makes offerings to the sutra scrolls with flowers, incense, garlands, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, banners, canopies, and music, and lights all kinds of lamps—ghee lamps, oil lamps, fragrant oil lamps, sumana flower oil lamps, campaka flower oil lamps, vārsikā flower oil lamps, and utpala flower oil lamps—and a hundred thousand other kinds of offerings? Kunti, you and your retinues should protect such Dharma teachers."
When this chapter on Dharanis was being preached, sixty-eight thousand people attained the patience of non-arising.





Chapter 27: The Former Lives of King Wonderful Adornment
At that time, the Buddha said to all the great assemblies: "In the distant past, an immeasurable, boundless, and inconceivable asaṃkhyeya kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named Cloud-Thunder-Voice-Constellation-King-Wisdom Tathagata, Worthy One, Truly and Universally Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Supreme Being, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land was named Bright-Adornment, and the kalpa was named Joy-in-Seeing."
The Story of King Wonderful Adornment
"In that Buddha's Dharma, there was a king named Wonderful Adornment. The king's queen was named Pure Virtue, and they had two sons, one named Pure Treasury and the other named Pure Eye. These two sons had great supernatural powers, blessings, and wisdom. They had long cultivated the path of a Bodhisattva, practicing the pāramitā of giving, the pāramitā of precepts, the pāramitā of patience, the pāramitā of diligence, the pāramitā of meditation, the pāramitā of wisdom, and the pāramitā of expedient means. They were also clear in their understanding of compassion, joy, giving up, and the thirty-seven parts of the Way.
"They had also attained the Bodhisattva's Samadhi of Purity, the Samadhi of the Sun and Stars, the Samadhi of Pure Light, the Samadhi of Pure Form, the Samadhi of Pure Illumination, the Samadhi of Eternal Adornment, and the Samadhi of the Great Treasury of Majestic Virtue. In these samadhis, they were all thoroughly proficient."
"At that time, that Buddha, wishing to guide King Wonderful Adornment and out of compassion for sentient beings, preached the Lotus Sutra. The two sons, Pure Treasury and Pure Eye, went to their mother, joined their palms, and said: 'Mother, we wish for you to go to the Cloud-Thunder-Voice-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha's place. We will also follow you to be close to him and make offerings. Why? This Buddha is now preaching the Lotus Sutra in the midst of all the gods and humans, and it is proper that we should listen and accept it.'
"The mother said to her sons: 'Your father is deeply attached to the heretical teachings and reveres the Brahmins. You should go and tell your father and go with him.'
"Pure Treasury and Pure Eye, with joined palms, said to their mother: 'We are sons of the Dharma King, but we were born into a family that holds these wrong views.'
"The mother said to her sons: 'You should have a worried thought for your father and manifest a spiritual transformation for him. If he sees it, his mind will surely become pure, and he might allow us to go to the Buddha's place.'
"Then, the two sons, out of love for their father, rose into the air, as high as seven tāla trees. They manifested all kinds of supernatural transformations. In the air, they would walk, stand, sit, and lie down. Water would come from their upper body and fire from their lower body; fire would come from their upper body and water from their lower body. Sometimes they would manifest as a great body that filled the sky, and then they would manifest as a small body. They would vanish in the air and suddenly reappear on the ground. They would enter the ground as if it were water and walk on water as if it were ground.
"They manifested all these kinds of supernatural transformations to cause their father's heart to become pure and full of faith. When the father saw the supernatural power of his sons in this way, his heart was filled with great joy and he gained what he had never had. He joined his palms toward his sons and said: 'Who is your teacher? Whose disciples are you?' The two sons said: 'Great King, that Cloud-Thunder-Voice-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha is now sitting on a Dharma seat under a seven-jeweled bodhi tree. In the midst of all the assemblies of gods and humans, he is widely preaching the Lotus Sutra. He is our teacher, and we are his disciples.' The father said to his sons: 'I now also wish to see your teacher. We should go together.'
"Then the two sons descended from the air, went to their mother, and, with palms joined, said to her: 'Father has now gained faith and understanding and is worthy of giving rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. We have already done the work of a Buddha for our father. We wish that our mother would allow us to renounce our home and cultivate the Way under that Buddha.'
"At that time, the two sons, wishing to repeat their meaning, said in verse to their mother:
Mama, oh mama, won't you let us be free?
This old house, it ain't the place for you and me.
We wanna walk the Buddha's path, learn his gentle way,
'Cause a Buddha's like a flower, seen once in a long, long day.

Trouble and danger, they lurk on every side,
But with the Buddha's wisdom, we'll have nowhere to hide.
So mama, sweet mama, please understand our plea,
Let us leave this weary home, and set our spirits free.
"The mother then said: 'I allow you to renounce your home. Why? Because the Buddha is difficult to encounter.' Then the two sons said to their parents: 'Excellent, our parents! We wish that you would now go to the place of the Cloud-Thunder-Voice-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha to be close to him and make offerings. Why? A Buddha is difficult to encounter, like the udumbara flower, and it is like a one-eyed tortoise finding a floating log with a hole in it. Because our past blessings are so deep and rich, we have been born at a time when we can encounter the Buddha's Dharma. For this reason, parents, you must allow us to renounce our home. Why? Buddhas are difficult to encounter, and the time is also difficult to meet.'
"At that time, the eighty-four thousand women in King Wonderful Adornment's palace were all worthy of receiving and upholding this Lotus Sutra. Bodhisattva Pure Eye had long had a thorough understanding of the Samadhi of the Lotus Sutra, and Bodhisattva Pure Treasury had, for an immeasurable hundred million kalpas, had a thorough understanding of the Samadhi of Leaving All Evil Destinies and wished for all sentient beings to be free from all evil destinies. The king's queen, Pure Virtue, had attained the Samadhi of All Buddhas' Assembly and was able to know the secret treasury of all Buddhas. The two sons, in this way, used the power of expedient means to skillfully convert their father, causing his heart to believe and understand and to love the Buddha's Dharma.
"Then, King Wonderful Adornment, with his ministers and retinues, and Queen Pure Virtue, with her retinue of palace maidens, and the two sons of the king, with their retinue of forty-two thousand people, all went to the Buddha's place. When they arrived, they bowed their heads at his feet, circled the Buddha three times, and stood to one side."
The King's Prophecy and Renunciation
"At that time, that Buddha preached the Dharma for the king, revealing, teaching, benefiting, and filling him with joy. The king was extremely delighted. Then, King Wonderful Adornment and his queen took off their pearl necklaces, worth a hundred thousand, and scattered them upon the Buddha. In the air, they transformed into a four-pillared jeweled platform. On the platform, there was a great jeweled bed covered with hundreds of thousands of millions of heavenly robes. Upon it, the Buddha sat in the lotus posture, emitting great light.
"At that time, King Wonderful Adornment thought: 'The Buddha's body is so rare, majestic, and wonderful, complete with the most subtle and supreme form.'
"Then, the Cloud-Thunder-Voice-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha said to the four groups of the assembly: 'Do you see King Wonderful Adornment standing before me with joined palms? This king will, in my Dharma, become a monk, diligently cultivate, and assist in the Dharma of the Buddha Way. He will attain Buddhahood, with the title King of the Sāla-Tree Tathagata. His land will be named Great-Light, and the kalpa will be named Great-High-King. This Sāla-Tree-King Buddha will have an immeasurable assembly of Bodhisattvas and immeasurable śrāvakas. His land will be level, and its merits will be like this.'
"The king then immediately gave his country to his younger brother and, along with his queen, his two sons, and all his retinues, renounced his home and cultivated the Way in the Buddha's Dharma. When the king had renounced his home, for eighty-four thousand years, he constantly and diligently cultivated and practiced the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma. After that, he attained the Samadhi of All Pure Merit Adornment. He immediately rose into the air, as high as seven tāla trees, and said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, my two sons have done the work of a Buddha. With their supernatural transformations, they turned my wrong views and enabled me to be settled in the Buddha Dharma and to see the World-Honored One. These two sons are my good companions. For the sake of giving rise to my roots of goodness from a past life and for my benefit, they were born into my family.'"
"At that time, the Cloud-Thunder-Voice-Constellation-King-Wisdom Buddha said to King Wonderful Adornment: 'It is so, it is so, just as you say. If a noble man or noble woman plants roots of goodness, from lifetime to lifetime, they will attain good companions. The good companions are able to do the work of a Buddha—revealing, teaching, benefiting, and filling them with joy, and causing them to enter Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Great King, you should know that good companions are a great cause, as they convert and guide one to see the Buddha and give rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Great King, do you see these two sons? These two sons have made offerings to sixty-five hundred thousand million nayutas of Buddhas, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. They have been close to them with reverence, and have received and upheld the Lotus Sutra from those Buddhas, and out of compassion for sentient beings with wrong views, they have caused them to dwell in right views.'
"King Wonderful Adornment then descended from the air and said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the Tathagata is so rare. Because of your merits and wisdom, the tuft of hair on your head shines with a brilliant light. Your eyes are long and broad and are a deep blue color. The tuft of hair between your eyebrows is white like a crystal moon. Your teeth are white, even, and close together, and always have a shining light. The color of your lips is a beautiful red, like the bimva fruit.'
"At that time, King Wonderful Adornment, having praised the Buddha's immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of merits in this way, with a single mind and joined palms before the Tathagata, said again to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, this is unprecedented! The Dharma of the Tathagata is completely adorned with inconceivable, subtle, and wonderful merits. The teachings and practices bring peace, comfort, and goodness. From today on, I will no longer follow my own will, and I will not give rise to wrong views, arrogance, anger, or any other unwholesome thoughts.' Having spoken these words, he paid reverence to the Buddha and left."
The Buddha said to the great assembly: "What do you think? Was King Wonderful Adornment a different person? He is Bodhisattva Flower-Virtue today. His queen, Pure Virtue, is Bodhisattva Adorned with Pure Light who is here before me. Out of compassion for King Wonderful Adornment and all his relatives, she was born into that family. His two sons are Bodhisattva Medicine King and Bodhisattva Medicine-on-High today.
"These Bodhisattva Medicine King and Bodhisattva Medicine-on-High are complete in such great merits and have, under immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas, planted all kinds of good roots. They have completed inconceivable good merits. If a person knows the names of these two Bodhisattvas, all the gods, humans, and people of the world should also pay them reverence."
When the Buddha preached this chapter on the former lives of King Wonderful Adornment, eighty-four thousand people became far from defilement and dirt and attained the pure eye of the Dharma.
Chapter 28: The Bodhisattva Universal Worthy Encouraging and Upholding the Sutra
At that time, Bodhisattva Universal Worthy, with his independent and supernatural powers, his majestic virtue, and his well-known fame, came from the east with a countless and boundless assembly of great Bodhisattvas. As they passed through all the lands, they all shook, rained down jeweled lotus flowers, and played countless hundreds of thousands of millions of different kinds of music. He was surrounded by a great assembly of countless gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans, all manifesting their majestic and spiritual powers. When he arrived at Mount Vulture Peak in the Saha world, he bowed his head at the feet of Śākyamuni Buddha, circled him seven times to the right, and said to the Buddha:
"World-Honored One, from the land of King of Superior Virtue of Treasures, I heard from afar that in this Saha world, the Lotus Sutra is being preached. I have come with immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of millions of Bodhisattva assemblies to listen to it. We only wish that the World-Honored One would tell us how a noble man or noble woman can attain this Lotus Sutra after the Tathagata’s passing?"
The Buddha said to Bodhisattva Universal Worthy: "If a noble man or noble woman is complete in four Dharmas, after the Tathagata’s passing, they will be able to attain this Lotus Sutra. The four are: first, they are protected and remembered by all the Buddhas; second, they plant roots of all merits; third, they enter the correct group (of those destined for enlightenment); and fourth, they give rise to the mind to save all sentient beings. Noble men and noble women who are complete in these four Dharmas will surely attain this sutra after the Tathagata’s passing."
The Vow of Universal Worthy
At that time, Bodhisattva Universal Worthy said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, in the latter five hundred years of the turbid and evil age, if there is one who upholds this scripture, I will protect him and remove his misfortunes, so that he may be at peace. I will prevent anyone who seeks his weakness—whether they are a demon, a son of a demon, a daughter of a demon, a follower of a demon, one who is possessed by a demon, a yaksha, a rakshasa, a kumbhāṇḍa, a piśāca, a kṛtya, a pūtanā, or a vetāla—from having an advantage over him.
"If this person is walking or standing, reading and reciting this sutra, I will, at that time, ride my white six-tusked elephant king, with a great assembly of Bodhisattvas, and go to his place. I will manifest my body to him, make offerings, protect him, and comfort his heart, and I will also be making offerings to the Lotus Sutra. If this person is sitting and contemplating this sutra, I will also, at that time, ride my white elephant king and appear before him. If this person forgets a single line or a single verse of the Lotus Sutra, I will teach him, read and recite it with him, and cause him to master it again. At that time, the one who receives, upholds, reads, and recites the Lotus Sutra, will see my body and be filled with great joy, and will become even more diligent. Because he sees me, he will immediately attain a samadhi and a dhāraṇī, named Whirling Dhāraṇī, Dhāraṇī of a Hundred Thousand Million Whirlings, and Dhāraṇī of the Dharma Sound and Expedient Means. He will attain these kinds of dhāraṇī."
"World-Honored One, if, in a future age, in the last five hundred years of the turbid and evil age, a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman who is a seeker, upholder, reader, reciter, or copier wishes to cultivate this Lotus Sutra, they should, for three seven-day periods, with a single mind, be diligent. When the three seven-day periods have passed, I will ride my white six-tusked elephant and, surrounded by countless Bodhisattvas, manifest my body, which is a joy for all sentient beings to see, before that person. I will preach the Dharma for him, reveal and teach, benefit and fill him with joy. I will also give him a dhāraṇī spell, and because he attains this dhāraṇī, no non-human being will be able to harm him, nor will he be deluded by a woman. I myself will also constantly protect this person. We only wish, World-Honored One, that you would permit me to speak this dhāraṇī spell."
He then spoke the spell in the presence of the Buddha:
A-tan-di, Tan-tuo-po-di, Tan-tuo-po-di, Tan-tuo-jiu-she-li, Tan-tuo-xiu-tuo-li, Xiu-tuo-li, Xiu-tuo-luo-po-di, Fo-tuo-po-shan-ni, Sa-po-tuo-luo-ni-a-po-duo-ni, Sa-po-po-sha-a-po-duo-ni, Xiu-a-po-duo-ni, Seng-qie-po-li-cha-ni, Seng-qie-nie-qie-tuo-ni, A-seng-qi, Seng-qie-bo-qie-di, Di-li-a-duo-seng-qie-dou-lüe, A-luo-di-po-luo-di, Sa-po-seng-qie-san-mo-di-qie-lan-di, Sa-po-da-mo-xiu-bo-li-cha-di, Sa-po-sa-duo-lou-tuo-qiao-she-lüe-a-men-qie-di, Xin-a-pi-ji-li-di-di.
The Merits of Upholding the Sutra
"World-Honored One, if a Bodhisattva hears this dhāraṇī, they should know the supernatural power of Universal Worthy. If the Lotus Sutra is being practiced in the world of Jambudvīpa, and there is one who upholds it, they should think: 'This is all due to the majestic and spiritual power of Universal Worthy.' If a person upholds, reads, recites, remembers it properly, understands its meaning, and practices it as it is taught, you should know that this person is practicing the conduct of Universal Worthy. He has planted deep roots of goodness under immeasurable and boundless Buddhas and has had his head touched by all the Tathagatas.
"If a person only copies the sutra, when this person dies, he will be born in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven. At that time, eighty-four thousand heavenly maidens will come with music to greet him. This person will put on a seven-jeweled crown and, in the midst of the maidens, will find joy and happiness. How much more for one who receives, upholds, reads, recites, remembers it properly, understands its meaning, and practices it as it is taught?
"If a person receives, upholds, reads, and understands its meaning, when this person dies, a thousand Buddhas will extend their hands to him, causing him to have no fear and not to fall into an evil destiny. He will immediately go to the Tuṣita heaven, to the place of Bodhisattva Maitreya. Bodhisattva Maitreya, who is surrounded by a great assembly of thirty-two marks of Bodhisattvas, will also have hundreds of thousands of millions of heavenly maidens in his retinue. This person will be born among them and receive such meritorious benefits. For this reason, the wise should, with a single mind, copy it for themselves, or have others copy it. They should receive, uphold, read, recite, remember it properly, and practice it as it is taught."
The Buddha's Confirmation
"World-Honored One, I will now, with my supernatural power, protect this sutra, and after the Tathagata’s passing, I will cause it to be widely spread in the world of Jambudvīpa so that it is not cut off."
At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha praised him, saying: "Excellent! Excellent, Universal Worthy! You are able to protect and assist this sutra and bring peace, joy, and benefit to many sentient beings. You have completed inconceivable merits and a deep and great compassion. Since a long time ago, you have given rise to the mind for Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, and you are able to make this vow of supernatural power to protect this sutra. I will use my supernatural power to protect those who can uphold the name of Bodhisattva Universal Worthy."
"Universal Worthy, if a person receives, upholds, reads, recites, remembers properly, cultivates, and copies this Lotus Sutra, you should know that this person has seen Śākyamuni Buddha, has heard this scripture as if from the Buddha’s own mouth, has made offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha, is praised as excellent by the Buddha, has had his head touched by the Buddha's hand, and is covered by the Buddha's robe.
"Such a person is no longer attached to worldly pleasures, does not delight in heretical scriptures or writings, and does not delight in being close to such people or those who are evil—whether they are butchers, those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens, or dogs, hunters, or those who live by selling women’s beauty. This person’s heart and mind are simple and honest, he has right mindfulness, and he has the power of blessings. This person is not tormented by the three poisons, nor is he tormented by jealousy, arrogance, false pride, or overconfidence. This person has few desires and is content, and he is able to cultivate the conduct of Universal Worthy."
"Universal Worthy, if, after the Tathagata’s passing, in the latter five hundred years, there is a person who sees one who receives, upholds, reads, and recites the Lotus Sutra, he should think: 'This person will soon go to the place of enlightenment, break all the demon armies, attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, turn the Dharma wheel, beat the Dharma drum, blow the Dharma conch, and rain the Dharma rain. He will sit on the lion’s Dharma seat in the midst of the assembly of gods and humans.'"
"Universal Worthy, if, in a future age, a person receives and upholds this scripture, this person will no longer be attached to robes, bedding, food, or material possessions. His wishes will not be in vain, and he will receive his karmic reward in this very life. If there is a person who scorns him and says, 'You are a madman! Your practice is empty, and you will never gain anything,' the karmic retribution for this sin is that he will be without eyes in lifetime after lifetime. If there is one who makes offerings to and praises him, he will receive his present reward in this life. If another person sees one who upholds this sutra and points out their faults, whether they are real or not, this person will, in this life, suffer from white leprosy. If there is one who laughs at him, he will, in lifetime after lifetime, have gapped teeth, ugly lips, a flat nose, and crooked hands and feet. His eyes will be cross-eyed, and his body will be foul-smelling, with evil sores, pus, and blood, dropsy, and shortness of breath, and all kinds of severe evil sicknesses. For this reason, Universal Worthy, if you see one who upholds this scripture, you should go out to meet him from afar, and you should revere him as if he were the Buddha."
When this chapter on Universal Worthy’s encouragement was preached, countless and boundless Bodhisattvas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges attained the Dhāraṇī of a Hundred Thousand Million Whirlings. The Bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust motes of the three-thousand-great-thousand-fold world attained the path of Universal Worthy. When the Buddha finished preaching this sutra, Universal Worthy and all the Bodhisattvas, the śrāvakas such as Śāriputra, and all the gods, dragons, humans, and non-humans, and the entire great assembly were all filled with great joy. They received and upheld the Buddha’s words, bowed in reverence, and departed.
