Chapter Twenty: The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta: "You should now know: if bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, or upāsikās who uphold the Lotus Sutra are subjected to evil speech, reviling slander, they shall obtain great retribution for their offenses, as previously explained. The merit they obtain is as previously described—purity of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Mahāsthāmaprāpta, in the past, long ago, beyond immeasurable, boundless, inconceivable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, there was a Buddha named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Humans, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa was named離衰 (離衰), and the land was named Great Achievement. That Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Buddha, in that world, expounded the Dharma for devas, humans, and asuras. For those seeking the śrāvaka path, he expounded the Dharma according to the four noble truths, ferrying them across birth, old age, sickness, and death to the ultimate nirvāṇa. For those seeking to become pratyekabuddhas, he expounded the Dharma according to the twelve links of dependent origination. For the bodhisattvas, because of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, he expounded the Dharma according to the six pāramitās, leading to the ultimate attainment of Buddha-wisdom. Mahāsthāmaprāpta, the lifespan of this Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Buddha was forty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges' sands of kalpas. The True Dharma abided in the world for a number of kalpas equal to the dust-motes of one Jambudvīpa. The Semblance Dharma abided in the world for a number of kalpas equal to the dust-motes of the four continents. Having benefited beings, that Buddha then entered extinction. After the True Dharma and Semblance Dharma had completely disappeared, in that land another Buddha appeared, also named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Humans, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. Thus in succession there were twenty thousand koṭis of Buddhas, all sharing the same name."

"After the first Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata had entered extinction, when the True Dharma had disappeared, in the age of the Semblance Dharma, bhikṣus of overweening pride possessed great power. At that time there was a bodhisattva bhikṣu named Sadāparibhūta. Mahāsthāmaprāpta, for what reason was he named Sadāparibhūta? This bhikṣu, whenever he encountered anyone—whether bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, or upāsikās—would bow in reverence and praise them, speaking these words: 'I deeply revere you all and dare not treat you with disparagement. Why is this? You are all practicing the bodhisattva path and shall attain Buddhahood.' Yet this bhikṣu did not exclusively read or recite the scriptures; he only practiced bowing in reverence. Even when he saw the fourfold assembly from afar, he would also deliberately go and bow in reverence and praise them, speaking these words: 'I dare not disparage you, for you shall all attain Buddhahood.' Among the fourfold assembly there were those who gave rise to anger and impure minds. With evil speech they reviled him, saying: 'This ignorant bhikṣu—where does he come from? He says of himself, "I do not disparage you," yet he confers upon us the prophecy that we shall attain Buddhahood. We have no use for such false prophecies!' Thus for many years he was constantly reviled, yet he never gave rise to anger. He constantly spoke these words: 'You shall attain Buddhahood.' When he spoke these words, people would sometimes strike him with staffs, wood, tiles, or stones. Even while fleeing and taking refuge at a distance, he would still call out in a loud voice: 'I dare not disparage you, for you shall all attain Buddhahood.' Because he constantly spoke these words, the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās of overweening pride gave him the name Sadāparibhūta."

"When this bhikṣu was approaching the time of his death, he heard in the sky the twenty thousand myriads of koṭis of verses of the Lotus Sutra that Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Buddha had previously expounded. He was able to receive and uphold them all, and immediately obtained purity of the eye faculty, and purity of the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind faculties, as described above. Having obtained the purity of these six faculties, his lifespan was further extended by two hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of years, and he widely expounded this Lotus Sutra for others. At that time, the fourfold assembly of overweening pride—the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who had disparaged this person and given him the name 'Never Disparaging'—saw that he had obtained great spiritual penetration powers, the power of joyful eloquence, and the power of great virtuous quiescence. Hearing what he expounded, they all believed, submitted, and followed him. This bodhisattva also converted thousands of myriads of koṭis of beings, causing them to abide in anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. After his life ended, he encountered two thousand koṭis of Buddhas, all named Candrasūryapradīpa. In their Dharma he expounded this Lotus Sutra. Through this cause and condition, he again encountered two thousand koṭis of Buddhas, all sharing the name Meghasvararāja. Within the Dharma of these Buddhas he received, upheld, read, and recited, and for the fourfold assembly he expounded this sutra. Therefore he obtained the constant purity of the eye, and the purity of the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind faculties. Amid the fourfold assembly, when expounding the Dharma, his mind was without fear."

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, this Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Sadāparibhūta made offerings to such numbers of Buddhas, revering, honoring, and praising them, and planting wholesome roots. Afterward he again encountered thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas. Also within the Dharma of these Buddhas he expounded this sutra. Having perfected his merit, he was able to attain Buddhahood. Mahāsthāmaprāpta, what is your opinion? Could that Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta at that time have been anyone else? He was none other than myself. If in former lives I had not received, upheld, read, and recited this sutra, and expounded it for others, I would not have been able to quickly attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Because in the presence of former Buddhas I received, upheld, read, and recited this sutra and expounded it for others, I was able to quickly attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Mahāsthāmaprāpta, at that time the fourfold assembly—the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās—who with minds of anger disparaged me, for two hundred koṭis of kalpas constantly did not encounter a Buddha, did not hear the Dharma, and did not see the Saṅgha. For a thousand kalpas they suffered great anguish in the Avīci hell. Having exhausted this offense, they again encountered the Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta, who taught and converted them toward anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Mahāsthāmaprāpta, what is your opinion? Could those of the fourfold assembly who constantly disparaged this bodhisattva at that time have been anyone else? They are the five hundred bodhisattvas such as Bhadrapāla now in this assembly, the five hundred bhikṣus such as Lion Moon, and the five hundred upāsakas such as Thoughtful of the Buddha—all those who in regard to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi are non-retrogressing. Mahāsthāmaprāpta, you should know that this Lotus Sutra greatly benefits the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, enabling them to reach anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Therefore, the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, after the Tathāgata's extinction, should always receive, uphold, read, recite, explain, and write this sutra."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"In the past there was a Buddha
Named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja,
With spiritual wisdom immeasurable,
Leading and guiding all.

"Devas, humans, nāgas, and spirits
Together made offerings to him.
After this Buddha's extinction,
When the Dharma was about to end,

"There was a bodhisattva
Named Sadāparibhūta.
At that time the fourfold assembly
Were attached and clinging to the Dharma.

"The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging
Went to where they were
And addressed them, saying:
'I do not disparage you.

"'You are all practicing the Way—
You shall all attain Buddhahood.'
When the people heard this,
They slighted, reviled, and abused him.

"The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging
Was able to patiently endure it.
When his offenses were exhausted,
At the end of his life,

"He was able to hear this sutra.
His six faculties became pure.
Through the power of spiritual penetrations,
His lifespan was extended.

"Again for others
He widely expounded this sutra.
All those attached to Dharma
Received the bodhisattva's

"Teaching and conversion,
Causing them to abide in the Buddha-Way.
When Never Disparaging's life ended,
He encountered countless Buddhas.

"Because he expounded this sutra,
He obtained immeasurable blessings.
Gradually perfecting his merit,
He swiftly achieved the Buddha-Way.

"That Never Disparaging at that time
Was none other than myself.
The fourfold assembly at that time,
Those attached to Dharma—

"Hearing Never Disparaging's words,
'You shall all attain Buddhahood,'
Through this cause and condition,
Encountered countless Buddhas.

"The bodhisattvas in this assembly,
Five hundred in number,
And also the fourfold assembly—
Pure-believing men and women—

"Now in my presence
Listening to the Dharma—they are those people.
In former lives I
Exhorted these people

"To hear and receive this sutra,
The foremost Dharma.
Opening, revealing, and teaching people,
Causing them to abide in nirvāṇa,

"Life after life receiving and upholding
Such sutras as these.
Only after koṭis upon koṭis of myriads of kalpas,
Beyond all conceivability,

"Were they able to hear
This Lotus Sutra.
Only after koṭis upon koṭis of myriads of kalpas,
Beyond all conceivability,

"Do the Buddhas, World-Honored Ones,
Expound this sutra.
Therefore the practitioner,
After the Buddha's extinction,

"Hearing such a sutra,
Should not give rise to doubt.
They should single-mindedly
Widely expound this sutra—

"Life after life encountering Buddhas,
Swiftly achieving the Buddha-Way."
