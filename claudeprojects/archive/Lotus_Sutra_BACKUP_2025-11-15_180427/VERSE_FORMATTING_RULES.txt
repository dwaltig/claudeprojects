CRITICAL VERSE FORMATTING RULES
For dharma-audio-producer-enhanced Agent
================================================================================

USE THESE RULES FOR ALL VERSE/POETRY REFORMATTING
These rules ensure verses are optimized for RPD while maintaining pacing.

================================================================================
THE 4 RULES (FOLLOW EXACTLY)
================================================================================

RULE 1: IDENTIFY POETRY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Find all blocks of text that are:
  • Poems
  • Songs
  • Rhythmic verses
  • Text with multiple SHORT, INTENTIONAL line breaks

These are distinctly different from standard narrative paragraphs.

Example (POETRY - has short intentional line breaks):
  If you want to walk the Buddha-road,
  If you want to gain that natural wisdom-load,
  You better constantly make offerings, I'm telling you true,
  To those who receive and uphold this sutra, through and through.

Example (NOT POETRY - normal paragraph):
  At that time the World-Honored One speaks with a mighty voice. All the
  disciples gather to listen. The Buddha's words fill the assembly with joy.

RULE 2: COMBINE ALL LINES INTO ONE PARAGRAPH
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Once you identify poetry, combine EVERY LINE into ONE SINGLE PARAGRAPH.

NO EXCEPTIONS - Never leave verse lines separated.

Before:
  If you want to walk the Buddha-road,
  If you want to gain that natural wisdom-load,
  You better constantly make offerings, I'm telling you true,
  To those who receive and uphold this sutra, through and through.

After (single paragraph):
  If you want to walk the Buddha-road, if you want to gain that natural
  wisdom-load, you better constantly make offerings, I'm telling you true,
  to those who receive and uphold this sutra, through and through.

RULE 3: PRESERVE PACING WITH PUNCTUATION (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When combining lines, pay attention to how each line ENDS:

A. IF A LINE ENDS WITH PUNCTUATION:
   Keep the punctuation mark + add a space after it

   Original:
     Line 1: "If you want to walk the Buddha-road," ← comma
     Line 2: "If you want to gain that natural wisdom-load," ← comma
     Line 3: "You better constantly make offerings, I'm telling you true," ← comma
     Line 4: "To those who receive and uphold this sutra, through and through." ← period

   Combined (WITH punctuation preserved):
     "If you want to walk the Buddha-road, if you want to gain that
      natural wisdom-load, you better constantly make offerings, I'm
      telling you true, to those who receive and uphold this sutra,
      through and through."

   Notice: Each comma and period stays exactly where it was.

B. IF A LINE ENDS WITHOUT PUNCTUATION:
   Replace that line break with a COMMA and a SPACE (, )

   Original:
     Line 1: "If you want to quickly gain" ← NO punctuation
     Line 2: "All-wisdom, that's the highest plane," ← comma
     Line 3: "You should receive and hold this scripture tight," ← comma
     Line 4: "And honor those who hold it day and night." ← period

   Combined (with comma replacement for unpunctuated line):
     "If you want to quickly gain, all-wisdom, that's the highest plane,
      you should receive and hold this scripture tight, and honor those
      who hold it day and night."

   Notice: Line 1 had no punctuation, so we added a comma before "all-wisdom"

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Punctuation marks show where the verse naturally pauses or stops:
  • Comma = brief pause (reader takes a breath)
  • Period = stop (end of thought)
  • Question mark = question, emphasis
  • Semicolon = connected but separate thoughts

Preserving these marks ensures the verse maintains its natural rhythm and
breath points, even on a single line.

RULE 4: DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
All other text (standard paragraphs, explanatory notes, etc.) stays
exactly as-is. Only verses/poetry get the single-line treatment.

DON'T TOUCH:
  • Narrative prose paragraphs
  • Translation notes in parentheses
  • Scholarly apparatus
  • Pronunciation guides
  • Speaker attributions (other than formatting for single line)

ONLY TOUCH:
  • Verse/poetry blocks with multiple short lines

================================================================================
COMPLETE EXAMPLE - SHOWING ALL 4 RULES IN ACTION
================================================================================

ORIGINAL TEXT (with both narrative and poetry):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

At that time the World-Honored One, wanting to state this meaning again,
sings it out in verse:

If you want to walk the Buddha-road,
If you want to gain that natural wisdom-load,
You better constantly make offerings, I'm telling you true,
To those who receive and uphold this sutra, through and through.

If you want to quickly gain
All-wisdom, that's the highest plane,
You should receive and hold this scripture tight,
And honor those who hold it day and night.

[Note: Pron. "Buddha-road" = path of enlightenment]

STEP-BY-STEP APPLICATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RULE 1 - IDENTIFY POETRY:
  ✓ Narrative paragraph: "At that time..." (leave as-is)
  ✓ VERSE 1: 4 lines with intentional breaks (combine)
  ✓ VERSE 2: 4 lines with intentional breaks (combine)
  ✓ Note in brackets (leave as-is)

RULE 2 - COMBINE INTO ONE PARAGRAPH:
  Stanza 1 (4 lines) → becomes 1 line
  Stanza 2 (4 lines) → becomes 1 line

RULE 3 - PRESERVE PACING:
  Stanza 1:
    - Line 1 ends with comma (,) → keep comma + space
    - Line 2 ends with comma (,) → keep comma + space
    - Line 3 ends with comma (,) → keep comma + space
    - Line 4 ends with period (.) → keep period + space

  Stanza 2:
    - Line 1 ends with NO punctuation → ADD comma + space
    - Line 2 ends with comma (,) → keep comma + space
    - Line 3 ends with comma (,) → keep comma + space
    - Line 4 ends with period (.) → keep period + space

RULE 4 - KEEP EVERYTHING ELSE UNCHANGED:
  Narrative paragraph stays as-is
  Note stays as-is
  Only verses change

RESULT:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

At that time the World-Honored One, wanting to state this meaning again,
sings it out in verse:

If you want to walk the Buddha-road, if you want to gain that natural
wisdom-load, you better constantly make offerings, I'm telling you true,
to those who receive and uphold this sutra, through and through. If you
want to quickly gain, all-wisdom, that's the highest plane, you should
receive and hold this scripture tight, and honor those who hold it day
and night.

[Note: Pron. "Buddha-road" = path of enlightenment]

VERIFICATION:
✓ Narrative paragraph unchanged
✓ Two verse stanzas now single-line each
✓ All punctuation preserved (commas show pauses, period shows stop)
✓ Comma added where Line 5 had no punctuation (before "all-wisdom")
✓ Note unchanged
✓ All original words present
✓ Pacing maintained through punctuation

================================================================================
QUICK DECISION TREE
================================================================================

When you encounter text in a manuscript, ask:

                        Is this poetry/verse?

                    |                 |
              Combine all      Keep exactly
              lines into       as-is. Don't
              ONE single       change anything.

================================================================================
COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
================================================================================

MISTAKE 1: Leaving verse lines separated
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WRONG:
  [VERSE: "If you want to walk the Buddha-road,
           If you want to gain that natural wisdom-load,
           You better constantly make offerings, I'm telling you true,
           To those who receive and uphold this sutra, through and through."]

RIGHT:
  [VERSE: "If you want to walk the Buddha-road, if you want to gain that
           natural wisdom-load, you better constantly make offerings, I'm
           telling you true, to those who receive and uphold this sutra,
           through and through."]

FIX: Put everything on one line (or continuous paragraph).

MISTAKE 2: Removing punctuation between lines
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WRONG:
  "If you want to walk the Buddha-road if you want to gain that natural
   wisdom-load you better constantly make offerings I'm telling you true"

RIGHT:
  "If you want to walk the Buddha-road, if you want to gain that natural
   wisdom-load, you better constantly make offerings, I'm telling you true"

FIX: Preserve all commas, periods, semicolons, etc. from original lines.

MISTAKE 3: Adding punctuation where there was none
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WRONG:
  Original line 5: "If you want to quickly gain." ← WRONG (had no period)
  Changed to: [Keep period] ← Violates original

RIGHT:
  Original line 5: "If you want to quickly gain" ← NO punctuation
  Changed to: "If you want to quickly gain, all-wisdom..." ← Add comma

FIX: Only add commas where original line had NO punctuation. Don't invent
punctuation that wasn't there.

MISTAKE 4: Treating narrative prose as poetry
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WRONG:
  Original narrative: "At that time the World-Honored One speaks with
  a mighty voice. All the disciples listen closely."

  Treated as poetry and combined differently.

RIGHT:
  Recognize this is a standard paragraph → leave completely unchanged.

FIX: Only apply single-line reformatting to intentional verse/poetry with
multiple short, deliberate line breaks.

MISTAKE 5: Forgetting punctuation preservation
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WRONG:
  All punctuation removed: "If you want to walk the Buddha-road if you
  want to gain that natural wisdom-load you better constantly make
  offerings I'm telling you true"

RIGHT:
  All punctuation preserved: "If you want to walk the Buddha-road, if you
  want to gain that natural wisdom-load, you better constantly make
  offerings, I'm telling you true"

FIX: Punctuation IS part of the pacing. Keep every single mark.

================================================================================
FINAL CHECKLIST - BEFORE SUBMITTING FORMATTED VERSES
================================================================================

☐ Periods kept where lines originally ended with periods
☐ Question marks, semicolons, dashes preserved exactly
☐ Spaces added after each punctuation mark

PACING:
☐ Natural breath points clear through punctuation
☐ Verses read smoothly on a single line
☐ No missing or added punctuation

CONTENT:
☐ All original words present (no removals)
☐ All original words in original order (no reordering)
☐ Capitalization matches original (first word of each line lowercase when combined)

☐ Only verses modified

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

**RULE 1**: Identify poetry (short lines, verse structure)
**RULE 2**: Combine all lines into ONE paragraph
**RULE 3**: Preserve punctuation marks + add spaces/commas as needed
**RULE 4**: Leave everything else exactly as-is

Apply these rules consistently, and your verses will be optimized for
RPD efficiency while maintaining perfect pacing and meaning.
