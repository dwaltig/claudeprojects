CHAPTER FOURTEEN: PEACEFUL PRACTICES

At that time, Mañjuśrī, Dharma-Prince Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva, addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, these bodhisattvas are extremely rare, for out of reverence for the Buddha they have made great vows that in the future evil age they shall protect, read, and expound this Lotus Sutra. World-Honored One, how should bodhisattva-mahāsattvas be able to expound this sutra in the future evil age?" The Buddha told Mañjuśrī: "If bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in the future evil age wish to expound this sutra, they should abide in four dharmas. First, they should abide in the sphere of practice of bodhisattvas and the sphere of intimacy, and thus be able to expound this sutra for beings."

"Mañjuśrī, what is called the sphere of practice of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas? If bodhisattva-mahāsattvas abide on the ground of patient acceptance, are gentle, agreeable, and compliant, neither hasty nor violent, their minds also unperturbed; moreover, regarding dharmas they practice non-practice while contemplating all dharmas according to their true marks—also neither practicing nor discriminating—this is called the sphere of practice of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas."

"What is called the sphere of intimacy of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas? Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas do not intimately associate with kings, princes of royal blood, great ministers, or officials. They do not intimately associate with various non-Buddhist brahmins, nirgranthas, or those who compose worldly writings, compose poetry, or write in praise of external writings. Nor do they associate with Lokāyata or anti-Lokāyata thinkers. They also do not intimately associate with those engaged in violent sports, wrestling matches, nāṭya performances, or various illusory transformations and theatrical displays. They do not intimately associate with caṇḍālas or with those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens, or dogs, or who hunt, fish, or trap, or with any who practice evil livelihoods. Should such persons occasionally come, they shall expound the Dharma for them, seeking nothing in return. Moreover, they do not intimately associate with bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, or upāsikās who seek the śrāvaka path, nor do they inquire after them. Whether in private chambers, in walking meditation areas, or in lecture halls, they do not dwell together with them. Should such persons occasionally come, they expound the Dharma for them according to circumstances, seeking nothing in return."

"Mañjuśrī, moreover, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas should not, with regard to women's bodies, take the marks that can generate desire and expound the Dharma for them, nor should they delight in seeing them. If entering another's home, they should not converse with young girls, maidens, or widows. They also should not approach the five kinds of paṇḍakas to form close friendships. They should not enter another's home alone. If there are causes and conditions requiring them to enter alone, they should single-mindedly recollect the Buddha. When expounding the Dharma for women, they should not display their teeth in laughter or expose their chest. Even for the sake of the Dharma, they should not form close friendships, how much less for other matters. They should not delight in keeping young disciples, śrāmaṇeras, or small children, nor should they delight in sharing the same teacher. They should constantly delight in sitting in meditation, dwelling in secluded places and regulating their minds. Mañjuśrī, this is called the first sphere of intimacy."

"Furthermore, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas contemplate all dharmas as empty, according to their true mark—not inverted, not moving, not retreating, not revolving, like empty space, having the nature of non-existence. All verbal paths are cut off. Not born, not emerging, not arising. Without name, without mark, truly non-existent. Without measure, without boundary. Without obstruction, without hindrance. But only existing through causes and conditions, arising from inverted views—therefore we speak of them. Always delighting in contemplating the marks of dharmas in this way—this is called the second sphere of intimacy of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If there are bodhisattvas
In the future evil age
With minds free from fear
Who wish to expound this sutra,

"They should enter the sphere of practice
And the sphere of intimacy,
Always keeping far from kings
And princes of royal blood,

"Great ministers and officials,
Those engaged in violent sports,
Caṇḍālas,
And non-Buddhist brahmins.

"Nor should they intimately associate
With those of increased arrogance,
Those greedy for and attached to the Lesser Vehicle,
Scholars of the Three Baskets,

"Bhikṣus who violate the precepts,
Arhats in name only,
Bhikṣuṇīs
Who delight in jesting and laughter,

"Who are deeply attached to the five desires,
Who seek present extinction,
Or upāsikās—
From all these they should not draw near.

"If such persons
Come with good minds
To the bodhisattva's place
To hear the Buddha-Way,

"The bodhisattva then, with
Fearless mind,
Not harboring expectations,
Expounds the Dharma for them.

"Widows, maidens,
Or the various paṇḍakas—
From all these they should not draw near
To form close friendships.

"Nor should they approach
Butchers, executioners,
Hunters and fishermen,
Those who kill for profit,

"Who sell meat for their livelihood,
Who display and sell women—
From all such persons
They should not draw near.

"Violent wrestling,
Various kinds of amusements,
Prostitutes and others—
From all these they should completely avoid intimacy.

"They should not teach the Dharma
To women in solitary places.
When expounding the Dharma,
They should not engage in jesting and laughter.

"Entering villages to beg for food,
They should take along one bhikṣu.
If there is no bhikṣu available,
They should single-mindedly recollect the Buddha.

"These, then, are called
The sphere of practice and sphere of intimacy.
Through these two spheres,
They can expound peacefully and joyfully.

"Moreover, they do not practice
Superior, middling, or inferior dharmas,
Conditioned or unconditioned,
Real or unreal dharmas.

"Nor do they discriminate
Between male and female.
Not obtaining any dharmas,
Not knowing, not seeing—

"This, then, is called
The sphere of practice of bodhisattvas.
All dharmas
Are empty and non-existent,

"Without permanence or abiding,
Also without arising or perishing.
This is called what the wise
Intimately associate with.

"Inverted discrimination
That dharmas exist or do not exist,
Are real or not real,
Are born or not born—

"Dwelling in secluded places,
Regulating their minds,
Abiding motionless
Like Mount Sumeru,

"Contemplating all dharmas
As entirely non-existent,
Like empty space—
Without solidity,

"Not born, not emerging,
Not moving, not retreating,
Always abiding in the single mark—
This is called the sphere of intimacy.

"If there are bhikṣus
After my extinction
Who enter this sphere of practice
And sphere of intimacy,

"When they expound this sutra,
They shall have no timidity or weakness.
When bodhisattvas at times
Enter quiet chambers,

"With correct mindfulness
They contemplate dharmas according to their meaning.
Arising from meditative concentration,
They expound for various kings,

"Princes, ministers, and people,
Brahmins, and others,
Expounding and proclaiming
This sutra,

"Their minds peaceful and secure,
Without timidity or weakness.
Mañjuśrī,
This is called the bodhisattva

"Abiding in the first dharma,
Able in the future age
To expound the Lotus Sutra."

"Again, Mañjuśrī, after the Tathāgata's extinction, in the Dharma-ending age, those who wish to expound this sutra—whether proclaiming orally or reading the sutra—should not delight in speaking of people's or sutras' faults. They should also not slight or disparage other Dharma teachers. They should not speak of other people's good or bad qualities or faults. Regarding śrāvaka persons, they should also not call them by name to speak of their faults, nor should they call them by name to praise their virtues. Moreover, they should not generate resentful or disaffected minds. Through skillfully cultivating such a mind of peace and joy, those who listen shall not oppose their intentions. When questioned with difficulties, they should not answer with the Dharma of the Lesser Vehicle, but only explain with the Mahāyāna, enabling them to attain the wisdom of all modes."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Bodhisattvas always delight
In expounding the Dharma peacefully and securely.
On pure ground
They establish seats,

"Anoint their bodies with oil,
Bathe away dust and defilement,
Don fresh, clean robes—
Pure within and without.

"Peacefully taking their Dharma-seat,
They answer questions as asked.
If there are bhikṣus
And bhikṣuṇīs,

"Upāsakas
And upāsikās,
Kings, princes,
Ministers, officers, and people,

"With subtle and wondrous meaning,
They expound with pleasant countenance.
When questioned with difficulties,
They answer according to the meaning,

"Through causes, conditions, and parables,
Expounding and discriminating,
By these expedient means
Causing all to generate the aspiration,

"Gradually increasing and advancing,
Entering upon the Buddha-Way,
Removing thoughts of laziness
And slackness,

"Abandoning all sorrows and troubles,
Compassionately expounding the Dharma.
Day and night, constantly expounding
The teaching of the unsurpassed Way,

"Through various causes and conditions
And immeasurable parables,
They enlighten beings,
Causing all to rejoice.

"Concerning garments, bedding,
Food and medicine,
They harbor no expectations
Among these things,

"But single-mindedly recollect
The causes and conditions for expounding the Dharma,
Wishing to achieve the Buddha-Way
And cause others to be thus as well.

"This, then, is great benefit,
The offering of peace and joy.
After my extinction,
If there are bhikṣus

"Able to proclaim
This Lotus Sutra,
Their minds without jealousy, anger,
Or various troubling obstructions,

"Also without sorrows, troubles,
Or those who revile and curse,
Also without fear
Of swords, staves, or the like,

"Also without expulsion—
Abiding in patient acceptance.
The wise, in this way,
Skillfully regulate their minds,

"Able to abide peacefully and joyfully
As I have explained above.
The merit of such persons,
Throughout thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas,

"Through calculations or parables,
Cannot be exhaustively explained."

"Again, Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in the future final age, when the Dharma is about to perish, who receive, uphold, read, and recite this sutra should not harbor jealous, deceitful, or flattering minds. Nor should they slight or revile those who study the Buddha-Way or seek out their faults. Whether bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, or upāsikās—whether they seek to be śrāvakas, seek to be pratyekabuddhas, or seek the bodhisattva path—one should not trouble them or cause them doubt or regret, saying to such persons: 'You are far from the Way and shall never attain the wisdom of all modes. Why is this? Because you are lazy and lax persons, negligent regarding the Way.' Moreover, they should not engage in frivolous discussions about dharmas or disputes and contentions. They should generate thoughts of great compassion toward all beings, thoughts of compassionate fathers toward all Tathāgatas, and thoughts of great teachers toward all bodhisattvas. Regarding the great bodhisattvas of the ten directions, they should always deeply and reverently worship them. Toward all beings they should expound the Dharma equally. According to the Dharma, they do not speak much or little. Even to those who deeply love the Dharma, they should not speak excessively."

"Mañjuśrī, if bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in the future final age when the Dharma is about to perish achieve this third practice of peace and joy, when expounding this Dharma, none shall be able to trouble or disturb them. They shall gain good companions to read and recite this sutra together. They shall also gain great assemblies who come to listen and receive. Having listened, they can uphold. Having upheld, they can recite. Having recited, they can expound. Having expounded, they can write or cause others to write. They shall make offerings to the sutra scrolls, revering, honoring, and praising them."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If one wishes to expound this sutra,
One should abandon jealousy, anger, arrogance,
Flattery, deceit, and devious minds,
Constantly cultivating straightforward conduct.

"Not slighting or despising people,
Nor frivolously discussing the Dharma,
Not causing others doubt or regret,
Saying: 'You shall not attain Buddhahood.'

"When this Buddha-son expounds the Dharma,
He is always gentle and patient,
Compassionate toward all,
Not generating a mind of slackness.

"Toward the great bodhisattvas of the ten directions
Who practice the Way out of pity for multitudes,
He should generate a mind of reverence:
'These are my great teachers.'

"Toward the Buddhas, World-Honored Ones,
He generates thoughts of unsurpassed fathers.
Breaking the mind of arrogance,
He expounds the Dharma without obstruction.

"Such is this third dharma—
The wise should guard and protect it.
Single-mindedly practicing peacefully and joyfully,
He is revered by immeasurable multitudes."

"Again, Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in the future final age when the Dharma is about to perish, who uphold this Lotus Sutra, should generate minds of great compassion toward both householders and renunciants. Toward those who are not bodhisattvas, they should generate minds of great pity, thinking thus: 'Such persons have suffered great loss. For though the Tathāgata through expedient means expounds the Dharma according to circumstances, they do not hear, do not know, do not awaken, do not inquire, do not believe, and do not understand. Though such persons do not inquire about, believe in, or understand this sutra, when I attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, wherever they may be, through spiritual penetration powers and wisdom powers, I shall draw them in and cause them to abide in this Dharma.' Mañjuśrī, if bodhisattva-mahāsattvas after the Tathāgata's extinction achieve this fourth dharma, when expounding this Dharma they shall be without faults, constantly receiving offerings, reverence, honor, and praise from bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, kings, princes, great ministers, people, brahmins, and householders. The devas in empty space, for the sake of hearing the Dharma, shall also constantly attend upon them. Whether in villages, cities, or secluded forests, should anyone come wishing to raise difficult questions, the devas day and night, constantly for the sake of the Dharma, shall guard and protect them, enabling all who listen to rejoice. Why is this? Because this sutra is protected by the spiritual powers of all past, future, and present Buddhas. Mañjuśrī, in immeasurable lands, this Lotus Sutra cannot even be heard by name, how much less seen, received, upheld, or recited!"

"Mañjuśrī, suppose there were a powerful wheel-turning sage-king who wished to subdue various nations through his majestic authority, but the various petty kings do not obey his command. At that time, the wheel-turning king raises various troops and goes forth to punish them. When the king sees that his troops have fought with merit, he greatly rejoices and according to their merit bestows rewards—perhaps granting fields, houses, villages, cities, or garments and personal adornments, or various precious things—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, coral, amber, elephants, horses, carriages, servants, and people. Only the bright pearl in his topknot he does not give. Why is this? Only on the king's crown is this one pearl. Were he to give it, the king's retinue would surely be greatly astonished."

"Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata is also like this. Through the power of meditative concentration and wisdom, he has obtained the land of the Dharma and reigns over the triple realm. Yet the various Māra-kings are unwilling to submit. The Tathāgata's worthy and sage generals do battle with them. To those who have merit, his mind also rejoices. In the midst of the fourfold assembly, he expounds various sutras, causing their minds to rejoice, bestowing meditative concentration, liberation, the faculties and powers of the undefiled root, and the wealth of various dharmas. Moreover, he bestows the city of nirvāṇa, declaring that they attain extinction. He guides their minds, causing all to rejoice—yet he does not expound this Lotus Sutra for them."

"Mañjuśrī, just as the wheel-turning king, seeing his troops possessing great merit, his mind greatly rejoicing, finally gives this pearl that is difficult to believe in, which has long been in his topknot and which he does not casually give to people—and now gives it to them—the Tathāgata is also like this. In the triple realm, he is the great Dharma-king, teaching and converting all beings through the Dharma. Seeing the worthy and sage army doing battle with the five-aggregate demons, the affliction demons, and the death demon, achieving great merit and glory, destroying the three poisons, emerging from the triple realm, and breaking the nets of Māra—at this time, the Tathāgata also greatly rejoices. This Lotus Sutra can enable beings to reach the wisdom of all modes. It is greatly resented and difficult to believe in by all the world. Previously it had not been expounded—yet now he expounds it."

"Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the foremost teaching of all Tathāgatas. Among all teachings, it is the most profound. Bestowed at the very end, it is like that powerful king who long protected the bright pearl and now finally gives it. Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the secret treasury of all Buddhas and Tathāgatas. Among all sutras, it is supreme above all. Long protected throughout the night, it has not been rashly expounded. Only today do I give it to you and others, expounding it widely."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Always practicing patient acceptance,
Pitying all,
One is then able to proclaim
The sutra praised by the Buddha.

"In the future final age,
Those who uphold this sutra
Should generate compassion
Toward householders, renunciants, and non-bodhisattvas.

"These who do not hear
Or believe in this sutra
Suffer a great loss.

"When I attain the Buddha-Way,
Through various expedient means,
I shall expound this Dharma for them,
Causing them to abide within it.

"Suppose there were a powerful
Wheel-turning king
Who, when troops fight with merit,
Rewards various things—

"Elephants, horses, carriages,
Personal adornments,
And various fields, houses,
Villages, and cities,

"Or grants garments,
Various precious things,
Servants and wealth,
Joyfully bestowing them.

"If there are valiant and strong ones
Able to perform difficult deeds,
The king removes from his topknot
The bright pearl and bestows it on them.

"The Tathāgata is also thus—
The king of all dharmas,
Possessing great powers of patient acceptance
And the treasure-house of wisdom.

"With great compassion,
According to the Dharma, he transforms the world.
Seeing all people
Receiving various sufferings and troubles,

"Seeking liberation,
They do battle with the demons.
For the sake of these beings
He expounds various dharmas.

"With great expedient means
He expounds these sutras.
Once he knows that beings
Have obtained their strength,

"Finally, at the very end,
He expounds this Lotus Sutra,
Like the king who removes from his topknot
The bright pearl and gives it to them.

"This sutra is most honored,
Supreme among sutras.
I constantly guard and protect it,
Not rashly revealing it.

"Now is precisely the time
To expound it for you and others.
After my extinction,
Those who seek the Buddha-Way

"And wish to attain peace and security
In proclaiming this sutra
Should draw near
Such four dharmas as these.

"Readers of this sutra
Shall constantly be without sorrows or troubles,
Also without sicknesses or pains,
Their complexions fresh and fair.

"Not born into poverty,
Baseness, or ugliness,
Beings delight in seeing them,
As they would admire worthy sages.

"The various sons of devas
Shall serve as their attendants.
Swords and staves shall not strike them;
Poisons cannot harm them.

"If people speak evil words of abuse,
Their mouths shall close and seal.
They shall travel without fear,
Like the lion king.

"The brilliance of their wisdom
Shall be like the shining of the sun.
If in dreams,
They shall see only wondrous things:

"They shall see all Tathāgatas
Seated upon lion thrones,
Surrounded by assemblies of bhikṣus,
Expounding the Dharma.

"Also seeing dragons, spirits,
Asuras, and others,
Numerous as Ganges' sands,
Reverently pressing palms together.

"They shall see themselves
Expounding the Dharma for them.
Also seeing various Buddhas,
Their bodies the color of gold,

"Emitting immeasurable light,
Illuminating all,
With Brahma-voiced sounds
Proclaiming all dharmas.

"The Buddha, for the fourfold assembly,
Expounds the unsurpassed Dharma.
They see themselves in the midst,
Palms pressed together, praising the Buddha.

"Hearing the Dharma and rejoicing,
They make offerings.
They attain dhāraṇī
And realize irreversible wisdom.

"The Buddha, knowing their minds
Have deeply entered the Buddha-Way,
Immediately bestows upon them predictions
Of achieving perfect enlightenment:

"'Good man,
In a future age
You shall obtain immeasurable wisdom—
The great Way of the Buddha.

"'Your land shall be adorned and pure,
Vast, great, and incomparable.
There shall also be a fourfold assembly
With palms pressed together, listening to the Dharma.'

"They also see themselves
In mountain forests,
Cultivating wholesome dharmas,
Realizing all true marks,

"Deeply entering meditative concentration,
Beholding Buddhas of the ten directions."

"The Buddhas' bodies are golden-hued,
Adorned with a hundred marks of merit.
Hearing the Dharma and expounding it for others—
They constantly have such excellent dreams.

"They also dream of becoming kings,
Abandoning palaces, retinues,
And supremely wondrous sensual pleasures,
Proceeding to the place of the Way.

"Under the bodhi tree,
Taking their place upon the lion seat,
Seeking the Way for seven days,
They attain the wisdom of all Buddhas.

"Having achieved the unsurpassed Way,
They arise and turn the Dharma-wheel.
For the fourfold assembly expounding the Dharma
Throughout thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas,

"Expounding the undefiled, wondrous Dharma,
Saving immeasurable beings.
Thereafter they enter nirvāṇa,
Like smoke exhausted and lamps extinguished.

"If, in the future evil age,
One expounds this foremost Dharma,
Such persons shall gain great benefit—
The merit and virtue described above."
