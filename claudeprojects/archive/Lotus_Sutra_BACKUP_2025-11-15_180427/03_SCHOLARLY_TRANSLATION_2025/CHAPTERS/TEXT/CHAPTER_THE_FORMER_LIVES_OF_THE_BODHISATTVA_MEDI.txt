CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE: THE FORMER LIVES OF THE BODHISATTVA MEDICINE KING

At that time, the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, how does the Bodhisattva Medicine King travel throughout the sahā world? World-Honored One, this Bodhisattva Medicine King has undergone countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of difficult practices and ascetic disciplines. Excellent, World-Honored One! We pray that you will expound this matter briefly." All the devas, nāgas, spirits, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, beings human and nonhuman, as well as bodhisattvas who had come from other lands, and the assembly of śrāvakas present—all rejoiced to hear this.

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower: "In ages past, immeasurable Ganges sand kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Tathāgata, One Worthy of Offerings, One of Right and Universal Knowledge, One Perfect in Clarity and Conduct, Well Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. That Buddha had eight billion great bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and seventy-two Ganges sands of great śrāvaka disciples. The Buddha's lifespan was forty-two thousand kalpas, and the bodhisattvas' lifespans were equal to that. In that land there were no women, no hells, no hungry ghosts, no animals, no asuras, and none of the various difficulties. The ground was level as a palm, composed of lapis lazuli. Jeweled trees adorned it; jeweled canopies covered it from above; jeweled banners and streamers hung down; jeweled vessels and incense burners filled the entire realm. There were platforms of seven jewels—one tree, one platform—and each tree was the distance of an arrow's flight from its platform. Beneath all these jeweled trees sat bodhisattvas and śrāvakas. Upon each of the jeweled platforms, ten billion devas played celestial music, singing hymns to the Buddha as an offering."

"At that time, that Buddha expounded the Lotus Sutra for the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana, for the assembly of bodhisattvas, and for the śrāvaka disciples. This Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana delighted in practicing ascetic disciplines. Within the Dharma of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, he practiced vigorously, single-mindedly seeking buddhahood. After twelve thousand years had passed, he attained the samādhi of the manifestation of all physical forms. Having attained this samādhi, his heart was greatly joyful, and he immediately thought: 'My attainment of the samādhi of the manifestation of all physical forms has come entirely through the power of hearing the Lotus Sutra. I must now make offerings to Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha and to the Lotus Sutra.' He then entered into this samādhi, and in the空中, he caused mandārava flowers and mahā-mandārava flowers to rain down, along with finely powdered solid black sandalwood, filling the空 and descending like clouds. Moreover, he caused sandalwood from the shores of the sea to rain down—this incense, worth six śu, had the value of an entire sahā world—all as an offering to the Buddha."

"After making this offering, he arose from samādhi and thought to himself: 'Though I have made offerings to the Buddha through supernatural powers, this does not compare to making an offering with my body.' He then ingested various fragrances—sandalwood, frankincense, turushka, pṛkkā, aloeswood, and resin incense—and drank the fragrant oils of campaka and other flowers. After twelve hundred years had passed, he anointed his body with fragrant oils, and in the presence of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, wrapped himself in celestial jeweled garments, poured fragrant oils over himself, and through the power of his supernatural vows, set his own body aflame. The radiance illuminated eighty koṭis of Ganges sand worlds. Within those worlds, all the buddhas simultaneously praised him, saying: 'Excellent, excellent, good man! This is true vigor; this is called the true Dharma offering to the Tathāgata. Though one may make offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, burning incense, powdered incense, paste incense, celestial silks, banners, canopies, and sandalwood from the shores of the sea—all such various things as offerings—none can equal this. Even should one give in charity one's kingdom, cities, wife, and children, still it cannot compare. Good man, this is called the foremost gift, the most honored and supreme among all gifts, for it is a Dharma offering to all the tathāgatas.' Having spoken thus, each fell silent. His body burned with flames for twelve hundred years. After that time had passed, his body was completely consumed. After the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana had made this Dharma offering, his life ended, and he was reborn in the land of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, spontaneously appearing in the household of King Pure Virtue, seated in full lotus posture, suddenly manifesting by transformation. Immediately he spoke a verse for his father:

Great king, you should know this now:
While I practiced walking there,
I straightaway attained the samādhi
Of manifesting all physical forms.

I practiced great vigorous effort,
Abandoned my beloved body,
Made offering to the World-Honored One,
Seeking the supreme wisdom.

"After speaking this verse, he addressed his father: 'Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha still abides in the world at present. Previously, after making offerings to that Buddha, I obtained the dhāraṇī of understanding the languages of all living beings. Moreover, I have heard this Lotus Sutra—eight hundred thousand myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kiṃkaras, viṃvaras, and aupāśas of verses. Great king, I must now return to make offerings to that Buddha.' Having spoken thus, he sat upon a platform of seven jewels, ascended into the空中 to a height of seven tāla trees, went to where the Buddha was, bowed his head to the Buddha's feet, joined his ten fingernails together, and praised the Buddha in verse:

Your countenance is most wondrous and sublime,
Your radiance illuminates the ten directions;
I but recently made offerings to you,
And now I have returned to behold you again.

"At that time, the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana, having spoken this verse, addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the World-Honored One still abides in the world.' Then Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana: 'Good man, the time of my nirvāṇa has arrived; the time of extinction is at hand. You may arrange the bed and seat; tonight I shall enter nirvāṇa.' He further commanded the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana: 'Good man, I entrust to you the Buddha Dharma, as well as all the bodhisattvas and great disciples, together with the Dharma of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. I also entrust to you the great trichiliocosm of seven-jeweled worlds, the jeweled trees, jeweled platforms, and the devas in attendance. After my extinction, my śarīra relics I also entrust to you. You must cause them to be distributed and widely venerated. You should erect many thousands of stūpas.' Having thus commanded the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana, Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha entered nirvāṇa in the latter part of that night."

"At that time, the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana, seeing the Buddha's extinction, felt grief, anguish, and longing for the Buddha. He then used sandalwood from the shores of the sea as fuel for the pyre, made offerings to the Buddha's body, and cremated it. After the fire had died out, he gathered the śarīra relics, made eighty-four thousand jeweled vessels, and erected eighty-four thousand stūpas as tall as three worlds, adorned with towering banners and canopies, and hung with numerous jeweled bells."

"At that time, the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana again thought to himself: 'Though I have made these offerings, my heart is still not satisfied. I must now make further offerings to the śarīra relics.' He then addressed the bodhisattvas, great disciples, as well as the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, and the entire great assembly: 'You should all concentrate your minds. I shall now make offerings to the śarīra relics of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha.' Having spoken thus, he immediately burned his arms adorned with a hundred merits before the eighty-four thousand stūpas for seventy-two thousand years as an offering. This caused innumerable persons seeking the śrāvaka path and immeasurable asaṃkhyeyas of people to generate the mind of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, and all were enabled to abide in the samādhi of the manifestation of all physical forms."

"At that time, the bodhisattvas, devas, humans, asuras, and others, seeing him without arms, became distressed, sorrowful, and grieving, and spoke thus: 'This Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana is our teacher, the one who instructs us, yet now he has burned his arms and his body is incomplete.' At that moment, the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana made this vow before the great assembly: 'Having sacrificed both my arms, I shall certainly attain the Buddha's golden-hued body. If this is truly not false, may my two arms be restored as before.' Having made this vow, they were naturally restored, due to the pure and deep merit, virtue, and wisdom of that bodhisattva. At that time, the great trichiliocosm quaked in six ways, and heaven rained jeweled flowers. All humans and devas experienced what they had never experienced before."

The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower: "What is your opinion? Was the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana some other person? He is none other than the present Bodhisattva Medicine King. The number of times he has sacrificed his body in charity is thus immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas. Constellation King Flower, if there are those who have generated the aspiration to attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi and are able to burn a finger or even a single toe as an offering to a buddha stūpa, this surpasses offering one's kingdom, cities, wife, and children, as well as all the mountains, forests, rivers, ponds, and precious treasures of the great trichiliocosm. Moreover, if someone fills the great trichiliocosm with the seven jewels and makes offerings to the Buddha, to the great bodhisattvas, to the pratyekabuddhas, and to the arhats, the merit that person obtains does not compare to accepting and upholding this Lotus Sutra, even a single four-line verse of it; that merit is greatest of all."

"Constellation King Flower, just as among all streams, rivers, and waters, the ocean is foremost, so too is this Lotus Sutra the most profound and great among all the sutras expounded by the tathāgatas. Just as among all mountains—earth mountains, black mountains, the small Iron Ring Mountains, the great Iron Ring Mountains, and the ten jeweled mountains—Mount Sumeru is foremost, so too is this Lotus Sutra supreme among all sutras. Just as among all the stars, the moon deity is foremost, so too is this Lotus Sutra the most illuminating among thousands of myriads of koṭis of kinds of sutra dharmas. Just as the sun deity can dispel all darkness, so too can this sutra destroy all darkness of unwholesomeness. Just as among all lesser kings, the wheel-turning sage king is foremost, so too is this sutra the most honored among all sutras. Just as Śakra is king among the thirty-three devas, so too is this sutra king among all sutras. Just as the great Brahmā king is father of all living beings, so too is this sutra father of all worthies and sages, learners and non-learners, and those who have generated the bodhisattva mind. Just as among all ordinary persons, the stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, arhat, and pratyekabuddha are foremost, so too is this sutra foremost among all sutras expounded by tathāgatas, bodhisattvas, or śrāvakas. One who is able to accept and uphold this scripture is likewise foremost among all living beings. Among all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, the bodhisattva is foremost; so too is this sutra foremost among all sutra dharmas. Just as the Buddha is king of all dharmas, so too is this sutra king among all sutras."

"Constellation King Flower, this sutra can save all living beings; this sutra can enable all living beings to separate from all sufferings and distress; this sutra can greatly benefit all living beings and fulfill their wishes. Like a cool pond that can satisfy all who are thirsty and parched; like one who is cold obtaining fire; like one who is naked obtaining clothing; like a merchant obtaining a leader; like a child obtaining its mother; like one who would cross over obtaining a boat; like one who is ill obtaining a physician; like one in darkness obtaining a lamp; like one who is poor obtaining treasure; like the people obtaining a king; like a merchant obtaining the sea; like a torch dispelling darkness—so too is this Lotus Sutra able to enable living beings to separate from all suffering and all illness, able to release all the bonds of birth and death. If a person hears this Lotus Sutra and either copies it himself or causes others to copy it, the merit obtained—even were one to measure it with the Buddha's wisdom—could not reach its limit. If one copies this sutra and makes offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, burning incense, powdered incense, paste incense, banners, canopies, garments, and various kinds of lamps—ghee lamps, oil lamps, lamps of various fragrant oils, campaka oil lamps, sumanas oil lamps, pāṭala oil lamps, vārṣika oil lamps, and navamallikā oil lamps—the merit obtained is likewise immeasurable."

"Constellation King Flower, if anyone hears this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King, that person also obtains immeasurable and boundless merit. If any woman hears this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King and is able to accept and uphold it, this shall be the end of her female body, and she shall not receive it again. If, after the extinction of the Tathāgata, in the latter five hundred years, any woman hears this scripture and practices according to its teachings, when her life ends she shall immediately proceed to the Land of Peace and Bliss, where Amitābha Buddha and the assembly of great bodhisattvas dwell, and be born within a lotus flower upon a jeweled throne. She shall no longer be tormented by desire, nor shall she be tormented by anger or delusion, nor shall she be tormented by arrogance, jealousy, or other defilements. She shall obtain the bodhisattva's supernatural powers and the tolerance of the non-arising of dharmas. Having obtained this tolerance, her eye faculty shall become pure. With this pure eye faculty, she shall see seven million two hundred thousand koṭis of nayutas of Ganges sand tathāgatas. At that time, those buddhas shall praise her from afar, saying: 'Excellent, excellent, good man! You have been able to accept, uphold, read, recite, and contemplate this sutra within the Dharma of Śākyamuni Buddha, and expound it for others. The merit you have obtained is immeasurable and boundless. Fire cannot burn it; water cannot sweep it away. Your merit is such that even a thousand buddhas speaking together could not exhaust it. You have now been able to destroy all demonic adversaries and to demolish the army of birth and death; all other enemies have been entirely vanquished. Good man, hundreds of thousands of buddhas, by their supernatural powers, protect you together. Among all in the worlds of devas and humans, there is none like you, except only the Tathāgata. As for the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and even bodhisattvas, in wisdom and meditative concentration, none are equal to you.' Constellation King Flower, this bodhisattva achieves such power of merit, virtue, and wisdom."

"If anyone hears this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King and is able to rejoice and praise it, in the present world that person's mouth shall constantly emit the fragrance of blue lotus flowers, and from the pores of that person's body shall constantly issue the fragrance of ox-head sandalwood. The merit obtained is as described above. Therefore, Constellation King Flower, I entrust this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King to you. After my extinction, in the latter five hundred years, widely proclaim and propagate it throughout Jambudvīpa. Do not allow it to be cut off, lest evil demons, demonic people, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, kumbhāṇḍas, and others gain advantage."

"Constellation King Flower, you must use your supernatural powers to protect this sutra. Why is this so? This sutra is the excellent medicine for the illnesses of the people of Jambudvīpa. If a person is ill and hears this sutra, the illness shall immediately be eliminated, and that person shall not grow old or die. Constellation King Flower, if you see someone who accepts and upholds this sutra, you should take blue lotus flowers filled with powdered incense and scatter them over that person. After scattering them, think thus: 'Before long, this person shall certainly take up grass, sit upon the place of enlightenment, defeat the demonic armies, sound the Dharma conch, strike the great Dharma drum, and ferry all living beings across the sea of old age, sickness, and death.' Therefore, those who seek the Buddha path, upon seeing a person who accepts and upholds this scripture, should thus generate a mind of reverence."

When this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King was expounded, eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas obtained the dhāraṇī of understanding the languages of all living beings. The Tathāgata Many Jewels, from within the jeweled stūpa, praised the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower, saying: "Excellent, excellent, Constellation King Flower! You have achieved inconceivable merit and virtue in being able to question Śākyamuni Buddha about such matters, thereby benefiting immeasurable multitudes of living beings."
