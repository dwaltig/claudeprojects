CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR: THE BODHISATTVA WONDERFUL SOUND

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha emitted great light from the mark of the fleshy protuberance upon his head, one of the thirty-two major characteristics, and also emitted light from the white tuft between his eyebrows, illuminating throughout the eastern direction one hundred eighty myriads of koṭīs of nayutas of Ganges' sands of buddha-worlds. Beyond this number, there was a world named Pure Light Adorned. In that land there was a buddha named Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Thus Come One, Worthy of Offerings, One of Right and Universal Knowledge, One Perfected in Clarity and Conduct, Well Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Heavenly and Human Beings, Buddha, World-Honored One, who was expounding the Dharma, reverently surrounded by immeasurable and boundless assemblies of bodhisattvas and great multitudes. The white tuft light of Śākyamuni Buddha illuminated throughout that land.

At that time, in the land of Pure Light Adorned, there was a bodhisattva named Wonderful Sound who had long since planted the roots of manifold virtue, made offerings to and drawn near to immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭīs of buddhas, and had fully perfected exceedingly profound wisdom. He had attained the Wonderful Banner Characteristic Samādhi, the Dharma Flower Samādhi, the Pure Virtue Samādhi, the Constellation King Sport Samādhi, the Samādhi Without Conditions, the Wisdom Seal Samādhi, the Samādhi of Understanding All Sentient Beings' Languages, the Samādhi of Assembling All Merit, the Pure Samādhi, the Samādhi of Supernatural Powers' Sport, the Wisdom Torch Samādhi, the King of Adornment Samādhi, the Pure Light Samādhi, the Pure Treasury Samādhi, the Unshared Samādhi, the Sun Rotation Samādhi—he had attained such great samādhis as these, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭīs of Ganges' sands in number. When the light of Śākyamuni Buddha illuminated his body, he forthwith addressed Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I should go to the Sahā world to pay reverence, draw near, and make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha, and also to see Mañjuśrī, Dharma Prince and Son of the Dharma King, the Bodhisattva Medicine King, the Bodhisattva Brave Donation, the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower, the Bodhisattva Superior Conduct and Intent, the Bodhisattva King of Adornment, and the Bodhisattva Superior Medicine."

At that time, Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha spoke to the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound: "You must not slight that land or give rise to thoughts of inferiority. Good man, that Sahā world is uneven and irregular, with earth, stones, and various mountains; it is filled with filth and evil. The Buddha's body is diminutive, and the assembly of bodhisattvas likewise has small forms. Yet your body measures forty-two thousand yojanas in height, while my body measures six million eight hundred thousand yojanas. Your body is supremely handsome, having hundreds of thousands of myriads of blessings, and your radiance is especially wondrous. Therefore, when you go there, you must not slight that land—whether buddha, bodhisattvas, or the land itself—do not give rise to thoughts of inferiority." The Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound addressed his buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, that I now go to the Sahā world is entirely due to the Thus Come One's power, the Thus Come One's supernatural powers' sport, and the Thus Come One's merit, wisdom, and adornment." Thereupon, the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound, without rising from his seat and without his body stirring, entered into samādhi. Through the power of samādhi, at Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain, not far from the Dharma seat, he magically created eighty-four thousand jeweled lotus flowers with stems of Jambūnada gold, leaves of silver, pistils of diamond, and platforms of mahāmaṇi-ratna jewels.

At that time, Mañjuśrī, Dharma Prince and Son of the Dharma King, seeing these lotus flowers, addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, what causes and conditions have brought about this auspicious portent? There are several thousands of myriads of lotus flowers with stems of Jambūnada gold, leaves of silver, pistils of diamond, and platforms of mahāmaṇi-ratna jewels." At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha told Mañjuśrī: "It is the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound who, together with eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas surrounding him, desires to come from the land of Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha to this Sahā world to make offerings, draw near, and pay reverence to me, and also desires to make offerings and hear the Dharma Flower Sutra."

Mañjuśrī addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, what good roots has this bodhisattva planted? What merit has he cultivated to possess such great supernatural powers? What samādhi does he practice? I pray that you will expound for us the name of this samādhi. We also wish to diligently cultivate and practice it. Practicing this samādhi, we shall be able to see this bodhisattva's physical characteristics, his size, his majestic deportment, and his comings and goings. I only pray that the World-Honored One, through supernatural powers, will cause that bodhisattva to come so that we may see him." At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha told Mañjuśrī: "This Tathāgata Many Jewels, who long ago entered extinction, shall manifest his form for you."

At that time, Many Jewels Buddha spoke to that bodhisattva: "Good man, come. Mañjuśrī, Dharma Prince and Son of the Dharma King, desires to see your body." Thereupon, the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound vanished from that land and, together with eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas, set forth to come here. In all the lands through which they passed, there were the six kinds of earthquakes, and jeweled lotus flowers of the seven treasures rained down everywhere; hundreds of thousands of heavenly musical instruments sounded without being struck. The eyes of this bodhisattva were like broad and great blue lotus petals; even if one were to combine the faces of hundreds of thousands of myriads of moons, his countenance was still more handsome than these. His body was the color of true gold, adorned with immeasurable hundreds of thousands of meritorious attributes. His威德 was blazing with intensity, his radiance illuminating all around. He possessed all the bodily characteristics perfectly, like Nārāyaṇa's firm and solid body. He entered a platform of the seven jewels and ascended into the sky to a height of seven tāla trees. Surrounded reverently by the assembly of bodhisattvas, he came to this Sahā world, to Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain.

Having arrived, he descended from the platform of the seven jewels, took a necklace worth hundreds of thousands, brought it before Śākyamuni Buddha, touched his head to the Buddha's feet in reverence, presented the necklace as an offering, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha inquires of the World-Honored One: Are you free from illness and affliction? Are your daily activities light and comfortable? Are you dwelling in peace and happiness? Are the four elements in harmony? Are worldly matters bearable? Are sentient beings easy to save? Do they not have excessive greed, hatred, delusion, jealousy, and arrogant pride? Do they not show disrespect to father and mother or fail to honor śramaṇas? Do they not hold wrong views, unwholesome thoughts, or fail to control the five sense faculties? World-Honored One, are sentient beings able to subdue the enmity of all māras? Has the Tathāgata Many Jewels, who long ago entered extinction, come in his seven-jeweled stūpa to hear the Dharma? He also inquires of the Tathāgata Many Jewels: Is he dwelling peacefully with few afflictions? Can he patiently endure to abide for long? World-Honored One, I now wish to see the body of Many Jewels Buddha. I only pray that the World-Honored One will show him to me so that I may see him."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha spoke to Many Jewels Buddha: "This Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound desires to see you." At that time, Many Jewels Buddha told Wonderful Sound: "Excellent, excellent! You have been able to come here for the sake of making offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha, hearing the Dharma Flower Sutra, and seeing Mañjuśrī and others."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, what good roots has this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound planted? What merit has he cultivated to possess such supernatural powers?" The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue: "In the past there was a buddha named Cloud Thunder Sound King Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-Saṃbuddha. His land was named Manifesting All Worlds. The kalpa was named Joyfully Seen. The Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound, for twelve thousand years, used one hundred thousand kinds of musical performances to make offerings to Cloud Thunder Sound King Buddha, and also presented eighty-four thousand bowls of the seven jewels. As a consequence of these causes and conditions and their karmic rewards, he was now born in the land of Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha and possesses these supernatural powers. Flower Virtue, what do you think? Was the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound who, at that time in the presence of Cloud Thunder Sound King Buddha, made offerings with musical performances and presented jeweled vessels anyone else? It is this present Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound. Flower Virtue, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound has already made offerings to and drawn near to immeasurable buddhas, long ago planted the roots of virtue, and has also encountered hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭīs of nayutas of buddhas equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River."

"Flower Virtue, you merely see the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound with his body present here, yet this bodhisattva manifests various bodies everywhere, expounding this sutra for assemblies of sentient beings. Sometimes he manifests the body of King Brahmā, sometimes the body of Śakra, sometimes the body of the Īśvara deity, sometimes the body of Maheśvara deity, sometimes the body of a great heavenly general, sometimes the body of Vaiśravaṇa Heavenly King, sometimes the body of a wheel-turning sage king, sometimes the bodies of lesser kings, sometimes the body of an elder, sometimes the body of a householder, sometimes the body of a government minister, sometimes the body of a brāhmaṇa, sometimes the bodies of a bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī, upāsaka, or upāsikā, sometimes the body of the wife of an elder or householder, sometimes the body of the wife of a government minister, sometimes the body of the wife of a brāhmaṇa, sometimes the bodies of boys or girls, sometimes the bodies of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and so forth, and expounds this sutra. All those in hells, among hungry ghosts, among animals, and in places of difficulty—he is able to rescue them all. Even in the inner palaces of kings, he transforms into a woman's body and expounds this sutra."

"Flower Virtue, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound is able to rescue and protect the sentient beings of the Sahā world. This Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound manifests transformations of various bodies in this manner throughout the Sahā land, expounding this sutra for assemblies of sentient beings, yet his supernatural powers, transformations, and wisdom suffer no diminishment whatsoever. Through his various kinds of wisdom, this bodhisattva illuminates the Sahā world, causing all sentient beings each to attain what they need to know. And in the worlds throughout the ten directions, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, he likewise does the same. If one should be saved by the form of a śrāvaka, he manifests a śrāvaka's form and expounds the Dharma for them. If one should be saved by the form of a pratyekabuddha, he manifests a pratyekabuddha's form and expounds the Dharma for them. If one should be saved by the form of a bodhisattva, he manifests a bodhisattva's form and expounds the Dharma for them. If one should be saved by the form of a buddha, he immediately manifests a buddha's form and expounds the Dharma for them. In this manner, he variously manifests whatever form is appropriate for saving beings. Even for those who should be saved through extinction, he demonstrates extinction. Flower Virtue, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound has accomplished the power of great supernatural penetrations and wisdom. His deeds are such as these."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound has deeply planted good roots. World-Honored One, in what samādhi does this bodhisattva dwell such that he is able to manifest transformations everywhere in this manner and save sentient beings?" The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue: "Good man, that samādhi is named the Manifestation of All Physical Bodies. The Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound, dwelling in this samādhi, is able to benefit immeasurable multitudes of sentient beings in this manner." When this chapter on the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound was expounded, the eighty-four thousand persons who had come together with the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound all attained the Samādhi of Manifesting All Physical Bodies. The immeasurable bodhisattvas in this Sahā world also attained this samādhi and the dhāraṇīs.

At that time, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound, having made offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha and the stūpa of Many Jewels Buddha, returned to his original land. In all the lands through which he passed, there were the six kinds of earthquakes, jeweled lotus flowers rained down, and hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭīs of varieties of musical performances were played. Upon arriving at his original land, together with the eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas surrounding him, he went before Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I went to the Sahā world and benefited sentient beings. I saw Śākyamuni Buddha and saw the stūpa of Many Jewels Buddha, paid reverence and made offerings. I also saw Mañjuśrī, Dharma Prince and Son of the Dharma King, as well as the Bodhisattva Medicine King, the Bodhisattva Attained Through Diligent Vigorous Effort, the Bodhisattva Brave Donation, and others. I also caused these eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas to attain the Samādhi of Manifesting All Physical Bodies." When this chapter on the comings and goings of the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound was expounded, forty-two thousand sons of heaven attained the Patience of the Non-Arising of Dharmas, and the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue attained the Dharma Flower Samādhi.
