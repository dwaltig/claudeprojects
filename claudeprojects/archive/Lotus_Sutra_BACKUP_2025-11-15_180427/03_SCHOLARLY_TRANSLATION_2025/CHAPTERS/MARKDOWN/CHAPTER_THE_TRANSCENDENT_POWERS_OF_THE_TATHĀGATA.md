CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE: THE TRANSCENDENT POWERS OF THE TATHĀGATA


At that time, the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas equal in number to the dust particles of a thousand worlds, who had emerged from the earth, all with single-minded concentration joined their palms before the Buddha, gazed reverently upon his countenance, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, after the Buddha's extinction, in all the lands where the World-Honored One's emanation bodies are present, and in the places where he enters into parinirvāṇa, we shall extensively expound this sutra. For what reason? Because we ourselves also wish to obtain this true, pure, and great Dharma, to receive and maintain it, to read and recite it, to expound and explain it, to copy it in writing, and to make offerings to it."

At that time, the World-Honored One, in the presence of Mañjuśrī and the countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas who had long dwelt in the sahā world, as well as the assembly of bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, human and nonhuman beings, and all others, manifested great transcendent powers. He extended his broad and long tongue upward to the Brahma world, and from all his pores emitted countless, immeasurable beams of colored light, which universally illuminated the worlds in all ten directions. The buddhas seated upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees also did likewise, extending their broad and long tongues and emitting immeasurable light. When Śākyamuni Buddha and the buddhas beneath the jeweled trees were manifesting these transcendent powers, a full one hundred thousand years passed. Thereafter, they withdrew their tongues. At the same moment, they cleared their throats and snapped their fingers together. These two sounds reached throughout the buddha-worlds of the ten directions, and the earth in all of them quaked and trembled in six ways. The beings therein—devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, human and nonhuman beings, and others—by virtue of the Buddha's transcendent power, all beheld this sahā world with its immeasurable, limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of buddhas seated upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees, and also beheld Śākyamuni Buddha together with the Tathāgata Many Jewels, both seated upon the lion throne within the jeweled stūpa. Moreover, they beheld the immeasurable, limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and the fourfold assembly reverently surrounding Śākyamuni Buddha. Having beheld all this, they experienced great joy and obtained that which they had never before attained.

At that very moment, the devas in the air proclaimed aloud: "Beyond these immeasurable, limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of asaṃkhyeya worlds, there is a land called Sahā, wherein dwells a buddha named Śākyamuni. Now, for the sake of the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, he expounds the Great Vehicle sutra called the Lotus Blossom of the Sublime Dharma, the Dharma for Teaching Bodhisattvas, the Dharma Cherished and Protected by the Buddhas. You should all rejoice deeply in this, and should also pay reverence and make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha." When those beings heard this voice in the air, they joined their palms toward the sahā world and spoke thus: "Homage to Śākyamuni Buddha! Homage to Śākyamuni Buddha!" With various flowers, incense, necklaces, banners, canopies, and personal adornments, as well as precious and wondrous objects, they all scattered these remotely toward the sahā world. The scattered objects came from the ten directions, gathering like clouds, and were transformed into a jeweled canopy that universally covered all the buddhas assembled there. At that time, the worlds of the ten directions became perfectly penetrable without obstruction, as though they were a single buddha-land.

At that time, the Buddha addressed the great assembly of bodhisattvas led by Superior Conduct and the others: "The transcendent powers of the buddhas are thus immeasurable, limitless, and inconceivable. If I were to employ these transcendent powers to expound the merits and virtues of this sutra for the sake of entrusting it to you, doing so for immeasurable, limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, I still could not exhaust them. To speak concisely: all the dharmas possessed by the Tathāgata, all the sovereign transcendent powers of the Tathāgata, all the storehouse of profound essentials of the Tathāgata, all the most profound matters of the Tathāgata—all are proclaimed, revealed, and expounded in this sutra. Therefore, after the Tathāgata's extinction, you should all single-mindedly receive and maintain it, read and recite it, expound and explain it, copy it in writing, and practice according to the teachings. In whatever land there are those who receive and maintain it, read and recite it, expound and explain it, copy it in writing, and practice according to the teachings; wherever the sutra scrolls are present—whether in a garden, in a forest, beneath a tree, in a monastery, in a layman's dwelling, in a palace hall, or in mountain valleys and wilderness—in all such places, a stūpa should be erected and offerings made. For what reason? You should know that such places are the site of enlightenment, where all buddhas attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, where all buddhas turn the wheel of the Dharma, and where all buddhas enter into parinirvāṇa."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

The buddhas, saviors of the world,
Abiding in great transcendent powers,
To bring joy to all living beings,
Manifest immeasurable divine powers.

Their tongues reach to the Brahma heavens,
Their bodies emit countless rays of light;
For those who seek the Buddha's path,
They manifest these rare occurrences.

The sound of the buddhas clearing their throats
And the sound of their snapping fingers
Are heard throughout the lands of the ten directions,
And the earth everywhere quakes in six ways.

Because after the Buddha's extinction
There will be those able to maintain this sutra,
All the buddhas rejoice
And manifest immeasurable transcendent powers.

In entrusting this sutra to others,
And in praising those who receive and maintain it,
Even throughout immeasurable kalpas,
They still could not exhaust such praise.

The merits and virtues of such persons
Are boundless and without limit,
Like the void in the ten directions—
One cannot find their boundaries.

Those able to maintain this sutra
Are regarded as having already beheld me,
As well as the Buddha Many Jewels
And all the emanation buddhas.

They are also regarded as beholding me now
Teaching and transforming the bodhisattvas.
Those able to maintain this sutra
Cause me and the emanation buddhas,

As well as the extinct Buddha Many Jewels,
All to rejoice.
The buddhas presently dwelling in the ten directions,
And those of the past and future as well,

They shall also behold and make offerings to them,
And also cause them to rejoice.
The secret and essential Dharma
That the buddhas obtained while seated at the place of enlightenment—

Those able to maintain this sutra
Before long shall also obtain it.
Those able to maintain this sutra,
Regarding the meaning of all dharmas,

Names, words, and phrases,
Shall delight in expounding without exhaustion,
Like the wind in the sky
That encounters no obstacles whatsoever.

After the Tathāgata's extinction,
They shall know the sutras expounded by the Buddha,
Their causes and conditions and proper sequence,
And expound them truthfully in accord with their meaning,

Like the light of the sun and moon
That dispels all darkness.
Such persons moving through the world
Are able to extinguish the darkness of living beings,

Teaching immeasurable bodhisattvas
To ultimately abide in the One Vehicle.
Therefore, those possessed of wisdom,
Hearing of these merits and benefits,

After my extinction
Should receive and maintain this sutra.
Such persons, regarding the Buddha path,
Decidedly shall harbor no doubts whatsoever.
