CHAPTER THREE: PARABLES

At that time Śāriputra, leaping with joy, immediately rose, joined his palms together, gazed up at the Honored Countenance, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "Now, hearing this Dharma-sound from the World-Honored One, my heart leaps with joy and I have experienced what I have never before experienced. Wherefore is this so? In former times when I heard such Dharma from the Buddha and saw the Bodhisattvas receive predictions of Buddhahood, while we were not included in these matters, I deeply lamented and grieved at having lost the Tathāgata's immeasurable insight and vision.

"World-Honored One, when I would constantly dwell alone in mountain forests and beneath trees, whether sitting or walking, I would always have this thought: 'We have all equally entered into the Dharma-nature—why does the Tathāgata ferry us across through the Lesser Vehicle Dharma?' This is our fault, not the World-Honored One's. Wherefore is this so? Had we waited for the exposition of the causes for perfecting anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, we would certainly have been ferried across through the Great Vehicle. However, we did not comprehend that [the Buddha] expounds in accordance with what is appropriate through skillful means. Upon first hearing the Buddha-Dharma, we immediately encountered it, believed, received, contemplated, and realized it.

"World-Honored One, from times past until now, throughout the day and night, I have constantly reproached myself. But now, from the Buddha, I have heard this Dharma never before heard, this unprecedented Dharma, and all my doubts and regrets have been severed. My body and mind are at ease; I have quickly attained peace and security. Today at last I know that truly I am a Buddha-son, born from the Buddha's mouth, born from the Dharma through transformation, having obtained my share of the Buddha-Dharma."

At that time Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Hearing this Dharma-sound,
I have attained what I never before had.
My heart harbors great joy;
All nets of doubt have been removed.

"From ancient times receiving the Buddha's teaching,
I have not lost the Great Vehicle.
The Buddha's voice is extremely rare—
It can remove the afflictions of living beings.

"I have already attained the exhaustion of outflows;
Hearing this also removes my cares and afflictions.
I dwelt in mountain valleys
Or beneath forest trees,

"Whether sitting or walking,
Constantly contemplating this matter.
Alas! I deeply reproached myself:
'Why have I deceived myself?

"'We too are Buddha-sons,
Having equally entered the outflow-free Dharma,
Yet cannot in the future
Expound the supreme Way.

"'The golden color and thirty-two marks,
The ten powers and various liberations—
We share in one Dharma together,
Yet have not attained these things.

"'The eighty kinds of wondrous excellences,
The eighteen unique Buddha-dharmas—
Such merits as these,
All of them I have lost.'

"When I would walk alone,
Seeing the Buddha amidst the great assembly,
His fame filling the ten directions,
Extensively benefiting living beings,

"I thought I had lost this benefit;
I had deceived and deluded myself.
Constantly, day and night,
I would contemplate this matter,

"Wishing to ask the World-Honored One
Whether I had lost it or not.
I constantly saw the World-Honored One
Praising all the Bodhisattvas;

"Thus throughout day and night
I pondered over this matter.
Now, hearing the Buddha's voice
Expounding in accordance with what is appropriate,

"The outflow-free, inconceivable [Dharma],
Causing multitudes to reach the place of enlightenment—
I originally adhered to wrong views,
Serving as a teacher for the brāhmaṇas.

"The World-Honored One, knowing my mind,
Uprooted the wrong and expounded nirvāṇa.
I completely eliminated wrong views
And attained realization of the Dharma of emptiness.

"At that time my mind declared to itself
That I had attained extinction.
But now I realize myself
That this was not true extinction.

"When I attain Buddhahood,
Perfected with the thirty-two marks,
Revered by devas, humans, yakṣas,
Dragons, spirits, and others—

"At that time it may be said
I am forever exhausted and extinguished without remainder.
The Buddha, amidst the great assembly,
Has said I shall become a Buddha.

"Hearing such Dharma-sound,
All doubts and regrets have been removed.
When first I heard what the Buddha expounded,
In my mind great shock and doubt arose:

"'Could this not be Māra
Assuming the Buddha's form,
To harass and disturb my mind?'
The Buddha through various conditions,

"Parables and skillful expressions,
With a mind tranquil as the sea—
Hearing it, my net of doubts was severed.
The Buddha spoke of Buddhas of past ages,

"Immeasurable numbers who entered extinction,
Dwelling secure in skillful means;
They too all expounded this Dharma.
Present and future Buddhas,

"Whose number is without measure,
Also through various skillful means
Expound this Dharma thus.
Just as the present World-Honored One,

"From his birth and leaving home,
Attaining the Way and turning the Dharma-wheel,
Also expounds through skillful means.
The World-Honored One expounds the true path;

"Pāpīyān [the evil one] has no such matter.
Through this I definitely know
This is not Māra assuming the Buddha's form.
Because I had fallen into a net of doubts,

"I thought it was Māra's doing.
Hearing the Buddha's gentle, soft voice,
Profound, far-reaching, and extremely wondrous,
Expounding and manifesting the pure Dharma,

"My heart experienced great joy.
Doubts and regrets are forever exhausted;
I dwell secure in true wisdom.
I definitely shall become a Buddha,

"Honored by devas and humans.
I shall turn the supreme Dharma-wheel,
Teaching and transforming the Bodhisattvas."

At that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: "I now amidst this assembly of devas, humans, śramaṇas, brāhmaṇas, and others proclaim: In the past, in the presence of two myriads of billions of Buddhas, for the sake of the supreme Way, I constantly taught and transformed you. Throughout the long night you followed me in receiving instruction. Because I guided you through skillful means, you were born into my Dharma.

"Śāriputra, in former times I taught you to aspire to the Buddha-Way. You have now completely forgotten this and便自謂已得滅度 [consider yourself to have already attained extinction]. I now once again wish to cause you to recall the original vow and the Way you practiced. Therefore, for the śrāvakas, I expound this Great Vehicle sutra called the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas.

"Śāriputra, in a future age, after immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable kalpas, having made offerings to several thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas, having upheld the correct Dharma and perfected the path practiced by Bodhisattvas, you shall attain Buddhahood. Your name shall be Padmaprabha Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna, Sugata, Lokavid, Anuttara, Puruṣa-damya-sārathi, Śāstā-deva-manuṣyānām, Buddha, Bhagavat. Your land shall be named Vimalā ['Free from Defilement']. The earth shall be level and pure, adorned and exquisite, peaceful, prosperous, and happy, with devas and humans flourishing. The ground shall be of lapis lazuli with eight crossroads, bordered with golden cords. Alongside shall be rows of seven-jeweled trees, constantly bearing flowers and fruits. The Tathāgata Padmaprabha shall also teach and transform living beings through the Three Vehicles.

"Śāriputra, although that Buddha appears at a time that is not an evil age, because of his original vows he expounds the Dharma of the Three Vehicles. That kalpa shall be named Mahāratnapratimaṇḍita ['Great Jeweled Adornment']. Why is it named Great Jeweled Adornment? In that land, Bodhisattvas are regarded as great jewels. Those Bodhisattvas shall be immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable, beyond what calculations or parables can reach; no one besides those with the Buddha's power of wisdom can know their number. When they wish to walk, jeweled flowers support their feet. These Bodhisattvas are not those who have newly generated the resolve; all have long planted roots of virtue. In the presence of immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas they have purely cultivated the holy life, constantly receiving praise from all Buddhas. They constantly cultivate Buddha-wisdom, possess great spiritual powers, thoroughly know all the gateways to the Dharmas, are straightforward, genuine, and undeceptive, and their aspirations and mindfulness are firm and solid. Bodhisattvas such as these shall fill that land.

"Śāriputra, the lifespan of the Buddha Padmaprabha shall be twelve lesser kalpas—excluding the time when he was a prince before becoming a Buddha. The people of that land shall live eight lesser kalpas. After twelve lesser kalpas, the Tathāgata Padmaprabha shall confer upon the Bodhisattva Dhṛtipariparipūrṇa the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, telling the bhikṣus: 'This Bodhisattva Dhṛtipariparipūrṇa shall next become a Buddha, whose name shall be Padmapadaviśīrṇagāmin, Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha. His Buddha-land shall also be thus.'

"Śāriputra, after this Buddha Padmaprabha enters final nirvāṇa, the correct Dharma shall dwell in the world for thirty-two lesser kalpas, and the semblance Dharma shall also dwell for thirty-two lesser kalpas."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Śāriputra, in a future age
Shall become a Buddha, universally honored in wisdom,
Whose name shall be Padmaprabha,
Ferrying across immeasurable multitudes.

"Having made offerings to innumerable Buddhas,
Perfecting the practices of Bodhisattvas,
The ten powers and other merits,
He shall realize the supreme Way.

"After immeasurable kalpas have passed,
The kalpa shall be named Great Jeweled Adornment,
The world named Free from Defilement—
Pure, without impurities or blemishes.

"With lapis lazuli as its ground,
Golden cords bordering its paths,
Seven-jeweled trees of mixed colors
Constantly bearing flowers and fruits.

"The Bodhisattvas of that land,
Their aspirations constantly firm and solid,
Having all perfected
Spiritual powers and pāramitās—

"In the presence of innumerable Buddhas,
They have well studied the Bodhisattva-Way.
Great beings such as these
Are transformed by the Buddha Padmaprabha.

"When the Buddha was a prince,
He renounced his kingdom and worldly glory.
In his very final body
He left home and perfected the Buddha-Way.

"The Buddha Padmaprabha shall dwell in the world
For twelve lesser kalpas.
The people of that land
Shall have lifespans of eight lesser kalpas.

"After the Buddha's extinction,
The correct Dharma shall dwell in the world
For thirty-two lesser kalpas,
Extensively ferrying across all living beings.

"When the correct Dharma is exhausted,
The semblance [Dharma shall last] thirty-two [kalpas].
Śarīra shall be widely distributed,
Universally receiving offerings from devas and humans.

"What the Buddha Padmaprabha accomplishes—
These matters shall all be thus.
That Honored Sage of Two Feet
Shall be most supreme, without equal or match.

"That one shall be none other than you—
You should rejoice and celebrate!"

At that time the fourfold assembly—bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās—together with devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, and other members of the great assembly, seeing Śāriputra before the Buddha receive the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, experienced great joy in their hearts, leaping with immeasurable delight. Each removed the upper garment they were wearing and offered it to the Buddha. Śakra Devānām Indra, the Brahmā Heavenly King, and others, together with innumerable celestial sons, also made offerings to the Buddha with wondrous celestial garments, celestial mandārava flowers, mahāmandārava flowers, and such. The celestial garments they scattered remained in empty space, revolving of themselves. Celestial music of hundreds of thousands of myriads of kinds simultaneously played in empty space, raining down multitudes of celestial flowers. And they spoke these words: "Long ago at Vārāṇasī the Buddha first turned the Dharma-wheel; now he again turns the supreme and greatest Dharma-wheel!"

At that time the celestial sons, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Long ago at Vārāṇasī
He turned the Dharma-wheel of the Four Noble Truths,
Making distinctions and expounding all dharmas—
The arising and cessation of the five aggregates.

"Now again he turns the most wondrous,
Supreme and great Dharma-wheel.
This Dharma is extremely deep and mysterious;
Few are able to believe it.

"We from ancient times until now
Have repeatedly heard the World-Honored One expound,
But have never before heard
Such profound, wondrous, and supreme Dharma.

"Since the World-Honored One expounds this Dharma,
We all rejoice accordingly.
The greatly wise Śāriputra
Has now received the honored prediction.

"We too are likewise thus—
We shall certainly attain Buddhahood.
Throughout all the world
Most honored, without any superior.

"The Buddha-Way is inconceivable;
He expounds through skillful means in accordance with what is appropriate.
Whatever merit and karmic activity we possess,
Whether of this life or past lives,

"Together with seeing the Buddha's merit—
All of it we dedicate toward the Buddha-Way."

At that time Śāriputra addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I now have no further doubts or regrets. Personally before the Buddha I have received the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. These twelve hundred whose minds are self-mastered formerly dwelt at the stage of learning. The Buddha constantly taught and transformed them, saying: 'My Dharma can separate one from birth, old age, sickness, and death, ultimately reaching nirvāṇa.' Whether at the stage of learning or beyond learning, these people also each considered that, having separated from the view of self as well as views of existence and non-existence, they had attained nirvāṇa. But now, before the World-Honored One, hearing what they had never before heard, they have all fallen into doubt and perplexity. Excellent, World-Honored One! We pray that for the sake of the fourfold assembly you will explain the cause and condition, causing them to separate from doubt and regret."

At that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Did I not previously say that all Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, through various causes and conditions, parables, and expressions, expound the Dharma through skillful means, all for the sake of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi? All these expositions are for the sake of transforming Bodhisattvas. However, Śāriputra, I shall now once more through a parable clarify this meaning further. Those with wisdom comprehend through parables.

"Śāriputra, suppose in a certain land, province, or village there was a great elder who was aged and declining, possessing immeasurable wealth, with many fields, estates, and servants. His house was vast and great, having only a single gate. A great many people—one, two, or even five hundred—were dwelling within it. The halls and pavilions were decayed and old, the walls crumbling down, the pillar bases rotten and decomposed, the beams and ridgepoles tilting precariously. All around, simultaneously, fire suddenly broke out, engulfing the dwelling. The elder's sons—perhaps ten, twenty, or as many as thirty—were inside this house.

"The elder, seeing this great fire arise from the four directions, immediately felt great alarm and terror, and had this thought: 'Though I am able to emerge safely through this burning gate, my sons within the burning house are engrossed in play and amusements, unaware, unknowing, unalarmed, unafraid. Though the fire approaches and presses upon their bodies, causing them pain and suffering, their minds harbor no aversion or distress, and they have no thought of escaping.'

"Śāriputra, this elder made this reflection: 'I have physical strength in my body and hands. I could use a robe or a table to carry them out of the dwelling.' Then he further reflected: 'This house has only one gate, which moreover is narrow and small. My sons are young and immature, lacking understanding. They are attached to their place of play and may fall down and be burned by the fire. I should tell them of this frightening matter: this house is already burning—they must quickly get out now, lest they be harmed by the fire.' Having thought thus, in accordance with his reflections, he informed all his sons: 'You must quickly come out!' Though the father showed compassion and skillfully coaxed and admonished them, the sons were engrossed in amusements and play, unwilling to believe and receive [his warning], neither alarmed nor afraid, and completely lacking any thought of escape. Moreover, they did not even know what fire was, what a house was, or what 'losing' meant. They merely ran about from east to west, playing, glancing at their father and nothing more.

"At that time the elder made this reflection: 'This house is already being consumed by a great fire. If my sons and I do not get out in time, we shall certainly be burned. I shall now employ skillful means to cause my sons to escape this calamity.' The father, knowing what each of his sons had previously enjoyed—various rare and unusual playthings and objects to which they would certainly be attached—spoke to them, saying: 'The playthings you enjoy, rare and difficult to obtain—if you do not take them now, you will surely regret it later. Various sheep-carts, deer-carts, and ox-carts are now outside the gate, where you can play with them. You should quickly come out of this burning house. Whatever you desire, I shall give to you all.'

"At that time, the sons, hearing their father describe these precious playthings—things that suited their wishes—each became emboldened and brave. Pushing and jostling one another, they raced competitively forth, scrambling to escape the burning house.

"At that time, when the elder saw that his sons had safely escaped and were all seated in the open at the crossroads, no longer obstructed, his mind became tranquil and he was filled with joy and rapture. Each of the sons then addressed their father, saying: 'Father, the playthings you promised us earlier—the sheep-carts, deer-carts, and ox-carts—please give them to us now.'

"Śāriputra, at that time the elder gave to each of his sons an identical great cart. These carts were tall and spacious, adorned and decorated with manifold jewels, surrounded with railings, with bells hanging from all four sides. A canopy was spread over the top, also decorated and adorned with rare and various jewels. Jeweled cords crisscrossed, with hanging garlands of flowers. Inside, layered mats were spread with cushions of red pillows. They were yoked to white oxen, their skin lustrous and pure, their physical form beautiful, possessing great muscular strength, their gait steady and even, as swift as the wind. Moreover, many servants attended and guarded them. Wherefore was this so? This great elder possessed immeasurable wealth; all his various storehouses were completely full to overflowing. And he made this reflection: 'My wealth is limitless. I should not give inferior small carts to my sons. These young children are all my sons, whom I love without partiality. Possessing such great seven-jeweled carts, immeasurable in number, I should with equal mind give one to each, without showing favoritism. Wherefore is this so? Even if I were to distribute these possessions throughout an entire land, there would still be no shortage—how much more so for my sons!' At that time, each of the sons mounted his great cart, experiencing what they had never before experienced, beyond their original expectations.

"Śāriputra, what is your opinion? Did that elder, in giving precious great carts equally to his sons, commit any falsehood or not?"

Śāriputra replied: "No, World-Honored One. That elder merely enabled his sons to escape the fire's calamity, preserving their bodies and lives—this was not falsehood. Why is this so? Precisely by preserving their bodies and lives, they had already obtained wonderful playthings—how much more so through skillful means used to rescue them from that burning house! World-Honored One, even if that elder had not given them so much as the smallest cart, it still would not have been falsehood. Why is this so? That elder had previously formed this intention: 'I shall employ skillful means to cause my sons to escape.' For this reason, there is no falsehood. How much less falsehood is there when the elder, knowing himself to possess immeasurable wealth, wishing to benefit his sons equally, gave them each great carts!"

The Buddha told Śāriputra: "Excellent, excellent! It is just as you have said. Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is also likewise thus—he is the father of all the world. Regarding all fear, decline, distress, anxiety, ignorance, and dark obscuration, he has forever exhausted them without remainder, and has perfected immeasurable insight and vision, powers, fearlessnesses, great spiritual power, and the power of wisdom. He possesses perfect skillful means and the pāramitā of wisdom. His great compassion and great kindness are constant and unwearying; he eternally seeks wholesome matters, benefiting all.

"Thus he is born into the triple world—a decaying and burning house—in order to ferry across living beings from birth, old age, sickness, death, grief, sorrow, suffering, distress, delusion, darkness, and the three poisons of fire. He teaches and transforms them, causing them to attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. He sees all living beings being seared and boiled by birth, old age, sickness, death, grief, sorrow, suffering, and distress. Moreover, due to the five desires and wealth they undergo various kinds of suffering. Further, through greedy attachment and pursuit, they presently undergo manifold sufferings and afterward undergo the sufferings of the hells, animals, and hungry ghosts. Even if born in the heavens or in the human realm, they undergo the sufferings of poverty and destitution, the suffering of separation from the beloved, the suffering of encountering the hateful—such various kinds of suffering as these. Yet living beings, sunken within all this, delight and play joyfully, unaware, unknowing, unalarmed, unafraid. They also do not become weary or seek liberation. In this burning house of the triple world they run about from east to west. Though they encounter great suffering, they do not regard it as affliction.

"Śāriputra, having seen this, the Buddha then made this reflection: 'I am the father of living beings. I should extract them from suffering and distress and give them the joy of the immeasurable, limitless Buddha-wisdom, causing them to find amusement in it.'

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata further made this reflection: 'If I merely use spiritual power and the power of wisdom, casting aside skillful means, and for the sake of living beings praise the Tathāgata's insight and vision, powers, and fearlessnesses, living beings will be unable to be ferried across through this. Wherefore is this so? These living beings have not yet escaped birth, old age, sickness, death, grief, sorrow, suffering, and distress. They are being burned by the burning house of the triple world—how could they comprehend the Buddha's wisdom?'

"Śāriputra, just as that elder, though he had physical strength and power in his body and hands, did not use it but merely through diligent skillful means rescued his sons from the calamity of the burning house, and afterward gave each the precious great carts—the Tathāgata is also likewise thus. Though he possesses power and fearlessness, he does not use it. He merely through the power of wisdom and skillful means extracts and rescues living beings from the burning house of the triple world, expounding for them the Three Vehicles—those of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and Buddhas. And he speaks thus: 'You should not delight in dwelling in the burning house of the triple world. Do not greedily crave crude and inferior forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles. If through greedy attachment you generate love, you will be burned by it. You should quickly exit the triple world and obtain the Three Vehicles of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and Buddhas. I now guarantee this matter for you; it shall never prove false. You should merely be diligently vigorous.'

"Through these skillful means the Tathāgata entices living beings forward. He furthermore says: 'You should know that these Three Vehicle Dharmas are all praised by sages. They are free, unbound, without anything upon which they depend or which they seek. Riding these Three Vehicles, through outflow-free faculties, powers, limbs of enlightenment, factors of the Path, dhyāna concentrations, liberations, samādhis, and such, you yourselves experience amusement and thereby attain immeasurable peace, security, and joy.'

"Śāriputra, if there are living beings who internally possess the nature of wisdom, who, hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, the World-Honored One, believe and receive it, who are diligent and vigorous, wishing to quickly exit the triple world and seeking nirvāṇa for themselves—these are called those of the Śrāvaka Vehicle, like those sons who sought the sheep-carts and exited the burning house.

"If there are living beings who, hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, the World-Honored One, believe and receive it, who are diligent and vigorous, seeking self-arising wisdom, delighting in solitary goodness and tranquility, and deeply understanding the causes and conditions of all dharmas—these are called those of the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle, like those sons who sought the deer-carts and exited the burning house.

"If there are living beings who, hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, the World-Honored One, believe and receive it, who diligently cultivate and vigorously advance, seeking the wisdom of all modes, Buddha-wisdom, self-arising wisdom, teacherless wisdom, the Tathāgata's insight and vision, powers, and fearlessnesses, who pity, bring peace, and benefit immeasurable multitudes of living beings, benefiting devas and humans and ferrying across all—these are called those of the Great Vehicle. Because Bodhisattvas seek this Vehicle, they are called Mahāsattvas, like those sons who sought the ox-carts and exited the burning house.

"Śāriputra, just as that elder, seeing his sons safely escape the burning house and reach a place without fear, reflecting on his immeasurable wealth, gave great carts equally to his sons—the Tathāgata is also likewise thus, being the father of all living beings. If he sees immeasurable billions of thousands of myriads of living beings, through the Buddha's teaching-gateway, escape the suffering, fear, and dangerous paths of the triple world and attain the joy of nirvāṇa, the Tathāgata at that time makes this reflection: 'I possess immeasurable, limitless wisdom, powers, fearlessnesses, and other treasuries of Buddha-Dharmas. All these living beings are my sons. I give equally to all the Great Vehicle, not allowing anyone to individually attain extinction. All shall attain extinction through the Tathāgata's extinction.' Those living beings who escape the triple world are all given the amusements and tools of the Buddhas' dhyāna concentrations and liberations. They are all of one mark, one kind, praised by sages, able to generate pure, wondrous, foremost joy.

"Śāriputra, just as that elder first used the three carts to entice his sons, but afterward gave them only the great cart adorned with jewels, safest and foremost—yet that elder is not guilty of falsehood—the Tathāgata is also likewise thus, without any falsehood. First he expounds the Three Vehicles to guide living beings, but afterward he ferries them across solely through the Great Vehicle. Wherefore is this so? The Tathāgata possesses the treasury of immeasurable wisdom, powers, fearlessnesses, and all dharmas, and is able to give all living beings the Dharma of the Great Vehicle. However, not all are able to receive it.

"Śāriputra, for this cause and condition you should know: through the power of skillful means, within the One Buddha Vehicle, the Buddhas make distinctions and expound three."

The Buddha, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Suppose there is an elder
Who has a great dwelling,
Which, being of long standing,
Moreover is now dilapidated and ruinous.

"The halls and houses are lofty and dangerous,
The pillar bases decayed and rotten,
The beams and ridgepoles tilting askew,
The foundations and steps crumbling and destroyed.

"Walls and partitions are cracked and gaping,
The mud coating has peeled and fallen off,
The thatch covering is scattered and collapsing,
The rafters and crossbeams are loose and dislodged.

"Surroundings winding and crooked,
Filth fills them everywhere.
Five hundred people
Dwell and reside within it.

"Kites, owls, eagles, and vultures,
Crows, magpies, doves, and pigeons,
Vipers, snakes, vipers, and scorpions,
Centipedes and millipedes,

"Geckos and hundred-leggers,
Weasels, raccoons, and mice—
Various evil insect tribes
Run crisscross back and forth.

"Places of excrement and urine stench,
With impure matter flowing and overflowing—
Dung beetles and other insects
Gather and collect upon them.

"Foxes, wolves, and wild dogs
Chew, trample, and gnaw at corpses,
Scattering bones and flesh about.
Due to this, packs of dogs

"Competitively come to snatch and grab,
Starving, emaciated, frightened, and frantic,
Everywhere seeking food,
Fighting and struggling, tearing and pulling,

"Snarling and howling, barking—
Such is the fearful condition
And changing state of that dwelling.

"Everywhere throughout
Are sprites and demons.
Yakṣas and evil ghosts
Devour human flesh.

"Poisonous insect tribes
And various evil birds and beasts
Hatch and bear offspring,
Each hiding and protecting them.

"Yakṣas compete to come
And struggle to seize and devour them.
Having eaten their fill,
Their evil minds become even fiercer.

"The sounds of their fighting and struggling
Are extremely fearful.
Kumbhāṇḍa ghosts
Squat upon mounds of earth,

"Sometimes rising from the ground
One or two feet,
Wandering back and forth,
Indulging in frivolous play,

"Seizing dogs by both feet,
Striking them so they lose their voice,
Placing feet upon their necks,
Terrifying the dogs for their own amusement.

"Again there are various ghosts
Whose bodies are tall and large,
Naked, black, and emaciated,
Constantly dwelling therein,

"Emitting great evil sounds,
Crying and calling out for food.
Again there are ghosts
Whose throats are like needles.

"Again there are ghosts
With heads like ox heads—
Some eat human flesh,
Others also devour dogs.

"Hair disheveled and wild,
Cruel and dangerous in harming,
Oppressed by hunger and thirst,
They cry out and run about.

"Yakṣas, hungry ghosts,
And various evil birds and beasts,
Desperately hungry, facing in all directions,
Peering through windows and openings—

"Such difficulties as these,
And fears immeasurable,
Belong to this decayed old dwelling,
Which is owned by one person.

"That person had recently gone out
Not long before
When, in the rear of that dwelling,
Fire suddenly broke out.

"Simultaneously on all four sides
Its flames burned fiercely together.
Ridgepoles, beams, rafters, and pillars
Exploded with震裂 [震crackling sounds],

"Crumbling, breaking, and falling down,
Walls and partitions collapsing.
All the ghosts and spirits
Raised their voices in great cries.

"Eagles, vultures, and various birds,
Kumbhāṇḍas and such,
In frantic terror and fear,
Were unable to escape by themselves.

"Evil beasts and poisonous insects
Hid and burrowed into holes and crevices.
Piśāca ghosts
Also dwelt therein.

"Due to scant merit and virtue,
Oppressed by the fire,
They mutually harmed one another,
Drinking blood and devouring flesh.

"Wild dog tribes
Had already died before.
Various large evil beasts
Competed to come and devour them.

"Foul smoke and flames
Filled and blocked all four sides.
Centipedes and millipedes,
Poisonous snake tribes,

"Burned by the fire,
Struggled to exit their holes.
Kumbhāṇḍa ghosts
Seized and devoured them.

"Moreover, all the hungry ghosts
Had fire burning atop their heads.
Afflicted by hunger, thirst, heat, and distress,
They frantically ran about in anguish.

"Such is the condition of that dwelling—
Extremely fearful,
With calamities of poison, harm, and fire,
Manifold difficulties, not just one.

"At that time the master of the dwelling
Was standing outside the gate.
He heard someone say:
'Your various sons

"'Earlier, due to play and amusement,
Entered into this dwelling.
Young and lacking knowledge,
They delight and are attached to amusements.'

"The elder, hearing this,
Alarmed, entered the burning house,
Appropriately planning rescue,
To prevent them from being burned or harmed.

"He admonished and instructed his sons,
Explaining the manifold troubles and difficulties:
'Evil ghosts and poisonous insects,
The calamity of fire spreading everywhere,

"'Manifold sufferings continuously,
One after another without cease.
Poisonous snakes and vipers,
Together with all the yakṣas,

"'Kumbhāṇḍa ghosts,
Wild dogs, foxes, and jackals,
Eagles, vultures, and kites,
And hundred-legged tribes,

"'Afflicted by hunger and thirst,
Extremely fearful—
This is a place of suffering and difficulty,
How much worse with the great fire!'

"The sons, lacking knowledge,
Though hearing their father's instruction,
Still remained attached and delighted,
Playing without cease.

"At that time the elder
Made this reflection:
'The sons are like this,
Increasing my grief and distress.

"'Now in this dwelling
There is nothing delightful,
Yet these sons,
Engrossed in frivolous play,

"'Do not receive my teaching
And will be harmed by the fire.'
He immediately reflected,
Establishing various skillful means,

"And told all his sons:
'I have various
Precious playthings—
Wonderful jeweled fine carts,

"'Sheep-carts and deer-carts,
And great ox-carts,
Now outside the gate.
Come out, you!

"'For your sake
I have created these carts.
According to your desires,
You can play with them.'

"Hearing these carts described,
The sons immediately raced competitively,
Running forth and emerging,
Reaching the open ground,

"Separating from all suffering and difficulties.
The elder, seeing his sons
Escape the burning house,
Dwelling at the crossroads,

"Seated on lion thrones,
Made this joyful declaration:
'I am now happy and at ease!
These sons

"'Were extremely difficult to give birth to and raise.
Foolish, small, and lacking knowledge,
They entered a dangerous dwelling
With many poisonous insects

"'And frightful sprites and demons.
The great fire with fierce flames
Arose simultaneously from all four sides,
Yet these sons,

"'Greedy and attached to play,
I have now rescued them,
Causing them to escape difficulty.
Therefore, all people,

"'I am now happy and at ease.'
At that time the sons,
Knowing their father was seated securely,
All approached their father's place

"And addressed their father, saying:
'Please grant us
The three kinds of jeweled carts
As you previously promised:

"'When the sons emerge,
You shall give three carts
According to our desires.'
Now is precisely the time—

"'We only pray you will bestow them!'
The elder, greatly wealthy,
With many treasuries and storehouses—
Gold, silver, lapis lazuli,

"Giant clam shell, and agate—
With manifold jeweled materials
He fashioned various great carts,
Decorated and adorned,

"Surrounded with railings,
With bells hanging from four sides,
And golden cords crisscrossing.
Pearl netting

"Spread and extended above,
With golden flower garlands
Hanging down everywhere.
Multicolored decorations

"Surrounded them all about.
Soft silk and cotton
Served as cushions and mats.
Superior, wondrous fine cloth

"Worth thousands of billions,
Pure white and immaculately clean,
Covered them above.
There were great white oxen,

"Fat, strong, and powerful,
Beautiful in physical form,
Yoked to the jeweled carts,
With many attendants

"Serving and guarding them.
With these wonderful carts
He gave equally to his sons.
The sons at that time

"Experienced joy and rapture,
Mounting these jeweled carts,
Roaming in the four directions,
Playing joyfully,

"At ease without obstruction.
I tell Śāriputra:
I too am likewise thus—
Among sages most honored,

"Father of the world.
All living beings
Are all my sons,
Deeply attached to worldly pleasures,

"Without minds of wisdom.
The triple world has no peace—
It is like a burning house,
Filled with manifold sufferings,

"Extremely fearful,
Constantly having birth, old age,
Sickness, death, and anxieties—
Fires such as these

"Blaze fiercely without cease.
The Tathāgata has already separated
From the burning house of the triple world,
Dwelling serenely and leisurely at ease,

"Peacefully residing in forests and wilds.
Now this triple world
Is all my possession.
The living beings within it

"Are all my sons.
Yet now this place
Has many troubles and difficulties.
Only I alone

"Am able to provide rescue and protection.
Though I furthermore teach and instruct,
They do not believe or receive it,
Due to being deeply attached

"To desires through greed.
Through these skillful means
I expound the Three Vehicles,
Causing all living beings

"To know the triple world's sufferings,
Demonstrating and expounding
The transcendent worldly path.
If these sons

"Have minds that are resolute and determined,
Perfecting the three clarities
And the six spiritual powers,
Some attaining pratyekabuddhahood,

"And irreversible Bodhisattvas—
Śāriputra,
For the sake of living beings,
Through this parable

"I expound the One Buddha Vehicle.
If you are able
To believe and receive these words,
You shall all

"Attain accomplishment of the Buddha-Way.
This Vehicle is wondrous,
Pure and foremost.
Throughout all worlds

"There is none superior to it—
That which the Buddha delights in.
All living beings
Should praise it,

"Make offerings to it, and bow to it.
Immeasurable billions of thousands
Of powers and liberations,
Dhyāna concentrations and wisdom,

"Together with the Buddha's other dharmas—
Having attained such a Vehicle,
It causes all the sons
Throughout days, nights, and kalpa-periods

"Constantly to find amusement and play,
Together with Bodhisattvas
And the multitude of śrāvakas,
Mounting this jeweled Vehicle,

"Going directly to the place of enlightenment.
For this cause and condition,
Seeking throughout the ten directions,
There is no other Vehicle,

"Except the Buddha's skillful means.
I tell Śāriputra
That you and all others
Are all my sons,

"And I am your father.
Throughout accumulated kalpas
You have been burned by manifold sufferings,
And I have rescued and extracted you all,

"Causing you to exit the triple world.
Though I previously said
You had all attained extinction,
You have merely exhausted birth and death

"But have not truly become extinct.
What you should now accomplish
Is solely Buddha-wisdom.
If there are Bodhisattvas

"Within this assembly
Who can single-mindedly listen to
The true Dharma of all Buddhas—
Though the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones,

"Through skillful means
Transform living beings,
All those transformed are Bodhisattvas.

"If people have small wisdom,
Deeply attached to craving and desire—
For ones such as these
I expound the Truth of Suffering.

"Living beings' minds rejoice,
Experiencing what they never before had:
'The Buddha's exposition of the Truth of Suffering
Is true and without difference!'

"If there are living beings
Who do not know suffering's root,
Who are deeply attached to suffering's cause
And cannot temporarily relinquish it—

"For ones such as these,
I expound the Path through skillful means.
The cause of all sufferings
Is greed and desire as the root.

"If one extinguishes greed and desire,
It has nothing upon which to depend.
Extinguishing and exhausting all sufferings
Is called the Third Truth.

"For the sake of the Truth of Extinction,
One cultivates and practices the Path.
Separating from all bonds of suffering
Is called attaining liberation.

"Regarding what matter
Do these people attain liberation?
They merely separate from falsity and emptiness—
This is called liberation.

"In reality they have not yet attained
Complete liberation.
The Buddha says these people
Have not truly attained extinction,

"Because these people have not yet attained
The supreme Way.
My intention does not wish
To cause them to reach extinction.

"I am the Dharma King,
Sovereign over all dharmas.
To bring peace to living beings,
I therefore appear in the world.

"Śāriputra,
This Dharma-seal of mine,
Wishing to benefit
The world, I expound it.

"Wherever you roam,
Do not transmit it carelessly.
If there are those who hear it
And rejoice, receiving it reverently,

"You should know such people
Are irreversible [from enlightenment].
If there are those who believe and receive
This sutra-Dharma,

"Such people have already
Seen Buddhas of the past,
Reverently making offerings
And also hearing this Dharma.

"If people are able
To believe what you expound,
They thereby see me
And also see you

"Together with the bhikṣu Saṅgha
And all the Bodhisattvas.
This Dharma Flower Sutra
Is expounded for those of deep wisdom.

"Those of shallow knowledge hearing it
Become confused and fail to comprehend.
All śrāvakas
And pratyekabuddhas

"Regarding this sutra
Find it beyond their power's reach.
Even you, Śāriputra,
Regarding this sutra

"Gained entry through faith—
How much more so other śrāvakas!
The other śrāvakas,
Due to believing the Buddha's words,

"Comply with this sutra,
Not through their own wisdom's portion.
Furthermore, Śāriputra,
To the arrogant and lazy,

"Those who calculate [views of] self—
Do not expound this sutra.
Common people of shallow knowledge,
Deeply attached to the five desires,

"Hearing it, cannot comprehend—
Also do not expound it to them.
If people do not believe
And slander this sutra,

"They thereby sever all
The Buddha-seeds of the world.
Or they may frown with furrowed brows
And harbor doubts and perplexities—

"You should now listen
To the karmic retribution of such people:
Whether the Buddha is in the world
Or after his extinction,

"If there are those who slander
Sutras such as this,
Who see those reading, reciting,
Or upholding and copying the sutra,

"Who despise, hate, envy them,
And harbor resentful thoughts—
Listen now to the karmic retribution
Of such people:

"When their lives end,
They enter Avīci hell,
Fully remaining for one kalpa.
When the kalpa ends they are reborn,

"Turning and revolving thus
Through innumerable kalpas.
Emerging from the hells,
They shall fall into the animal realm—

"As dogs or wild jackals,
Their forms gaunt and emaciated,
Dark, mottled with mange and scabies,
Objects for people to torment.

"Moreover, they shall be
Loathed and despised by people,
Constantly afflicted by hunger and thirst,
Their bones and flesh withered and desiccated.

"In life receiving cruel torment,
In death struck by tiles and stones—
Due to severing the Buddha-seed,
They receive such karmic retribution.

"If they become camels
Or are born among donkeys,
Their bodies constantly bearing heavy loads,
With sticks and whips added,

"They think only of water and grass,
Knowing nothing else.
Due to slandering this sutra,
They obtain retribution such as this.

"Some become wild jackals
Entering villages and settlements,
Their bodies afflicted with mange and scabies,
Moreover lacking one eye,

"Struck and pelted
By various children,
Receiving all manner of suffering and pain,
Sometimes even unto death.

"Having died in this [state],
They again receive python bodies,
Their forms long and large,
Five hundred yojanas,

"Deaf, stupid, and without feet,
Writhing and crawling on their bellies.
By various small insects
They are bitten and devoured,

"Day and night undergoing suffering
Without any respite.
Due to slandering this sutra,
They obtain retribution such as this.

"If they attain human form,
All their faculties are dull and dark—
Dwarfed, hunched, lame, and paralyzed,
Blind, deaf, and hunchbacked.

"Whatever they say,
People do not believe or receive.
Their breath is constantly foul;
They are possessed by ghosts and demons.

"Poor and lowly,
Employed by others,
Afflicted with many illnesses, emaciated,
Without anyone to rely upon.

"Though they attach themselves to people,
People pay them no mind.
If they obtain anything,
They soon again forget and lose it.

"If they practice the medical way,
Following prescriptions to treat illness,
They further increase others' diseases
Or also cause death.

"If they themselves have illness,
No one rescues or treats them.
Though they take good medicine,
It further increases their suffering.

"If others rebel,
Plundering and robbing through theft—
Transgressions such as these
Befall them as calamities.

"Such sinful people
Forever never see the Buddha,
The King of Multitudes of Sages,
Expounding Dharma and teaching transformation.

"Such sinful people
Are constantly born in difficult places—
Mad, deaf, with minds confused,
Forever never hearing the Dharma.

"Throughout innumerable kalpas
Numerous as Ganges' sands,
Whenever born, deaf and mute,
Their faculties incomplete,

"They constantly dwell in the hells
As if roaming in parks and gardens.
In other evil paths
As if in their own dwelling places.

"Camels, donkeys, pigs, and dogs—
These are their places of movement.
Due to slandering this sutra,
They obtain retribution such as this.

"If they attain human form,
Deaf, blind, mute, and dumb,
Poverty and all manner of decline
Serve as their adornments.

"Dropsy, emaciation,
Scabies, ulcers, and boils—
Such diseases as these
Serve as their clothing.

"Their bodies constantly stink and are foul,
Filthy and impure.
Deeply attached to the view of self,
They increase in anger and rage.

"Sexual desire burns fiercely—
They do not distinguish birds from beasts.
Due to slandering this sutra,
They obtain retribution such as this.

"I tell Śāriputra:
Those who slander this sutra—
If I were to speak of their transgressions,
I could not exhaust them throughout a kalpa.

"For this cause and condition,
I therefore tell you:
Among people without wisdom,
Do not expound this sutra.

"If there are those of keen faculties,
Whose wisdom is clear and luminous,
Much learning and strong retention,
Seeking the Buddha-Way—

"For people such as these,
One may expound it.
If people have seen
Billions of hundreds of thousands of Buddhas,

"Having planted all manner of wholesome roots,
With profound minds firm and solid—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"If people are vigorously advancing,
Constantly cultivating compassionate minds,
Not begrudging body or life—
For such one may expound it.

"If people are reverent,
Without any divergent minds,
Separated from all common fools,
Dwelling alone in mountains and marshlands—

"For people such as these,
One may expound it.
Furthermore, Śāriputra,
If you see someone

"Who has renounced evil acquaintances
And drawn near to good friends—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"If you see Buddha-sons
Upholding precepts purely,
Like pure, bright jewels,
Seeking Great Vehicle sutras—

"For people such as these,
One may expound it.
If people are without anger,
Straightforward, gentle, and pliant,

"Constantly pitying all,
Revering all Buddhas—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"Again, there are Buddha-sons
Who, within great assemblies,
With pure minds,
Through various causes and conditions,

"Parables and expressions,
Expound Dharma without obstruction—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"If there are bhikṣus
Who, for the sake of the wisdom of all modes,
Seek the Dharma in the four directions,
Joining palms and reverently receiving it,

"Who merely delight in receiving and upholding
Great Vehicle sutras,
Not even receiving
A single verse of other sutras—

"For people such as these,
One may expound it.
Like one who single-mindedly
Seeks the Buddha's śarīra,

"Seeking sutras in such manner,
Having obtained them, reverently receiving them on the crown of the head—
Such a person no longer
Aspires to seek other sutras,

"Nor has ever thought of
Non-Buddhist scriptures—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"I tell Śāriputra:
If I were to speak of the characteristics
Of those seeking the Buddha-Way,
I could not exhaust them throughout a kalpa.

"People such as these
Are then able to believe and comprehend.
You should expound for them
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma."
