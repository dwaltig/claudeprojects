CHAPTER 2: SKILLFUL MEANS
The Buddha's Opening Teaching on Buddha-Wisdom
At that time, the World-Honored One, having emerged from meditation with composed serenity, addressed Śāriputra:¹
"The wisdom of the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, is infinitely profound and immeasurable. The gateway to this wisdom is difficult to comprehend and difficult to enter—beyond the capacity of all Śrāvakas (disciples) and Pratyekabuddhas (solitary awakeners) to understand. Why is this?
"The Buddhas have approached and made offerings to hundreds of thousands of billions of Tathāgatas beyond number. They have completely practiced the infinite dharmic pathways of all the Buddhas. With courageous diligence, their renown has spread universally. They have accomplished teachings utterly unprecedented and extraordinary.²
"Their teachings, adapted to circumstances and conditions, are of meaning (arthas) most difficult to comprehend. Śāriputra, since my own attainment of Buddhahood, I have employed innumerable causes and conditions, boundless parables and illustrations, and infinite skilful means (upayā) to guide and transform all beings, enabling them to transcend all forms of attachment and clinging.³ Why is this?
"The Tathāgata has completely perfected the transcendent wisdom and vision of skilful means (upaya-jñāna-darsana). Śāriputra, the Tathāgata's wisdom and vision is boundless and vast, profound and far-reaching, infinite and unobstructed. His supernatural powers, fearlessness, meditative concentrations, liberations, and samadhis extend into the infinite and reach to the limit. The Tathāgata has accomplished teachings utterly unprecedented.
"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is able to make distinctions among the various dharmas and to discourse skillfully upon them, employing words gentle and soft that bring joy to the hearts of all beings.⁴ Śāriputra, in essential summary, the Tathāgata has accomplished infinite, boundless, unprecedented teachings."⁵
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Buddha's Cessation: The Limits of Teaching
Then the Buddha said: "Cease, Śāriputra. There is no need to speak further. Why? The supremely rare and extraordinary teaching that the Buddha has accomplished—the dharma most difficult to understand—can only be fully penetrated and exhausted by the Buddha together with other Buddhas. I refer to the realm of reality in which:⁶
"The various dharmas possess such-like characteristics, such-like natures, such-like bodies, such-like powers, such-like activities, such-like causes, such-like conditions, such-like effects, such-like retributions, and such-like their beginning and end, their ultimate equivalence."⁷
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verse Statement of Buddha-Wisdom's Transcendence
The World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, then spoke in verse:
The Lord of Sages cannot be measured— By all the devas and all people, All classes of sentient beings, None have the capacity to know the Buddha.
The Buddha's power is without limitation, His fearlessness, his liberations, his concentrations, And all other Buddha-dharmas are, Beyond any capacity to measure.
From countless numberless Buddhas, He has completely practiced all the paths, The profoundly subtle dharmas, Difficult to see and difficult to comprehend.
Through immeasurable billions of eons, Having practiced all these pathways, Upon the seat of enlightenment, I have fully realized and perceived all this.
Such great fruitions, With their diverse characteristics and meanings, Only I and the ten-direction Buddhas, Are able to know these things.
This dharma cannot be demonstrated, Language and verbal expression exhaust themselves; All other classes of sentient beings, Have no capacity to comprehend it,
Except for the Bodhisattva assembly, Whose faith-power is firmly established. The Buddha's disciples assembled here, Having made offerings to all the Buddhas,
Who have exhausted all outflows, And dwell in this their final body, Such persons as these, Lack the capacity for this.
Even if the entire world were filled, All like Śāriputra in wisdom, Collectively thinking and measuring, They could not fathom Buddha-wisdom.
And should the entire ten directions, All be filled with Śāriputra-like beings, And all other disciples, Completely filling all the Buddha-lands,
All collectively thinking and measuring, Still they could not know it. Pratyekabuddhas of keen intelligence, With the unconditioned final body,
Completely filling all ten-direction worlds, Numbering like bamboo forests, All of these, in unified mind, Throughout billions of immeasurable eons,
Desiring to contemplate Buddha-wisdom, Could not know even a fraction of it. Newly-aspiring Bodhisattvas, Having made offerings to countless Buddhas,
Understanding various meanings, And able to discourse skillfully upon the dharma, As numerous as rice grains, hemp seeds, bamboo stalks, and reeds, Filling all the ten-direction Buddha-lands,
All with transcendent wisdom, Throughout the Ganges' sand-number of eons, All together contemplating, Could not know Buddha-wisdom.
The non-retrogressive Bodhisattvas, Numbering like Ganges' sands, All of one mind seeking to comprehend, Still could not know it.
Again, I tell you, Śāriputra: The unconditioned, unthinkable, Profoundly subtle dharmas, I have now completely obtained.
Only I am able to know their characteristics, And so too are the Buddhas of the ten directions. Śāriputra, you should know: The language of all Buddhas is without contradiction,
Regarding the dharma spoken by the Buddha, You should generate great faith-power. The World-Honored One's dharma, after a long time, Will certainly speak the truth.
Announcing to the assembly of Śrāvakas, And to those seeking the pratyekabuddha vehicle, I have enabled them to escape suffering's bonds, And to attain nirvāṇa.
By the Buddha's skilful means-power, I have shown the three-vehicle teaching, And because sentient beings cling everywhere, I guide them to liberation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Assembly's Confusion
At that time, there were in the great assembly twelve hundred Śrāvakas who had exhausted all outflows and were Arhats, including Ājñātakauṇḍinya and others, as well as those among the bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs, male and female lay disciples who had generated the aspiration toward Śrāvaka and Pratyekabuddha vehicles. All of them harbored this thought:
"Why does the World-Honored One so earnestly praise skilful means (upaya) and speak in this manner? He says that the dharma obtained by the Buddha is profoundly difficult to comprehend, that what he speaks is of meaning difficult to discern, that it exceeds the capacity of all Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas to attain.
"The Buddha has spoken of one meaning of liberation,⁸ which we too have obtained, enabling us to reach nirvāṇa. Yet now we do not understand toward what end this teaching aims."⁹
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Śāriputra's Inquiry
At that time, Śāriputra, recognizing the perplexity in the hearts of the fourfold assembly and being himself uncertain, addressed the Buddha:
"World-Honored One, for what cause and condition do you so earnestly praise the supreme skilful means of all the Buddhas—that dharma most profoundly subtle and difficult to comprehend? Since ancient times, I have never heard from the Buddha such teaching as this. Now the fourfold assembly harbors doubt about this matter. I beseech you, World-Honored One, to elucidate this matter! Why do you so earnestly praise the dharma so profoundly subtle and difficult to comprehend?"¹⁰
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Śāriputra's Verse of Inquiry
Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:
O Wisdom-Sun, Great Sage of Honor, Long have you refrained from speaking this dharma, You yourself have spoken of possessing such power, fearlessness, and concentrations, Meditations, liberations, and other inconceivable dharmas.
The dharma obtained upon the seat of enlightenment, —no one has capacity to question about it. Your intention is difficult to measure, And there is none who can question you.
Without being asked, you spontaneously speak, Praising the path you have traversed, Your wisdom is supremely subtle, The attainment of all the Buddhas.
The unconditioned Arhats, And those seeking nirvāṇa, Now find themselves caught in a net of doubt— Why do you speak in this manner?
Those seeking the pratyekabuddha vehicle, The bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs, All the devas, dragons, ghosts, and spirits, And the gandharvas and others,
Gaze at each other with doubt in their hearts, Reverently looking to the Two-Footed Honored One, Asking: What is the meaning of this? I beseech the Buddha to explain.
Regarding all the Śrāvaka assembly, The Buddha has said I am foremost. But I myself harbor doubt regarding wisdom— Is this the ultimate dharma, or is it the practiced path?
Sons of the Buddha, joined hands reverently, Await in anticipation, Wishing to hear your subtle voice, At this time explaining what is truly so.
The devas, dragons, and spiritual beings, Number like Ganges' sands, The Bodhisattvas seeking the Buddha, Are eighty thousand in great number.
Moreover, all the billions of worlds, Including wheel-turning sage kings, With palms joined in reverent respect, Desire to hear the complete path.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Buddha's Hesitation and Reassurance
Then the Buddha said to Śāriputra: "Cease, cease! There is no need to speak further. If I were to explain this matter, the entire world of devas and humans would be astonished and filled with perplexity."¹¹
Śāriputra again respectfully addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I beseech you to speak! I beseech you to speak! Why is this? This assembly includes immeasurable, hundreds of thousands of billions of asankhya sentient beings who have witnessed countless Buddhas before. Their faculties are keen and sharp, their wisdom is clear and lucid. These beings, having heard the dharma the Buddha speaks, will be able to generate respectful faith."¹²
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verse on the Assembly's Readiness
Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:
O Dharma King without superior, I beseech you to speak without hesitation— This assembly contains immeasurable multitudes, Who are capable of generating respectful faith.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Buddha's Continued Reluctance
The Buddha again restrained Śāriputra, saying: "If I were to explain this matter, all the devas, humans, and asuras would be astonished. Moreover, monks seized by arrogant conceit will fall into a great abyss."¹³
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Buddha's Verse on the Difficulty of Teaching
Then the World-Honored One spoke in verse:
Cease, cease—there is no need to speak. My dharma is wonderfully difficult to conceive, Those seized by arrogant conceit, Hearing it, will generate no respectful faith.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Śāriputra's Final Entreaty
Then Śāriputra again respectfully addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I beseech you to speak! I beseech you to speak! In this assembly, there are ones comparable to myself, numbering in the hundreds of thousands and billions across countless ages. Having long been transformed by the Buddha, such persons will certainly generate respectful faith and enjoy long safety and repose, receiving immeasurable benefit."¹⁴
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verse of Śāriputra's Final Request
Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:
O Unsurpassed Two-Footed Honored One, I beseech you to teach the supreme dharma— I am the Buddha's eldest son, I alone receive your distinctions of teaching.
This assembly contains immeasurable multitudes, Capable of generating faith in this dharma. The Buddha has, through countless ages, Taught and transformed beings such as these.
All with unified, joined hands, Desire to hear the Buddha's words. We twelve hundred, Together with all who seek Buddhahood,
On behalf of this assembly, I beseech you to make distinctions clear. These beings, hearing this dharma, Will generate great joy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Buddha's Consent and the Departure of Doubters
Then the World-Honored One said to Śāriputra: "You have made your earnest request three times. How could I not speak? Now listen attentively and think carefully upon what I say. I shall make clear distinctions for you."¹⁵
At the moment the Buddha spoke these words, there arose from their seats among the assembly five thousand bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, male and female lay disciples, and they bowed to the Buddha and withdrew.¹⁶ Why was this?
"This group harbored deep karmic roots of transgression and, moreover, arrogant conceit. They presumed attainment without having truly attained, and presumed realization without having truly realized. Possessed of such failings, they did not remain. The World-Honored One, observing this, made no attempt to prevent them from departing."¹⁷
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Buddha's Affirmation of the Remaining Assembly
Then the Buddha said to Śāriputra: "Now my assembly here is entirely purified, without superfluous branches—consisting only of authentic fruit. Śāriputra, such proud and conceited persons departing is a good thing. Now listen well. I shall explain this to you. Śāriputra replied: 'Excellent, World-Honored One. I earnestly desire to hear.'"¹⁸
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE HEART OF THE TEACHING: THE ONE GREAT CAUSE
The Rarity and Incomparability of the Buddha's Teaching
The Buddha then addressed Śāriputra:
"This Wonderful Dharma is something that all the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, only rarely teach. It is comparable to the udumbara flower, which blooms but once in a very long age. Śāriputra, you and others should believe in the words of the Buddha, for the Buddha's speech is not false and cannot deceive.¹⁹
"Śāriputra, the Buddhas teach the dharma adaptively (upaya) according to circumstances and conditions, and their meaning is difficult to comprehend. Why is this?
"I employ innumerable skilful means, various causes and conditions, parables and verbal expressions to expound upon the various dharmas. This dharma cannot be comprehended through thinking and discrimination—only the Buddhas are capable of knowing it.
"Why is this? All the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world for one great cause alone. Śāriputra, what is meant by 'the Buddhas appear in the world for one great cause'?
"The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world in order to open for sentient beings the perception of Buddha-wisdom (buddha-jñāna). They appear in order to show sentient beings the Buddha-perception. They appear in order to cause sentient beings to awaken to Buddha-perception. They appear in order to guide sentient beings into the path of Buddha-perception.²⁰
"Śāriputra, this is the one great cause for which the Buddhas appear in the world."²¹
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The One Buddha Vehicle
"Śāriputra, the Buddhas teach and transform only Bodhisattvas. Whatever the Buddhas undertake to do is always for one purpose alone: to show sentient beings the Buddha-perception, to cause them to awaken to it.
"Śāriputra, because of the One Buddha Vehicle, the Tathāgata teaches the dharma to all sentient beings. There are no other vehicles—neither two nor three.²² Śāriputra, all the Buddhas of the ten directions teach the dharma in this very manner."²³
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Universal Attainment Through One Vehicle
"Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the past employed innumerable skilful means, various causes and conditions, parables and verbal expressions to expound upon the various dharmas. All these dharmas were for the One Buddha Vehicle alone. The sentient beings who heard the dharma from these Buddhas ultimately obtained the wisdom-knowing-all-aspects (sarvākārajñatā).²⁴
"Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the future shall appear in the world, and they too shall employ innumerable skilful means, various causes and conditions, parables and verbal expressions to expound upon the various dharmas. All these dharmas will be for the One Buddha Vehicle alone. The sentient beings who hear the dharma from these Buddhas shall ultimately obtain the wisdom-knowing-all-aspects.
"Śāriputra, in the present age, in the boundless, countless, billion-fold Buddha-lands of the ten directions, the World-Honored Ones who dwell there bring immeasurable benefit and peace to sentient beings. These Buddhas too employ innumerable skilful means, various causes and conditions, parables and verbal expressions to expound upon the various dharmas. All these dharmas are for the One Buddha Vehicle alone. The sentient beings who hear the dharma from these Buddhas shall ultimately obtain the wisdom-knowing-all-aspects.
"Śāriputra, these Buddhas teach and transform only Bodhisattvas, desiring to show sentient beings the Buddha-perception, desiring to cause sentient beings to awaken to the Buddha-perception, desiring to guide sentient beings into the path of Buddha-perception.
"Śāriputra, I too am now in precisely this manner. Knowing that sentient beings possess various desires, deeply attached according to their fundamental natures, I employ various causes and conditions, parables and verbal expressions, skilful means, to expound the dharma for them. Śāriputra, in all these ways, my purpose is to realize the One Buddha Vehicle and the wisdom-knowing-all-aspects."²⁵
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Denial of the Three Vehicles in Absolute Reality
"Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions, there do not even exist two vehicles, much less three. Śāriputra, the Buddhas appear in the world amid the five corruptions and turbidities²⁶—namely, the corruption of the age, the corruption of afflictions, the corruption of sentient beings, the corruption of views, and the corruption of lifespan.
"Thus, Śāriputra, when the age is corrupted and turbid, sentient beings are weighted with defilements, stingy and jealous, and have accumulated roots of unwholesomeness. Therefore, the Buddhas, by means of skilful means-power, within the One Buddha Vehicle, make distinctions and teach the three vehicles.²⁷
"Śāriputra, if my disciples, claiming to be Arhats or Pratyekabuddhas, do not hear about this matter—that the Tathāgata teaches and transforms only Bodhisattvas—then they are not disciples of the Buddha, not Arhats, and not Pratyekabuddhas."²⁸
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The False Claim of Arhatship
"Moreover, Śāriputra, those bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs who claim they have already attained the state of Arhat, that this is their final body, and that they have ultimately realized nirvāṇa, and therefore no longer aspire to realize anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi—you should understand that such persons are seized by arrogant conceit.
"Why is this? If a bhikṣu truly attains Arhatship, if he does not believe in this dharma, such a situation is impossible.²⁹ [Exception exists only] when the Buddha has entered parinirvāṇa and no Buddha is present in the world.
"Why is this? After the Buddha enters parinirvāṇa, if there are persons who receive, read, recite, and understand the meaning of sutras such as this, these persons are rare indeed. When they encounter another Buddha, regarding this dharma they will attain decisive understanding.
"Śāriputra, you and all others should generate one-pointed faith and understanding, and receive and uphold the Buddha's words. The Tathāgata and all other Buddhas do not speak falsity. There are no other vehicles—the Buddha Vehicle alone exists."³⁰
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verse Recapitulation of the One Vehicle Teaching
Then the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:
Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs, Those harboring arrogant conceit, Male lay practitioners of pride, Female lay practitioners of faithlessness,
Such among these four groups, Numbering five thousand in total, Who do not perceive their own shortcomings, With respect to the precepts possessing flaws,
Who protect and hide their defects— The small-minded have now departed, The chaff among the assembly, Gone due to the Buddha's majesty.
Now this assembly contains no branches, Consisting entirely of authentic fruit. Śāriputra, listen carefully! The dharma the Buddhas obtain,
Is through immeasurable skilful means-power, That they teach the various dharmas to sentient beings. The beings' hearts' intentions, The various paths they pursue,
The differing desires and natures, And the wholesome and unwholesome deeds from the past— The Buddha, having completely understood all this, By means of causes, conditions, parables, and verbal expressions,
And skilful means-power, Teaches all beings to their joy. Teaching sutras and poetic gathas, Stories and previous lives,
And also on causes and conditions, Parables, verses, and analytic discourse— Those of dull faculties who delight in small dharmas, Clinging to birth and death,
Among the countless Buddhas, Not practicing the profound subtle path, Troubled by all sufferings, For such beings I teach nirvāṇa.
I create this skilful means, To enable them to enter Buddha-wisdom, Never before have I taught that you, Should attain the Buddha path.
Why have I not taught this before? Because the time for speaking had not yet come. Now at last the time has arrived— I shall now decisively teach the great vehicle.
These nine categories of teaching, I teach in accordance with sentient beings, Taking the great vehicle as the foundation, Therefore I teach this sutra.
There are Buddha-children, Pure of heart and of pliable faculties, Who have before countless Buddhas, Practiced the profound subtle path.
For all such Buddha-children, I teach this great-vehicle sutra. I prophesy to such beings, That in the future they shall become Buddhas,
Because of deep mindfulness toward the Buddha, And constant cultivation of pure precepts. Upon hearing the Buddha's dharma, Great joy fills their entire bodies.
The Buddha knows their minds and deeds, And therefore teaches them the great vehicle. Whether Śrāvakas or Bodhisattvas, Who hear the dharma I teach,
Even to the extent of a single verse, All shall without doubt become Buddhas. In the Buddha-lands of the ten directions, There exists only the One Vehicle dharma—
Neither two nor three. Except for the Buddhas' skilful means-teaching, Which merely uses provisional names, To guide sentient beings,
Speaking of Buddha-wisdom. All the Buddhas who appear in the world, Accomplish this single real principle, While the other two are not true.
They shall never employ the small vehicle, To liberate any sentient being at all. The Buddha dwells in the great vehicle, In accordance with the dharma obtained,
Adorned with concentrated power and wisdom, With this they liberate sentient beings. Having themselves realized the supreme path, The impartial dharma of the great vehicle,
If one were to use the small vehicle, Even to transform a single person, I would fall into stinginess and attachment— This is an impossible matter.
If a person takes refuge in the Buddha, The Tathāgata does not deceive or betray, Nor harbors any stingy or jealous intent, But severs all evil dharmas.
Therefore the Buddha, in the ten directions, Stands alone without fear. I adorn my body with the sublime marks, And my light illuminates the world.
Honored by countless multitudes, To proclaim the seal of the real nature of reality.³¹ Śāriputra, you should know, I have established the original vow,
Desiring that all beings, Would be equal with me. As I vowed in the past, Now this is fully accomplished—
I teach all sentient beings, Causing them to enter the Buddha path. If I encounter any sentient being, I teach them all the Buddha path—
Those without wisdom become confused, Bewildered and unable to receive the teaching. I know such sentient beings, Have never cultivated wholesome roots,
Firmly attached to the five desires, Caused suffering by delusion and craving. Because of various desire-conditions, They fall and descend into the three evil paths,
Circling through the six destinies, Completely experiencing all suffering and pain, Receiving tiny embryonic forms, Continually increasing through world after world.
Those of slight virtue and meager good fortune, Pressed upon by all sufferings, Enter into forests of perverted views— Viewing existence and non-existence equally.
Relying on such perverted views, Possessed of sixty-two such views, Deeply attached to false dharmas, Firmly grasping them as inseparable,
With self-pride and exalted conceit, Scheming hearts and untruthful intentions, For billions of eons, They hear not the Buddha's name,
Nor hear the correct dharma— Such beings are difficult to liberate. Therefore, Śāriputra, I create skilful means,
Teaching all dharmas that exhaust suffering, Showing them nirvāṇa. Although I teach nirvāṇa, This is also not true extinction.
For all dharmas have, From the beginning, the characteristic of quiescence. Buddha-children practicing the path, In the future will become Buddhas.
I possess skilful means-power, Opening and revealing the three-vehicle dharmas. All the World-Honored Ones, All speak the one-vehicle path—
In this assembly, All should cast off their doubts. The language of the Buddhas is without variance— Only One Vehicle without a second.
In past countless eons, Countless, immeasurable Buddhas have passed away, A hundred thousand billion types, Beyond measure in number.
All such World-Honored Ones, Through various causes, conditions, and parables, Immeasurable skilful means-power, Expounded the characteristics of various dharmas.
All these World-Honored Ones, All taught the one-vehicle dharma, Transforming countless sentient beings, Causing them to enter the Buddha path.
Again, all the great sage-rulers, Knowing all the world— Devas, humans, and all other living kinds, The deep desires of their hearts—
By means of alternative skilful means, They further reveal the supreme reality.³² If there are sentient beings, Who encounter the Buddhas of the past,
Or hearing the dharma of giving, Or maintaining precepts, practicing patience, Exerting effort, meditation, and wisdom— Cultivating all manner of virtue and good fortune—
All such persons, Have already become Buddhas. After the Buddhas have passed away, If beings possess gentle, soft hearts,
All such sentient beings, Have already become Buddhas. After the Buddhas have passed away, Those who make offerings to the relics,
Erecting billions of kinds of stūpas, Of gold, silver, and crystal, Beryl and agate, Pearls and jewels—
Brightly adorned with purity, Decorated and ornate with many stūpas, Or building stone temples, Sandalwood and aloe-wood,
Timber and other materials, Brick, tile, clay and earth— Or in wastelands, Accumulating earth into Buddha shrines,
Even children at play, Piling sand to make Buddha stūpas— All such persons as these, Have already become Buddhas.
If a person, for the Buddha's sake, Establishes all manner of Buddha images, Carving and sculpting all kinds of forms— All have already become Buddhas.
Made from the seven precious substances, Copper, stone, red and white bronze, White lead and tin, Wood and clay, etc.—
Or with glue, lacquer, and cloth, All adorned as Buddha images— All such persons as these, Have already become Buddhas.
Painted and rendered as Buddha images, Adorned with the hundred-fold blessings— Whether one creates or directs others to create— All have already become Buddhas.
Even to the extent that children in play, With grass, wood, or a brush, Or with their fingernails or teeth, Paint Buddha images—
All such persons as these, Gradually accumulate blessed merit, Complete the heart of great compassion, And have already become Buddhas.
Transforming only Bodhisattvas, Liberating countless sentient beings. If a person, in stūpas or temples, With precious images and painted ones,
Makes offerings with flowers, incense, banners, and canopies, With a heart of reverent respect. Or causes music to be made, Striking drums and blowing horns and conches,
Flutes, lyres, and harps, Lutes and cymbals, and brass bells— All such marvelous sounds, Are employed in making offerings.
Or with a joyful heart, One sings hymns praising the Buddha's virtue— To the extent of even one small utterance, All have already become Buddhas.
If a person with distracted mind, Even offers a single flower, To a painted Buddha image, They shall gradually see countless Buddhas.
Or if someone bows, Or merely joins their palms, Lifts a single hand, Or even slightly bows the head,
In making offerings to an image— They shall gradually perceive countless Buddhas. And will themselves attain the supreme path, Widely liberating countless sentient beings,
Entering the unconditioned parinirvāṇa, Like fire extinguished when fuel is exhausted. If a person with scattered mind, Enters into a stūpa or temple,
And utters a single "Homage to the Buddha," All have already become Buddhas. Regarding past Buddhas, Both in their living presence and after their passing,
If any being hears this dharma, All have already become Buddhas. The future World-Honored Ones, Shall be boundless in number,
All such Tathāgatas, Shall also teach the dharma through skilful means. All the Tathāgatas, Through immeasurable skilful means-power,
Liberate all sentient beings, Causing them to enter the Buddha's unconditioned wisdom. If there is one who hears the dharma, There is none who shall not become a Buddha.
All the Buddhas' original vows, Are that the path I have practiced, I universally desire all sentient beings, To attain this path equally.
The future World-Honored Ones, Though teaching hundreds of billions, Of countless dharma-teachings, In reality constitute but one vehicle.
All the Buddhas, the two-footed honored ones, Know that dharma is ever without nature, Buddha-seed arises from conditions— *Therefore they teach the one vehicle.*³³
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion: The Truth of the Teaching
"This dharma dwells in the dharmic position; the characteristics of the world ever remain constant. Upon the seat of enlightenment, having understood this, the guide teaches it through skilful means.³⁴
"The beings honored by heaven and people, the present Buddhas in the ten directions, numbering like Ganges' sands, appearing in the world in order to bring peace to sentient beings, all teach this same dharma.
"Understanding supreme quiescence through skilful means-power, although they show various paths, in reality this is the Buddha Vehicle. Understanding sentient beings' practices, the deep desires of their hearts, their past habits and karmic deeds, the desires and exertions of their faculties, dull and keen—through various causes, conditions, parables, and verbal expressions, they teach adaptively according to circumstances.
"I too am now in this manner, bringing peace to sentient beings through infinite dharma-teachings, revealing the Buddha path.
"I employ the power of wisdom to know sentient beings' natures and desires, teaching the dharmas through skilful means such that all attain joy.
"Śāriputra, with the Buddha-eye I observe the six-path sentient beings—poor, without virtue and good fortune, entering the dangerous path of birth and death, their suffering continuously unceasing, deeply attached to the five desires, like oxen attached to their own tails, blinded by greed and affection, unseeing.
"They do not seek the power of the great Mahāsattva Buddha, nor seek the dharma that cuts suffering; they deeply enter perverted views, and with suffering seek to transcend suffering.
"For the sake of such sentient beings, I generate the mind of great compassion.
"When I initially sat upon the seat of enlightenment, observing the trees and practicing circumambulation, within twenty-one days, I contemplated this matter: The wisdom I have obtained is subtle and supreme; sentient beings are dull-witted, bound by blindness and suffering—how can they be liberated?
"At that time, all the Brahmā kings, the devas of India, the Four Heavenly Kings, and the great Maheśvara devas, together with all celestial retinues numbering in the hundreds of thousands and millions, showed respect through palms joined in salutation, requesting me to turn the Dharma wheel.
"I then reflected within myself: If I merely praise the Buddha Vehicle, sentient beings submerged in suffering will be unable to generate faith in this dharma. If they reject the dharma due to faithlessness, they will fall into the three evil paths. It would be better for me not to teach the dharma and to quickly enter parinirvāṇa.³⁵
"Then I recalled the skilful means-power of the Buddhas of the past. Now, the path I have obtained should also employ teaching of the three vehicles.
"While contemplating this matter, all the Buddhas of the ten directions appeared to me and spoke with voices of Brahmā, comforting me: 'Well done, Śākyamuni, supreme guide! We have also obtained this dharma. In accordance with the conduct of all the Buddhas, we employ skilful means-power.
"'We too have all attained the supreme, most wonderful dharma. In order to teach all sentient beings, we make distinctions among the three vehicles. Although we teach the three vehicles, it is only to guide Bodhisattvas.
"'Those of limited wisdom delight in small dharmas and do not generate faith that they shall become Buddhas. This is why we employ skilful means, distinguishing the results.
"'Although we teach the three vehicles, in reality we guide all toward the Bodhisattva path.'
"Śāriputra, upon hearing the words of these Buddha-sages, and recalling their words, I rejoiced and called out, 'Homage to the Buddhas!' and contemplated this matter further.³⁶
"I realized that the appearance of Buddhas in the world is to teach Buddha-wisdom. And now is precisely the time to teach this dharma.³⁷
"Śāriputra, you should know: Those of dull faculties, those of limited wisdom, those seized by attachment and arrogant conceit, are unable to generate faith in this dharma.
"Now I am glad and without fear regarding all Bodhisattvas. I shall forthwith abandon skilful means and teach only the supreme path.
"The Bodhisattvas, having heard this dharma, will have their nets of doubt completely severed. The twelve hundred Arhats shall all become Buddhas.³⁸
"Just as all the Buddhas of the three times teach the dharma through such methods, I now likewise teach the undifferentiated dharma.
"The appearance of Buddhas in the world is extraordinarily rare, and the chance to encounter them is difficult; even if one encounters them, to hear this dharma is rare; and the capacity to listen to this dharma is rare indeed.
"It is comparable to the udumbara flower, which all love and esteem, which devas and humans regard as rare, appearing only at certain times.
"One who hears this dharma with joyful praise, even to the extent of uttering a single word, has already made offerings to all the Buddhas of the three times. Such a person is extremely rare, surpassing even the udumbara flower.
"You should harbor no doubt! I am the Dharma King of all dharmas,³⁹ and I hereby universally announce to the great assembly: It is through the One Buddha Vehicle alone that I teach the Bodhisattvas. There are no voice-hearer disciples.
"You, Śāriputra, together with all voice-hearers and Bodhisattvas, should understand that this wonderful dharma is the secret treasury of all the Buddhas.⁴⁰
"Because the five corruptions exist in this evil world, sentient beings delight in and cling to various desires. Such beings will never seek the Buddha path. When those evil-natured humans of the future age hear the Buddha teaching the One Vehicle, confused and faithless, they will reject the dharma and fall into the evil paths.⁴¹
"But for those possessing shame and purity, seeking the Buddha path, I shall extensively praise the One Vehicle path.
"Śāriputra, you should know: The dharma of all Buddhas is thus—through immeasurable skilful means, teaching dharmas according to circumstances. Those who have not studied and learned cannot fully comprehend this.⁴²
"Now that you have already understood the Buddhas' nature and the matter of teaching through skilful means, without any further doubts, your hearts generate great joy, and you shall surely become Buddhas."

SCHOLARLY APPARATUS
Footnote Commentary
1. "Emerged from meditation with composed serenity" (從三昧安詳而起): The phrase 安詳 (anshang) suggests calm, measured, and deliberate movement, indicating that the Buddha's emergence from deep meditative absorption occurs with perfect composure. This physical embodiment of tranquility establishes the tone for the profound teachings to follow.
2. "The Buddha's accomplishment of unprecedented teachings" (成就甚深未曾有法): The phrase "unprecedented" (未曾有) is repeated throughout this chapter and suggests that the Buddha's realization transcends all previous understanding and comprehension. This emphasizes the revolutionary nature of the Lotus Sutra's core message.
3. "Transcend all forms of attachment and clinging" (令離諸著): The Sanskrit term taṇhā (craving/clinging) is fundamental to Buddhist psychology. Attachment to fixed views, identities, and objects is understood as the root cause of suffering, and liberation requires transcending these forms of grasping.
4. Philosophical Parallel: In existentialist philosophy, Sartre's concept of "bad faith" similarly refers to the human tendency to cling to fixed identities and predetermined essences rather than acknowledging radical freedom and responsibility.
5. "Words gentle and soft that bring joy to the hearts of all beings" (言辭柔軟，悅可眾心): This phrase describes the skillful communication of ultimate truth through language that is psychologically attuned to listeners' capacities. It represents a profound understanding that the transmission of wisdom requires not merely intellectual accuracy but emotional and relational appropriateness.
6. "The Tathāgata has accomplished infinite, boundless, unprecedented teachings" (無量無邊未曾有法，佛悉成就): This statement establishes that Buddha-wisdom is not limited or partial but comprehensive and complete, transcending all previous conceptual frameworks and categories.
7. "The supremely rare and extraordinary teaching" (佛所成就第一稀有難解之法): The use of "supremely rare" (第一稀有) suggests that the teaching is not merely difficult but represents a categorical transcendence of ordinary understanding.
8. "Ten dharmic characteristics" (十如是): The ten characteristics listed—characteristics, nature, body, power, activity, cause, condition, effect, retribution, and beginning-and-end equality—constitute the Buddhist understanding of the fundamental structure of reality. These aren't merely philosophical abstractions but describe how any phenomenon (dharma) manifests across multiple dimensions of understanding.
9. Metaphysical Significance: This passage suggests that ultimate reality is not some transcendent realm beyond the phenomenal world but rather a comprehensive understanding of how all phenomena actually are in their suchness (tathatā).
10. "One meaning of liberation" (一解脫義): The phrase indicates that the disciples understood a single type of liberation (Arhatship) but did not grasp the fuller implications for universal Buddhahood.
11. "We do not understand toward what end this teaching aims" (而今不知是義所趨): The assembly's confusion indicates a crisis of understanding—they believed they had achieved the ultimate goal but are now uncertain whether the Buddha is suggesting something beyond their attainment.
12. Śāriputra's respectful inquiry: Śāriputra, foremost among the Buddha's disciples in wisdom, serves as the representative questioner for the entire assembly. His willingness to ask despite his own great learning establishes the appropriate epistemic humility for receiving the Buddha's teaching.
13. "The entire world of devas and humans would be astonished" (一切世間諸天及人，皆當驚疑): The Buddha's hesitation suggests that the teaching is so revolutionary that it threatens the entire cosmological and spiritual worldview that has been established.
14. Hermeneutical Note: This hesitation is a rhetorical device that creates narrative tension and emphasizes the radical nature of what is about to be taught.
15. "Their faculties are keen and sharp, their wisdom is clear and lucid" (諸根猛利，智慧明了): These adjectives describe practitioners who have developed their spiritual capacity through long training and thus are capable of receiving teachings that would confound those of lesser attainment.
16. "Monks seized by arrogant conceit will fall into a great abyss" (增上慢比丘、將墜於大坑): The concept of "arrogant conceit" (增上慢) refers to the false presumption of attainment—claiming realization one has not actually achieved. This is presented as a serious spiritual danger.
17. "Ones comparable to yourself... across countless ages" (如我等比、百千萬億，世世已曾從佛受化): This phrase indicates that the assembly includes not merely contemporary practitioners but those who have been cultivated by the Buddha across countless lifetimes, suggesting a deeply rooted spiritual readiness.
18. "You have made your earnest request three times" (汝已殷勤三請): The threefold request (a classical rhetorical pattern in Buddhist texts) establishes sufficient earnestness to justify the Buddha's consent. In Buddhist narrative convention, three requests constitute a binding obligation to respond.
19. "Five thousand departed" (五千人等，即從座起，禮佛而退): This departure is highly significant—those whose karmic roots are not yet sufficiently developed cannot remain to hear the supreme teaching. The number five thousand may be symbolic rather than literal.
20. "Deep karmic roots of transgression and arrogant conceit" (此輩罪根深重，及增上慢): The Buddhist understanding of karma (Sanskrit: karma; Chinese: 業, yè) refers to actions and their inevitable consequences. Those with deep roots of transgression (negative karma) cannot generate the faith necessary to receive the supreme teaching.
21. "Entirely purified, without superfluous branches—consisting only of authentic fruit" (無復枝葉，純有貞實): This metaphor suggests that what remains is the essential core of authentic practitioners, with all extraneous elements removed. The contrast between "branches" (superficial growth) and "fruit" (true attainment) represents quality over quantity.
22. "The udumbara flower, which blooms but once in a very long age" (如優曇缽華，時一現耳): In Buddhist legend, the udumbara (Sanskrit: udumbara) flower is an extraordinarily rare celestial blossom that blooms only once in three thousand years. Its extreme rarity makes it the perfect metaphor for the infrequency of Buddha-teaching and human capacity to receive it.
23. Comparative Significance: This metaphor appears in multiple Buddhist texts and represents a universal principle—that the opportunity to encounter true teaching is exceedingly rare.
24. "Four aspects of Buddha-perception" (開佛知見、示佛知見、悟佛知見、入佛知見): These four aspects represent progressive stages: (1) opening the gateway to Buddha-wisdom, (2) showing or revealing Buddha-wisdom, (3) enabling awakening to Buddha-wisdom, and (4) guiding entry into the path of Buddha-wisdom. Together they suggest a comprehensive transformation of consciousness.
25. Epistemological Significance: These four phrases describe the complete pedagogical process through which the Buddha transforms the consciousness of sentient beings from ignorance to enlightenment.
26. "The One Great Cause" (一大事因緣): This phrase is central to the Lotus Sutra's metaphysics. The "one great cause" (singular, unified) for which all Buddhas appear in the world is to enable all sentient beings to realize Buddha-wisdom. All other teachings and paths are understood as manifestations of this one fundamental purpose.
27. Metaphysical Principle: This represents the Lotus Sutra's assertion of ultimate unity—beneath apparent multiplicity of teachings and paths lies a singular, unified purpose and reality.
28. "Neither two nor three" (無有餘乘，若二、若三): This statement directly denies the validity of the three vehicles as ultimate reality. While the Buddha teaches through the framework of three vehicles (adapted to different capacities), ultimate truth is singular and unified.
29. "All the Buddhas of the ten directions teach the dharma in this very manner" (一切十方諸佛，法亦如是): This universal principle establishes that the teaching of the One Vehicle is not unique to Śākyamuni but characteristic of all Buddhas throughout time and space. It is a cosmic principle rather than a particular doctrine.
30. "The wisdom-knowing-all-aspects" (一切種智): This term represents the comprehensive, all-knowing wisdom of Buddhahood—consciousness that simultaneously perceives all phenomena in all their aspects and relationships. It is the ultimate goal of Buddhist practice.
31. Systems Theory Parallel: This concept might be understood as analogous to systems-thinking awareness that perceives complex wholes while comprehending individual components and their interrelationships.
32. "My purpose is to realize the One Buddha Vehicle and the wisdom-knowing-all-aspects" (皆為得一佛乘、一切種智故): This explicit statement of the Buddha's motivation unifies the various teachings around a single purpose—to guide all beings to comprehensive wisdom and enlightenment.
33. "Five corruptions and turbidities" (五濁): These are: (1) corruption of the age—the world's degeneration, (2) corruption of afflictions—the intensification of mental defilements, (3) corruption of sentient beings—the degradation of living beings' capacities, (4) corruption of views—the proliferation of perverted understandings, (5) corruption of lifespan—the shortening of human life. These represent the conditions that make direct teaching of Buddha-wisdom difficult and necessitate skilful means.
34. Cosmological Significance: The concept of five corruptions places the Lotus Sutra in a particular historical moment—the age of dharma-decline (mappo in Japanese Buddhism)—when beings are less capable of understanding the full teaching and thus require graduated instruction.
35. "The Buddhas... within the One Buddha Vehicle, make distinctions and teach the three vehicles" (諸佛以方便力，於一佛乘、分別說三): This is the central formulation of skilful means—the three vehicles are not separate ultimate realities but distinctions made for pedagogical purposes within the unified framework of the One Buddha Vehicle. This represents a radical reconceptualization of Buddhist teaching hierarchy.
36. Philosophical Innovation: This teaching revolutionizes Buddhist thought by asserting that apparent contradictions in Buddhist doctrine (the three vehicles) are not genuinely contradictory but represent different presentations of a unified truth.
37. "Not disciples of the Buddha, not Arhats, and not Pratyekabuddhas" (此非佛弟子，非阿羅漢，非辟支佛): This statement has profound implications—one who hears the teaching of universal Buddha-nature but refuses to believe it disqualifies oneself from authentic discipleship, regardless of one's formal status or past attainments.
38. "If he does not believe in this dharma, such a situation is impossible" (若不信此法，無有是處): This assertion establishes a logical principle—if someone has truly realized Arhatship (direct realization of the nature of conditioned existence), they must necessarily accept the teaching of universal Buddha-nature because it follows from understanding dependent origination.
39. "There are no other vehicles—the Buddha Vehicle alone exists" (無有餘乘，唯一佛乘): This direct statement denies the ultimate validity of the three-vehicle framework and asserts the singular ultimacy of the Buddha Vehicle. This represents the Lotus Sutra's most radical metaphysical claim.
40. "The seal of the real nature of reality" (實相印): The "seal" (mudra) represents an official stamp of authenticity. The "real nature of reality" (實相) refers to the ultimate, unchanging nature of all phenomena as understood in Buddhist philosophy.
41. "Further reveal the supreme reality" (助顯第一義): The phrase "supreme reality" (第一義) refers to the ultimate, unconditioned dimension beyond ordinary conceptual understanding. All skilful means ultimately serve to reveal this supreme reality.
42. "Buddha-seed arises from conditions—Therefore they teach the one vehicle" (佛種從緣起，是故說一乘): This condensed philosophical statement suggests that Buddhahood itself arises through dependent origination (conditioned arising)—it is not a fixed, transcendent state but emerges through the causes and conditions of practice and receiving the teaching. Therefore, all beings who encounter the conditions (hearing the teaching) possess the capacity for Buddhahood.
43. Metaphysical Significance: This represents a profound synthesis—the principle of dependent origination (the most fundamental Buddhist principle) is applied to understand Buddhahood itself as arising through conditions rather than being a transcendent, unchanging state.
44. "This dharma dwells in the dharmic position; the characteristics of the world ever remain constant" (是法住法位，世間相常住): This statement suggests that the dharma described is not something new or artificially constructed but rather the eternal, unchanging nature of reality itself. The "dharmic position" refers to reality's fundamental structure.
45. "Enter parinirvāṇa" (疾入於涅槃): The Buddha's contemplation of whether to teach or immediately enter parinirvāṇa establishes the profound difficulty of the teaching task. The Buddha recognizes that teaching the one vehicle risks rejection and thus descent into evil paths, whereas entering parinirvāṇa would spare beings from this danger.
46. Narrative Significance: This inner dialogue establishes that the Buddha's ultimate choice to teach represents a compassionate sacrifice—accepting the risk that some will reject and thereby fall into negative karmic consequences, in order that others might receive the supreme teaching.
47. "Words of the Buddha-sages" (聖師子 / 聖師獅): The metaphor of "lion" (lion-roar, simhanada) refers to the Buddha's fearless proclamation of truth. The lion's roar is traditionally understood as symbolic of the Buddha's teachings that cut through all opposing views.
48. "Now is precisely the time to teach this dharma" (今正是其時): This establishes a principle of temporal appropriateness—teachings must be given at the right moment in history and in the development of individual practitioners' consciousness. Premature or delayed teaching lacks efficacy.
49. "The twelve hundred Arhats shall all become Buddhas" (千二百羅漢、悉亦當作佛): This prophecy, extended to all present disciples, symbolizes the universal capacity for Buddhahood and represents the complete overturning of previous hierarchies that placed Arhatship as the ultimate goal for disciples.
50. "I am the Dharma King of all dharmas" (我為諸法王): This title asserts the Buddha's supreme authority and mastery over all teachings and dharmas, establishing him as the source and arbiter of all valid understanding.
51. "The secret treasury of all the Buddhas" (諸佛之秘要): The teaching of the One Vehicle is described as the "secret treasury" (秘要)—a precious, hidden teaching that has been reserved and protected by Buddhas throughout history, now revealed to fortunate practitioners.
52. Hermeneutical Significance: The concept of "secret" (in Buddhist hermeneutics) does not mean intentionally hidden from some while revealed to others, but rather refers to teachings that are accessible only to those with sufficient spiritual capacity to comprehend them.
53. "Evil-natured humans of the future age" (當來世惡人): This reference to future ages suggests that the Lotus Sutra anticipates a time of spiritual degeneration when beings will be less capable of receiving the supreme teaching. This reflects the Buddhist historical periodization of mappō (the latter age of dharma decline).
54. "Those who have not studied and learned cannot fully comprehend this" (其不習學者，不能曉了此): This final statement establishes that understanding the Lotus Sutra's teaching on skilful means requires prior cultivation—study, practice, and training in Buddhist philosophy and meditation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY CONCEPTS INTRODUCED IN CHAPTER 2
Skilful Means (Upaya / 方便)
The central concept of Chapter 2—that all Buddhist teachings, even apparently contradictory ones, are expressions of a single unified purpose. The Buddha adapts teachings to different capacities and circumstances while aiming at a singular ultimate realization.
Philosophical Significance: This concept resolves apparent contradictions in Buddhist doctrine by asserting that differences in teaching reflect differences in method (upaya) rather than differences in truth. All paths lead to the same destination, though the routes vary.
Contemporary Parallel: In modern systems thinking, skilful means parallels the principle that complex systems can be understood through multiple valid frameworks and descriptions, each appropriate to particular contexts and perspectives.
The One Buddha Vehicle (一佛乘)
While the Buddha teaches through the framework of three vehicles (Śrāvaka, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva), ultimate reality recognizes only the One Buddha Vehicle—the universal path to complete Buddhahood.
Metaphysical Implication: This represents a fundamental assertion about the nature of ultimate reality as unified and singular, beneath apparent multiplicity.
Universal Buddha-nature
Chapter 2 reaffirms and develops the principle introduced in Chapter 1: all sentient beings without exception possess Buddha-nature and thus possess the intrinsic capacity to become Buddhas.
The Five Corruptions (五濁)
These represent the historical moment and conditions that necessitate skilful means—a world of spiritual degeneration in which beings cannot directly comprehend Buddha-wisdom and thus require graduated instruction.
The Transcendence of Language and Concept
The repeated assertion that Buddha-wisdom "cannot be expressed in words" and "transcends thinking and discrimination" points to a non-dualistic understanding that reality surpasses conceptual understanding. Yet paradoxically, the Buddha employs infinite skilful means of language, metaphor, and parable to communicate this truth.
