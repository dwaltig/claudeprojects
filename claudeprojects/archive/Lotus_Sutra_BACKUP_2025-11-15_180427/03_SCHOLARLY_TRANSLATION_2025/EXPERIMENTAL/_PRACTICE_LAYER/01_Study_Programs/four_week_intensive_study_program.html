<li>Journal: "Where do I see myself in the universal assembly?" (10 min)</li>
<li>Meditate with the three-fold manifestation (light, flowers, trembling) (15 min)</li></ol>

<p>---</p>
<h4><strong>Day 2: Chapter 2 - The Expedient Means (方便品第二)</strong></h4>
<strong>Theme</strong>: The One Vehicle, different paths pointing to same goal, the parable of the three carts

<p>---</p>
<h4><strong>Day 3: Chapter 3 - The Burning House Parable (譬喩品第三)</strong></h4>
<strong>Theme</strong>: The burning house metaphor, urgency of dharma, skillful methods adapted to capacity
<strong>Focus</strong>: Understand why the Buddha uses stories and how they point beyond themselves

<p>---</p>
<h4><strong>Day 4: Chapter 4 - Belief and Understanding (信解品第四)</strong></h4>
<strong>Theme</strong>: Removing doubts, understanding that hearing is itself transformation, rejoicing in faith

<h2>After the Four Weeks</h2>
<h3><strong>Sustaining Your Practice</strong></h3>

<p>---</p>

<p>---</p>
<h2>If You Fall Behind</h2>
<p>The program is intensive. If you fall behind:</p>
<strong>Do NOT abandon the practice.</strong>
<p>Instead:
<ol><li>Reduce to 2-3 chapters per week (stretch to 6-8 weeks)</li>
<li>Focus on prose sections only; skip verse on first read</li>
<li>Use study guides but abbreviate journal reflections</li>
<li>Maintain daily meditation even if not reading</li></ol></p>
<p>The most important thing is <strong>consistency</strong>, not speed. A slower, sustained practice is more valuable than trying to rush and then stopping.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>Support Resources</h2>
<h3><strong>If Studying Alone</strong></h3>
<ul><ol><li>Find a practice buddy to check in with weekly</li>
<li>Join an online dharma community</li>
<li>Seek a teacher via your local Buddhist center</li>
<li>Use the reflection journal consistently</li></ol></ul>
<h3><strong>If Studying in a Group</strong></h3>
<ul><ol><li>Meet weekly to discuss the 7 chapters</li>
<li>Rotate leadership</li>
<li>Practice meditation together</li>
<li>Hold each other accountable</li></ol></ul>
<h3><strong>If Feeling Stuck</strong></h3>
<ul><ol><li>Return to Chapter 1's focal point (the three-fold manifestation)</li>
<li>Practice a daily dharma extract</li>
<li>Reach out to a teacher or friend</li>
<li>Sit in silence with the teaching</li></ol></ul>
<p>---</p>
<h2>Final Notes</h2>
<p>This intensive month will transform your understanding and open pathways of practice that may unfold for the rest of your life. The Lotus Sutra is not something you "complete"—it's something you gradually wake up to.</p>
<p>Some teachings from this month will be crystal clear; others will remain mysterious. Both are valuable. The mysterious ones are seeds—they'll sprout when conditions are right.</p>
<p>Trust the process. Trust yourself. Trust the Buddha who appears in these pages and also in your own deepest nature.</p>
<strong>May this practice serve your awakening and the awakening of all beings.</strong>
<p>---</p>
<strong>Ready to Begin? Start Week 0 today.</strong>
<p>The transformation awaits.</p>
