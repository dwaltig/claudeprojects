---

## If You Fall Behind

The program is intensive. If you fall behind:

**Do NOT abandon the practice.**

Instead:
1. Reduce to 2-3 chapters per week (stretch to 6-8 weeks)
2. Focus on prose sections only; skip verse on first read
3. Use study guides but abbreviate journal reflections
4. Maintain daily meditation even if not reading

The most important thing is **consistency**, not speed. A slower, sustained practice is more valuable than trying to rush and then stopping.

---

## Support Resources

### **If Studying Alone**

### **If Studying in a Group**

## Final Notes

This intensive month will transform your understanding and open pathways of practice that may unfold for the rest of your life. The Lotus Sutra is not something you "complete"—it's something you gradually wake up to.

Some teachings from this month will be crystal clear; others will remain mysterious. Both are valuable. The mysterious ones are seeds—they'll sprout when conditions are right.

Trust the process. Trust yourself. Trust the Buddha who appears in these pages and also in your own deepest nature.

**May this practice serve your awakening and the awakening of all beings.**

**Ready to Begin? Start Week 0 today.**

The transformation awaits.
