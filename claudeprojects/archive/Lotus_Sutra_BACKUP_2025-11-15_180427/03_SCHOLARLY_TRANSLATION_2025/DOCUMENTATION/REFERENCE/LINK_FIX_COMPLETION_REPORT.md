<!-- AFTER (helpful message + working links) -->
<p style="color: #666; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
    📚 <strong>Study Guide for this chapter is coming soon.</strong>
    In the meantime, explore our <a href="../index.html#practice">practice materials</a>
    and <a href="../_PRACTICE_LAYER/00_START_HERE/INDEX_READ_ME_FIRST.md">complete practice guide</a>.

```

## Next Steps

### When Creating New Study Guides

As each new chapter study guide is created, uncomment/activate the link in that chapter:

**Chapters to Create (Tier 1 - Highest Impact):**
1. **Chapter 16** (Buddha's Eternal Lifespan) - ~5-6 hours
2. **Chapter 23** (Medicine King) - ~5-6 hours
3. **Chapter 25** (Avalokiteśvara) - Already partially complete, ~2-3 hours to finish

**After Tier 1 completion:** Move to Tier 2 (Chapters 4-8, 10, 14, 20-22)

**Timeline:** Using GUIDE_GENERATOR_SYSTEM.md framework, estimate 95-115 hours for all 24 remaining guides over 3-4 months at 10 hrs/week.

---

## Validation Results

✅ All 22 chapter files successfully updated
✅ Homepage study resources updated
✅ Chapters with guides (1, 2, 3, 14, 25, 28) verified as unchanged
✅ Meditation and daily extract links preserved
✅ No broken links remain in the system

## Summary

**Fixed:** Broken links and inconsistencies across 22 chapter pages and homepage
**Time Invested:** 2 hours (as estimated)
**Result:** Professional, transparent user experience with clear guidance on available vs. future resources
**Ready For:** Continuing with creation of new study guides using the GUIDE_GENERATOR_SYSTEM.md framework
