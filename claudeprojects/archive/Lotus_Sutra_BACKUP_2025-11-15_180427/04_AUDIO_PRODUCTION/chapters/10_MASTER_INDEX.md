## PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Preparation
- [x] Chapter 10 optimized using 4-Rule Verse Formatting System
- [x] All quality checks passed
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Ready for deployment

### Step 2: Google AI Studio Setup
1. Open Google AI Studio
2. Navigate to text-to-speech interface
3. Select voice: "Charon" (or "Puck" as alternative)
4. Set speed: 0.95x
5. Set pitch: 0 (neutral)

### Step 3: Script Upload
1. Open: `10_CHAPTER_HONOR_THE_WORD-CARRIERS_OPTIMIZED.txt`
2. Select all content (Cmd+A / Ctrl+A)
3. Copy (Cmd+C / Ctrl+C)
4. Paste into Google AI Studio text input

### Step 4: Generate Audio
1. Review settings one final time
2. Click "Generate" or equivalent
3. Optional: Split at line 128 for two-part processing if single generation exceeds quality threshold
4. Download generated audio files

### Step 5: Post-Production (Optional)
1. Validate audio quality against sacred text standards
2. Add optional soundscape elements (see Optimization Report for suggestions)
3. Apply minimal mastering if needed (light compression, normalization)
4. Export final production file

## QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKLIST

Pre-Production Verification:
- [x] Optimized script uses correct file (not original)
- [x] All verses are single-paragraph format
- [x] No unintended line breaks in verses
- [x] Prose sections unchanged
- [x] File encoding is UTF-8 (for diacritics)

During Production:
- [ ] Voice selected: Charon or Puck
- [ ] Speed set: 0.95x
- [ ] Pitch set: 0 (neutral)
- [ ] Full chapter pasted correctly
- [ ] Preview first 30 seconds before full generation

Post-Production Verification:
- [ ] Audio flows naturally in verse sections
- [ ] Comma pauses are present but not excessive
- [ ] Blues/gospel vernacular sounds authentic
- [ ] No choppy or fragmented delivery
- [ ] Total duration appropriate (~10-15 minutes estimated)

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING REFERENCE

**Problem:** Verses sound rushed, commas ignored
**Solution:** Decrease speed to 0.90x, increase stability setting

**Problem:** Audio sounds choppy despite optimization
**Solution:** Verify optimized file was used; check for accidental line breaks during copy/paste

**Problem:** Voice changes mid-chapter
**Solution:** Ensure entire chapter processed in single API call with consistent voice selection

**Problem:** Diacritics not pronounced correctly (yakṣas, Śākyamuni)
**Solution:** Normal variation; Gemini approximates Sanskrit pronunciation; consider light editing note in production notes

**Problem:** Total audio length seems too short/long
**Solution:** Expected range: 10-15 minutes at 0.95x speed; verify full chapter was pasted

   - Check technical audio quality

2. **Document Learnings**
   - Note any voice adjustments needed
   - Record actual processing time
   - Identify any post-production needs
   - Assess overall satisfaction

3. **Scale to Additional Chapters**
   - Apply same 4-Rule System to other chapters
   - Maintain consistent voice/settings
   - Build complete Lotus Sutra audio library
   - Track cumulative time/cost savings

4. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Add contemplative soundscapes
   - Create chapter transition audio
   - Design complete listening experience
   - Implement quantum entrainment elements (binaural beats, harmonic drones)
