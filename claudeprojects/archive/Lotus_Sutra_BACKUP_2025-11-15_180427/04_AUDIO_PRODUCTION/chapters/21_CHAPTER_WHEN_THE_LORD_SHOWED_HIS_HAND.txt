CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE: WHEN THE LORD SHOWED HIS HAND
(The Buddha's Supernatural Powers / 如來神力品第二十一)

A Blues/Gospel Interpretation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese

THE VOW TO WITNESS

Now listen here—at that time, all them Bodhisattvas what come up from the earth, countless as dust motes in a thousand worlds, they all standing there before the Buddha, hands pressed together, gazing up at that holy face, and they speaking out their hearts:

"World-Honored One, after you done gone on from this world, wherever your presence still abiding—in all them lands where your manifested bodies been teaching, in every place where you entered into rest—we gonna spread this sutra far and wide.

Why we saying this? Because we ourselves want to get hold of this true and pure Great Law, want to keep it, read it, recite it, explain it, write it down, and make offerings to it."

THE GREAT REVEALING

Now at that time the World-Honored One, right there before Mañjuśrī and all them countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of Bodhisattvas what been dwelling in this Saha world from way back, and before all the monks and nuns, the laymen and laywomen, the devas and dragons and yakshas and gandharvas and asuras and garudas and kinnaras and mahoragas, before humans and non-humans alike—before EVERY LIVING THING THAT EVER WAS—the Buddha showed forth his great supernatural power.

And what he do?

He put out his broad long tongue, and it reached straight up to the Brahma heaven.

From every pore of his body he released immeasurable, numberless colored lights, and they shone everywhere throughout the ten directions.

And all them other Buddhas sitting on lion thrones under jeweled trees, they did the same thing—put out they broad long tongues and released immeasurable light.

When Śākyamuni Buddha and all them Buddhas under the jeweled trees was showing forth they supernatural power, it lasted for a hundred thousand years.

Then they drew back they tongue-signs.

And then—oh, then!—they coughed once, ALL TOGETHER, and snapped they fingers, ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

And them two sounds—that cough and that finger-snap—they traveled to all the Buddha-worlds in the ten directions.

And the earth, she shook six ways.

THE UNIVERSAL WITNESS

Now all the living beings in them worlds—the devas and dragons and yakshas and gandharvas and asuras and garudas and kinnaras and mahoragas, humans and non-humans—through the Buddha's supernatural power, they ALL SAW this Saha world.

They saw immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas sitting on lion thrones under jeweled trees.

They saw Śākyamuni Buddha sitting together with Many Treasures Tathāgata on the lion throne inside that jeweled stupa.

They saw immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of Bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly respectfully surrounding Śākyamuni Buddha.

When they seen all this, they was filled with great joy—they got something they never had before!

THE CALL AND THE RESPONSE

Right then and there, the devas in empty space, they raised up they voices high and made this proclamation:

"Beyond these immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of asamkhyeya worlds, there's a land called Saha. In that land there's a Buddha called Śākyamuni. Right now he teaching the great vehicle sutra to the Bodhisattvas—it called the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower, the teaching for Bodhisattvas, the one the Buddha guards and keeps in mind.

Y'all should rejoice from the bottom of your hearts! You should bow down and make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha!"

When all them beings heard that voice from empty space, they pressed they palms together, turned toward the Saha world, and said:

"Glory to Śākyamuni Buddha! Glory to Śākyamuni Buddha!"

They took all kinds of flowers and incense and necklaces, banners and canopies, jewels and precious ornaments for adorning the body, and they scattered them from afar toward the Saha world.

All them scattered things coming from the ten directions, they gathered like clouds, transformed into jeweled canopies, and spread out covering all the Buddhas there.

And in that time, the worlds of the ten directions was completely open and unobstructed, like one Buddha land.

THE ENTRUSTMENT

At that time the Buddha told Superior Practices and all them other Bodhisattvas:

"The supernatural powers of the Buddhas—they just like this: immeasurable, boundless, inconceivable. Even if I was to use these supernatural powers for immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of asamkhyeya kalpas, talking about the merit and virtue of this sutra for the sake of entrusting it to y'all, I still couldn't finish telling it.

Let me sum it up for you:

All the Dharmas the Tathāgata possesses,
All the sovereign supernatural powers of the Tathāgata,
All the storehouse of profound essentials of the Tathāgata,
All the most deep matters of the Tathāgata—

ALL OF IT is proclaimed and revealed and demonstrated in this sutra.

Therefore, after the Tathāgata done passed on into extinction, y'all should single-mindedly receive and keep, read and recite, explain and expound, transcribe and practice according to what it says.

In whatever land you find yourself, if someone receives and keeps, reads and recites, explains and expounds, transcribes and practices according to what this sutra says—or if there's a place where a sutra scroll dwells, whether in a garden, or in a grove, or under a tree, or in a monk's dwelling, or in a white-clothed person's house, or in a hall or palace, or in a mountain valley or wilderness—in that place you should build a stupa and make offerings.

Why is that? You should know: THAT PLACE IS THE SITE OF ENLIGHTENMENT.

The Buddhas attained anuttara-samyak-sambodhi at that place.
The Buddhas turned the Dharma wheel at that place.
The Buddhas entered nirvāṇa at that place."

THE SUTRA IN VERSE

At that time the World-Honored One, wanting to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

The Buddhas, saviors of the world,
Dwelling in great supernatural penetrations,
In order to gladden living beings,
Display immeasurable supernatural powers.

They tongues reaching to the Brahma heaven,
They bodies releasing numberless lights—
For them seeking the Buddha Way,
They manifest these rare occurrences.

The sound of the Buddhas coughing,
The sound of they fingers snapping,
Heard throughout the lands in ten directions,
The earth shaking six ways everywhere.

Because after the Buddha's extinction
Someone able to uphold this sutra,
All the Buddhas rejoicing,
Display immeasurable supernatural powers.

For the sake of entrusting this sutra,
Praising those who receive and keep it,
Even through immeasurable kalpas
They still can't come to the end of it.

The merit and virtue of such a person—
Boundless, without limit,
Like the empty space of ten directions,
You can't find no edge to it.

One who able to uphold this sutra,
That person already seen me,
Already seen Many Treasures Buddha
And all the manifested body Buddhas.

They also seen me today
Teaching and transforming the Bodhisattvas.
One who able to uphold this sutra
Makes me and my manifested bodies,
Makes Many Treasures Buddha now extinct,
Makes ALL OF THEM rejoice.

The Buddhas existing now in ten directions,
The Buddhas of past and future too—
They also gonna see them, gonna make offerings to them,
Gonna make them rejoice as well.

The secret essential Dharma
The Buddhas attained sitting at the place of enlightenment—
One who able to uphold this sutra
Gonna get it before too long.

One who able to uphold this sutra—
When it come to the meaning of all dharmas,
The names and the words,
They gonna preach with inexhaustible joy,
Like wind in empty space
That ain't got no obstruction nowhere.

After the Tathāgata's extinction,
They gonna know the sutras the Buddha taught,
The causes and conditions and the sequence,
And teach them according to the true meaning,
Like the light of sun and moon
That removes all darkness—

This person walking through the world
Able to destroy the darkness of living beings,
Teaching immeasurable Bodhisattvas,
Finally causing them to dwell in the One Vehicle.

Therefore, if you got wisdom,
Hearing these benefits and merits,
After my extinction
You should receive and uphold this sutra.

Such a person, on the Buddha Way,
Decidedly ain't got no doubt.
