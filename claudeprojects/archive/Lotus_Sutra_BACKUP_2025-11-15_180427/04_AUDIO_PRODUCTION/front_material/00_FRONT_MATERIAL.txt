heart. This text was meant to be heard.



THE DHARMA AND THE BLUES
(Interpreter's Note)

This interpretation takes Kumarajiva's Classical Chinese text of the Lotus Sutra 
and pours it through the blues—that great river of African American spiritual 
and musical expression that has always known how to carry deep wisdom in 
everyday language.

Some might ask: Why?

The answer is that these two great traditions, born worlds apart, share a 
spiritual DNA.

Both emerge from the raw, unflinching recognition of suffering. The blues is 
born from slavery, oppression, and the "hard road" of human trouble. Buddhism 
is born from the recognition of dukkha—the truth that this conditioned world is 
a "burning house." Both traditions refuse to look away.

And yet, both insist on joy despite the suffering. The blues can laugh through 
tears. The gospel tradition shouts for joy in the face of despair. The Lotus 
Sutra promises that even in the burning house, a "great cart" of inconceivable 
beauty is waiting for us.

This interpretation is an attempt to honor that shared DNA. The blues has always 
carried sacred truth in the language of the people. It's a tradition that 
understands:

- The "loving tricks" of a compassionate father (skillful means)
- The "poverty consciousness" of the prodigal son who forgot his inheritance
- The "hidden dignity" of the jewel sewn in the pauper's robe
- The "mathematics of grace" where one moment of faith outweighs eons of works
- The "prophetic faith" of "Never Looked Down," who keeps declaring "You gonna 
  be a Buddha" even as the stones are flying

This is not a formal, academic interpretation. This is an interpretation for 
the heart. I kept the famous names—Manjushri, Avalokiteshvara, Shariputra—and 
the original 28-chapter structure. But I've let abstract terms become lived 
experience. "Arhat" becomes a brother who's "made it through to the other 
side." "Nirvana" becomes "that final peace beyond peace." "Dharani" becomes 
"a power to hold onto the truth no matter how hard the wind blows."

The verses, especially, are rendered to be felt, to be sung. They use the 
repetition, the rhythm, and the direct address ("Listen now," "you hear me?") 
of the blues sermon.

Because that's what this sutra is. It's a revelation, a promise, and a call. 
It's the testimony that the world is on fire, and still we sing.

My hope is that this voice allows the Dharma to be heard in a new way, in the 
key that sang freedom in chains and prophesied justice in the dark. May all 
beings hear the teaching in the voice that reaches their hearts.

About gender in this interpretation: You'll notice the text maintains male 
characters where they're specific—the Buddha, Shariputra, Manjushri, and the 
other historical disciples. This is deliberate. Because this sutra's power 
doesn't come from pretending women were always fully centered in a male-dominated 
world. It comes from showing women breaking into that narrative, claiming their 
place, and in doing so, shattering the categories entirely. 

When that dragon girl becomes a Buddha, it matters because the story up to that 
point has been mostly men. When Mahaprajapati demands recognition, it carries 
weight because the Buddha had to think about it. I've kept that narrative 
reality. But in the universal teachings, in the addresses to all practitioners, 
in the parables that apply to every living being—there I've made sure the 
language includes everybody. The dharma doesn't have gender restrictions, so 
the language addressing 'all beings' shouldn't either. 

This is an interpretation that lets the Sutra's own revolution speak: first you 
think this is a man's world, then you discover it's not, and that discovery IS 
the teaching.

INTRODUCTION: THE PARABLE AND THE PROMISE

Listen now, this is what you're holding in your hands: the Sutra of the Lotus 
Flower of the Wonderful Dharma, one of the most beloved and revolutionary texts 
in the world. In Asia, they call it the "King of Sutras." This is the teaching 
that turned everything upside down.

For centuries, many believed the highest spiritual goal was to become an 
Arhat—a perfect saint who escapes the cycle of suffering and enters the final 
peace of nirvana. It was a hard road, and it was final.

Then, the Buddha reveals the truth at the heart of this sutra. He says that 
this final peace, this nirvana, wasn't the final destination after all. It was 
just a "phantom city," a rest stop he created out of compassion for travelers 
who were too tired to keep walking.

The true destination, he says, is something bigger. It's the "one great matter" 
he came to reveal: Every single living being—no exceptions—will become a Buddha.

This is the sutra's great promise. The old disciples who thought they were 
finished, the women who were told they couldn't, the evil-doers like Devadatta, 
the non-humans like the 8-year-old dragon girl—all of them, and all of us, are 
destined for perfect, complete enlightenment.

And let me tell you something else you need to know. This sutra's been written 
down by men, and mostly men talking. But pay attention when the women show 
up—because when they do, everything changes. Mahaprajapati, the aunt who 
raised the Buddha when his mama died, she walks up and asks the Buddha straight 
out: 'Can we practice? Can we be free too?' And the Buddha's got to stop and 
reckon with her. Then later, eight thousand nuns come through and get their 
prophecies of Buddhahood. And then—this is the thing that's gonna shake 
you—a dragon girl, eight years old, becomes a Buddha right there in front of 
everybody. Just like that. No waiting, no 'you gotta come back as a man next 
time.' The dharma don't work that way.

The blues knows this truth. Sister Rosetta Tharpe didn't wait for permission. 
Mahalia Jackson carried the Spirit. The mothers and grandmothers held the church 
together. When women move in the dharma, when women practice, when women 
teach—that's when you know it's real. That's the sign that this teaching ain't 
just for the chosen few. It's for everybody. The dragon girl's enlightenment 
ain't incidental. It's the proof. It's the promise written in the flesh of a 
child who shouldn't be able to do it—but does.

To explain this, the Buddha uses parables—stories that resonate with a truth 
deeper than philosophy. He tells of:

- A father lying to save his children from a burning house
- A rich man who finds his long-lost prodigal son and slowly gives him back 
  his inheritance
- A man who wanders in poverty, not knowing there's a priceless jewel sewn 
  into his robe

These are stories of "loving tricks" (upaya, or skillful means). They teach 
that the Buddha is an eternal father who, out of boundless compassion, meets 
us where we are, speaks our language, and uses whatever parables it takes to 
guide us home.

This "Blues Interpretation" takes that principle to heart. The blues and gospel 
traditions are, at their core, traditions of parable and promise. They know the 
burning house. They know the prodigal son. They know what it means to be a 
"motherless child, a long way from home" who is still promised a "home in 
gloryland."

HOW TO READ THIS BOOK

This text was meant to be heard, to be recited, to be felt. As a musician, I 
invite you to read it that way. Don't get hung up on the strange names or the 
cosmic numbers. Listen for the music. Listen for the rhythm in the verses. 
Listen for the voice of the preacher, the storyteller, the father, the friend.

This isn't just a book. It's a song. It's a promise. It's the good news that 
no matter who you are, or where you've been, or what you've done, you are 
already an heir to everything.

You just need to wake up, remember who you are, and claim your inheritance.

THE GATHERING

Listen now, this is what I heard with my own ears.

One time—and ain't it always one time when truth comes calling—the Buddha was 
staying up on Vulture Peak Mountain, right outside the city called King's House 
(Rajagriha). And he wasn't alone, no sir. He had twelve thousand monks with 
him, every last one of them a brother who'd made it through to the other side.
