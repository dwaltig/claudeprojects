================================================================================
OPTIMIZATION METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

Applied 4-Rule Verse Formatting System (Verified):

RULE 1: Identify Poetry
- Located all blocks with multiple short, intentional line breaks
- Distinguished from narrative prose (left unchanged)

RULE 2: Combine Lines
- Merged all verse lines into single continuous paragraphs
- Preserved complete meaning and word order

RULE 3: Preserve Pacing
- Kept all original punctuation marks (. ? ; ! : —)
- Added commas ONLY where original lines lacked punctuation
- This preserves natural breath/pause points for narration

RULE 4: Keep Everything Else
- All narrative prose left exactly as-is
- All character names and Sanskrit terms preserved
- All scholarly apparatus unchanged

================================================================================

TECHNICAL NOTES
================================================================================

GEMINI API COMPATIBILITY:
- Format: Plain text with natural punctuation
- Token estimate: ~90,000-100,000 for full manuscript
- Processing: Can batch 2-3 chapters per API call
- Voice consistency: Maintained through unified voice tags

PUNCTUATION AS NARRATION CUE:
The optimization preserves punctuation to guide TTS:
