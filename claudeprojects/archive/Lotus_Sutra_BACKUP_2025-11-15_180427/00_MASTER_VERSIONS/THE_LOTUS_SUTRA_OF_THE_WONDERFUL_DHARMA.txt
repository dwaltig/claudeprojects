PREFACE ON THE PROPAGATION OF THE LOTUS SUTRA

Composed by Śramaṇa Dao Xuan of Mount Zhongnan, Tang Dynasty


The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma represents the fundamental intention underlying all Buddhas' descents into the world. This teaching was treasured in India and emerged from that land after more than a thousand years. It was transmitted eastward to China over three hundred years ago. During the Yongkang era of Emperor Hui of the Western Jin Dynasty, at the Azure Gate of Chang'an, the Bodhisattva Dharmarakṣa of Dunhuang first translated this sutra, naming it the Sutra of the Correct Dharma Lotus. During the Longan era of Emperor An of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, in the Hongshi era of the Later Qin, the Śramaṇa Kumārajīva of Kucha next translated this sutra, naming it the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma. During the Renshou era of the Sui Dynasty, the Śramaṇa Jñānagupta of Northern India at the Great Xingshan Monastery produced a later translation, likewise naming it the Wonderful Dharma. These three translations overlap and repeat one another, with their textual purport presented differently. The version honored in that age was the dissemination of the Qin text. Beyond these, there exist derivative chapters and separate verses in circulation. These are detailed in historical accounts and thus will not be discussed here.

Now, the sacred mountain manifesting its spiritual presence could only be opened and transformed by the Great Sage. The extent of this transformative teaching could only guide the hearts of those with karmic connections from past lives. Thus at the Deer Park the teaching was inaugurated, dividing faculties into lesser and greater distinctions. At the Golden River's final instruction, the path was distinguished between partial and complete categories. Is this not because teachings respond to their time, making it futile to examine which assemblies were superior? Therefore we know that the five thousand who withdrew from the assembly were advancing those with increasing arrogance. The five hundred who received predictions jointly honored the traces of esoteric transformation. Thus the emission of light and manifestation of auspicious signs opened the wellspring of teaching through inquiry. Emerging from samādhi and proclaiming virtue, the Buddha expounded the vast essence of Buddha-wisdom. The parable of the burning house reveals the path to enter the Great Vehicle. The metaphor of the conjured city demonstrates that ancient karmic connections do not fall into oblivion. The jewel sewn in the garment illuminates the eternal presence of the inherent nature. The metaphor of boring for water reveals the many ways to awakening. The words and meaning are perfectly clear, yet the parables point to what is distant. Were it not for the Great Compassion's vast salvation, rescuing those drowning in stagnation, were it not for the ultimate compassionate heart, saving those who have lost their true nature through delusion—

From the Han through the Tang Dynasties, over six hundred years, encompassing the complete collection of scriptures—more than four thousand scrolls—none has been more fervently upheld and practiced than this sutra. Could it not be that the teaching resonates with spiritual faculties, all being remnants of Buddha Wisdom Victory's ancient connections? Those who hear it and deeply revere it all share in the residual merit of King Awesome Sound of the World. I have thus ventured to compose this preface at the beginning of the sutra, that we may swiftly purify the six sense faculties and look up to the wondrous assembly of the Compassionate Honored One, speedily perfect the four virtues, and advance toward the profound way of the Pure Land. Praise and glorification cannot be exhausted—may this endure and be transmitted to all future generations.

THE LOTUS SUTRA OF THE WONDERFUL DHARMA
VOLUME ONE

Translated by Tripiṭaka Master Kumārajīva of Kucha, Later Qin Dynasty
Rendered under imperial decree

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was dwelling at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa near the city of Rājagṛha, together with a great assembly of twelve thousand bhikṣus. All were Arhats whose outflows had been exhausted, who had no further afflictions, who had attained their own benefit, who had severed all bonds of existence, and whose minds had attained freedom. Their names were: Ājñātakauṇḍinya, Mahākāśyapa, Uruvilvākāśyapa, Gayākāśyapa, Nadīkāśyapa, Śāriputra, Mahāmaudgalyāyana, Mahākātyāyana, Aniruddha, Kapphiṇa, Gavāṃpati, Revata, Pilindavatsa, Bakkula, Mahākauṣṭhila, Nanda, Sundarananda, Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra, Subhūti, Ānanda, and Rāhula—great Arhats such as these, well known to all.

Furthermore, there were two thousand persons of learning and those beyond learning. The bhikṣuṇī Mahāprajāpatī was present with her retinue of six thousand. The bhikṣuṇī Yaśodharā, mother of Rāhula, was also present with her retinue. There were eighty thousand Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, all of whom were irreversible from anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. All had attained dhāraṇī, eloquence in joyful exposition, and had turned the irreversible Dharma wheel. They had made offerings to innumerable hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, and in the presence of all Buddhas had planted roots of virtue. They were constantly praised by all Buddhas. They cultivated themselves with compassion, skillfully entered into Buddha-wisdom, thoroughly penetrated the great wisdom, and reached the farther shore. Their fame was universally heard throughout immeasurable worlds, and they were able to liberate innumerable hundreds of thousands of living beings. Their names were: the Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, the Bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta, the Bodhisattva Nityodyukta, the Bodhisattva Aniksiptadhura, the Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi, the Bodhisattva Medicine King, the Bodhisattva Pradānaśūra, the Bodhisattva Ratnacandra, the Bodhisattva Candraprabha, the Bodhisattva Pūrṇacandra, the Bodhisattva Mahāvikramin, the Bodhisattva Anantavikramin, the Bodhisattva Trailokyavikrama, the Bodhisattva Bhadrapāla, the Bodhisattva Maitreya, the Bodhisattva Ratnākara, and the Bodhisattva Susārthavāha—eighty thousand Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas such as these were all present.

At that time Śakra Devānām Indra was present with his retinue of twenty thousand celestial sons. Also present were the celestial sons Candravimala, Manojñasvara, Ratnacchattra, and the Four Great Heavenly Kings, with their retinue of ten thousand celestial sons. The celestial sons Īśvara and Maheśvara were present with their retinue of thirty thousand celestial sons. The Brahmā Heavenly King, lord of the Sahā world, together with Śikhin Mahābrahman, Jyotiṣprabha Mahābrahman and others, were present with their retinue of twelve thousand celestial sons. There were eight Dragon Kings: the Dragon King Nanda, the Dragon King Upananda, the Dragon King Sāgara, the Dragon King Vāsukin, the Dragon King Takṣaka, the Dragon King Anavatapta, the Dragon King Manasvin, and the Dragon King Utpalaka—each with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members. There were four Kiṃnara Kings: the Kiṃnara King Dharma, the Kiṃnara King Sudharma, the Kiṃnara King Mahādharma, and the Kiṃnara King Dharmadhara—each with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members. There were four Gandharva Kings: the Gandharva King Manojña, the Gandharva King Manojñasvara, the Gandharva King Madhura, and the Gandharva King Madhurasvara—each with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members. There were four Asura Kings: the Asura King Balin, the Asura King Kharaskandha, the Asura King Vemacitra, and the Asura King Rāhu—each with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members. There were four Garuḍa Kings: the Garuḍa King Mahātejas, the Garuḍa King Mahākāya, the Garuḍa King Mahāpūrṇa, and the Garuḍa King Manojña—each with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members. King Ajātaśatru, son of Vaidehī, was present with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members. Each bowed at the Buddha's feet and withdrew to sit to one side.

At that time the World-Honored One, surrounded by the fourfold assembly, having received offerings with reverence, honor, and praise, expounded for the Bodhisattvas a Mahāyāna sutra entitled the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas. Having concluded the exposition of this sutra, the Buddha sat in full lotus posture and entered the samādhi of the abode of immeasurable meanings, his body and mind unmoving. Thereupon heavenly mandārava flowers, great mandārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, and great mañjūṣaka flowers rained down, scattering upon the Buddha and the great assembly. The entire Buddha-world quaked and trembled in six ways.

At that time, all in the assembly—bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans, lesser kings, and wheel-turning sage kings—the entire great assembly experienced what they had never experienced before. They rejoiced, placed their palms together, and single-mindedly gazed upon the Buddha.

At that time the Buddha emitted a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows, illuminating eighteen thousand worlds to the east, omitting none, extending downward to the Avīci hells and upward to the Akaniṣṭha Heaven. From this world, the beings of the six destinies in all those lands were completely visible. Moreover, the Buddhas presently dwelling in those lands were seen, and the sutras and Dharma that those Buddhas expounded were heard. Also visible were the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who had cultivated practice and attained the Way. Furthermore, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas were seen practicing the Bodhisattva path through various causes and conditions, various faiths and understandings, and various appearances and forms. Also seen were Buddhas entering parinirvāṇa. Also seen, after those Buddhas' parinirvāṇa, were stūpas of the seven precious materials being erected for their śarīra.

At that time the Bodhisattva Maitreya had this thought: "Now the World-Honored One has manifested this spiritual transformation. For what cause and condition has this auspicious sign appeared? Now the Buddha, the World-Honored One, has entered samādhi—this inconceivable manifestation of rare phenomena—whom should I ask? Who can answer?" Then he had this further thought: "This Mañjuśrī, prince of the Dharma King, has previously drawn near and made offerings to immeasurable Buddhas of the past. Surely he must have witnessed this rare sign. I shall now inquire of him."

At that time the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, and all the devas, nāgas, and spirits all had this thought: "This Buddha-light and spiritual power—of whom should we now inquire?"

At that time the Bodhisattva Maitreya, wishing to resolve his own doubt and observing the minds of the fourfold assembly—bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, and all the devas, nāgas, and spirits of the assembly—addressed Mañjuśrī, saying: "For what cause and condition has this auspicious spiritual sign appeared—this emission of great light illuminating the eighteen thousand lands to the east, whereby all the adornments of those Buddha-lands are completely visible?"

Thereupon the Bodhisattva Maitreya, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, inquiring:

"Mañjuśrī!
Why does the Guide,
From the white hair between his brows,
Universally illuminate with great light?

"Raining mandārava
And mañjūṣaka flowers,
While sandalwood-scented breezes
Delight the hearts of all—

"By this cause and condition,
The earth is perfectly adorned,
And this world
Quakes in six ways.

"At this time the fourfold assembly
All rejoice,
Their bodies and minds delighted,
Experiencing what they have never experienced.

"The light between the brows
Illuminates the east—
Eighteen thousand lands
All become golden in hue.

"From Avīci hell
Up to the Summit of Existence,
In all those worlds,
The beings of the six paths—

"Where birth and death lead,
The karmic connections of good and evil,
The beautiful and ugly results they receive—
All these are seen here.

"Also visible are the Buddhas,
Those sage lords and lions,
Expounding sutras and teachings,
Most subtle and supreme.

"Their voices pure,
Emitting gentle tones,
Teaching Bodhisattvas
Numbering countless myriads—

"Brahman voices profound and wondrous,
Causing people to delight in hearing.
In each world,
They expound the correct Dharma—

"Through various causes and conditions,
With immeasurable parables,
Illuminating the Buddha-Dharma,
Awakening living beings.

"If people encounter suffering,
Weary of old age, sickness, and death,
For them they expound nirvāṇa,
The ending of all suffering's limits.

"If people possess merit,
Having made offerings to Buddhas,
And aspire to the supreme Dharma,
For them they expound pratyekabuddhas.

"If there are sons of Buddha
Cultivating various practices
And seeking supreme wisdom,
For them they expound the pure path.

"Mañjuśrī!
Dwelling here,
I see and hear such things,
And thousands of billions more—

"So numerous,
I shall now briefly speak.
I see in those lands
Bodhisattvas numerous as Ganges' sands,

"Through various causes and conditions
Seeking the Buddha-Way.
Some practice giving—
Gold, silver, coral,

"Pearls, māṇi jewels,
Giant clam shells, agate,
Diamonds and precious things,
Servants, carriages,

"Jeweled palanquins and sedan chairs—
Joyfully giving these as gifts,
Dedicating toward the Buddha-Way,
Wishing to attain this vehicle,

"First in the three realms,
Praised by all Buddhas.
Or there are Bodhisattvas
Giving teams of jeweled carriages,

"With railings and canopies
Exquisitely adorned, as gifts.
I also see Bodhisattvas
Giving their body's flesh, hands, and feet,

"Even wives and children,
Seeking the supreme Way.
I also see Bodhisattvas
Joyfully giving their heads, eyes, and bodies,

"Seeking Buddha-wisdom.
Mañjuśrī!
I see various kings
Going to where the Buddhas are,

"Inquiring about the supreme Way,
Then abandoning their delightful lands,
Palaces and consorts,
Shaving hair and beards,

"Donning the Dharma robes.
Or I see Bodhisattvas
Becoming bhikṣus,
Dwelling alone in quietude,

"Delighting in reciting sutras.
I also see Bodhisattvas
Vigorously and energetically advancing,
Entering deep into mountains,

"Contemplating the Buddha-Way.
I also see those renouncing desire,
Always dwelling in empty places,
Deeply cultivating dhyāna concentration,

"Attaining the five spiritual powers.
I also see Bodhisattvas
Peacefully meditating with palms joined,
With thousands upon myriads of verses

"Praising the Dharma Kings.
I again see Bodhisattvas
Whose wisdom is profound and resolve firm,
Able to question the Buddhas,

"Hearing and completely upholding all.
I also see sons of Buddha
Perfected in concentration and wisdom,
Who, through immeasurable parables,

"Expound Dharma for the multitudes,
Joyfully teaching the Dharma,
Transforming all Bodhisattvas,

"Defeating the hosts of Māra,
Beating the Dharma drum.
I also see Bodhisattvas
Serene in silent tranquility,

"Though devas and nāgas revere them,
They take no joy in this.
I also see Bodhisattvas
Dwelling in forests, emitting light,

"Relieving the suffering of hells,
Causing entry to the Buddha-Way.
I also see sons of Buddha
Who have never slept,

"Walking through forests,
Diligently seeking the Buddha-Way.
I also see those perfected in precepts,
Whose deportment is flawless,

"Pure as precious gems,
Thus seeking the Buddha-Way.
I also see sons of Buddha
Dwelling in the power of patience—

"When arrogant people
Revile and beat them,
They are able to endure all,
Thus seeking the Buddha-Way.

"I also see Bodhisattvas
Who have left frivolous laughter
And foolish companions,
Drawing near to the wise,

"Single-mindedly eliminating confusion,
Gathering their thoughts in mountain forests
For myriads of thousands of years,
Thus seeking the Buddha-Way.

"Or I see Bodhisattvas
Offering choice foods and beverages
And hundreds of medicinal remedies
To the Buddha and the Saṃgha.

"Fine robes and superior garments
Worth thousands of myriads,
Or priceless robes,
Offered to Buddha and Saṃgha.

"Thousands of myriads of billions of kinds
Of sandalwood treasure houses,
Marvelous beds and bedding,
Offered to Buddha and Saṃgha.

"Pure gardens and forests
Where flowers and fruits flourish,
With flowing springs and bathing pools,
Offered to Buddha and Saṃgha.

"Such giving as this,
Of various wondrous things,
With joy and without weariness,
Seeking the supreme Way.

"Or there are Bodhisattvas
Expounding the Dharma of tranquil extinction,
Teaching and instructing in various ways
Countless multitudes of beings.

"Or I see Bodhisattvas
Contemplating the nature of dharmas—
That there is no duality,
Like empty space.

"I also see sons of Buddha
Whose minds cling to nothing,
Who, through this wondrous wisdom,
Seek the supreme Way.

"Mañjuśrī!
I also see Bodhisattvas
Who, after the Buddha's final nirvāṇa,
Make offerings to his śarīra.

"I also see sons of Buddha
Constructing stūpas and shrines
Numerous as Ganges' sands,
Adorning the lands,

"Jeweled stūpas lofty and wondrous,
Five thousand yojanas high,
Their length and breadth equal,
Two thousand yojanas each.

"Each stūpa and shrine
Has a thousand banners and pennants,
With pearl-woven canopies and curtains,
And precious bells harmoniously chiming.

"Devas, nāgas, spirits,
Humans and non-humans,
With incense, flowers, and music
Constantly make offerings.

"Mañjuśrī!
These sons of Buddha,
To make offerings to śarīra,
Adorn stūpas and shrines—

"Causing those lands naturally
To become extraordinarily wondrous and beautiful,
Like heavenly jeweled trees
Whose flowers have opened.

"The Buddha emitted one light,
And I and this assembly
See these lands'
Various wondrous things.

"The Buddhas' spiritual powers
And wisdom are rare—
Emitting one pure light,
Illuminating immeasurable lands.

"We, seeing this,
Attain what we have never attained.
Son of Buddha, Mañjuśrī,
We pray you resolve the assembly's doubts.

"The fourfold assembly looks with longing,
Gazing at you and me—
Why has the World-Honored One
Emitted this light?

"Son of Buddha, answer now,
Resolve our doubts and bring us joy.
What benefit is to be gained?
For what purpose is this light manifested?

"The Dharma attained by the Buddha
As he sat at the place of enlightenment—
Does he wish to expound this?
Or is he about to bestow predictions?

"The manifestation of those Buddha-lands,
Adorned with all precious things,
And the sight of those Buddhas—
This is no small matter.

"Mañjuśrī, you should know—
The fourfold assembly, nāgas, and spirits
Gaze upon you, worthy one,
Awaiting your explanation."

At that time Mañjuśrī addressed the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya and all the great beings, good men and others: "According to my consideration, the Buddha, the World-Honored One, now wishes to expound the great Dharma, to rain down the great Dharma rain, to blow the great Dharma conch, to beat the great Dharma drum, to elucidate the meaning of the great Dharma. Good men! In the presence of past Buddhas, I have witnessed this auspicious sign. After emitting this light, they immediately expounded the great Dharma. Therefore you should know that now, when the Buddha manifests this light, it is likewise thus—he wishes to cause all living beings to hear and know the Dharma that is difficult for all the world to believe, and therefore he manifests this auspicious sign.

"Good men! In the past, immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable, asaṃkhya kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named Candrasūryapradīpa Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna, Sugata, Lokavid, Anuttara, Puruṣa-damya-sārathi, Śāstā-deva-manuṣyānām, Buddha, Bhagavat. He expounded the correct Dharma, good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, profound in meaning and skillful in wording, pure and unmixed, complete, and perfecting the characteristics of the pure holy life. For those seeking to be śrāvakas, he expounded the Dharma appropriate to the Four Noble Truths, ferrying them across birth, old age, sickness, and death, and ultimately to nirvāṇa. For those seeking to be pratyekabuddhas, he expounded the Dharma appropriate to the twelve links of dependent origination. For the Bodhisattvas, he expounded the Dharma appropriate to the six pāramitās, causing them to attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi and perfect the wisdom of all modes.

"Next there was another Buddha, also named Candrasūryapradīpa. Next there was another Buddha, also named Candrasūryapradīpa. In this way there were twenty thousand Buddhas, all sharing the same single name, Candrasūryapradīpa, and all sharing the same surname, the surname Bharadvāja. Maitreya, you should know that from the first Buddha to the last Buddha, all shared the same name, Candrasūryapradīpa, and were perfected in the ten epithets. The Dharma they expounded was good in the beginning, middle, and end. The very last Buddha, before leaving the household life, had eight royal sons: the first named Sumati, the second named Sudhārmati, the third named Amitamati, the fourth named Ratnāmati, the fifth named Viśeṣamati, the sixth named Vimatipranaśana, the seventh named Abhimati, and the eighth named Dharmāmati. These eight princes were majestic and self-possessed, each ruling over four continents. When these princes heard that their father had left home and attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, they all renounced their royal positions and likewise left home, generated the intention for the Great Vehicle, constantly cultivated the pure holy life, and all became Dharma teachers, having planted roots of goodness in the presence of thousands of myriads of Buddhas.

"At that time, the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa expounded the Mahāyāna sutra entitled the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas. Having concluded the exposition of this sutra, immediately before the great assembly he sat in full lotus posture and entered the samādhi of the abode of immeasurable meanings, his body and mind unmoving. At that time, heavenly mandārava flowers, great mandārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, and great mañjūṣaka flowers rained down, scattering upon the Buddha and the great assembly. The entire Buddha-world quaked and trembled in six ways. At that time, all in the assembly—bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans, lesser kings, wheel-turning sage kings, and others—the entire great assembly experienced what they had never experienced before. They rejoiced, placed their palms together, and single-mindedly gazed upon the Buddha.

"At that time the Tathāgata emitted a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows, illuminating eighteen thousand Buddha-lands to the east, omitting none, just as those Buddha-lands are now seen. Maitreya, you should know that at that time there were two billion Bodhisattvas in the assembly who delighted in hearing the Dharma. These Bodhisattvas, seeing this light universally illuminating the Buddha-lands, experienced what they had never experienced before and wished to know the cause and condition of this light. At that time there was a Bodhisattva named Varaprabha who had eight hundred disciples. Then the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa arose from samādhi, and because of the Bodhisattva Varaprabha, he expounded the Mahāyāna sutra entitled the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas. For sixty lesser kalpas he did not rise from his seat. Those listening in the assembly also sat in one place for sixty lesser kalpas, their bodies and minds unmoving, listening to what the Buddha expounded, each regarding it as if only a mealtime had passed. At that time, among the multitude, not a single person, whether in body or mind, experienced weariness or exhaustion.

"After the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa had expounded this sutra for sixty lesser kalpas, he then made this proclamation before the assembly of Brahmas, Māras, śramaṇas, brāhmaṇas, devas, humans, and asuras: 'The Tathāgata shall enter parinirvāṇa without residue at midnight this very day.' At that time there was a Bodhisattva named Yaśaskāma. The Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa then conferred upon him a prediction, telling the bhikṣus: 'This Bodhisattva Yaśaskāma shall next become a Buddha named Vimalakāya, Tathāgata Arhat Samyak-saṃbuddha.' After the Buddha bestowed this prediction, at midnight he entered parinirvāṇa without residue. After the Buddha's final nirvāṇa, the Bodhisattva Varaprabha upheld the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma and for a full eighty lesser kalpas expounded it for people. The eight sons of the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa all took Varaprabha as their teacher. Varaprabha taught and transformed them, causing them to become firmly established in anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. These princes, having made offerings to immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas, all accomplished the Buddha-Way. The last to become Buddha was named Dīpaṃkara. Among the eight hundred disciples, there was one person named Yaśaskāma who was greedy for gain and offerings. Though he repeatedly recited numerous sutras, he did not penetrate them and forgot much, hence his name Yaśaskāma—Fame-Seeker. Yet this person also, through having planted various roots of goodness, encountered immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas, making offerings with reverence, honor, and praise.

"Maitreya, you should know that the Bodhisattva Varaprabha at that time—could he have been anyone else? He was none other than myself. The Bodhisattva Yaśaskāma was none other than you. Now, witnessing this auspicious sign is no different from before. Therefore I consider that today the Tathāgata shall expound the Mahāyāna sutra entitled the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas."

At that time Mañjuśrī, wishing to restate this meaning before the great assembly, spoke in verse, saying:

"I recall ages past,
Immeasurable countless kalpas—
There was a Buddha, honored among people,
Named Candrasūryapradīpa.

"The World-Honored One expounded Dharma,
Ferrying across immeasurable beings,
Countless billions of Bodhisattvas,
Causing them to enter Buddha-wisdom.

"Before the Buddha left the household,
The eight princes born to him—
Seeing the Great Sage leave home,
Also followed in cultivating the pure life.

"At that time the Buddha expounded the Great Vehicle,
A sutra named Immeasurable Meanings,
Before the great assembly
He extensively explained and clarified it.

"After the Buddha expounded this sutra,
Immediately upon the Dharma seat,
He sat in lotus samādhi
Named the Abode of Immeasurable Meanings.

"Heaven rained mandārava flowers,
Heavenly drums spontaneously sounded,
Devas, nāgas, ghosts, and spirits
Made offerings to the Honored One among humans.

"All those Buddha-lands
At once greatly quaked and trembled.
The Buddha emitted light from between his brows,
Manifesting various rare phenomena.

"This light illuminated to the east
Eighteen thousand Buddha-lands,
Revealing all living beings'
Places of birth-death karmic retribution.

"I saw those Buddha-lands,
Adorned with various precious things,
The color of lapis lazuli and crystal—
This was due to the Buddha's illuminating light.

"And I saw devas and humans,
Nāgas, spirits, yakṣas,
Gandharvas and kiṃnaras,
Each making offerings to their Buddha.

"I also saw those Tathāgatas
Naturally accomplishing the Buddha-Way,
Their body color like golden mountains,
Supremely dignified and most wondrous—

"Like pure lapis lazuli
Containing a true golden image within.
The World-Honored Ones, in great assemblies,
Expounded the profound Dharma's meaning.

"In each of those Buddha-lands,
Śrāvakas beyond counting—
Due to the Buddha's illuminating light—
That entire great assembly was visible.

"Or there were bhikṣus
In mountain forests,
Energetically upholding pure precepts,
Guarding them like bright pearls.

"I also saw Bodhisattvas
Practicing giving, patience, and the like,
Their number like Ganges' sands—
This was due to the Buddha's illuminating light.

"I also saw Bodhisattvas
Deeply entering various dhyāna concentrations,
Bodies and minds serene and unmoving,
Thus seeking the supreme Way.

"I also saw Bodhisattvas
Who knew the Dharma's mark of tranquil extinction,
Each in their own lands
Expounding Dharma, seeking the Buddha-Way.

"At that time the fourfold assembly,
Seeing the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa
Manifest great spiritual powers,
All rejoiced in their hearts,

"Each asking one another,
'What is the cause of this?'
The Honored One revered by devas and humans
Had just arisen from samādhi,

"And praised the Bodhisattva Varaprabha:
'You are the eye of the world,
Trusted and taken refuge in by all,
Able to uphold the Dharma treasury.

"'The Dharma I have expounded—
Only you can bear true witness to it.'
The World-Honored One, having offered this praise,
Causing Varaprabha to rejoice,

"Expounded this Lotus Sutra
For a full sixty lesser kalpas
Without rising from his seat.
The supreme wondrous Dharma he expounded

"Was completely upheld and received
By that Dharma Teacher Varaprabha.
After the Buddha expounded the Lotus,
Causing the assembly to rejoice,

"On that very day
He proclaimed to the assembly of devas and humans:
'The true characteristics of all dharmas' meaning
Has already been expounded for you.

"'I now at midnight
Shall enter into nirvāṇa.
You must single-mindedly advance with vigor,
Separating from indolence.

"'Buddhas are extremely difficult to encounter—
Once in billions of kalpas.'
The World-Honored One's disciples,
Hearing the Buddha would enter nirvāṇa,

"Each harbored grief and distress:
'How quickly the Buddha is extinguished!'
The Sage Lord, King of Dharma,
Comforted the immeasurable multitudes:

"'When the time of my final nirvāṇa comes,
You should not worry or fear.
This Bodhisattva Yaśaskāma
Has penetrated in mind the true mark without outflows.

"'He shall next become Buddha,
Named Vimalakāya,
Also ferrying across immeasurable multitudes.'
That night the Buddha was extinguished,

"Like firewood exhausted and fire extinguished.
Śarīra were distributed
And immeasurable stūpas erected.

"Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs,
Their number like Ganges' sands,
Redoubled their energetic vigor,
Seeking the supreme Way.

"That Dharma Teacher Varaprabha
Upheld the Buddha's Dharma treasury—
For eighty lesser kalpas
He extensively proclaimed the Lotus Sutra.

"Those eight princes
Were taught and transformed by Varaprabha,
Firm in the supreme Way—
They would see innumerable Buddhas.

"Having made offerings to all Buddhas,
Following and practicing the great Way,
They successively accomplished Buddhahood,
Conferring predictions in turn.

"The last among heavenly honored ones
Was named the Buddha Dīpaṃkara,
Guide of all seers,
Who liberated immeasurable multitudes.

"That Dharma Teacher Varaprabha
At that time had one disciple
Whose mind constantly harbored indolence,
Greedily attached to fame and gain.

"Seeking fame and gain without satiation,
Frequently visiting noble households,
He abandoned what he had memorized,
Forgot it and could not penetrate it.

"Because of this cause and condition,
He was called Yaśaskāma.
Yet he also practiced various good deeds,
And was able to see innumerable Buddhas.

"Making offerings to all Buddhas,
Following and practicing the great Way,
Perfecting the six pāramitās,
He now sees the Lion of the Śākyas.

"Afterward he shall become a Buddha
Whose name shall be Maitreya,
Widely ferrying across living beings,
Their number beyond measure.

"After that Buddha's final nirvāṇa,
The indolent one—that is you.
That Dharma Teacher Varaprabha
Is now my very self.

"I witnessed the Buddha Dīpaṃkara—
The original light-sign was like this.
From this I know the present Buddha
Wishes to expound the Lotus Sutra.

"The present sign is like the original auspice—
This is the skillful means of all Buddhas.
Now the Buddha emits this light
To help reveal the meaning of true characteristics.

"All people should now know:
Join your palms single-mindedly and wait—
The Buddha shall rain down the Dharma rain,
Satisfying all who seek the Way.

"Those seeking the Three Vehicles—
If they harbor doubts or regrets—
The Buddha shall dispel and sever them,
Causing them to be exhausted without remainder."

CHAPTER TWO: SKILLFUL MEANS

At that time, the World-Honored One arose from samādhi with tranquil composure and addressed Śāriputra: "The wisdom of the Buddhas is extremely profound and immeasurable. The gateway to this wisdom is difficult to comprehend and difficult to enter. It cannot be known by any śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha. Wherefore is this so? The Buddhas have personally drawn near to hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of innumerable Buddhas, and have exhaustively practiced the immeasurable Dharma-ways of all Buddhas, advancing vigorously and courageously, until their names were universally heard. They have perfected the extremely profound and unprecedented Dharma, and whatever they teach in accordance with circumstances has a meaning difficult to comprehend.

"Śāriputra, since attaining Buddhahood, through various causes and conditions, various parables, I have extensively proclaimed teachings with words, and through immeasurable skillful means have guided living beings, causing them to separate from all attachments. Wherefore is this so? The Tathāgata's skillful means and the pāramitā of insight and vision are both completely perfected.

"Śāriputra, the insight and vision of the Tathāgata are vast, profound, and far-reaching—immeasurable, unobstructed. [He possesses] powers, fearlessnesses, dhyāna concentrations, liberations, and samādhis, having penetrated deeply without limit, and has perfected all unprecedented Dharmas.

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is able to make various distinctions and skillfully expound all dharmas. His words are gentle and soft, delighting the hearts of all.

"Śāriputra, to speak concisely: the Buddha has completely perfected the immeasurable, limitless, unprecedented Dharma.

"Cease, Śāriputra! There is no need to speak further. Wherefore is this so? Because what the Buddha has perfected is the foremost, rare, and difficult-to-understand Dharma. Only a Buddha together with a Buddha can fathom the true mark of all dharmas—that is to say: the suchness of their marks, the suchness of their nature, the suchness of their embodiment, the suchness of their power, the suchness of their function, the suchness of their causes, the suchness of their conditions, the suchness of their effects, the suchness of their retributions, and the suchness of their ultimate equality from beginning to end."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"The Hero of the World is immeasurable—
All devas and worldly people,
All categories of living beings,
None can know the Buddha.

"The Buddha's powers and fearlessnesses,
His liberations and samādhis,
And all the Buddha's other dharmas—
None can measure them.

"Originally, from innumerable Buddhas,
Having completely practiced all Ways,
The profound and wondrous Dharma,
Difficult to see and difficult to comprehend—

"Throughout immeasurable billions of kalpas,
Having practiced all these Ways,
At the place of enlightenment he attained the fruit.
I have completely known and seen it all.

"Such great fruition and retribution,
The meaning of various natures and marks—
I, together with the Buddhas of the ten directions,
Alone can know this matter.

"This Dharma cannot be demonstrated;
The mark of words is extinguished.
Of all other categories of living beings,
None are able to comprehend it,

"Except for the multitude of Bodhisattvas
Whose power of faith is firm and solid.
The multitude of Buddha-disciples
Who have made offerings to all Buddhas,

"Who have exhausted all outflows
And dwell in this final body—
Even such people as these
Cannot bear this burden.

"Even if the world were filled
Entirely with ones like Śāriputra,
Who exhausted their thinking to measure it together,
They could not fathom the Buddha's wisdom.

"Even if the ten directions were filled
Entirely with ones like Śāriputra,
And the rest of the disciples
Also filled the lands of the ten directions,

"And exhausted their thinking to measure it together,
Still they could not know it.
Pratyekabuddhas of keen wisdom,
Without outflows, in their final bodies,

"Also filling the ten directions' realms,
Their number like bamboo forests—
If these all with one mind,
Throughout billions of immeasurable kalpas,

"Wished to contemplate the Buddha's true wisdom,
They could not know even a small portion.
Newly-resolved Bodhisattvas
Who have made offerings to innumerable Buddhas,

"Who thoroughly understand all meanings
And are moreover able to expound Dharma well—
Like rice, hemp, bamboo, and reeds
Filling the lands of the ten directions—

"With one mind, through wondrous wisdom,
Throughout kalpas numerous as Ganges' sands,
All together contemplating and measuring,
They could not know the Buddha's wisdom.

"Irreversible Bodhisattvas,
Their number like Ganges' sands—
With one mind seeking together,
Still they could not know it.

"Again I tell Śāriputra:
The inconceivable, without outflows,
Extremely profound and wondrous Dharma—
I have now completely attained it.

"Only I know this mark;
The Buddhas of the ten directions are likewise thus.
Śāriputra, you should know:
The words of all Buddhas do not differ.

"Toward the Dharma the Buddha has expounded,
You should generate great power of faith.
After the World-Honored One's Dharma has long endured,
He must in the end proclaim the truth.

"I tell the multitude of śrāvakas
And those seeking the pratyekabuddha vehicle:
'I enable you to escape the bonds of suffering
And attain nirvāṇa.'

"Through the power of skillful means,
The Buddha manifests the teaching of the Three Vehicles.
Living beings are attached in various places;
He draws them forth and enables them to emerge.

At that time in the great assembly, there were śrāvakas—Arhats whose outflows were exhausted, such as Ājñātakauṇḍinya and twelve hundred others, as well as bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who had generated the resolve for the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha vehicles. Each had this thought: "For what reason does the World-Honored One now so earnestly extol skillful means and make this statement: 'The Dharma the Buddha has attained is extremely profound and difficult to comprehend. Whatever he says has a meaning difficult to know, which all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas cannot reach. The Buddha has expounded the single meaning of liberation, yet we also have attained this Dharma and arrived at nirvāṇa. But now we do not know toward what this meaning tends.'"

At that time Śāriputra, perceiving the doubts in the minds of the fourfold assembly and being himself not yet comprehending, addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, by what cause and condition do you now so earnestly extol the foremost skillful means of all Buddhas—the extremely profound, wondrous, and difficult-to-comprehend Dharma? From times past until now, I have never heard such an exposition from the Buddha. Now the fourfold assembly all harbor doubts. We only pray that the World-Honored One will expound this matter. World-Honored One, for what reason do you so earnestly extol this extremely profound, wondrous, and difficult-to-comprehend Dharma?"

At that time Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Sun of Wisdom, Great Sage and Honored One,
After so long you now expound this Dharma.
You yourself proclaim having attained such
Powers, fearlessnesses, and samādhis,

"Dhyāna concentrations, liberations, and such—
Inconceivable dharmas.
The Dharma attained at the place of enlightenment—
None can raise questions about it.

"My intention is difficult to fathom;
There is also none who can question it.
Without being questioned, you speak of your own accord,
Extolling the Way you have practiced:

"'The wisdom is extremely wondrous—
What all Buddhas have attained.'
The outflow-free Arhats
And those seeking nirvāṇa

"Have now all fallen into a net of doubts:
'Why does the Buddha speak of this?'
Those seeking the pratyekabuddha vehicle,
Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs,

"Devas, dragons, ghosts, and spirits,
Gandharvas and such,
Gaze at one another harboring hesitation,
Looking up to the Honored One of Two Feet:

"'What is the meaning of this matter?'
We pray the Buddha will explain.
Among the multitude of śrāvakas,
The Buddha has said I am foremost.

"Yet now regarding my own wisdom,
I am doubtful and cannot comprehend:
Is this the ultimate Dharma?
Or is this the path to be practiced?

"Sons born from the Buddha's mouth,
With palms joined, gaze upward and wait,
Praying you will emit wondrous sound
And timely expound the truth.

"Devas, dragons, spirits, and such,
Their number like Ganges' sands,
Bodhisattvas seeking Buddhahood,
Eighty thousand in great number,

"And from myriads of billions of lands,
Wheel-turning sage kings have arrived,
With palms joined and reverent minds,
Wishing to hear the complete Way."

At that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Cease, cease! There is no need to speak further. If I were to speak of this matter, all the devas and humans in all worlds would be shocked and doubtful."

Śāriputra again addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we only pray you will speak of it, we only pray you will speak of it. Wherefore is this so? In this assembly are immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of asaṃkhya living beings who have seen all Buddhas, whose faculties are keen and sharp, whose wisdom is clear and luminous. If they hear what the Buddha expounds, they will be able to believe it with reverence."

At that time Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Dharma King, Supreme and Honored One,
Only speak—pray have no concern!
In this assembly of immeasurable multitudes,
There are those able to believe with reverence."

The Buddha again stopped Śāriputra: "If I were to speak of this matter, all the devas, humans, and asuras in all the world would be shocked and doubtful, and the bhikṣus of overweening pride would fall into a great pit."

At that time the World-Honored One repeated this in verse, saying:

"Cease, cease—there is no need to speak!
My Dharma is wondrous and difficult to contemplate.
Those of overweening pride,
Hearing it, will certainly not believe with reverence."

At that time Śāriputra again addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we only pray you will speak of it, we only pray you will speak of it! In this present assembly, hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions such as we have, world after world, already received transformation from the Buddha. People such as these will surely be able to believe with reverence, attaining peace and security for the long night, receiving much benefit."

At that time Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Supreme Honored One of Two Feet,
Pray expound the foremost Dharma!
I am the Buddha's eldest son—
I only pray you will explain with discrimination.

"The immeasurable multitude in this assembly
Can believe this Dharma with reverence.
The Buddha has already, world after world,
Taught and transformed ones such as these.

"All with one mind and palms joined,
They wish to hear and receive the Buddha's words.
We twelve hundred,
And others seeking Buddhahood,

"Pray for the sake of this multitude
That you will explain with discrimination.
When these hear this Dharma,
They will experience great joy."

At that time the World-Honored One told Śāriputra: "Since you have now earnestly requested three times, how can I not speak? You should now listen attentively and think well upon this. I shall explain and analyze it for you." As he spoke these words, in the assembly there were bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās—five thousand persons who immediately rose from their seats, bowed to the Buddha, and withdrew. Wherefore was this so? The roots of transgression of this group were deep and grave, and [they harbored] overweening pride. Thinking they had attained what they had not attained, thinking they had realized what they had not realized, having such faults as these, therefore they did not remain. The World-Honored One remained silent and did not restrain them.

At that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: "My present assembly is now free of branches and leaves and is purely composed of the true and substantial. Śāriputra, it is well that such people of overweening pride have withdrawn. You should now listen well; I shall expound for you." Śāriputra said: "So be it, World-Honored One! I joyfully wish to hear."

The Buddha told Śāriputra:

"Such wondrous Dharma as this is expounded by the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, only occasionally, like the uḍumbara flower which appears but once in a great while. Śāriputra, you should all believe what the Buddha says; his words are not false or vain.

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas expound the Dharma in accordance with what is appropriate, and its meaning is difficult to comprehend. Wherefore is this so? Through immeasurable skillful means, through various causes and conditions, through parables and expressions, I expound all dharmas. This Dharma is not something that thought and discrimination can comprehend; only the Buddhas can know it. Wherefore is this so? The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world for the sake of one great cause and condition alone.

"Śāriputra, what is meant by 'the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world for the sake of one great cause and condition alone'? The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world because they wish to cause living beings to open the Buddha's insight and vision, enabling them to attain purity. They appear in the world because they wish to demonstrate to living beings the Buddha's insight and vision. They appear in the world because they wish to cause living beings to awaken to the Buddha's insight and vision. They appear in the world because they wish to cause living beings to enter the path of the Buddha's insight and vision. Śāriputra, this is the one great cause and condition for which all Buddhas appear in the world."

The Buddha told Śāriputra: "The Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, merely teach and transform Bodhisattvas. All their actions are always for one matter alone: solely to demonstrate and awaken living beings to the Buddha's insight and vision.

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata expounds the Dharma for living beings solely through the One Buddha Vehicle. There are no other vehicles, whether two or three.

"Śāriputra, the Dharma of all the Buddhas of the ten directions is likewise thus.

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the past expounded dharmas for living beings through immeasurable, innumerable skillful means, through various causes and conditions, through parables and expressions. All these dharmas were for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All these living beings, hearing the Dharma from the Buddhas, ultimately attain the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, when the Buddhas of the future appear in the world, they too will expound dharmas for living beings through immeasurable, innumerable skillful means, through various causes and conditions, through parables and expressions. All these dharmas will be for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All these living beings, hearing the Dharma from the Buddhas, will ultimately attain the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, presently in the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddha-lands throughout the ten directions, who bring much benefit and peace to living beings—these Buddhas too expound dharmas for living beings through immeasurable, innumerable skillful means, through various causes and conditions, through parables and expressions. All these dharmas are for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All these living beings, hearing the Dharma from the Buddhas, ultimately attain the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, these Buddhas merely teach and transform Bodhisattvas. They wish to demonstrate to living beings the Buddha's insight and vision. They wish to cause living beings to awaken to the Buddha's insight and vision. They wish to cause living beings to enter the Buddha's insight and vision.

"Śāriputra, I too am now likewise thus. Knowing that living beings have various desires and that the attachments in the depths of their minds differ, in accordance with their fundamental natures, through various causes and conditions, parables, and expressions, through the power of skillful means, I expound the Dharma for them.

"Śāriputra, all of this is for the purpose of enabling them to attain the One Buddha Vehicle and the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions there are not even two vehicles, how much less three!

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas appear in the five turbidities of an evil world—namely, the turbidity of the kalpa, the turbidity of afflictions, the turbidity of living beings, the turbidity of views, and the turbidity of lifespan. It is thus, Śāriputra: when the kalpa is turbid and chaotic, living beings are heavily defiled, avaricious, jealous, and envious, thereby perfecting various unwholesome roots. Therefore the Buddhas, through the power of skillful means, within the One Buddha Vehicle, make distinctions and expound three.

"Śāriputra, if any of my disciples claim to be Arhats or pratyekabuddhas but do not hear or know that the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, merely teach and transform Bodhisattvas—such are not disciples of the Buddha, not Arhats, and not pratyekabuddhas.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra, if these bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs claim to have already attained Arhatship, to be in their final body, to have reached final nirvāṇa, and consequently do not further aspire to seek anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, you should know that all such people harbor overweening pride. Wherefore is this so? It is impossible for a bhikṣu who has truly attained Arhatship not to believe this Dharma—except after the Buddha's final nirvāṇa when there is no Buddha present. Wherefore is this so? After the Buddha's final nirvāṇa, those who can receive, uphold, read, recite, and comprehend the meaning of sutras such as these will be difficult to find. If they encounter other Buddhas, they will then attain decisive understanding regarding this Dharma.

"Śāriputra, you should all single-mindedly believe, comprehend, receive, and uphold the Buddha's words. The words of the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, are not false or vain. There is no other vehicle; there is only the One Buddha Vehicle."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs
Harboring overweening pride,
Upāsakas with self-conceit,
And upāsikās lacking faith—

"These four groups and such,
Five thousand in number,
Do not perceive their own faults;
Their precepts have deficiencies and flaws,

"Yet they guard and treasure their imperfections.
These people of small wisdom have departed—
The chaff amidst the multitude.
By the Buddha's awesome virtue they left.

"These people have scant merit and virtue
And cannot receive this Dharma.
This assembly is now free of branches and leaves,
Remaining only the purely true and substantial.

"Śāriputra, listen well!
The Dharma attained by all Buddhas,
Through the power of immeasurable skillful means,
Is expounded for living beings.

"What living beings think in their minds,
The various paths they practice,
Their manifold natures and desires,
And the good and evil karma of past lives—

"The Buddha completely knows all this,
And through various conditions and parables,
Through expressions and the power of skillful means,
He causes all to rejoice.

"Whether expounding sūtras,
Gāthās, or accounts of previous events,
Of past births and unprecedented matters,
Or also expounding causality,

"Parables together with geyas,
And upadeśa sūtras—
Those of dull faculties who delight in lesser dharmas,
Greedily attached to birth and death,

"Who, despite innumerable Buddhas,
Do not practice the profound and wondrous Way,
Who are harassed and confused by manifold sufferings—
For these I expound nirvāṇa.

"I established these skillful means
To cause them to enter into Buddha-wisdom.
I have never yet told you
That you shall attain the Buddha-Way.

"The reason I have never yet spoken
Is because the time to speak had not yet arrived.
Now precisely is that time
To decisively expound the Great Vehicle.

"These nine divisions of my Dharma,
Expounded in accordance with living beings,
Have as their foundation entry into the Great Vehicle—
Therefore I expound this sutra.

"There are Buddha-sons whose minds are pure,
Who are gentle and also of keen faculties,
Who in the presence of immeasurable Buddhas
Have practiced the profound and wondrous Way.

"For these Buddha-sons
I expound this Great Vehicle sutra.
I predict that such people
In future lives shall attain the Buddha-Way,

"Because with profound minds they are mindful of the Buddha
And uphold the pure precepts.
When these hear they shall become Buddhas,
Great joy fills their bodies.

"The Buddha, knowing their mental conduct,
Therefore expounds the Great Vehicle for them.
When śrāvakas or Bodhisattvas
Hear the Dharma I expound,

"Even a single verse,
All without doubt shall become Buddhas.
In the Buddha-lands of the ten directions,
There is only the Dharma of One Vehicle—

"There is no second and no third,
Except the Buddha's expedient teaching,
Where he merely uses provisional names
To guide living beings,

"Expounding the Buddha's wisdom.
The Buddhas appear in the world
Solely for this one true matter;
The other two are not true.

"They will never use a Lesser Vehicle
To ferry living beings across.
The Buddha himself dwells in the Great Vehicle,
And according to the Dharma he has attained—

"Adorned with the power of concentration and wisdom—
With this he ferries living beings across.
Having himself realized the supreme Way,
The Great Vehicle's equal Dharma,

"If he were to transform even one person
By means of the Lesser Vehicle,
I would be guilty of stinginess and greed—
Such a thing is impossible.

"If a person has faith in and takes refuge with the Buddha,
The Tathāgata does not deceive or delude,
Nor has he thoughts of avarice or envy;
He has severed evil in all dharmas.

"Therefore, throughout the ten directions,
The Buddha alone is without fear.
I adorn my body with the marks,
My light illuminates the world.

"Honored by immeasurable multitudes,
I expound the seal of true characteristics.
Śāriputra, you should know
That I originally made a vow,

"Wishing to cause all the multitude
To be equal to me without difference.
As was my vow in times past,
Now it has been completely fulfilled—

"I transform all living beings,
Causing them all to enter the Buddha-Way.
If when I encounter living beings,
I were to teach them all the Buddha-Way,

"Those without wisdom would become confused,
Deluded and unable to receive the teaching.
I know these living beings
Have never cultivated wholesome roots,

"Are firmly attached to the five desires,
And through delusion and craving generate afflictions.
Through the causes and conditions of various desires,
They fall into the three evil paths,

"Revolving through the six destinies,
Thoroughly experiencing all sufferings and poisons.
Receiving the minute form in the womb,
World after world it constantly increases.

"People of scant virtue and little merit,
Oppressed by manifold sufferings,
Enter the dense forest of wrong views—
Existence, non-existence, and the like.

"Relying upon all these views,
Fully possessed of sixty-two,
Deeply attached to false and empty dharmas,
Firmly clinging and unable to release them,

"They are arrogant and self-exalting,
Flattering and crooked, their minds insincere.
Throughout thousands of myriads of billions of kalpas,
They hear not the Buddha's name,

"Nor do they hear the correct Dharma—
Such people are difficult to ferry across.
Therefore, Śāriputra,
I establish skillful means,

"Expounding the path that exhausts all suffering,
Demonstrating nirvāṇa to them.
Though I speak of nirvāṇa,
This too is not true extinction.

"All dharmas from the origin
Have always borne the mark of tranquil extinction.
When Buddha-sons have practiced the Way,
In a future age they shall become Buddhas.

"I possess the power of skillful means
And demonstrate the teaching of the Three Vehicles.
All the World-Honored Ones
Expound the path of One Vehicle.

"Now this great assembly
Should all eliminate doubts and perplexities.
The words of all Buddhas do not differ—
There is only One, not Two Vehicles.

"Throughout past immeasurable kalpas,
Innumerable Buddhas who have entered extinction—
Hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of kinds,
Their number beyond measure—

"Such World-Honored Ones as these,
Through various conditions and parables,
Through the power of innumerable skillful means,
Have expounded the characteristics of all dharmas.

"These World-Honored Ones
All expound the Dharma of One Vehicle,
Transforming immeasurable multitudes,
Causing them to enter the Buddha-Way.

"Moreover, these Great Sage Lords,
Knowing all the world—
Devas, humans, and all categories of beings—
The deep desires of their minds,

"Further employ different skillful means
To help illuminate the foremost meaning.
If there are categories of living beings
Who encountered Buddhas of the past—

"Whether they heard Dharma, practiced giving,
Or upheld precepts, practiced patience,
Vigor, dhyāna, wisdom, and such,
Cultivating merit and wisdom in various ways—

"All such people as these
Have already attained the Buddha-Way.
After the Buddhas' final nirvāṇa,
If people have gentle and pliant minds,

"All such living beings as these
Have already attained the Buddha-Way.
After the Buddhas' final nirvāṇa,
Those who make offerings to śarīra,

"Erecting myriads of billions of kinds of stūpas—
Of gold, silver, and crystal,
Giant clam shell and agate,
Rose quartz and lapis lazuli jewels,

"Pure, vast, and well adorned,
Decorating all the stūpas—
Or some who erect stone temples,
Of sandalwood and aloe wood,

"Hovenia and other timbers,
Brick, tile, clay, and earth—
Or in a deserted wilderness
Pile earth to form a Buddha-shrine—

"Or even children at play
Heap sand to make a Buddha-stūpa—
All such people as these
Have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"If people, for the Buddha's sake,
Establish various images,
Carved and sculpted in manifold forms,
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"Whether made of seven jewels,
Copper—red or white,
Pewter, lead, or tin,
Iron, wood, or also clay,

"Or fashioned with lacquer-coated cloth
To adorn and create Buddha-images—
All such people as these
Have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"Those who painted Buddha-images
With the hundred merits adorning their marks—
Whether doing so themselves or employing others—
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"Or even children at play,
With grass, wood, or brush,
Or using fingernails
To draw and create Buddha-images—

"All such people as these,
Gradually accumulating merit and virtue,
Perfecting a heart of great compassion,
Have already attained the Buddha-Way,

"Merely transforming Bodhisattvas
And ferrying across immeasurable multitudes.
If people, before stūpas and shrines,
Or precious images and painted images,

"With flowers, incense, banners, and canopies,
Make offerings with reverent minds—
Or if they employ others to make music,
Beating drums, blowing horns and conches,

"Flutes, pipes, lutes, and harps,
Lutes, cymbals, and gongs—
Such manifold wondrous sounds
All continuously offered,

"Or with joyful minds
Singing songs praising the Buddha's virtue—
Even with but one small sound—
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"If a person with scattered mind,
Even with but a single flower,
Makes offerings to a painted image,
They shall gradually see innumerable Buddhas.

"Or if people make prostrations,
Or merely join their palms,
Or even raise a single hand,
Or slightly bow their heads,

"Making offerings to images with these—
They shall gradually see immeasurable Buddhas,
Themselves attaining the supreme Way,
Extensively ferrying across innumerable multitudes,

"Entering nirvāṇa without residue,
Like firewood exhausted and fire extinguished.
If people with scattered minds
Enter stūpas or shrines

"And recite but once 'Namo Buddha,'
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.
Regarding all Buddhas of the past,
Whether while living or after extinction,

"If there were those who heard this Dharma,
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.
The World-Honored Ones of the future,
Whose number is without measure—

"These Tathāgatas
Shall also expound the Dharma through skillful means.
All the Tathāgatas,
Through immeasurable skillful means,

"Ferry across all living beings,
Causing them to enter the Buddha's outflow-free wisdom.
Of those who hear the Dharma,
Not one fails to become a Buddha.

"The original vow of all Buddhas:
'The Buddha-Way that I practice—
I universally wish to cause living beings
Also to attain this same Way.'

"The Buddhas of future ages,
Though they expound hundreds of thousands of billions,
Innumerable Dharma-gates,
In truth these are for the One Vehicle.

"All Buddhas, Honored Ones of Two Feet,
Know the Dharma is always without nature;
The Buddha-seed arises from conditions—
Therefore they expound the One Vehicle.

"This Dharma dwells in the Dharma-position;
The marks of the world constantly abide.
Having known this at the place of enlightenment,
The guiding teacher expounds through skillful means.

"The presently existing Buddhas of the ten directions,
Honored and offered by devas and humans,
Their number like Ganges' sands,
Appearing in the world

"To bring peace to living beings,
Also expound this Dharma thus,
Knowing the foremost tranquil extinction,
Through the power of skillful means.

"Though they manifest various paths,
In truth these are for the Buddha Vehicle.
Knowing living beings' various practices,
The thoughts deep within their minds,

"The karma they practiced in the past,
Their desires, natures, and vigor-power,
And the keenness or dullness of their faculties—
Through various causes and conditions,

"Parables and also expressions,
In accordance with what is suitable, they expound through skillful means.
I too am now likewise thus,
To bring peace to living beings,

"Through various Dharma-gates
I proclaim and demonstrate the Buddha-Way.
Through the power of my wisdom,
Knowing living beings' natures and desires,

"I expound all dharmas through skillful means,
Causing all to attain joy.
Śāriputra, you should know
That with the Buddha-eye I observe

"And see living beings of the six paths,
Impoverished, without merit and wisdom,
Entering the dangerous path of birth and death,
Suffering continuing uninterrupted,

"Deeply attached to the five desires
Like a yak loving its tail—
Through greed and craving they cover themselves,
Blind and unseeing, they see nothing.

"Not seeking the Buddha of great power
Or the Dharma that severs suffering,
They deeply enter wrong views,
Wishing through suffering to cast off suffering.

"For the sake of these living beings
I generate a heart of great compassion.
When I first sat at the place of enlightenment,
Contemplating the tree and also walking,

"Throughout three times seven days,
I contemplated matters such as these:
'The wisdom I have attained
Is wondrous and most supreme.

"'But living beings' faculties are dull;
Attached to pleasures, blinded by delusion—
How can categories such as these
Possibly be ferried across?'

"At that time all the Brahma Kings
And the Śakra Devānām Indras,
The Four Heavenly Kings who protect the world,
And the Great Īśvara Deva,

"Together with other hosts of devas,
With retinues of hundreds of thousands of myriads,
Reverently joining palms and making obeisances,
Requested that I turn the Dharma-wheel.

"I then thought to myself:
'If I merely praise the Buddha Vehicle,
Living beings sunk in suffering
Will be unable to believe this Dharma.

"'Through breaking the Dharma and not believing,
They would fall into the three evil paths.
I would rather not expound the Dharma
And swiftly enter into nirvāṇa.'

"Then recalling the Buddhas of the past,
The power of skillful means they practiced,
'The Way I have now attained
Should also be expounded as the Three Vehicles.'

"While making such contemplation,
The Buddhas of the ten directions all appeared,
With Brahma voices comforting and exhorting me:
'Excellent, Śākyamuni!

"'Foremost guiding teacher,
Having attained this supreme Dharma,
Following all the Buddhas,
You employ the power of skillful means.

"'We too have all attained
The most wondrous, foremost Dharma,
And for all categories of living beings
Make distinctions expounding the Three Vehicles.

"'Those of little wisdom who delight in lesser dharmas,
Not believing themselves capable of becoming Buddhas—
Therefore through skillful means
We make distinctions expounding various fruits.

"'Though we furthermore expound the Three Vehicles,
It is solely to teach Bodhisattvas.'
Śāriputra, you should know:
I heard the Sacred Lion's

"Profound, pure, and wondrous voice,
Joyfully proclaiming 'Namo Buddha!'
I furthermore made this contemplation:
'I have emerged into a turbid and evil world.

"'As all the Buddhas have expounded,
I too shall follow and practice accordingly.'
Having contemplated this matter,
I immediately proceeded to Vārāṇasī.

"The mark of tranquil extinction of all dharmas
Cannot be conveyed in words.
Through the power of skillful means,
I expounded it for the five bhikṣus.

"This is called turning the Dharma-wheel;
There arose then the sound of 'nirvāṇa,'
As well as 'Arhat,'
And the distinct names 'Dharma' and 'Saṅgha.'

"From distant kalpas until now,
I have praised this nirvāṇa Dharma:
'The suffering of birth and death is eternally exhausted'—
I constantly expound thus.

"Śāriputra, you should know:
I see Buddha-sons
Aspiring to seek the Buddha-Way,
Immeasurable thousands of myriads of billions—

"All with reverent minds
Coming to where the Buddha is.
They have heard from all Buddhas
The Dharma expounded through skillful means.

"I then made this contemplation:
'The reason the Tathāgata appears
Is to expound the Buddha-wisdom—
Now precisely is the time.'

"Śāriputra, you should know:
People of dull faculties and small wisdom,
Attached to marks and arrogant—
These cannot believe this Dharma.

"Now I joyfully and without fear,
Among the Bodhisattvas,
Frankly casting aside skillful means,
Expound solely the supreme Way.

"When Bodhisattvas hear this Dharma,
All their nets of doubt are removed.
The twelve hundred Arhats
Shall likewise all become Buddhas.

"Like the Buddhas of the three periods of time,
In their manner of expounding the Dharma,
I too am now likewise thus,
Expounding the undifferentiated Dharma.

"The Buddhas' emergence in the world
Is remote and difficult to encounter.
Even when they appear in the world,
To expound this Dharma is also difficult.

"Throughout immeasurable, innumerable kalpas,
To hear this Dharma is also difficult.
Those able to listen to this Dharma—
Such people are also rare.

"Like the uḍumbara flower,
Which all love and delight in,
Rare for devas and humans—
It appears only occasionally.

"Those who hear the Dharma and joyfully praise it,
Even uttering but a single word,
Have thereby already made offerings
To all Buddhas of the three periods of time.

"Such people are extremely rare,
Surpassing even the uḍumbara flower.
You should harbor no doubts—
I am the King of all Dharmas,

"Proclaiming to the entire great assembly:
'Solely through the path of One Vehicle
I teach and transform Bodhisattvas;
There are no śrāvaka disciples.'

"You, Śāriputra,
Śrāvakas and Bodhisattvas,
Should know this wondrous Dharma
Is the secret essential of all Buddhas.

"In this evil world of five turbidities,
Where beings merely delight in attachment to desires,
Living beings such as these
Will never seek the Buddha-Way.

"The evil people of future ages,
Hearing the Buddha expound the One Vehicle,
Shall be deluded, unable to believe and receive it,
And through breaking the Dharma shall fall into evil paths.

"There are those with humility and purity
Who aspire to seek the Buddha-Way—
For ones such as these
I should extensively praise the path of One Vehicle.

"Śāriputra, you should know
The Dharma of all Buddhas is thus:
Through myriads of billions of skillful means,
They expound the Dharma in accordance with what is suitable.

"Those who are not practiced and learned in this
Cannot comprehend it thoroughly.
Since you have already come to know
That all Buddhas, teachers of the world,

"Employ skillful means in accordance with what is suitable,
You should have no further doubts or perplexities.
Let your minds give rise to great joy,
Knowing you shall become Buddhas."

CHAPTER THREE: PARABLES

At that time Śāriputra, leaping with joy, immediately rose, joined his palms together, gazed up at the Honored Countenance, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "Now, hearing this Dharma-sound from the World-Honored One, my heart leaps with joy and I have experienced what I have never before experienced. Wherefore is this so? In former times when I heard such Dharma from the Buddha and saw the Bodhisattvas receive predictions of Buddhahood, while we were not included in these matters, I deeply lamented and grieved at having lost the Tathāgata's immeasurable insight and vision.

"World-Honored One, when I would constantly dwell alone in mountain forests and beneath trees, whether sitting or walking, I would always have this thought: 'We have all equally entered into the Dharma-nature—why does the Tathāgata ferry us across through the Lesser Vehicle Dharma?' This is our fault, not the World-Honored One's. Wherefore is this so? Had we waited for the exposition of the causes for perfecting anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, we would certainly have been ferried across through the Great Vehicle. However, we did not comprehend that [the Buddha] expounds in accordance with what is appropriate through skillful means. Upon first hearing the Buddha-Dharma, we immediately encountered it, believed, received, contemplated, and realized it.

"World-Honored One, from times past until now, throughout the day and night, I have constantly reproached myself. But now, from the Buddha, I have heard this Dharma never before heard, this unprecedented Dharma, and all my doubts and regrets have been severed. My body and mind are at ease; I have quickly attained peace and security. Today at last I know that truly I am a Buddha-son, born from the Buddha's mouth, born from the Dharma through transformation, having obtained my share of the Buddha-Dharma."

At that time Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Hearing this Dharma-sound,
I have attained what I never before had.
My heart harbors great joy;
All nets of doubt have been removed.

"From ancient times receiving the Buddha's teaching,
I have not lost the Great Vehicle.
The Buddha's voice is extremely rare—
It can remove the afflictions of living beings.

"I have already attained the exhaustion of outflows;
Hearing this also removes my cares and afflictions.
I dwelt in mountain valleys
Or beneath forest trees,

"Whether sitting or walking,
Constantly contemplating this matter.
Alas! I deeply reproached myself:
'Why have I deceived myself?

"'We too are Buddha-sons,
Having equally entered the outflow-free Dharma,
Yet cannot in the future
Expound the supreme Way.

"'The golden color and thirty-two marks,
The ten powers and various liberations—
We share in one Dharma together,
Yet have not attained these things.

"'The eighty kinds of wondrous excellences,
The eighteen unique Buddha-dharmas—
Such merits as these,
All of them I have lost.'

"When I would walk alone,
Seeing the Buddha amidst the great assembly,
His fame filling the ten directions,
Extensively benefiting living beings,

"I thought I had lost this benefit;
I had deceived and deluded myself.
Constantly, day and night,
I would contemplate this matter,

"Wishing to ask the World-Honored One
Whether I had lost it or not.
I constantly saw the World-Honored One
Praising all the Bodhisattvas;

"Thus throughout day and night
I pondered over this matter.
Now, hearing the Buddha's voice
Expounding in accordance with what is appropriate,

"The outflow-free, inconceivable [Dharma],
Causing multitudes to reach the place of enlightenment—
I originally adhered to wrong views,
Serving as a teacher for the brāhmaṇas.

"The World-Honored One, knowing my mind,
Uprooted the wrong and expounded nirvāṇa.
I completely eliminated wrong views
And attained realization of the Dharma of emptiness.

"At that time my mind declared to itself
That I had attained extinction.
But now I realize myself
That this was not true extinction.

"When I attain Buddhahood,
Perfected with the thirty-two marks,
Revered by devas, humans, yakṣas,
Dragons, spirits, and others—

"At that time it may be said
I am forever exhausted and extinguished without remainder.
The Buddha, amidst the great assembly,
Has said I shall become a Buddha.

"Hearing such Dharma-sound,
All doubts and regrets have been removed.
When first I heard what the Buddha expounded,
In my mind great shock and doubt arose:

"'Could this not be Māra
Assuming the Buddha's form,
To harass and disturb my mind?'
The Buddha through various conditions,

"Parables and skillful expressions,
With a mind tranquil as the sea—
Hearing it, my net of doubts was severed.
The Buddha spoke of Buddhas of past ages,

"Immeasurable numbers who entered extinction,
Dwelling secure in skillful means;
They too all expounded this Dharma.
Present and future Buddhas,

"Whose number is without measure,
Also through various skillful means
Expound this Dharma thus.
Just as the present World-Honored One,

"From his birth and leaving home,
Attaining the Way and turning the Dharma-wheel,
Also expounds through skillful means.
The World-Honored One expounds the true path;

"Pāpīyān [the evil one] has no such matter.
Through this I definitely know
This is not Māra assuming the Buddha's form.
Because I had fallen into a net of doubts,

"I thought it was Māra's doing.
Hearing the Buddha's gentle, soft voice,
Profound, far-reaching, and extremely wondrous,
Expounding and manifesting the pure Dharma,

"My heart experienced great joy.
Doubts and regrets are forever exhausted;
I dwell secure in true wisdom.
I definitely shall become a Buddha,

"Honored by devas and humans.
I shall turn the supreme Dharma-wheel,
Teaching and transforming the Bodhisattvas."

At that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: "I now amidst this assembly of devas, humans, śramaṇas, brāhmaṇas, and others proclaim: In the past, in the presence of two myriads of billions of Buddhas, for the sake of the supreme Way, I constantly taught and transformed you. Throughout the long night you followed me in receiving instruction. Because I guided you through skillful means, you were born into my Dharma.

"Śāriputra, in former times I taught you to aspire to the Buddha-Way. You have now completely forgotten this and便自謂已得滅度 [consider yourself to have already attained extinction]. I now once again wish to cause you to recall the original vow and the Way you practiced. Therefore, for the śrāvakas, I expound this Great Vehicle sutra called the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas.

"Śāriputra, in a future age, after immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable kalpas, having made offerings to several thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas, having upheld the correct Dharma and perfected the path practiced by Bodhisattvas, you shall attain Buddhahood. Your name shall be Padmaprabha Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna, Sugata, Lokavid, Anuttara, Puruṣa-damya-sārathi, Śāstā-deva-manuṣyānām, Buddha, Bhagavat. Your land shall be named Vimalā ['Free from Defilement']. The earth shall be level and pure, adorned and exquisite, peaceful, prosperous, and happy, with devas and humans flourishing. The ground shall be of lapis lazuli with eight crossroads, bordered with golden cords. Alongside shall be rows of seven-jeweled trees, constantly bearing flowers and fruits. The Tathāgata Padmaprabha shall also teach and transform living beings through the Three Vehicles.

"Śāriputra, although that Buddha appears at a time that is not an evil age, because of his original vows he expounds the Dharma of the Three Vehicles. That kalpa shall be named Mahāratnapratimaṇḍita ['Great Jeweled Adornment']. Why is it named Great Jeweled Adornment? In that land, Bodhisattvas are regarded as great jewels. Those Bodhisattvas shall be immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable, beyond what calculations or parables can reach; no one besides those with the Buddha's power of wisdom can know their number. When they wish to walk, jeweled flowers support their feet. These Bodhisattvas are not those who have newly generated the resolve; all have long planted roots of virtue. In the presence of immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas they have purely cultivated the holy life, constantly receiving praise from all Buddhas. They constantly cultivate Buddha-wisdom, possess great spiritual powers, thoroughly know all the gateways to the Dharmas, are straightforward, genuine, and undeceptive, and their aspirations and mindfulness are firm and solid. Bodhisattvas such as these shall fill that land.

"Śāriputra, the lifespan of the Buddha Padmaprabha shall be twelve lesser kalpas—excluding the time when he was a prince before becoming a Buddha. The people of that land shall live eight lesser kalpas. After twelve lesser kalpas, the Tathāgata Padmaprabha shall confer upon the Bodhisattva Dhṛtipariparipūrṇa the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, telling the bhikṣus: 'This Bodhisattva Dhṛtipariparipūrṇa shall next become a Buddha, whose name shall be Padmapadaviśīrṇagāmin, Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha. His Buddha-land shall also be thus.'

"Śāriputra, after this Buddha Padmaprabha enters final nirvāṇa, the correct Dharma shall dwell in the world for thirty-two lesser kalpas, and the semblance Dharma shall also dwell for thirty-two lesser kalpas."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Śāriputra, in a future age
Shall become a Buddha, universally honored in wisdom,
Whose name shall be Padmaprabha,
Ferrying across immeasurable multitudes.

"Having made offerings to innumerable Buddhas,
Perfecting the practices of Bodhisattvas,
The ten powers and other merits,
He shall realize the supreme Way.

"After immeasurable kalpas have passed,
The kalpa shall be named Great Jeweled Adornment,
The world named Free from Defilement—
Pure, without impurities or blemishes.

"With lapis lazuli as its ground,
Golden cords bordering its paths,
Seven-jeweled trees of mixed colors
Constantly bearing flowers and fruits.

"The Bodhisattvas of that land,
Their aspirations constantly firm and solid,
Having all perfected
Spiritual powers and pāramitās—

"In the presence of innumerable Buddhas,
They have well studied the Bodhisattva-Way.
Great beings such as these
Are transformed by the Buddha Padmaprabha.

"When the Buddha was a prince,
He renounced his kingdom and worldly glory.
In his very final body
He left home and perfected the Buddha-Way.

"The Buddha Padmaprabha shall dwell in the world
For twelve lesser kalpas.
The people of that land
Shall have lifespans of eight lesser kalpas.

"After the Buddha's extinction,
The correct Dharma shall dwell in the world
For thirty-two lesser kalpas,
Extensively ferrying across all living beings.

"When the correct Dharma is exhausted,
The semblance [Dharma shall last] thirty-two [kalpas].
Śarīra shall be widely distributed,
Universally receiving offerings from devas and humans.

"What the Buddha Padmaprabha accomplishes—
These matters shall all be thus.
That Honored Sage of Two Feet
Shall be most supreme, without equal or match.

"That one shall be none other than you—
You should rejoice and celebrate!"

At that time the fourfold assembly—bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās—together with devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, and other members of the great assembly, seeing Śāriputra before the Buddha receive the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, experienced great joy in their hearts, leaping with immeasurable delight. Each removed the upper garment they were wearing and offered it to the Buddha. Śakra Devānām Indra, the Brahmā Heavenly King, and others, together with innumerable celestial sons, also made offerings to the Buddha with wondrous celestial garments, celestial mandārava flowers, mahāmandārava flowers, and such. The celestial garments they scattered remained in empty space, revolving of themselves. Celestial music of hundreds of thousands of myriads of kinds simultaneously played in empty space, raining down multitudes of celestial flowers. And they spoke these words: "Long ago at Vārāṇasī the Buddha first turned the Dharma-wheel; now he again turns the supreme and greatest Dharma-wheel!"

At that time the celestial sons, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Long ago at Vārāṇasī
He turned the Dharma-wheel of the Four Noble Truths,
Making distinctions and expounding all dharmas—
The arising and cessation of the five aggregates.

"Now again he turns the most wondrous,
Supreme and great Dharma-wheel.
This Dharma is extremely deep and mysterious;
Few are able to believe it.

"We from ancient times until now
Have repeatedly heard the World-Honored One expound,
But have never before heard
Such profound, wondrous, and supreme Dharma.

"Since the World-Honored One expounds this Dharma,
We all rejoice accordingly.
The greatly wise Śāriputra
Has now received the honored prediction.

"We too are likewise thus—
We shall certainly attain Buddhahood.
Throughout all the world
Most honored, without any superior.

"The Buddha-Way is inconceivable;
He expounds through skillful means in accordance with what is appropriate.
Whatever merit and karmic activity we possess,
Whether of this life or past lives,

"Together with seeing the Buddha's merit—
All of it we dedicate toward the Buddha-Way."

At that time Śāriputra addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I now have no further doubts or regrets. Personally before the Buddha I have received the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. These twelve hundred whose minds are self-mastered formerly dwelt at the stage of learning. The Buddha constantly taught and transformed them, saying: 'My Dharma can separate one from birth, old age, sickness, and death, ultimately reaching nirvāṇa.' Whether at the stage of learning or beyond learning, these people also each considered that, having separated from the view of self as well as views of existence and non-existence, they had attained nirvāṇa. But now, before the World-Honored One, hearing what they had never before heard, they have all fallen into doubt and perplexity. Excellent, World-Honored One! We pray that for the sake of the fourfold assembly you will explain the cause and condition, causing them to separate from doubt and regret."

At that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Did I not previously say that all Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, through various causes and conditions, parables, and expressions, expound the Dharma through skillful means, all for the sake of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi? All these expositions are for the sake of transforming Bodhisattvas. However, Śāriputra, I shall now once more through a parable clarify this meaning further. Those with wisdom comprehend through parables.

"Śāriputra, suppose in a certain land, province, or village there was a great elder who was aged and declining, possessing immeasurable wealth, with many fields, estates, and servants. His house was vast and great, having only a single gate. A great many people—one, two, or even five hundred—were dwelling within it. The halls and pavilions were decayed and old, the walls crumbling down, the pillar bases rotten and decomposed, the beams and ridgepoles tilting precariously. All around, simultaneously, fire suddenly broke out, engulfing the dwelling. The elder's sons—perhaps ten, twenty, or as many as thirty—were inside this house.

"The elder, seeing this great fire arise from the four directions, immediately felt great alarm and terror, and had this thought: 'Though I am able to emerge safely through this burning gate, my sons within the burning house are engrossed in play and amusements, unaware, unknowing, unalarmed, unafraid. Though the fire approaches and presses upon their bodies, causing them pain and suffering, their minds harbor no aversion or distress, and they have no thought of escaping.'

"Śāriputra, this elder made this reflection: 'I have physical strength in my body and hands. I could use a robe or a table to carry them out of the dwelling.' Then he further reflected: 'This house has only one gate, which moreover is narrow and small. My sons are young and immature, lacking understanding. They are attached to their place of play and may fall down and be burned by the fire. I should tell them of this frightening matter: this house is already burning—they must quickly get out now, lest they be harmed by the fire.' Having thought thus, in accordance with his reflections, he informed all his sons: 'You must quickly come out!' Though the father showed compassion and skillfully coaxed and admonished them, the sons were engrossed in amusements and play, unwilling to believe and receive [his warning], neither alarmed nor afraid, and completely lacking any thought of escape. Moreover, they did not even know what fire was, what a house was, or what 'losing' meant. They merely ran about from east to west, playing, glancing at their father and nothing more.

"At that time the elder made this reflection: 'This house is already being consumed by a great fire. If my sons and I do not get out in time, we shall certainly be burned. I shall now employ skillful means to cause my sons to escape this calamity.' The father, knowing what each of his sons had previously enjoyed—various rare and unusual playthings and objects to which they would certainly be attached—spoke to them, saying: 'The playthings you enjoy, rare and difficult to obtain—if you do not take them now, you will surely regret it later. Various sheep-carts, deer-carts, and ox-carts are now outside the gate, where you can play with them. You should quickly come out of this burning house. Whatever you desire, I shall give to you all.'

"At that time, the sons, hearing their father describe these precious playthings—things that suited their wishes—each became emboldened and brave. Pushing and jostling one another, they raced competitively forth, scrambling to escape the burning house.

"At that time, when the elder saw that his sons had safely escaped and were all seated in the open at the crossroads, no longer obstructed, his mind became tranquil and he was filled with joy and rapture. Each of the sons then addressed their father, saying: 'Father, the playthings you promised us earlier—the sheep-carts, deer-carts, and ox-carts—please give them to us now.'

"Śāriputra, at that time the elder gave to each of his sons an identical great cart. These carts were tall and spacious, adorned and decorated with manifold jewels, surrounded with railings, with bells hanging from all four sides. A canopy was spread over the top, also decorated and adorned with rare and various jewels. Jeweled cords crisscrossed, with hanging garlands of flowers. Inside, layered mats were spread with cushions of red pillows. They were yoked to white oxen, their skin lustrous and pure, their physical form beautiful, possessing great muscular strength, their gait steady and even, as swift as the wind. Moreover, many servants attended and guarded them. Wherefore was this so? This great elder possessed immeasurable wealth; all his various storehouses were completely full to overflowing. And he made this reflection: 'My wealth is limitless. I should not give inferior small carts to my sons. These young children are all my sons, whom I love without partiality. Possessing such great seven-jeweled carts, immeasurable in number, I should with equal mind give one to each, without showing favoritism. Wherefore is this so? Even if I were to distribute these possessions throughout an entire land, there would still be no shortage—how much more so for my sons!' At that time, each of the sons mounted his great cart, experiencing what they had never before experienced, beyond their original expectations.

"Śāriputra, what is your opinion? Did that elder, in giving precious great carts equally to his sons, commit any falsehood or not?"

Śāriputra replied: "No, World-Honored One. That elder merely enabled his sons to escape the fire's calamity, preserving their bodies and lives—this was not falsehood. Why is this so? Precisely by preserving their bodies and lives, they had already obtained wonderful playthings—how much more so through skillful means used to rescue them from that burning house! World-Honored One, even if that elder had not given them so much as the smallest cart, it still would not have been falsehood. Why is this so? That elder had previously formed this intention: 'I shall employ skillful means to cause my sons to escape.' For this reason, there is no falsehood. How much less falsehood is there when the elder, knowing himself to possess immeasurable wealth, wishing to benefit his sons equally, gave them each great carts!"

The Buddha told Śāriputra: "Excellent, excellent! It is just as you have said. Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is also likewise thus—he is the father of all the world. Regarding all fear, decline, distress, anxiety, ignorance, and dark obscuration, he has forever exhausted them without remainder, and has perfected immeasurable insight and vision, powers, fearlessnesses, great spiritual power, and the power of wisdom. He possesses perfect skillful means and the pāramitā of wisdom. His great compassion and great kindness are constant and unwearying; he eternally seeks wholesome matters, benefiting all.

"Thus he is born into the triple world—a decaying and burning house—in order to ferry across living beings from birth, old age, sickness, death, grief, sorrow, suffering, distress, delusion, darkness, and the three poisons of fire. He teaches and transforms them, causing them to attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. He sees all living beings being seared and boiled by birth, old age, sickness, death, grief, sorrow, suffering, and distress. Moreover, due to the five desires and wealth they undergo various kinds of suffering. Further, through greedy attachment and pursuit, they presently undergo manifold sufferings and afterward undergo the sufferings of the hells, animals, and hungry ghosts. Even if born in the heavens or in the human realm, they undergo the sufferings of poverty and destitution, the suffering of separation from the beloved, the suffering of encountering the hateful—such various kinds of suffering as these. Yet living beings, sunken within all this, delight and play joyfully, unaware, unknowing, unalarmed, unafraid. They also do not become weary or seek liberation. In this burning house of the triple world they run about from east to west. Though they encounter great suffering, they do not regard it as affliction.

"Śāriputra, having seen this, the Buddha then made this reflection: 'I am the father of living beings. I should extract them from suffering and distress and give them the joy of the immeasurable, limitless Buddha-wisdom, causing them to find amusement in it.'

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata further made this reflection: 'If I merely use spiritual power and the power of wisdom, casting aside skillful means, and for the sake of living beings praise the Tathāgata's insight and vision, powers, and fearlessnesses, living beings will be unable to be ferried across through this. Wherefore is this so? These living beings have not yet escaped birth, old age, sickness, death, grief, sorrow, suffering, and distress. They are being burned by the burning house of the triple world—how could they comprehend the Buddha's wisdom?'

"Śāriputra, just as that elder, though he had physical strength and power in his body and hands, did not use it but merely through diligent skillful means rescued his sons from the calamity of the burning house, and afterward gave each the precious great carts—the Tathāgata is also likewise thus. Though he possesses power and fearlessness, he does not use it. He merely through the power of wisdom and skillful means extracts and rescues living beings from the burning house of the triple world, expounding for them the Three Vehicles—those of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and Buddhas. And he speaks thus: 'You should not delight in dwelling in the burning house of the triple world. Do not greedily crave crude and inferior forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles. If through greedy attachment you generate love, you will be burned by it. You should quickly exit the triple world and obtain the Three Vehicles of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and Buddhas. I now guarantee this matter for you; it shall never prove false. You should merely be diligently vigorous.'

"Through these skillful means the Tathāgata entices living beings forward. He furthermore says: 'You should know that these Three Vehicle Dharmas are all praised by sages. They are free, unbound, without anything upon which they depend or which they seek. Riding these Three Vehicles, through outflow-free faculties, powers, limbs of enlightenment, factors of the Path, dhyāna concentrations, liberations, samādhis, and such, you yourselves experience amusement and thereby attain immeasurable peace, security, and joy.'

"Śāriputra, if there are living beings who internally possess the nature of wisdom, who, hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, the World-Honored One, believe and receive it, who are diligent and vigorous, wishing to quickly exit the triple world and seeking nirvāṇa for themselves—these are called those of the Śrāvaka Vehicle, like those sons who sought the sheep-carts and exited the burning house.

"If there are living beings who, hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, the World-Honored One, believe and receive it, who are diligent and vigorous, seeking self-arising wisdom, delighting in solitary goodness and tranquility, and deeply understanding the causes and conditions of all dharmas—these are called those of the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle, like those sons who sought the deer-carts and exited the burning house.

"If there are living beings who, hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, the World-Honored One, believe and receive it, who diligently cultivate and vigorously advance, seeking the wisdom of all modes, Buddha-wisdom, self-arising wisdom, teacherless wisdom, the Tathāgata's insight and vision, powers, and fearlessnesses, who pity, bring peace, and benefit immeasurable multitudes of living beings, benefiting devas and humans and ferrying across all—these are called those of the Great Vehicle. Because Bodhisattvas seek this Vehicle, they are called Mahāsattvas, like those sons who sought the ox-carts and exited the burning house.

"Śāriputra, just as that elder, seeing his sons safely escape the burning house and reach a place without fear, reflecting on his immeasurable wealth, gave great carts equally to his sons—the Tathāgata is also likewise thus, being the father of all living beings. If he sees immeasurable billions of thousands of myriads of living beings, through the Buddha's teaching-gateway, escape the suffering, fear, and dangerous paths of the triple world and attain the joy of nirvāṇa, the Tathāgata at that time makes this reflection: 'I possess immeasurable, limitless wisdom, powers, fearlessnesses, and other treasuries of Buddha-Dharmas. All these living beings are my sons. I give equally to all the Great Vehicle, not allowing anyone to individually attain extinction. All shall attain extinction through the Tathāgata's extinction.' Those living beings who escape the triple world are all given the amusements and tools of the Buddhas' dhyāna concentrations and liberations. They are all of one mark, one kind, praised by sages, able to generate pure, wondrous, foremost joy.

"Śāriputra, just as that elder first used the three carts to entice his sons, but afterward gave them only the great cart adorned with jewels, safest and foremost—yet that elder is not guilty of falsehood—the Tathāgata is also likewise thus, without any falsehood. First he expounds the Three Vehicles to guide living beings, but afterward he ferries them across solely through the Great Vehicle. Wherefore is this so? The Tathāgata possesses the treasury of immeasurable wisdom, powers, fearlessnesses, and all dharmas, and is able to give all living beings the Dharma of the Great Vehicle. However, not all are able to receive it.

"Śāriputra, for this cause and condition you should know: through the power of skillful means, within the One Buddha Vehicle, the Buddhas make distinctions and expound three."

The Buddha, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Suppose there is an elder
Who has a great dwelling,
Which, being of long standing,
Moreover is now dilapidated and ruinous.

"The halls and houses are lofty and dangerous,
The pillar bases decayed and rotten,
The beams and ridgepoles tilting askew,
The foundations and steps crumbling and destroyed.

"Walls and partitions are cracked and gaping,
The mud coating has peeled and fallen off,
The thatch covering is scattered and collapsing,
The rafters and crossbeams are loose and dislodged.

"Surroundings winding and crooked,
Filth fills them everywhere.
Five hundred people
Dwell and reside within it.

"Kites, owls, eagles, and vultures,
Crows, magpies, doves, and pigeons,
Vipers, snakes, vipers, and scorpions,
Centipedes and millipedes,

"Geckos and hundred-leggers,
Weasels, raccoons, and mice—
Various evil insect tribes
Run crisscross back and forth.

"Places of excrement and urine stench,
With impure matter flowing and overflowing—
Dung beetles and other insects
Gather and collect upon them.

"Foxes, wolves, and wild dogs
Chew, trample, and gnaw at corpses,
Scattering bones and flesh about.
Due to this, packs of dogs

"Competitively come to snatch and grab,
Starving, emaciated, frightened, and frantic,
Everywhere seeking food,
Fighting and struggling, tearing and pulling,

"Snarling and howling, barking—
Such is the fearful condition
And changing state of that dwelling.

"Everywhere throughout
Are sprites and demons.
Yakṣas and evil ghosts
Devour human flesh.

"Poisonous insect tribes
And various evil birds and beasts
Hatch and bear offspring,
Each hiding and protecting them.

"Yakṣas compete to come
And struggle to seize and devour them.
Having eaten their fill,
Their evil minds become even fiercer.

"The sounds of their fighting and struggling
Are extremely fearful.
Kumbhāṇḍa ghosts
Squat upon mounds of earth,

"Sometimes rising from the ground
One or two feet,
Wandering back and forth,
Indulging in frivolous play,

"Seizing dogs by both feet,
Striking them so they lose their voice,
Placing feet upon their necks,
Terrifying the dogs for their own amusement.

"Again there are various ghosts
Whose bodies are tall and large,
Naked, black, and emaciated,
Constantly dwelling therein,

"Emitting great evil sounds,
Crying and calling out for food.
Again there are ghosts
Whose throats are like needles.

"Again there are ghosts
With heads like ox heads—
Some eat human flesh,
Others also devour dogs.

"Hair disheveled and wild,
Cruel and dangerous in harming,
Oppressed by hunger and thirst,
They cry out and run about.

"Yakṣas, hungry ghosts,
And various evil birds and beasts,
Desperately hungry, facing in all directions,
Peering through windows and openings—

"Such difficulties as these,
And fears immeasurable,
Belong to this decayed old dwelling,
Which is owned by one person.

"That person had recently gone out
Not long before
When, in the rear of that dwelling,
Fire suddenly broke out.

"Simultaneously on all four sides
Its flames burned fiercely together.
Ridgepoles, beams, rafters, and pillars
Exploded with震裂 [震crackling sounds],

"Crumbling, breaking, and falling down,
Walls and partitions collapsing.
All the ghosts and spirits
Raised their voices in great cries.

"Eagles, vultures, and various birds,
Kumbhāṇḍas and such,
In frantic terror and fear,
Were unable to escape by themselves.

"Evil beasts and poisonous insects
Hid and burrowed into holes and crevices.
Piśāca ghosts
Also dwelt therein.

"Due to scant merit and virtue,
Oppressed by the fire,
They mutually harmed one another,
Drinking blood and devouring flesh.

"Wild dog tribes
Had already died before.
Various large evil beasts
Competed to come and devour them.

"Foul smoke and flames
Filled and blocked all four sides.
Centipedes and millipedes,
Poisonous snake tribes,

"Burned by the fire,
Struggled to exit their holes.
Kumbhāṇḍa ghosts
Seized and devoured them.

"Moreover, all the hungry ghosts
Had fire burning atop their heads.
Afflicted by hunger, thirst, heat, and distress,
They frantically ran about in anguish.

"Such is the condition of that dwelling—
Extremely fearful,
With calamities of poison, harm, and fire,
Manifold difficulties, not just one.

"At that time the master of the dwelling
Was standing outside the gate.
He heard someone say:
'Your various sons

"'Earlier, due to play and amusement,
Entered into this dwelling.
Young and lacking knowledge,
They delight and are attached to amusements.'

"The elder, hearing this,
Alarmed, entered the burning house,
Appropriately planning rescue,
To prevent them from being burned or harmed.

"He admonished and instructed his sons,
Explaining the manifold troubles and difficulties:
'Evil ghosts and poisonous insects,
The calamity of fire spreading everywhere,

"'Manifold sufferings continuously,
One after another without cease.
Poisonous snakes and vipers,
Together with all the yakṣas,

"'Kumbhāṇḍa ghosts,
Wild dogs, foxes, and jackals,
Eagles, vultures, and kites,
And hundred-legged tribes,

"'Afflicted by hunger and thirst,
Extremely fearful—
This is a place of suffering and difficulty,
How much worse with the great fire!'

"The sons, lacking knowledge,
Though hearing their father's instruction,
Still remained attached and delighted,
Playing without cease.

"At that time the elder
Made this reflection:
'The sons are like this,
Increasing my grief and distress.

"'Now in this dwelling
There is nothing delightful,
Yet these sons,
Engrossed in frivolous play,

"'Do not receive my teaching
And will be harmed by the fire.'
He immediately reflected,
Establishing various skillful means,

"And told all his sons:
'I have various
Precious playthings—
Wonderful jeweled fine carts,

"'Sheep-carts and deer-carts,
And great ox-carts,
Now outside the gate.
Come out, you!

"'For your sake
I have created these carts.
According to your desires,
You can play with them.'

"Hearing these carts described,
The sons immediately raced competitively,
Running forth and emerging,
Reaching the open ground,

"Separating from all suffering and difficulties.
The elder, seeing his sons
Escape the burning house,
Dwelling at the crossroads,

"Seated on lion thrones,
Made this joyful declaration:
'I am now happy and at ease!
These sons

"'Were extremely difficult to give birth to and raise.
Foolish, small, and lacking knowledge,
They entered a dangerous dwelling
With many poisonous insects

"'And frightful sprites and demons.
The great fire with fierce flames
Arose simultaneously from all four sides,
Yet these sons,

"'Greedy and attached to play,
I have now rescued them,
Causing them to escape difficulty.
Therefore, all people,

"'I am now happy and at ease.'
At that time the sons,
Knowing their father was seated securely,
All approached their father's place

"And addressed their father, saying:
'Please grant us
The three kinds of jeweled carts
As you previously promised:

"'When the sons emerge,
You shall give three carts
According to our desires.'
Now is precisely the time—

"'We only pray you will bestow them!'
The elder, greatly wealthy,
With many treasuries and storehouses—
Gold, silver, lapis lazuli,

"Giant clam shell, and agate—
With manifold jeweled materials
He fashioned various great carts,
Decorated and adorned,

"Surrounded with railings,
With bells hanging from four sides,
And golden cords crisscrossing.
Pearl netting

"Spread and extended above,
With golden flower garlands
Hanging down everywhere.
Multicolored decorations

"Surrounded them all about.
Soft silk and cotton
Served as cushions and mats.
Superior, wondrous fine cloth

"Worth thousands of billions,
Pure white and immaculately clean,
Covered them above.
There were great white oxen,

"Fat, strong, and powerful,
Beautiful in physical form,
Yoked to the jeweled carts,
With many attendants

"Serving and guarding them.
With these wonderful carts
He gave equally to his sons.
The sons at that time

"Experienced joy and rapture,
Mounting these jeweled carts,
Roaming in the four directions,
Playing joyfully,

"At ease without obstruction.
I tell Śāriputra:
I too am likewise thus—
Among sages most honored,

"Father of the world.
All living beings
Are all my sons,
Deeply attached to worldly pleasures,

"Without minds of wisdom.
The triple world has no peace—
It is like a burning house,
Filled with manifold sufferings,

"Extremely fearful,
Constantly having birth, old age,
Sickness, death, and anxieties—
Fires such as these

"Blaze fiercely without cease.
The Tathāgata has already separated
From the burning house of the triple world,
Dwelling serenely and leisurely at ease,

"Peacefully residing in forests and wilds.
Now this triple world
Is all my possession.
The living beings within it

"Are all my sons.
Yet now this place
Has many troubles and difficulties.
Only I alone

"Am able to provide rescue and protection.
Though I furthermore teach and instruct,
They do not believe or receive it,
Due to being deeply attached

"To desires through greed.
Through these skillful means
I expound the Three Vehicles,
Causing all living beings

"To know the triple world's sufferings,
Demonstrating and expounding
The transcendent worldly path.
If these sons

"Have minds that are resolute and determined,
Perfecting the three clarities
And the six spiritual powers,
Some attaining pratyekabuddhahood,

"And irreversible Bodhisattvas—
Śāriputra,
For the sake of living beings,
Through this parable

"I expound the One Buddha Vehicle.
If you are able
To believe and receive these words,
You shall all

"Attain accomplishment of the Buddha-Way.
This Vehicle is wondrous,
Pure and foremost.
Throughout all worlds

"There is none superior to it—
That which the Buddha delights in.
All living beings
Should praise it,

"Make offerings to it, and bow to it.
Immeasurable billions of thousands
Of powers and liberations,
Dhyāna concentrations and wisdom,

"Together with the Buddha's other dharmas—
Having attained such a Vehicle,
It causes all the sons
Throughout days, nights, and kalpa-periods

"Constantly to find amusement and play,
Together with Bodhisattvas
And the multitude of śrāvakas,
Mounting this jeweled Vehicle,

"Going directly to the place of enlightenment.
For this cause and condition,
Seeking throughout the ten directions,
There is no other Vehicle,

"Except the Buddha's skillful means.
I tell Śāriputra
That you and all others
Are all my sons,

"And I am your father.
Throughout accumulated kalpas
You have been burned by manifold sufferings,
And I have rescued and extracted you all,

"Causing you to exit the triple world.
Though I previously said
You had all attained extinction,
You have merely exhausted birth and death

"But have not truly become extinct.
What you should now accomplish
Is solely Buddha-wisdom.
If there are Bodhisattvas

"Within this assembly
Who can single-mindedly listen to
The true Dharma of all Buddhas—
Though the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones,

"Through skillful means
Transform living beings,
All those transformed are Bodhisattvas.

"If people have small wisdom,
Deeply attached to craving and desire—
For ones such as these
I expound the Truth of Suffering.

"Living beings' minds rejoice,
Experiencing what they never before had:
'The Buddha's exposition of the Truth of Suffering
Is true and without difference!'

"If there are living beings
Who do not know suffering's root,
Who are deeply attached to suffering's cause
And cannot temporarily relinquish it—

"For ones such as these,
I expound the Path through skillful means.
The cause of all sufferings
Is greed and desire as the root.

"If one extinguishes greed and desire,
It has nothing upon which to depend.
Extinguishing and exhausting all sufferings
Is called the Third Truth.

"For the sake of the Truth of Extinction,
One cultivates and practices the Path.
Separating from all bonds of suffering
Is called attaining liberation.

"Regarding what matter
Do these people attain liberation?
They merely separate from falsity and emptiness—
This is called liberation.

"In reality they have not yet attained
Complete liberation.
The Buddha says these people
Have not truly attained extinction,

"Because these people have not yet attained
The supreme Way.
My intention does not wish
To cause them to reach extinction.

"I am the Dharma King,
Sovereign over all dharmas.
To bring peace to living beings,
I therefore appear in the world.

"Śāriputra,
This Dharma-seal of mine,
Wishing to benefit
The world, I expound it.

"Wherever you roam,
Do not transmit it carelessly.
If there are those who hear it
And rejoice, receiving it reverently,

"You should know such people
Are irreversible [from enlightenment].
If there are those who believe and receive
This sutra-Dharma,

"Such people have already
Seen Buddhas of the past,
Reverently making offerings
And also hearing this Dharma.

"If people are able
To believe what you expound,
They thereby see me
And also see you

"Together with the bhikṣu Saṅgha
And all the Bodhisattvas.
This Dharma Flower Sutra
Is expounded for those of deep wisdom.

"Those of shallow knowledge hearing it
Become confused and fail to comprehend.
All śrāvakas
And pratyekabuddhas

"Regarding this sutra
Find it beyond their power's reach.
Even you, Śāriputra,
Regarding this sutra

"Gained entry through faith—
How much more so other śrāvakas!
The other śrāvakas,
Due to believing the Buddha's words,

"Comply with this sutra,
Not through their own wisdom's portion.
Furthermore, Śāriputra,
To the arrogant and lazy,

"Those who calculate [views of] self—
Do not expound this sutra.
Common people of shallow knowledge,
Deeply attached to the five desires,

"Hearing it, cannot comprehend—
Also do not expound it to them.
If people do not believe
And slander this sutra,

"They thereby sever all
The Buddha-seeds of the world.
Or they may frown with furrowed brows
And harbor doubts and perplexities—

"You should now listen
To the karmic retribution of such people:
Whether the Buddha is in the world
Or after his extinction,

"If there are those who slander
Sutras such as this,
Who see those reading, reciting,
Or upholding and copying the sutra,

"Who despise, hate, envy them,
And harbor resentful thoughts—
Listen now to the karmic retribution
Of such people:

"When their lives end,
They enter Avīci hell,
Fully remaining for one kalpa.
When the kalpa ends they are reborn,

"Turning and revolving thus
Through innumerable kalpas.
Emerging from the hells,
They shall fall into the animal realm—

"As dogs or wild jackals,
Their forms gaunt and emaciated,
Dark, mottled with mange and scabies,
Objects for people to torment.

"Moreover, they shall be
Loathed and despised by people,
Constantly afflicted by hunger and thirst,
Their bones and flesh withered and desiccated.

"In life receiving cruel torment,
In death struck by tiles and stones—
Due to severing the Buddha-seed,
They receive such karmic retribution.

"If they become camels
Or are born among donkeys,
Their bodies constantly bearing heavy loads,
With sticks and whips added,

"They think only of water and grass,
Knowing nothing else.
Due to slandering this sutra,
They obtain retribution such as this.

"Some become wild jackals
Entering villages and settlements,
Their bodies afflicted with mange and scabies,
Moreover lacking one eye,

"Struck and pelted
By various children,
Receiving all manner of suffering and pain,
Sometimes even unto death.

"Having died in this [state],
They again receive python bodies,
Their forms long and large,
Five hundred yojanas,

"Deaf, stupid, and without feet,
Writhing and crawling on their bellies.
By various small insects
They are bitten and devoured,

"Day and night undergoing suffering
Without any respite.
Due to slandering this sutra,
They obtain retribution such as this.

"If they attain human form,
All their faculties are dull and dark—
Dwarfed, hunched, lame, and paralyzed,
Blind, deaf, and hunchbacked.

"Whatever they say,
People do not believe or receive.
Their breath is constantly foul;
They are possessed by ghosts and demons.

"Poor and lowly,
Employed by others,
Afflicted with many illnesses, emaciated,
Without anyone to rely upon.

"Though they attach themselves to people,
People pay them no mind.
If they obtain anything,
They soon again forget and lose it.

"If they practice the medical way,
Following prescriptions to treat illness,
They further increase others' diseases
Or also cause death.

"If they themselves have illness,
No one rescues or treats them.
Though they take good medicine,
It further increases their suffering.

"If others rebel,
Plundering and robbing through theft—
Transgressions such as these
Befall them as calamities.

"Such sinful people
Forever never see the Buddha,
The King of Multitudes of Sages,
Expounding Dharma and teaching transformation.

"Such sinful people
Are constantly born in difficult places—
Mad, deaf, with minds confused,
Forever never hearing the Dharma.

"Throughout innumerable kalpas
Numerous as Ganges' sands,
Whenever born, deaf and mute,
Their faculties incomplete,

"They constantly dwell in the hells
As if roaming in parks and gardens.
In other evil paths
As if in their own dwelling places.

"Camels, donkeys, pigs, and dogs—
These are their places of movement.
Due to slandering this sutra,
They obtain retribution such as this.

"If they attain human form,
Deaf, blind, mute, and dumb,
Poverty and all manner of decline
Serve as their adornments.

"Dropsy, emaciation,
Scabies, ulcers, and boils—
Such diseases as these
Serve as their clothing.

"Their bodies constantly stink and are foul,
Filthy and impure.
Deeply attached to the view of self,
They increase in anger and rage.

"Sexual desire burns fiercely—
They do not distinguish birds from beasts.
Due to slandering this sutra,
They obtain retribution such as this.

"I tell Śāriputra:
Those who slander this sutra—
If I were to speak of their transgressions,
I could not exhaust them throughout a kalpa.

"For this cause and condition,
I therefore tell you:
Among people without wisdom,
Do not expound this sutra.

"If there are those of keen faculties,
Whose wisdom is clear and luminous,
Much learning and strong retention,
Seeking the Buddha-Way—

"For people such as these,
One may expound it.
If people have seen
Billions of hundreds of thousands of Buddhas,

"Having planted all manner of wholesome roots,
With profound minds firm and solid—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"If people are vigorously advancing,
Constantly cultivating compassionate minds,
Not begrudging body or life—
For such one may expound it.

"If people are reverent,
Without any divergent minds,
Separated from all common fools,
Dwelling alone in mountains and marshlands—

"For people such as these,
One may expound it.
Furthermore, Śāriputra,
If you see someone

"Who has renounced evil acquaintances
And drawn near to good friends—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"If you see Buddha-sons
Upholding precepts purely,
Like pure, bright jewels,
Seeking Great Vehicle sutras—

"For people such as these,
One may expound it.
If people are without anger,
Straightforward, gentle, and pliant,

"Constantly pitying all,
Revering all Buddhas—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"Again, there are Buddha-sons
Who, within great assemblies,
With pure minds,
Through various causes and conditions,

"Parables and expressions,
Expound Dharma without obstruction—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"If there are bhikṣus
Who, for the sake of the wisdom of all modes,
Seek the Dharma in the four directions,
Joining palms and reverently receiving it,

"Who merely delight in receiving and upholding
Great Vehicle sutras,
Not even receiving
A single verse of other sutras—

"For people such as these,
One may expound it.
Like one who single-mindedly
Seeks the Buddha's śarīra,

"Seeking sutras in such manner,
Having obtained them, reverently receiving them on the crown of the head—
Such a person no longer
Aspires to seek other sutras,

"Nor has ever thought of
Non-Buddhist scriptures—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"I tell Śāriputra:
If I were to speak of the characteristics
Of those seeking the Buddha-Way,
I could not exhaust them throughout a kalpa.

"People such as these
Are then able to believe and comprehend.
You should expound for them
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma."

CHAPTER FOUR: FAITH AND UNDERSTANDING

At that time the Venerable Subhūti, Mahākātyāyana, Mahākāśyapa, and Mahāmaudgalyāyana, hearing from the Buddha this Dharma never before heard, and hearing that the World-Honored One conferred upon Śāriputra the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, gave rise to a rare aspiration. Joyful and rapturous, they immediately rose from their seats, adjusted their robes, bared their right shoulders, placed their right knees upon the ground, single-mindedly joined their palms, bent their bodies in reverence, gazed up at the Honored Countenance, and addressed the Buddha, saying:

"We dwell at the head of the Saṅgha, and our years are all declining and aged. Considering ourselves to have already attained nirvāṇa, we felt ourselves incompetent and did not further advance to seek anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. World-Honored One, you have long expounded the Dharma. At that time we sat in the assembly, our bodies growing weary and lax, merely contemplating emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. Regarding the Dharma of the Bodhisattvas—the spiritual penetrations through which they play, the purification of Buddha-lands, and the perfection of living beings—our minds took no delight or joy in these. Wherefore is this so? The World-Honored One caused us to emerge from the triple world and attain the realization of nirvāṇa. Moreover, we are now aged and declining. Regarding the Buddha's teaching and transformation of Bodhisattvas toward anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, we did not generate even a single thought of delight or aspiration.

"We now before the Buddha, hearing the conferral of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi upon śrāvakas, experience extreme joy in our hearts and have attained what we never before attained. We did not expect that now, suddenly, we would hear this rare Dharma. We deeply congratulate ourselves on having obtained this great wholesome benefit—immeasurable jewels arriving unsought."

"World-Honored One, we now delight in speaking a parable to clarify this meaning. Suppose there was a person who, while still young in years, abandoned his father, ran away, and for a long time dwelt in another land—perhaps ten, twenty, or as many as fifty years. As his years increased and he grew older, he moreover became impoverished and destitute, running about in the four directions seeking clothing and food. Gradually wandering and traveling, he happened to move toward his original land.

"His father had previously searched for his son but failed to find him, and had settled in a certain city. His household was greatly wealthy, with treasuries and wealth immeasurable—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, coral, amber, crystal, pearls, and such. His various storehouses were all overflowing and full. He had many servants, ministers, assistants, and subjects, as well as elephants, horses, carriages, oxen, and sheep—immeasurable in number. His investments and profits extended throughout other lands, and merchants and traders were also extremely numerous.

"At that time the impoverished son wandered through various villages, passing through states and cities, until he finally arrived at the city where his father had settled. The father's thoughts of his son—they had been separated for over fifty years—yet he had never spoken of this matter to anyone. He merely contemplated it himself, his mind harboring regret and resentment. He reflected to himself: 'I am old and declining. I possess much wealth—gold, silver, and precious jewels. My storehouses are overflowing and full. Yet I have no son or heir. Should I suddenly die one day, my wealth and possessions will scatter and be lost, with no one to entrust them to.' For this reason he earnestly and constantly thought of his son. He furthermore made this reflection: 'If I could obtain my son and entrust my wealth to him, I would be content, happy, and joyful, with no further cares or anxieties.'

"World-Honored One, at that time the impoverished son, hiring himself out and wandering from place to place, happened to arrive at his father's house. He stopped and stood by the gate. From afar he saw his father seated upon a lion throne, his footstool adorned with jewels, with brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, and householders all reverently surrounding him. His body was adorned with pearl necklaces worth thousands of myriads. Officials, servants, and attendants, holding white whisks, stood in attendance to his left and right. A jeweled canopy was spread above him, with hanging flowered banners. Fragrant water sprinkled the ground, and scattered renowned flowers. Precious objects were arranged in rows, being brought in and taken out. Such various adornments as these displayed his威德 [awesome virtue] as especially honored.

"The impoverished son, seeing his father possessed of such great power and influence, immediately became fearful and afraid, regretting having come to this place. Secretly he made this thought: 'This person may be a king or equal to a king. This is not a place where I, hiring out my labor, can obtain anything. It would be better to go to an impoverished neighborhood where, exerting my strength, there will be a place [for me], and clothing and food will be easily obtained. If I remain here long, I may be oppressed and forced to work.' Having made this thought, he quickly ran away.

"At that time the wealthy elder, seated upon his lion throne, saw his son and immediately recognized him. His heart experienced great joy. He immediately made this reflection: 'My wealth, treasuries, and storehouses now have someone to whom they can be entrusted! I have constantly thought of this son, with no way to see him, yet suddenly he has come of his own accord—this greatly suits my wishes. Although I am old and declining, I still have greedy attachment [to my possessions].' He immediately dispatched someone nearby to quickly pursue and bring him back.

"At that time the messenger rushed forth and seized him. The impoverished son, alarmed and astonished, cried out in grievance and wailed loudly: 'I have committed no offense against you—why am I being seized?' The messenger held him even more urgently, forcibly dragging him back. At that time the impoverished son thought to himself: 'Though guiltless, I am being imprisoned and seized. I shall certainly die.' He became even more terrified and frightened, fainting and collapsing upon the ground.

"The father, seeing this from afar, spoke to the messenger, saying: 'I have no need of this person. Do not forcibly bring him. Sprinkle cold water on his face to cause him to regain consciousness, but do not speak to him further.' Wherefore was this so? The father knew that his son's aspiration and intention were inferior and lowly. He knew himself to be noble and wealthy, [a status] difficult for his son [to accept]. He was certain this was his son, yet through skillful means he did not tell others, 'This is my son.'

"The messenger spoke to him: 'I now release you. Go wherever you wish.' The impoverished son, joyful and having experienced what he had never before experienced, rose from the ground and went to the impoverished neighborhood to seek clothing and food.

"At that time the elder, wishing to entice his son, established a skillful means. He secretly dispatched two people—haggard and wan in appearance and color, without威德 [dignity or virtue]—[saying]: 'You may go to that place and gently speak to the impoverished son: \"There is work to be done here, and we will pay you double wages.\" If the impoverished son agrees, bring him and put him to work. If he asks what work is to be done, then you may tell him, \"We are hiring you to clear away excrement. We two shall also work together with you.\"'

"At that time the two messengers immediately sought out the impoverished son. Having already found him, they fully related the above matter. At that time the impoverished son first received his wages, then proceeded to clear away excrement.

"His father, seeing his son, pitied yet marveled at him. On another day, through a window, he saw from afar his son's body—emaciated, haggard, and wan, soiled with excrement, dirt, and dust, filthy and impure. He immediately removed his pearl necklaces, fine soft upper garments, and ornamental adornments, and instead put on coarse, shabby, and greasy soiled clothing, his body covered with dust. In his right hand he grasped an implement for clearing excrement, appearing to be fearful. He spoke to the workers: 'You should all work diligently! Do not become lax or idle.' Through this skillful means, he was able to draw near to his son.

"Later he furthermore told him: 'Hey there, fellow! You should constantly work here. Do not go elsewhere again. I shall increase your wages. Whatever you need—bowls, utensils, rice, flour, salt, vinegar, and such—do not hesitate to ask. There are also old and worn-out servants available if needed. Set your mind at ease. I am like your father—you need no longer worry or be anxious. Wherefore is this so? I am old and aged, while you are young and strong. Whenever you work, you are never deceitful, idle, angry, resentful, or complaining. I have never seen you possess such evils as these, unlike other workers. From this day forward, you shall be like my own son.'

"Immediately the elder gave him a new name, calling him his son. At that time the impoverished son, though pleased by this encounter, still considered himself a hired menial worker. For this reason, for twenty years he was constantly made to clear away excrement. After this had passed, their minds mutually trusted one another. He could enter and exit freely without difficulty, yet the place where he stayed was still his original quarters.

"World-Honored One, at that time the elder became ill. Knowing he would soon die, he spoke to the impoverished son, saying: 'I now possess much gold, silver, and precious jewels. My storehouses are overflowing and full. Regarding how much is in them and what should be taken out or brought in, you know all of this completely. My mind is thus—you should understand this intention. Wherefore is this so? Now I and you are not different. You should be even more careful not to allow any loss or waste.'

"At that time the impoverished son immediately received this instruction and command, knowing about all the possessions—gold, silver, precious jewels, and all the storehouses—yet he had not the slightest thought of hoping to acquire even a single meal from them. However, where he stayed was still his original place, and his inferior and lowly mind he also had not yet been able to renounce.

"After a short time had again passed, the father, knowing his son's mind had gradually become open and pervasive, accomplishing great aspirations and feeling disdain for his former mind, approached the time of his end and summoned his son, assembling together relatives, clan members, the king, great ministers, kṣatriyas, and householders, all of whom had already gathered. He then made this proclamation: 'Gentlemen, you should know: this is my son, born of me. In such-and-such a city he abandoned me and ran away, enduring hardship and suffering for over fifty years. His original name was such-and-such, and my name is such-and-such. Long ago in my original city, harboring worry, I searched for him. Suddenly in this place we encountered one another and were reunited. This truly is my son, and I truly am his father. Now all the wealth I possess entirely belongs to my son. What was previously brought out or taken in—all of it was known by my son.'

"World-Honored One, when the impoverished son heard his father speak these words, he experienced great joy, having attained what he had never before attained, and made this reflection: 'Originally I had no mind and harbored no hopes or seeking, yet now this treasury has come of itself.'"

"World-Honored One, the greatly wealthy elder is the Tathāgata. We are all like Buddha-sons. The Tathāgata constantly says we are his sons. World-Honored One, due to the three kinds of suffering, within birth and death we have undergone all manner of heat and torment, being deluded, ignorant, and delighting in attachment to lesser dharmas. Today the World-Honored One causes us to contemplate and eliminate the excrement of the frivolous discussions of all dharmas. Within this we diligently applied vigor and attained nirvāṇa as our day's wages. Having attained this, our minds experienced great joy, considering ourselves satisfied, and we then declared to ourselves: 'Due to our diligent vigor within the Buddha-Dharma, what we have obtained is vast and abundant.'

"Yet the World-Honored One, knowing previously that our minds were attached to shabby desires and delighted in lesser dharmas, then allowed us to go our own way and did not make distinctions for us: 'You should all have a share in the Tathāgata's treasury of insight and vision.' The World-Honored One, through the power of skillful means, has expounded the Tathāgata's wisdom. We, receiving from the Buddha nirvāṇa as our day's wages, considered this a great attainment. Regarding this Great Vehicle, we had no aspiration to seek it.

"We furthermore, because of the Tathāgata's wisdom, demonstrated and expounded it for the Bodhisattvas, yet regarding this ourselves had no aspiration or wish. Wherefore is this so? The Buddha, knowing that our minds delighted in lesser dharmas, through the power of skillful means expounded in accordance with us, and we did not know we were truly Buddha-sons.

"Now we finally know that the World-Honored One regarding Buddha-wisdom is without any stinginess whatsoever. Wherefore is this so? From ancient times until now, we truly have been Buddha-sons, yet we merely delighted in lesser dharmas. Had we possessed minds delighting in the great, the Buddha would have expounded the Great Vehicle Dharma for us.

"Within this sutra, only the One Vehicle is expounded. Yet in the past, before the Bodhisattvas, [the Buddha] disparaged śrāvakas who delight in lesser dharmas. However, in reality the Buddha taught and transformed through the Great Vehicle. Therefore we say: Originally we had no minds harboring hopes or seeking anything. Now the Dharma King's great treasure has arrived of itself. What Buddha-sons should obtain, we have all already obtained."

At that time Mahākāśyapa, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"We today
Hearing the Buddha's sound and teaching,
Experience joy and rapture,
Having attained what we never before had.

"The Buddha says śrāvakas
Shall attain Buddhahood.
The supreme jeweled assembly—
Arrived unsought.

"It is like a young child,
Young and without understanding,
Who abandoned his father and ran away,
Traveling afar to another land,

"Wandering through various states
For over fifty years.
His father, anxious and concerned,
Searched in the four directions.

"Having searched until exhausted,
He settled in a city,
Building a house and dwelling,
Amusing himself with the five desires.

"His household was巨富 [immensely wealthy],
With much gold and silver,
Giant clam shell and agate,
Pearls and lapis lazuli,

"Elephants, horses, oxen, and sheep,
Sedan chairs and carriages,
Farmland estates and servants—
His populace numerous.

"His investments and profits
Extended throughout other lands.
Merchants and traders—
There was no place they were not present.

"Thousands of myriads of billions of multitudes
Surrounded him with reverence.
He was constantly beloved
And cherished by kings.

"Ministers and noble clans
All together honored him.
Due to various causes and conditions,
Those coming and going were numerous.

"Wealthy and powerful as this,
He possessed great influence and power.
Yet as his years declined and he aged,
He increasingly thought anxiously of his son.

"Morning and night he solely contemplated:
'The time of death is approaching.
My foolish son abandoned me
For over fifty years.

"'My storehouses and various possessions—
What shall become of them?'
At that time the impoverished son,
Seeking clothing and food,

"Went from town to town,
From state to state.
Sometimes he obtained something,
Sometimes he obtained nothing.

"Starving, emaciated,
His body afflicted with sores and scabs,
He gradually passed through and traveled,
Arriving at the city where his father dwelt.

"Hiring himself out and wandering,
He finally reached his father's house.
At that time the elder,
Within his gate,

"Spread a great jeweled canopy,
Seated upon a lion throne,
Surrounded by his retinue,
With people attending and guarding him.

"Some were calculating
Gold, silver, and precious objects,
Taking out and bringing in wealth and assets,
Recording and registering documents and tallies.

"The impoverished son, seeing his father
So豪貴 [noble] and honored in his dignity,
Thought he was a king
Or equal to a king.

"Alarmed, afraid, and astonished at himself:
'Why have I come to this place?'
He furthermore thought to himself:
'If I remain here long,

"'I may be oppressed and forced
To be driven and made to work.'
Having contemplated this,
He rushed away and fled,

"Inquiring about an impoverished neighborhood,
Wishing to go there to hire out his labor.
The elder at that time,
Seated upon his lion throne,

"Saw his son from afar
And silently recognized him.
He immediately commanded a messenger
To pursue, seize, and bring him.

"The impoverished son cried out in alarm,
Fainting and collapsing upon the ground:
'This person has seized me—
I shall certainly be killed!

"'Why did the need for clothing and food
Cause me to come to this place?'
The elder, knowing his son
Was foolish, narrow, and inferior,

"Would not believe his words,
Would not believe he was his father.
He immediately employed skillful means
And sent other people—

"Squint-eyed, dwarfed, and ugly,
Without威德 [dignity or virtue]:
'You may speak to him,
Saying we shall hire him,

"'To clear away excrement and filth,
Paying him double wages.'
The impoverished son, hearing this,
Joyfully came along,

"To clear away excrement and filth,
Cleaning all the rooms and chambers.
The elder, through a window,
Constantly saw his son,

"Remembering his son was foolish and inferior,
Delighting in menial tasks.
Then the elder
Put on shabby, soiled clothing,

"Grasping the implement for clearing excrement,
He went to where his son was.
Through skillful means drawing near,
He instructed him to work diligently:

"'I shall furthermore increase your wages
And also provide foot oil.
Food shall be sufficient,
Your mats and bedding thick and warm.'

"With harsh words such as these:
'You should work diligently!'
And also with gentle words:
'You are like my son.'

"The elder, possessing wisdom,
Gradually caused him to enter and exit.
After twenty years,
He managed household affairs,

"Showing him gold and silver,
Pearls and crystal,
And how various objects entered and exited—
All caused him to know this.

"Yet he still dwelt outside the gate,
Lodging in a grass hut,
Thinking of his poverty:
'I do not possess these things.'

"The father, knowing his son's mind
Had gradually become vast and expansive,
Wishing to give him his wealth,
Assembled relatives and clan,

"The king, great ministers,
Kṣatriyas, and householders.
Before this great assembly
He said: 'This is my son,

"'Who abandoned me and went elsewhere
For fifty years.
Since seeing my son return,
Twenty years have already passed.

"'Long ago, in such-and-such a city,
I lost this son.
Wandering about searching for him,
I finally came to this place.

"'All that I possess—
Dwelling and populace—
I completely entrust to him,
For him to use as he wishes.'

"The son, recalling his former poverty,
His inferior and lowly aspiration,
Now, at his father's place,
Has greatly obtained precious jewels,

"Together with dwelling and house,
And all wealth and possessions.
He experiences extreme great joy,
Having attained what he never before had.

"The Buddha too is likewise thus,
Knowing I delight in the lesser.
He never once said:
'You shall all become Buddhas.'

"Instead he said we
Attained the outflow-free [state],
Accomplishing the Lesser Vehicle
As śrāvaka disciples.

"The Buddha commanded us
To expound the supreme Way.
Those who cultivate this
Shall attain Buddhahood.

"Receiving the Buddha's teaching,
For the sake of great Bodhisattvas,
Through various causes and conditions,
And various kinds of parables,

"With manifold expressions,
I expounded the supreme Way.
All the Buddha-sons,
Hearing the Dharma from me,

"Day and night contemplated,
Diligently cultivating and practicing.
At that time all the Buddhas
Immediately conferred predictions upon them:

"'In a future age
You shall attain Buddhahood.'
The secret treasury Dharma
Of all the Buddhas—

"Solely for the sake of Bodhisattvas
Do they演其實事 [demonstrate its true reality],
But not for us
Do they expound this true essential.

"Like that impoverished son
Who drew near to his father,
Though knowing all the possessions,
His mind did not hope to acquire them.

"Though we expound
The Buddha-Dharma treasure,
We ourselves have no aspiration or wish—
We too are likewise thus.

"We considered our inner extinction
Sufficient in itself,
Understanding only this matter—
No other matter beyond it.

"If we heard of purifying Buddha-lands
And teaching and transforming living beings,
We had no delight or joy whatsoever.
Wherefore was this so?

"All the dharmas
Are all empty and tranquil,
Without arising, without ceasing,
Without great, without small,

"Without outflows, without conditioned action.
Contemplating thus,
We did not generate delight or joy.

"We throughout the long night
Regarding Buddha-wisdom
Had no greed, no attachment,
No further aspiration or wish.

"While ourselves regarding the Dharma,
We thought it was ultimate.
We throughout the long night
Cultivated and practiced the Dharma of emptiness,

"Attaining liberation from the triple world's
Suffering and distress,
Dwelling in the final body
With nirvāṇa still remaining.

"The Buddha's teaching and transformation
Obtained the Way without falsity.
We considered this as already having attained
Repayment of the Buddha's kindness.

"Though we, for the sake of
All the Buddha-sons,
Expounded the Bodhisattva Dharma
To seek the Buddha-Way,

"Regarding this Dharma
We永無願樂 [forever had no aspiration or delight].
The guiding teacher allowed us to go,
Observing our minds,

"And initially did not encourage us to advance,
Expounding that there were true benefits.
Like the wealthy elder
Who knew his son's aspirations were inferior,

"Through the power of skillful means
He gently subdued his mind,
And only afterward entrusted to him
All his wealth and possessions.

"The Buddha too is likewise thus,
Manifesting rare occurrences.
Knowing those who delight in the lesser,
Through the power of skillful means

"He tames and subdues their minds,
Then teaches the great wisdom.
We today
Have attained what we never before had—

"Not what we previously hoped for,
Yet now we have obtained it ourselves,
Like that impoverished son
Who obtained immeasurable treasure.

"World-Honored One, I now
Have obtained the Way and obtained the fruit.
Regarding the outflow-free Dharma,
I have obtained pure eyes.

"We throughout the long night
Have upheld the Buddha's pure precepts.
Only today
Have we obtained their fruition and reward.

"Within the Dharma King's Dharma,
Having long cultivated the holy life,
Now we have attained the outflow-free,
Supreme great fruit.

"We now
Truly are śrāvakas,
With the sound of the Buddha-Way
Causing all to hear.

"We now
Truly are Arhats.
Among all the world—
Devas, humans, Māras, and Brahmas—

"Universally among them all
We should receive offerings.
The World-Honored One's great kindness,
Through rare occurrences,

"Showing pity, teaching, and transforming,
Benefiting us—
Throughout immeasurable billions of kalpas,
Who could repay this?

"Offering with hands and feet,
Bowing heads in reverence,
All manner of offerings—
None could repay it.

"Even if bearing [him] on the crown of the head,
Carrying [him] on both shoulders,
Throughout kalpas numerous as Ganges' sands,
Exhausting the mind in reverence,

"Moreover, with fine delicacies,
Immeasurable jeweled garments,
And all manner of bedding,
Various medicinal remedies,

"Ox-head sandalwood
And various precious jewels,
With which to erect stūpas and shrines,
Spreading jeweled garments upon the ground—

"Such matters as these,
Employed to make offerings
Throughout kalpas numerous as Ganges' sands,
Still could not repay it.

"The Buddhas are rare,
Immeasurable, limitless,
Inconceivable,
With great spiritual powers,

"Outflow-free, unconditioned—
Kings of all dharmas.
Able, for the sake of the inferior,
To endure such matters,

"Taking common people attached to marks
And expounding in accordance with what is suitable.
The Buddhas, regarding all dharmas,
Attain utmost sovereignty.

"Knowing all living beings'
Various delights and joys,
Together with their powers of aspiration,
According to what they can bear,

"Through immeasurable parables
They expound the Dharma for them,
According to all living beings'
Past wholesome roots,

"Moreover knowing those mature
And those not yet mature.
Through various kinds of deliberation,
Having made distinctions and knowing this,

"Regarding the path of One Vehicle,
In accordance with what is suitable, they expound three."


CHAPTER FIVE: THE PARABLE OF MEDICINAL HERBS

At that time the World-Honored One addressed Mahākāśyapa and all the great disciples, saying: "Excellent, excellent! Kāśyapa has well spoken of the true and actual merits of the Tathāgata. It is truly as you have said. The Tathāgata indeed possesses immeasurable, limitless, asaṃkhyeya merits. Even if you were to speak of them throughout immeasurable koṭis of kalpas, you could never exhaust them. Kāśyapa, you should know that the Tathāgata is the king of all dharmas. Whatever he expounds is never false. Regarding all dharmas, he expounds them through wisdom and skillful means. Whatever dharmas he expounds all arrive at the ground of omniscient wisdom. The Tathāgata observes and knows all dharmas and where they return and tend. He also knows the deep mental activities of all living beings, penetrating them without obstruction. Moreover, regarding all dharmas he has investigated them thoroughly and comprehended them clearly, manifesting to all living beings the wisdom of omniscience."

"Kāśyapa, it is like the mountains, streams, valleys, and lands of the great trichiliocosm, where the various plants, bushes, forests, and medicinal herbs that are produced are of many kinds, each with different names and colors. Dense clouds spread and extend, everywhere covering the great trichiliocosm, raining down equally and universally. Their moisture permeates everywhere. The plants, bushes, forests, and medicinal herbs—those with small roots, small stems, small branches, and small leaves; those with medium roots, medium stems, medium branches, and medium leaves; those with large roots, large stems, large branches, and large leaves; and all trees, large and small—according to their superior, medium, and inferior nature, each receives its portion. The rain from one cloud, according to the nature of each seed, causes growth, and flowers and fruits open and ripen. Though all are produced from one earth and moistened by one rain, yet all the various plants and trees differ from one another."

"Kāśyapa, you should know the Tathāgata is also like this. He appears in the world like the arising of a great cloud. With his great voice he universally pervades the world of devas, humans, and asuras, just as that great cloud everywhere covers the great trichiliocosm. In the midst of the great assembly he proclaims these words: 'I am the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Samyak-saṃbuddha, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone One, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed One, the Tamer of Persons, the Teacher of Devas and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. Those not yet crossed over I cause to cross over. Those not yet liberated I cause to be liberated. Those not yet at peace I cause to be at peace. Those not yet entered into nirvāṇa I cause to attain nirvāṇa. I know the present world and the future world as they truly are. I am the all-knowing one, the all-seeing one, the knower of the Way, the opener of the Way, the expounder of the Way. You devas, humans, and asura assemblies should all come here to hear the Dharma.'"

"At that time, immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of species of living beings came to the Buddha's presence to hear the Dharma. The Tathāgata at that time observed whether the faculties of these beings were sharp or dull, whether they were vigorous or indolent. According to what they were capable of bearing, he expounded the Dharma for them—of innumerable varieties—causing all to rejoice and quickly gain wholesome benefit."

"After these living beings heard this Dharma, they obtained peace and tranquility in the present world and were reborn in wholesome destinies, receiving happiness through the Way. They also were able to hear the Dharma. Having heard the Dharma, they departed from all obstructions. Regarding all dharmas, according to the power within their capacity, they gradually attained entry to the Way—just as that great cloud rains upon all the plants, bushes, forests, and medicinal herbs, and each according to its seed-nature receives the moisture fully and each obtains growth."

"The Dharma expounded by the Tathāgata is of one characteristic and one flavor—namely, the characteristic of liberation, the characteristic of separation, the characteristic of extinction—ultimately arriving at the wisdom of all modes. When living beings hear the Dharma of the Tathāgata, whether upholding it, reading it, reciting it, or cultivating practice according to what is expounded, the merits they obtain they themselves are not aware of. Why is this so? Only the Tathāgata knows the species-characteristics, substance, and nature of these living beings—what matters they are mindful of, what matters they think of, what matters they cultivate; how they are mindful, how they think, how they cultivate; by what dharmas they are mindful, by what dharmas they think, by what dharmas they cultivate, by what dharmas they obtain what dharmas. Living beings abide in various grounds. Only the Tathāgata sees them as they truly are, clearly and without obstruction—just as those plants, bushes, forests, and medicinal herbs do not themselves know their superior, medium, or inferior nature. The Tathāgata knows this Dharma of one characteristic and one flavor—namely, the characteristic of liberation, the characteristic of separation, the characteristic of extinction, the characteristic of ultimate nirvāṇa, the characteristic of constant quiescence and extinction—finally returning to emptiness. Having known this, the Buddha observes the mental desires of living beings and protects them. For this reason he does not immediately expound the wisdom of all modes to them. You, Kāśyapa and others, are exceedingly rare in being able to know that the Tathāgata expounds the Dharma according to what is suitable, and in being able to believe and accept it. Why is this so? The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, expound the Dharma according to what is suitable—this is difficult to understand and difficult to know."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"The Dharma King who breaks [the bonds of] existence
Appears in the world,
According to the desires of living beings,
Expounding various dharmas.

"The Tathāgata, venerable and honored,
Whose wisdom is deep and far-reaching,
Has long remained silent on these essential matters,
Not hasty to expound them.

"Those with wisdom, if they hear,
Are able to believe and understand.
Those without wisdom doubt and regret,
And thus are permanently lost.

"Therefore, Kāśyapa,
I expound according to their capacity,
Through various causes and conditions,
Causing them to attain right view.

"Kāśyapa, you should know,
It is like a great cloud
Arising in the world,
Covering everything.

"The cloud of wisdom, containing moisture,
With lightning flashing brilliantly,
Thunder resounding afar,
Causing the multitudes to rejoice.

"The sun's light is obscured,
The earth becomes cool,
Thick clouds descend and spread
As though they could be grasped.

"The rain falls equally,
Coming down on all four sides,
Streaming and pouring without measure,
Thoroughly saturating all the land.

"In mountain streams and险谷,
In secluded and hidden places where they grow,
Plants and medicinal herbs,
Large and small trees,

"Hundreds of grains and seedlings,
Sugarcane and grape vines—
All moistened by the rain,
None not made abundant.

"The parched earth is universally saturated,
Medicinal plants and trees all flourish.
The water produced by that cloud
Is of one flavor.

"Plants, trees, bushes, and forests,
Each receives moisture according to its portion.
All the various trees,
Superior, medium, and inferior,

"According to their greatness or smallness,
Each obtains growth.
Roots, stems, branches, leaves,
Flowers, fruits, luster, and color—

"All reached by the one rain,
All become fresh and glossy.
According to their bodily characteristics,
Their nature, portion, and size,

"Though moistened uniformly,
Each grows luxuriantly.
The Buddha is also like this—
He appears in the world

"Like a great cloud
That universally covers all.
Having appeared in the world,
For the sake of all living beings

"He discriminates and expounds
The reality of all dharmas.
The Great Sage, the World-Honored One,
Among all devas, humans,

"And all other assemblies,
Proclaims these words:
'I am the Tathāgata,
The Most Honored of Two-Legged Beings,

"'Appearing in the world
Like a great cloud,
Fully moistening
All withered living beings,

"'Causing all to depart from suffering,
Obtaining peace, tranquility, and happiness—
The happiness of the world
And the happiness of nirvāṇa.

"'Devas and human assemblies,
With single mind, listen well:
All should come here
To behold the Unsurpassed Honored One.

"'I am the World-Honored One,
Unequaled by any.
To bring peace to living beings,
I appear in the world,

"'For the sake of the great assembly I expound
The sweet-dew pure Dharma.
This Dharma is of one flavor—
Liberation and nirvāṇa.

"'With one wondrous sound
I elucidate this meaning,
Constantly creating causes and conditions
For the Great Vehicle.

"'I regard all [beings]
As entirely equal,
Having no minds
Of preference or aversion.

"'I have no greed or attachment,
Nor any limitations or obstructions.
I constantly, for all,
Expound the Dharma equally—

"'As for one person,
So also for many.
I constantly expound the Dharma,
Never engaged in other matters.

"'Coming and going, sitting and standing,
I am never weary or tired,
Fully satisfying the world
Like rain that universally moistens.

"'Noble and base, superior and inferior,
Those who uphold precepts and those who violate them,
Those complete in deportment
And those not complete,

"'Those of right view and wrong view,
Those of sharp faculties and dull faculties—
I rain the Dharma-rain equally,
Without weariness or fatigue.

"'All living beings
Who hear my Dharma,
According to their capacity receive it,
Dwelling in various grounds.

"'Some dwell among humans and devas,
As wheel-turning sage kings,
As Indra and Brahmā kings—
These are the small medicinal herbs.

"'Those who know the outflow-free dharmas,
Able to attain nirvāṇa,
Who arouse the six spiritual powers
And attain the three clear knowledges,

"'Dwelling alone in mountain forests,
Constantly practicing meditation,
Attaining the realization of Pratyekabuddhas—
These are the medium medicinal herbs.

"'Those who seek the place of the World-Honored One,
[Thinking] "I shall become a Buddha,"
Practicing vigor and concentration—
These are the superior medicinal herbs.

"'Moreover, sons of the Buddha
Who single-mindedly pursue the Buddha-Way,
Constantly practicing compassion,
Knowing for themselves they will become Buddhas,

"'Determined without doubt—
These are called small trees.
Abiding secure in spiritual powers,
Turning the irreversible wheel,

"'Liberating immeasurable koṭis,
Hundreds of thousands of living beings—
Such Bodhisattvas
Are called great trees.

"'The Buddha's equal exposition
Is like the rain of one flavor.
According to the natures of living beings,
What they receive differs—

"'Just as those plants and trees
Each receive differently according to their endowment.
The Buddha uses this parable
To open and reveal through skillful means,

"'Through various kinds of words
Expounding the one Dharma.
Regarding Buddha-wisdom,
[This is] like one drop of the ocean.

"'I rain the Dharma-rain,
Filling the entire world.
The Dharma of one flavor—
Each practices according to capacity,

"'Like those bushes, forests,
And medicinal herbs and trees,
According to their greatness or smallness,
Gradually increasing in luxuriant beauty.

"'The Dharma of all Buddhas
Is constantly of one flavor,
Causing all the worlds
To become fully endowed universally.

"'Gradually cultivating and practicing,
All attain the fruits of the Way.
Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas,
Dwelling in mountain forests,

"'Abiding in the final body,
Hearing the Dharma and attaining its fruit—
These are called medicinal herbs,
Each obtaining increase.

"'If various Bodhisattvas,
Whose wisdom is firm and solid,
Fully understand the three realms
And seek the supreme vehicle—

"'These are called small trees
Obtaining increase.
Again, there are those who abide in meditation,
Attaining spiritual powers,

"'Hearing all dharmas are empty,
Their minds greatly rejoicing,
Emitting countless rays of light,
Liberating all living beings—

"'These are called great trees
Obtaining increase.
Thus, Kāśyapa,
The Dharma expounded by the Buddha

"'Is likened to a great cloud
With the rain of one flavor
Moistening human flowers—
Each attaining ripened fruit.

"Kāśyapa, you should know,
Through various causes and conditions,
Various parables,
I open and reveal the Buddha-Way.

"This is my skillful means,
And all Buddhas are likewise.
Now for your sake
I expound the most real matter:

"The assembly of śrāvakas
Have not all attained extinction.
What you are practicing
Is the Bodhisattva-Way.

"Gradually cultivating and learning,
You shall all accomplish Buddhahood."

CHAPTER SIX: BESTOWAL OF PROPHECY

At that time, after the World-Honored One spoke these verses, he addressed the great assembly, proclaiming these words: "This disciple of mine, Mahākāśyapa, in a future age shall be able to make offerings to and behold three hundred myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, World-Honored Ones, serving them with offerings, reverence, honor, and praise. He will extensively proclaim the immeasurable great Dharma of all Buddhas. In his final body, he shall accomplish Buddhahood, with the name Raśmiprabhāsa Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land will be called Raśmiguṇa, and the kalpa will be called Mahāvyūha. The lifespan of that Buddha will be twelve intermediate kalpas. The True Dharma will abide in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas, and the Semblance Dharma will likewise abide for twenty intermediate kalpas. His land will be magnificently adorned, without any defilements or evil things, without tiles, stones, thorns, or brambles, or excrement and impurity. The land will be level and even, without any high or low places, pits, valleys, or mounds. The ground will be of lapis lazuli. Jeweled trees will be arrayed in rows. Golden ropes will border the paths. Scattered precious flowers will be everywhere, all pure and clean. The Bodhisattvas of that land will number immeasurable thousands of koṭis. The assembly of śrāvakas will likewise be immeasurable. There will be no activities of Māra, though Māra and Māra's subjects will be present—all will protect the Buddha-Dharma."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"I announce to the bhikṣus:
With the Buddha-eye
I see this Kāśyapa—
In a future age,

"After immeasurable kalpas,
He shall accomplish Buddhahood.
In ages to come
He will make offerings to and behold

"Three hundred myriads of koṭis
Of Buddhas, World-Honored Ones.
For the sake of Buddha-wisdom,
Purely cultivating the holy practices,

"Having made offerings to the most supreme
Two-Legged Honored Ones,
He will cultivate and learn
All the unsurpassed wisdom.

"In his final body
He shall accomplish Buddhahood.
His land will be pure,
With lapis lazuli for ground.

"Many jeweled trees
Will be arrayed along the paths,
Golden ropes bordering the ways,
Pleasing to all who see them.

"Constantly emitting fine fragrances,
Scattering all kinds of renowned flowers,
Various wondrous things
Serving as adornments.

"The land will be level and even,
Without any hills or pits.
The assembly of Bodhisattvas
Will be incalculable—

"Their minds gentle and compliant,
Having attained great spiritual powers,
Upholding all Buddhas'
Mahāyāna scriptures.

"The assembly of śrāvakas—
Outflow-free, in their final bodies,
Sons of the Dharma King—
Will also be incalculable,

"Such that even with the divine eye
They cannot be counted.
The lifespan of that Buddha
Will be twelve intermediate kalpas.

"The True Dharma abiding in the world
Will be twenty intermediate kalpas.
The Semblance Dharma will likewise abide
For twenty intermediate kalpas.

"Raśmiprabhāsa, the World-Honored One—
Such are his circumstances."

At that time Mahāmaudgalyāyana, Subhūti, Mahākātyāyana, and others all trembled with trepidation. With palms joined as one, they gazed up at the Honored Countenance, their eyes not leaving him for an instant. Together they spoke in unison with these verses:

"Great Hero, Mighty World-Honored One,
King of the Dharma of all the Śākyas,
Out of compassion for us,
Bestow upon us the Buddha's voice!

"If you know our deep minds
And see fit to bestow prophecy upon us,
It will be like sweet-dew being sprinkled,
Removing heat and bringing coolness.

"Like one coming from a famished land
Who suddenly encounters a great king's feast—
The mind still harbors doubt and fear,
Not daring immediately to eat.

"If again one receives the king's command,
Only then does one dare to eat.
We are also like this—
Constantly considering the faults of the Small Vehicle,

"Not knowing how we could
Attain the unsurpassed Buddha-wisdom.
Though we hear the Buddha's voice
Saying 'You shall all become Buddhas,'

"Our minds still harbor anxiety and fear,
Like not yet daring to eat.
If we receive the Buddha's prophecy,
Then we shall be swiftly at peace and happy.

"Great Hero, Mighty World-Honored One,
Who always desires to bring peace to the world,
We pray you bestow prophecy upon us,
Like the famished who need the command to eat!"

At that time the World-Honored One, knowing the thoughts in the minds of all the great disciples, addressed the bhikṣus: "This Subhūti, in a future age, shall make offerings to and behold three hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Buddhas, serving them with offerings, reverence, honor, and praise. He will constantly cultivate the holy practices and perfect the Bodhisattva Way. In his final body, he shall accomplish Buddhahood, with the name Śāstādarśana Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa will be called Ratnasaṃbhava, and the land will be called Ratnasaṃbhava. The land will be level and even, with crystal for ground. Jeweled trees will serve as adornments. There will be no hills, pits, sand, gravel, thorns, brambles, or impurities of excrement. Jeweled flowers will cover the ground, everywhere pure and clean. The people of that land will all dwell on jeweled platforms and wondrous precious pavilions. The śrāvaka disciples will be immeasurable and limitless, such that calculation, analogy, and comparison cannot know their number. The assembly of Bodhisattvas will number immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas. The lifespan of that Buddha will be twelve intermediate kalpas. The True Dharma abiding in the world will be twenty intermediate kalpas, and the Semblance Dharma will likewise abide for twenty intermediate kalpas. That Buddha will constantly dwell in empty space, expounding the Dharma for the assembly, liberating immeasurable Bodhisattvas and the śrāvaka assembly."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"O assembly of bhikṣus,
Now I announce to you—
All should with single mind
Listen to what I expound.

"My great disciple
Subhūti
Shall accomplish Buddhahood,
With the name Śāstādarśana.

"He shall make offerings to countless
Myriads of koṭis of Buddhas,
Following the Buddhas' practices,
Gradually perfecting the Great Way.

"In the final body he will attain
The thirty-two marks,
Upright, beautiful, and wondrous,
Like a jeweled mountain.

"The land of that Buddha
Will be most magnificently pure.
Living beings who see it
Will all love and delight in it.

"The Buddha, within it,
Will liberate immeasurable multitudes.
In that Buddha's Dharma
There will be many Bodhisattvas—

"All of sharp faculties,
Turning the irreversible wheel.
That land will constantly
Be adorned with Bodhisattvas.

"The assembly of śrāvakas
Will be beyond calculation—
All will have attained the three clear knowledges,
Possess the six spiritual powers,

"Abide in the eight liberations,
And have great威德.
The exposition of Dharma by that Buddha
Will manifest immeasurable

"Spiritual transformations
Beyond conception.
Devas and human beings,
Numerous as Ganges' sands,

"Will all join their palms
To listen and receive the Buddha's words.
The lifespan of that Buddha
Will be twelve intermediate kalpas.

"The True Dharma abiding in the world
Will be twenty intermediate kalpas.
The Semblance Dharma will likewise abide
For twenty intermediate kalpas."

At that time the World-Honored One again addressed the assembly of bhikṣus: "I now tell you: This Mahākātyāyana, in a future age, will serve and make offerings to eight thousand koṭis of Buddhas with various offering articles, showing reverence and honor. After the extinction of those Buddhas, he will erect stūpas and temples for each—one thousand yojanas in height, five hundred yojanas in length and breadth, perfectly square—all composed of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, carnelian, pearl, and rose quartz, these seven precious materials. With multitudes of flowers, necklaces, paste incenses, powdered incenses, burning incenses, silk canopies, and banners, he will make offerings to the stūpas and temples. After this, he will again make offerings to twenty thousand koṭis of Buddhas, likewise in the same manner."

"After making offerings to these Buddhas, he will perfect the Bodhisattva Way and shall accomplish Buddhahood, with the name Jambūnadābhāsakusumādhipatijñānābhijña Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land will be level and even, with crystal for ground. Jeweled trees will serve as adornments. Golden ropes will border the paths. Wondrous flowers will cover the ground, everywhere pure and clean—all who see it will rejoice. There will be no four evil destinies: no hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras. There will be many devas, humans, śrāvakas, and Bodhisattvas—immeasurable myriads of koṭis adorning that land. The lifespan of that Buddha will be twelve intermediate kalpas. The True Dharma abiding in the world will be twenty intermediate kalpas, and the Semblance Dharma will likewise abide for twenty intermediate kalpas."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"O assembly of bhikṣus,
All listen with single mind!
As I expound,
Truly without difference.

"This Kātyāyana
Shall, with various
Wondrous and fine offering articles,
Make offerings to all Buddhas.

"After the extinction of all Buddhas,
He will erect stūpas of the seven precious materials,
Also with flowers and incenses
Making offerings to the śarīra.

"In his final body,
He will attain Buddha-wisdom
And accomplish Perfect Enlightenment.
His land will be pure,

"Liberating immeasurable
Myriads of koṭis of living beings,
All receiving offerings
From the ten directions.

"The Buddha's light
Will be unexcelled by any.
That Buddha will be called
Jambūnadābhāsa.

"Bodhisattvas and śrāvakas,
Severing all existence,
Immeasurable and countless,
Will adorn that land."

At that time the World-Honored One again addressed the great assembly: "I now tell you: This Mahāmaudgalyāyana shall, with various offering articles, make offerings to eight thousand Buddhas, showing reverence and honor. After the extinction of those Buddhas, he will erect stūpas and temples for each—one thousand yojanas in height, five hundred yojanas in length and breadth, perfectly square—all composed of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, carnelian, pearl, and rose quartz, these seven precious materials. With multitudes of flowers, necklaces, paste incenses, powdered incenses, burning incenses, silk canopies, and banners, he will use them to make offerings. After this, he will again make offerings to two hundred myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, likewise in the same manner. He shall accomplish Buddhahood, with the name Tamālapatracandanagandhābhijña Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa will be called Prītimaṇḍita, and the land will be called Manoratha. The land will be level and even, with crystal for ground. Jeweled trees will serve as adornments. Scattered pearls and flowers will be everywhere pure and clean—all who see it will rejoice. There will be many devas, humans, Bodhisattvas, and śrāvakas, immeasurable in number. The lifespan of that Buddha will be twenty-four intermediate kalpas. The True Dharma abiding in the world will be forty intermediate kalpas, and the Semblance Dharma will likewise abide for forty intermediate kalpas."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"This disciple of mine,
Mahāmaudgalyāyana,
Having cast off this body,
Shall behold eight thousand

"Two hundred myriads of koṭis
Of Buddhas, World-Honored Ones.
For the sake of the Buddha-Way,
He will serve them with offerings and reverence.

"In the presence of all Buddhas
He will constantly cultivate the holy practices.
Throughout immeasurable kalpas
He will uphold the Buddhas' Dharma.

"After the extinction of those Buddhas,
He will erect stūpas of the seven precious materials,
With tall columns and golden poles,
With flowers, incenses, and music,

"Making offerings thereby
To the stūpas and temples of all Buddhas.
Gradually perfecting
The Bodhisattva Way,

"In the land Manoratha
He shall accomplish Buddhahood,
Named Tamālapatraca
ndana Fragrance.

"The lifespan of that Buddha
Will be twenty-four kalpas.
Constantly for devas and humans
He will expound the Buddha-Way.

"Śrāvakas, immeasurable
As Ganges' sands,
With the three clear knowledges and six powers,
Having great威德—

"Bodhisattvas, countless,
Firm in resolve and vigorous,
Regarding Buddha-wisdom
All irreversible—

"After the Buddha's extinction,
The True Dharma shall abide
For forty intermediate kalpas.
The Semblance Dharma will be likewise.

"My various disciples,
Complete in威德,
Numbering five hundred,
Shall all receive prophecy.

"In future ages
All shall accomplish Buddhahood.
I and you
Have causes and conditions from former lives—

"I shall now expound this.
Listen well, all of you!"

CHAPTER SEVEN: THE PARABLE OF THE PHANTOM CITY

The Buddha addressed the bhikṣus: "In the past, throughout immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable, asaṃkhyeya kalpas, there was a Buddha named Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land was called Surāja, and the kalpa was called Mahārūpa. O bhikṣus, it has been exceedingly long and distant since that Buddha entered extinction. Suppose there were a person who ground all the earth-element of a great trichiliocosm into ink, and after passing through one thousand lands to the east, let fall one dot the size of a mote of dust, then after passing through another thousand lands let fall another dot—in this manner proceeding until all the earth-element ink was exhausted. What do you think? Could an arithmetician or an arithmetician's disciple reach the limit and know the number of all those lands?" "No, World-Honored One." "O bhikṣus, if all the lands that person passed through, whether marked with dots or not, were all ground into dust, and each dust-mote counted as one kalpa—the time since that Buddha entered extinction surpasses even this number by immeasurable, limitless, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya kalpas. Through the power of the Tathāgata's knowledge and vision, I regard that distant past as though it were this very day."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"I remember a past age,
Immeasurable, limitless kalpas ago—
There was a Buddha, Most Honored of Two-Legged Beings,
Named Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū.

"Suppose a person, exerting strength, were to grind
The earth of the great trichiliocosm,
Exhausting all these earth-elements,
All completely making them into ink,

"Then after passing through one thousand lands
Let fall a single dust-dot,
And proceeding in this manner, marking with dots,
Exhaust all this dust-ink—

"Suppose all such lands,
Both dotted and un-dotted,
Were again completely ground into dust,
With each dust-mote as one kalpa—

"The number of these dust-motes,
And kalpas surpassing even this—
Since that Buddha entered extinction,
Such immeasurable kalpas have passed.

"Through the Tathāgata's unobstructed wisdom
I know of that Buddha's extinction,
And of the śrāvakas and Bodhisattvas—
As though seeing an extinction today.

"You bhikṣus should know:
Buddha-wisdom is pure, subtle, and wondrous,
Without outflows, without obstructions,
Penetrating immeasurable kalpas."

The Buddha addressed the bhikṣus: "The lifespan of Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Buddha was five hundred forty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kalpas. Originally that Buddha, while sitting at the place of enlightenment, after defeating the armies of Māra and being on the verge of attaining anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, the dharmas of Buddhahood did not yet manifest before him. Thus for one intermediate kalpa, and up to ten intermediate kalpas, he sat in full lotus posture, body and mind unmoving, yet the dharmas of Buddhahood still did not appear before him."

"At that time the devas of Trāyastriṃśa had previously prepared a lion throne beneath the bodhi-tree for that Buddha, one yojana in height. The Buddha was to sit upon this seat and attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Just as he sat upon this seat, the Brahmā Heavenly Kings rained down celestial flowers covering a hundred yojanas. Fragrant breezes came from time to time, blowing away the withered flowers and raining down fresh ones. In this manner, without cease, for a full ten intermediate kalpas they made offerings to the Buddha, continuing thus until his extinction, constantly raining down these flowers. The Four Heavenly Kings, to make offerings to the Buddha, constantly beat heavenly drums. The remaining devas played heavenly music—for a full ten intermediate kalpas, until his extinction, likewise continuing thus."

"O bhikṣus, after Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Buddha had passed ten intermediate kalpas, the dharmas of Buddhahood then manifested before him, and he accomplished anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Before that Buddha left home, he had sixteen sons. The eldest was named Jñānākara. Each of the sons possessed various rare and marvelous playthings. When they heard that their father had accomplished anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, they all abandoned their precious possessions and proceeded to the Buddha's presence. Their mothers, weeping, followed after them. Their grandfather, a wheel-turning sage king, together with one hundred great ministers and hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of other people, all surrounded them and accompanied them to the place of enlightenment, all desiring to draw near to Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Tathāgata and to make offerings, show reverence, honor, and praise. Having arrived, they bowed with their heads at the Buddha's feet, circumambulated him, then with palms joined as one gazed up at the World-Honored One, speaking in verse:

"'Great威德 World-Honored One,
For the sake of liberating living beings,
Throughout immeasurable koṭis of kalpas,
You have now at last accomplished Buddhahood.

"'All vows already fulfilled,
How excellent and auspicious beyond compare!
The World-Honored One is exceedingly rare—
Sitting for ten intermediate kalpas,

"'Your body and hands and feet
Serene, peaceful, and unmoving.
Your mind constantly tranquil,
Never having been scattered or confused.

"'Ultimately and permanently quiescent,
Abiding secure in outflow-free dharmas.
Now we see the World-Honored One
Peacefully accomplishing the Buddha-Way.

"'We have obtained wholesome benefit,
Our praise and celebration great and joyful.
Living beings constantly suffer affliction,
Blind and dark without a guide.

"'They do not recognize the path to the cessation of suffering,
Nor know to seek liberation.
Throughout the long night they increase in evil destinies,
Diminishing the multitudes of devas.

"'From darkness they enter into darkness,
Never hearing the Buddha's name.
Now the Buddha has attained the supreme,
Peaceful, outflow-free Way.

"'We and all devas and humans
Have obtained the greatest benefit.
Therefore we all bow our heads,
Taking refuge in the Unsurpassed Honored One.'"

At that time, after the sixteen princes had praised the Buddha in verse, they entreated the World-Honored One to turn the Dharma-wheel, all speaking these words: "World-Honored One, expound the Dharma! May there be much peace, tranquility, compassion, benefit, and nourishment for all devas and human beings!" They restated this in verse, saying:

"'World Hero without equal,
Adorned by the hundred meritorious marks,
Having attained unsurpassed wisdom—
Please expound it for the world!

"'To liberate us
And all classes of living beings,
Discriminate and reveal,
Causing us to attain this wisdom.

"'If we and others attain Buddhahood,
Living beings will likewise be so.
The World-Honored One knows living beings'
Deep mental thoughts,

"'And also knows the paths they practice,
Their wisdom-power as well,
Their desires, joys, and cultivation of merit,
And the karmic actions of their past lives.

"'The World-Honored One, having fully known all this,
Should turn the unsurpassed wheel!'"

The Buddha addressed the bhikṣus: "When Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Buddha attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, in each of the ten directions, five hundred myriads of koṭis of Buddha-worlds quaked and trembled in six ways. In the dark interstices between those lands—places where the awesome light of the sun and moon could not illuminate—all became greatly illumined. The living beings therein each beheld one another and all said: 'How is it that beings have suddenly been born here?' Moreover, in those lands the palaces of all the devas, up to the Brahmā palaces, quaked and trembled in six ways, and great light universally shone, pervading the worlds, surpassing the light of the devas."

At that time, in five hundred myriads of koṭis of lands to the east, the palaces of the Brahmā Heavenly Kings shone with light and radiance doubly brilliant beyond their usual brightness. Each of the Brahmā Heavenly Kings had this thought: "Now the light of our palaces is unprecedented. For what cause and condition does this sign appear?" At that time the Brahmā Heavenly Kings immediately visited one another to discuss this matter together. At that time, within that assembly, there was a Great Brahmā Heavenly King named Sarveṣvararakṣa who, on behalf of the Brahmā assembly, spoke in verse:

"'Our various palaces,
Their light unprecedented—
What is the cause and condition for this?
We should all seek it together.

"'Has a deva of great virtue been born,
Or has a Buddha appeared in the world?
For this great light
Universally illumines the ten directions.'"

At that time five hundred myriads of koṭis of lands' worth of Brahmā Heavenly Kings, together with their palaces, each carrying robes filled with celestial flowers, proceeded together toward the west to investigate this sign. They beheld Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Tathāgata at the place of enlightenment, beneath the bodhi-tree, sitting upon the lion throne, with devas, nāgas, gandharvas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans respectfully surrounding him. They also beheld the sixteen princes entreating the Buddha to turn the Dharma-wheel.

Immediately the Brahmā Heavenly Kings bowed with their heads at the Buddha's feet, circumambulated him hundreds of thousands of times, then scattered celestial flowers upon the Buddha. The flowers they scattered were like Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi-tree. That bodhi-tree was ten yojanas in height. Having made offerings with flowers, they each presented their palaces to that Buddha, speaking these words: "May you mercifully pity and benefit us. These palaces we offer—may you graciously consent to accept them." At that time the Brahmā Heavenly Kings, in the Buddha's presence, with minds unified in one voice, spoke in verse:

"'The World-Honored One is exceedingly rare,
Difficult to encounter and meet.
Possessing immeasurable merits,
Able to save and protect all.

"'Great Teacher of devas and humans,
Compassionate toward the world—
The ten directions' living beings
All universally receive your nourishment and benefit.

"'The lands from which we have come—
Five hundred myriads of koṭis—
We abandon the bliss of deep meditation
For the sake of making offerings to the Buddha.

"'Our merit from former lives—
Our palaces magnificently adorned—
Now we offer them to the World-Honored One,
Praying you mercifully consent to accept them.'"

At that time, after the Brahmā Heavenly Kings had praised the Buddha in verse, they each spoke thus: "We pray the World-Honored One will turn the Dharma-wheel, liberate living beings, and open the path of nirvāṇa!" At that time the Brahmā Heavenly Kings, with minds unified in one voice, spoke in verse:

"'World Hero, Most Honored of Two-Legged Beings,
We pray you expound the Dharma!
With the power of great compassion,
Liberate suffering and afflicted living beings!'"

At that time Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Tathāgata silently consented.

"Moreover, O bhikṣus, to the southeast, in five hundred myriads of koṭis of lands, all the Great Brahmā Kings each beheld their own palaces' light and radiance shining brilliantly, unprecedented. Joyful, exultant, and giving rise to a sense of rarity, they immediately visited one another to discuss this matter together. At that time, within that assembly, there was a Great Brahmā Heavenly King named Mahākruṇā who, on behalf of the Brahmā assembly, spoke in verse:

"'For what cause and condition
Does such a sign as this appear?
Our various palaces,
Their light unprecedented.

"'Has a deva of great virtue been born,
Or has a Buddha appeared in the world?
We have never seen such a sign—
We should with unified mind seek it.

"'Passing beyond one thousand myriads of koṭis of lands,
Following the light, let us all investigate together.
Most likely a Buddha has appeared in the world
To liberate suffering living beings.'"

At that time five hundred myriads of koṭis of Brahmā Heavenly Kings, together with their palaces, each carrying robes filled with celestial flowers, proceeded together toward the northwest to investigate this sign. They beheld Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Tathāgata at the place of enlightenment, beneath the bodhi-tree, sitting upon the lion throne, with devas, nāgas, gandharvas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans respectfully surrounding him. They also beheld the sixteen princes entreating the Buddha to turn the Dharma-wheel.

At that time the Brahmā Heavenly Kings bowed with their heads at the Buddha's feet, circumambulated him hundreds of thousands of times, then scattered celestial flowers upon the Buddha. The flowers they scattered were like Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi-tree. Having made offerings with flowers, they each presented their palaces to that Buddha, speaking these words: "May you mercifully pity and benefit us. These palaces we offer—may you graciously consent to accept them." At that time the Brahmā Heavenly Kings, in the Buddha's presence, with minds unified in one voice, spoke in verse:

"'Sacred Lord, Heavenly King Among Kings,
With the voice of the kalaviṅka,
You who compassionately pity living beings—
We now bow in reverence.

"'The World-Honored One is exceedingly rare,
Only appearing once after a very long time.
One hundred eighty kalpas
Pass by empty, without a Buddha.

"'The three evil destinies are full,
The multitudes of devas diminished.
Now the Buddha has appeared in the world,
Becoming eyes for living beings—

"'That to which the world returns and tends,
Savior and protector of all,
Father of living beings,
You who compassionately pity and nourish them.

"'Through our merit and blessings from former lives,
Now we are able to encounter the World-Honored One.'"

At that time, after the Brahmā Heavenly Kings had praised the Buddha in verse, they each spoke thus: "We pray the World-Honored One will compassionately pity all and turn the Dharma-wheel to liberate living beings!" At that time the Brahmā Heavenly Kings, with minds unified in one voice, spoke in verse:

"'Great Sage, turn the Dharma-wheel!
Reveal the characteristics of all dharmas!
Liberate suffering and afflicted living beings,
Causing them to obtain great joy!

"'Living beings hearing this Dharma
Will attain the Way or be born in heaven.
All evil destinies will be diminished,
And those enduring and wholesome will increase.'"

At that time Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Tathāgata silently consented.

"Moreover, O bhikṣus, to the south, in five hundred myriads of koṭis of lands, all the Great Brahmā Kings each beheld their own palaces' light and radiance shining brilliantly, unprecedented. Joyful, exultant, and giving rise to a sense of rarity, they immediately visited one another to discuss this matter: 'For what cause and condition do our palaces have this radiance?' At that time, within that assembly, there was a Great Brahmā Heavenly King named Sudhārma who, on behalf of the Brahmā assembly, spoke in verse:

"'Our various palaces,
Their light most majestic and radiant—
This is not without cause and condition;
This sign should be sought.

"'Throughout more than one hundred thousand kalpas
We have never seen such a sign.
Has a deva of great virtue been born,
Or has a Buddha appeared in the world?'"

At that time five hundred myriads of koṭis of Brahmā Heavenly Kings, together with their palaces, each carrying robes filled with celestial flowers, proceeded together toward the north to investigate this sign. They beheld Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Tathāgata at the place of enlightenment, beneath the bodhi-tree, sitting upon the lion throne, with devas, nāgas, gandharvas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans respectfully surrounding him. They also beheld the sixteen princes entreating the Buddha to turn the Dharma-wheel.

At that time the Brahmā Heavenly Kings bowed with their heads at the Buddha's feet, circumambulated him hundreds of thousands of times, then scattered celestial flowers upon the Buddha. The flowers they scattered were like Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi-tree. Having made offerings with flowers, they each presented their palaces to that Buddha, speaking these words: "May you mercifully pity and benefit us. These palaces we offer—may you graciously consent to accept them." At that time the Brahmā Heavenly Kings, in the Buddha's presence, with minds unified in one voice, spoke in verse:

"'The World-Honored One is most difficult to see—
Destroyer of all afflictions.
More than one hundred thirty kalpas have passed;
Now at last we are able to see you once.

"'All those famished, thirsty living beings
Are filled with the Dharma-rain.
Never before have we beheld
This one of immeasurable wisdom—

"'Like the udumbara flower,
Today at last we encounter you.
Our various palaces,
Made splendid through this light—

"'World-Honored One of great compassion,
We pray you graciously consent to accept them.'"

At that time, after the Brahmā Heavenly Kings had praised the Buddha in verse, they each spoke thus: "We pray the World-Honored One will turn the Dharma-wheel, causing all worlds—devas, Māra, Brahmā, śramaṇas, and brāhmaṇas—to obtain peace, tranquility, and liberation!" At that time the Brahmā Heavenly Kings, with minds unified in one voice, spoke in verse:

"'We pray the Most Honored of Devas and Humans
Will turn the unsurpassed Dharma-wheel,
Beat the great Dharma-drum,
And blow the great Dharma-conch,

"'Universally rain down the great Dharma-rain
To liberate immeasurable living beings!
We all take refuge and entreat—
May you proclaim the deep and far-reaching sound!'"

At that time Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Tathāgata silently consented. The southwest through the nadir directions were likewise thus.

At that time, in five hundred myriads of koṭis of lands in the upward direction, all the Great Brahmā Kings each completely beheld their own dwelling palaces' light and majesty shining radiantly, unprecedented. Joyful, exultant, and giving rise to a sense of rarity, they immediately visited one another to discuss this matter: "For what cause and condition do our palaces have this light?" At that time, within that assembly, there was a Great Brahmā Heavenly King named Śikhin who, on behalf of the Brahmā assembly, spoke in verse:

"'Now for what cause and condition
Do our various palaces
Display such majestic light and radiance,
Adorned as never before?

"'Such wondrous signs as these—
Never before heard or seen—
Has a deva of great virtue been born,
Or has a Buddha appeared in the world?'"

At that time five hundred myriads of koṭis of Brahmā Heavenly Kings, together with their palaces, each carrying robes filled with celestial flowers, proceeded together toward the nadir to investigate this sign. They beheld Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Tathāgata at the place of enlightenment, beneath the bodhi-tree, sitting upon the lion throne, with devas, nāgas, gandharvas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans respectfully surrounding him. They also beheld the sixteen princes entreating the Buddha to turn the Dharma-wheel.

At that time the Brahmā Heavenly Kings bowed with their heads at the Buddha's feet, circumambulated him hundreds of thousands of times, then scattered celestial flowers upon the Buddha. The flowers they scattered were like Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi-tree. Having made offerings with flowers, they each presented their palaces to that Buddha, speaking these words: "May you mercifully pity and benefit us. These palaces we offer—may you graciously consent to accept them." At that time the Brahmā Heavenly Kings, in the Buddha's presence, with minds unified in one voice, spoke in verse:

"'Excellent to behold all Buddhas,
Savior Sages who rescue the world,
Able within the prison of the three realms
To liberate all living beings!

"'Universal Wisdom, Most Honored of Devas and Humans,
Compassionate toward the multitudes of beings,
Able to open the sweet-dew gate,
Extensively liberating all!

"'In countless kalpas of the past,
Empty, passing without a Buddha—
Before the World-Honored One appeared,
The ten directions were constantly dark.

"'The three evil destinies increased,
Asuras likewise prospered,
The multitudes of devas progressively diminished,
Many dying and falling into evil paths.

"'Not hearing the Dharma from Buddhas,
Constantly practicing unwholesome deeds,
Physical strength and wisdom—
All these decreased,

"'Due to the causes and conditions of sinful karma,
Losing happiness and thoughts of happiness,
Dwelling in dharmas of wrong views,
Not recognizing wholesome rules and principles.

"'Not receiving the Buddha's transforming influence,
Constantly falling into evil paths.
The Buddha is the eye of the world,
Appearing only after a very long time—

"'Compassionately pitying all living beings,
Therefore appearing in the world.
Transcending all, accomplishing Perfect Enlightenment—
We are profoundly joyful and celebrating!

"'And all the remaining multitudes
Rejoice and acclaim as never before!
Our various palaces,
Made splendid through this light—

"'Now we offer them to the World-Honored One,
Praying you graciously consent to accept them.
May, through these merits,
They universally reach all—

"'May we together with all living beings
All jointly accomplish the Buddha-Way!'"

At that time, after five hundred myriads of koṭis of Brahmā Heavenly Kings had praised the Buddha in verse, they each addressed the Buddha, saying: "We pray the World-Honored One will turn the Dharma-wheel—much peace, tranquility, much liberation!" At that time the Brahmā Heavenly Kings spoke in verse:

"'World-Honored One, turn the Dharma-wheel!
Beat the sweet-dew Dharma-drum!
Liberate suffering and afflicted living beings!
Open and reveal the path of nirvāṇa!

"'We pray you accept our entreaty!
With the great subtle and wondrous sound,
Compassionately elucidate and expound
The Dharma accumulated over immeasurable kalpas!'"

At that time Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Tathāgata, accepting the entreaty of the Brahmā Heavenly Kings of the ten directions and the sixteen princes, immediately turned the Dharma-wheel three times with twelve revolutions—a Dharma-wheel that śramaṇas, brāhmaṇas, devas, Māra, Brahmā, and the remaining world could not turn. He declared: 'This is suffering. This is the arising of suffering. This is the cessation of suffering. This is the path to the cessation of suffering.' He also extensively expounded the Dharma of the twelve causes and conditions: ignorance conditions formations; formations condition consciousness; consciousness conditions name-and-form; name-and-form conditions the six sense-bases; the six sense-bases condition contact; contact conditions feeling; feeling conditions craving; craving conditions grasping; grasping conditions becoming; becoming conditions birth; birth conditions aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, and distress. When ignorance ceases, formations cease. When formations cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name-and-form ceases. When name-and-form ceases, the six sense-bases cease. When the six sense-bases cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, becoming ceases. When becoming ceases, birth ceases. When birth ceases, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, and distress cease.

"When the Buddha was expounding this Dharma in the midst of the great assembly of devas and humans, six hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of persons, through not grasping any dharma, attained liberation of mind from all outflows. All attained profound and wondrous meditative concentration, the three clear knowledges, the six spiritual powers, and complete possession of the eight liberations. During the second, third, and fourth expositions of the Dharma, thousands of myriads of koṭis of Ganges' sands of nayutas of living beings also, through not grasping any dharma, attained liberation of mind from all outflows. From that time forward, the multitude of śrāvakas became immeasurable, limitless, beyond calculation.

"At that time the sixteen princes all left home as youths to become śrāmaṇeras. Their faculties were keen and perceptive, their wisdom clear and illumined. They had previously made offerings to hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, purely cultivating the holy practices, and sought anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Together they addressed the Buddha, saying: 'World-Honored One, these immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of great and virtuous śrāvakas have all achieved realization. World-Honored One, you should also expound for us the Dharma of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Having heard it, we shall all together cultivate and learn it. World-Honored One, we aspire to the knowledge and vision of the Tathāgata. Our deep minds' thoughts the Buddha himself bears witness to.' At that time, within the multitude the wheel-turning sage king had brought, eight hundred myriads of koṭis of persons, seeing the sixteen princes leave home, also sought to leave home. The king immediately granted them permission.

"At that time that Buddha, accepting the śrāmaṇeras' entreaty, after twenty thousand kalpas had passed, in the midst of the fourfold assembly expounded this Mahāyāna sutra named the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas. Having expounded this sutra, the sixteen śrāmaṇeras, for the sake of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, all together accepted, upheld, recited, and mastered it thoroughly. When this sutra was being expounded, the sixteen Bodhisattva-śrāmaṇeras all believed and accepted it with faith. Among the śrāvaka assembly there were also those who believed and understood. The remaining living beings—thousands of myriads of koṭis of species—all gave rise to doubts and perplexity. The Buddha expounded this sutra for eight thousand kalpas without ever resting or ceasing. Having expounded this sutra, he immediately entered a quiet chamber and dwelt in meditative concentration for eighty-four thousand kalpas. At that time the sixteen Bodhisattva-śrāmaṇeras, knowing the Buddha had entered the chamber in quiescent meditation, each ascended the Dharma-seat and likewise, for eighty-four thousand kalpas, discriminately expounded the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra extensively for the fourfold assembly. Each one liberated six hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges' sands of living beings, teaching, benefiting, and delighting them, causing them to arouse the mind of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"After Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū Buddha had passed eighty-four thousand kalpas, he arose from samādhi, proceeded to the Dharma-seat, sat calmly and peacefully, and universally addressed the great assembly: 'These sixteen Bodhisattva-śrāmaṇeras are exceedingly rare. Their faculties are keen and perceptive, their wisdom clear and illumined. They have previously made offerings to immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of numbers of Buddhas. In the presence of all Buddhas they have constantly cultivated the holy practices, accepting and upholding the Buddha's wisdom, opening and revealing it to living beings, causing them to enter into it. You should all repeatedly draw near to and make offerings to them. Why? If śrāvakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas are able to believe the sutras expounded by these sixteen Bodhisattvas, accepting and upholding them without destroying them, such persons shall all attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, the wisdom of the Tathāgata.'

"The Buddha addressed the bhikṣus: 'These sixteen Bodhisattvas constantly delighted in expounding this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra. Each Bodhisattva transformed six hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges' sands of living beings. Life after life, wherever they were born, they were together with that Bodhisattva. They heard the Dharma from him and all believed and understood. Through these causes and conditions they encountered four hundred myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, World-Honored Ones, and to this day have not yet exhausted this.'"

"'O bhikṣus, I now tell you: Those sixteen śrāmaṇeras who were disciples of that Buddha have now all attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. In lands throughout the ten directions they are presently expounding the Dharma, with immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of Bodhisattvas and śrāvakas as their retinue. Two of the śrāmaṇeras became Buddhas in the east: one is named Akṣobhya, in the land Abhirati; the other is named Merukūṭa. In the southeast are two Buddhas: one is named Siṃhanāda; the other is named Siṃhadhvaja. In the south are two Buddhas: one is named Ākāśapratiṣṭhita; the other is named Nityaparinirvṛta. In the southwest are two Buddhas: one is named Īśvaralakṣaṇa; the other is named Brahmalakṣaṇa. In the west are two Buddhas: one is named Amitāyus; the other is named Sarvalokadhātupadravodvegapratyuttīrṇa. In the northwest are two Buddhas: one is named Tamālapatracandanagandhābhijña; the other is named Merudhvajarāja. In the north are two Buddhas: one is named Meghasvararāja; the other is named Meghsvaravararāja. In the northeast the Buddha is named Sarvalokabhayastambhitvavidhvaṃsanakara. The sixteenth is I, Śākyamuni Buddha, who in the Sahā land accomplished anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi.'"

"'O bhikṣus, when we were śrāmaṇeras, each of us taught and transformed immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of Ganges' sands of living beings. Those who heard the Dharma from me [aspired to] anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Among these living beings, to this day there are those dwelling at the ground of śrāvakas. I constantly teach and transform them toward anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. These persons, through this Dharma, shall gradually enter the Buddha-Way. Why is this? The Tathāgata's wisdom is difficult to believe and difficult to understand. The immeasurable Ganges' sands of living beings transformed at that time—you bhikṣus, and those śrāvaka disciples after my extinction in a future age, are they. After my extinction, there will again be disciples who do not hear this sutra, do not know or perceive what Bodhisattvas practice, but who, regarding the merits they have themselves obtained, give rise to thoughts of extinction and enter nirvāṇa. In another land I shall become a Buddha with a different name. Though those persons give rise to thoughts of extinction and enter nirvāṇa, in that land they will seek the Buddha's wisdom and will be able to hear this sutra. Only through the Buddha Vehicle will they attain extinction—there is no other vehicle, except when Tathāgatas expound the Dharma through skillful means.'"

"'O bhikṣus, if the Tathāgata knows that the time for nirvāṇa has arrived, and the assembly is again pure, with faith, understanding, and resolve firm, fully comprehending the Dharma of emptiness and deeply entered into meditation, then he gathers together all Bodhisattvas and the śrāvaka assembly to expound this sutra. In the world there are no two vehicles by which to attain extinction—there is only the one Buddha Vehicle by which to attain extinction. Bhikṣus should know: the Tathāgata's skillful means deeply penetrate the natures of living beings. Knowing their delight in lesser dharmas and their deep attachment to the five desires, for the sake of such persons he expounds nirvāṇa. If such persons hear it, they then believe and accept it.'"

"'Suppose there were a险难 evil road of five hundred yojanas, a vast and barren expanse without people—a frightening place. If there were a large group wishing to traverse this road to reach a place of precious jewels, there would be a guide, intelligent and wise, well knowing the险道 and whether it was passable or blocked, who would lead and guide the people, desiring to pass through this difficulty. The people being led, midway through, grew weary and withdrew, addressing the guide: "We are utterly exhausted, and moreover we are afraid. We cannot proceed further. The road ahead is still far. Now we wish to turn back." The guide, possessing many skillful means, had this thought: "These people are pitiable—how can they abandon the great precious jewels and wish to turn back?" Having had this thought, through the power of skillful means, at a险道 he had passed three hundred yojanas along, he conjured a城. He told the people: "Do not be afraid! Do not turn back! Now there is this great city where you can stop and rest, doing as you wish. If you enter this city, you will quickly attain peace and tranquility. If you are able to proceed forward to the jewel-place, you may also go there." At that time the exhausted multitude, their minds greatly joyful, acclaimed as never before: "Now we have escaped this evil road and quickly attained peace and tranquility!" Thereupon the people proceeded forward and entered the conjured city, giving rise to thoughts of having crossed over and thoughts of peace and tranquility. At that time the guide, knowing these people had already obtained rest and were no longer exhausted, immediately caused the conjured city to vanish, saying to the people: "Come, let us go! The jewel-place is near. That great city just before—I conjured it merely as a resting place."'"

CHAPTER EIGHT: PREDICTION FOR FIVE HUNDRED DESCIPLES

At that time Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra, having heard from the Buddha this wisdom and skillful means, the exposition of Dharma according to circumstances, having heard the predictions of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi bestowed upon the great disciples, having further heard of past causes and conditions, and having further heard that the Buddhas possess great sovereign spiritual powers, attained what he had never before attained. His mind was purified and filled with joy. Immediately he arose from his seat, proceeded to the Buddha's presence, bowed his head at the Buddha's feet, then withdrew and stood to one side, gazing up at the honored countenance without averting his eyes for even a moment. And he had this thought: "The World-Honored One is exceedingly extraordinary! His actions are most rare! According to the various natures of worldly beings, through the knowledge and vision of skillful means he expounds the Dharma for them, drawing out living beings from their various attachments. We, regarding the Buddha's merits, cannot express them in words. Only the Buddha, the World-Honored One, can know our deep minds' original vow."

At that time the Buddha addressed the bhikṣus: "Do you see this Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra? I constantly praise him as foremost among those who expound the Dharma. I also constantly extol his various merits—how diligently he guards and maintains, assists in proclaiming my Dharma; how he is able, among the fourfold assembly, to teach, benefit, and gladden them; how he completely explains the Buddha's True Dharma, greatly benefiting those who practice the holy life alongside him. Apart from the Tathāgata, none can exhaust his eloquence in exposition."

"You should not think that Pūrṇa is only able to guard, maintain, and assist in proclaiming my Dharma. He also, in the presence of ninety koṭis of Buddhas in the past, guarded, maintained, assisted, and proclaimed the True Dharma of those Buddhas, and among those who expounded the Dharma, he was also foremost. Moreover, regarding the Dharma of emptiness expounded by those Buddhas, he clearly understood and thoroughly penetrated it, attaining the four unobstructed wisdoms. He was constantly able to審諦 expound the Dharma purely and without doubt, completely possessing the Bodhisattva's spiritual powers. Throughout his lifespan he constantly cultivated the holy practices. The people of those Buddha-worlds all regarded him as truly being a śrāvaka. Yet through this skillful means, Pūrṇa benefited immeasurable hundreds of thousands of living beings, and also transformed immeasurable asaṃkhyeyas of persons, causing them to establish themselves in anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. In order to purify Buddha-lands, he constantly engaged in Buddha-work, teaching and transforming living beings."

"O bhikṣus, Pūrṇa was also foremost among those who expounded the Dharma under the seven Buddhas. Now, among those who expound the Dharma in my presence, he is also foremost. Among the Buddhas to come in the Bhadrakalpa, among those who expound the Dharma, he shall again be foremost, and he shall guard, maintain, assist, and proclaim the Buddhas' Dharma. Also in the future he shall guard, maintain, assist, and proclaim the Dharma of immeasurable, limitless Buddhas, teaching, transforming, and benefiting immeasurable living beings, causing them to establish themselves in anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. In order to purify Buddha-lands, he shall constantly and diligently strive to teach and transform living beings, gradually perfecting the Bodhisattva-Way. After immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas have passed, in this land he shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, and shall be called Dharmaprabhāsa Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna, Sugata, Lokavid, Anuttara, Puruṣa-damya-sārathi, Śāstā-deva-manuṣyāṇāṃ, Buddha, Bhagavat."

"That Buddha shall take trichiliocosms equal to Ganges' sands as a single Buddha-land. The ground shall be of seven jewels, level as the palm of one's hand, without mountains, hills, valleys, ravines, or gullies. Pavilions and towers of seven jewels shall fill it throughout. The heavenly palaces shall be situated near in empty space. Humans and devas shall intermingle, each able to see the other. There shall be no evil destinies, nor shall there be any women. All living beings shall be born through transformation, and there shall be no sexual desire. They shall attain great spiritual powers; their bodies shall emit light; they shall fly about freely. Their resolve and mindfulness shall be firm and solid, their vigor and wisdom universal. All shall be of golden hue, adorned with the thirty-two marks. The living beings of that land shall constantly take two kinds of food: first, the food of Dharma-joy; second, the food of meditative bliss. There shall be immeasurable asaṃkhyeya thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Bodhisattva multitudes who have attained great spiritual powers and the four unobstructed wisdoms, able skillfully to teach and transform the classes of living beings. The śrāvaka multitude, through calculation and reckoning, shall be beyond knowledge—all shall have completely attained the six supernatural powers, the three clear knowledges, and the eight liberations. That Buddha-land shall have such immeasurable meritorious adornments accomplished and perfected. The kalpa shall be named Ratnāvabhāsa, and the land shall be named Suviśuddhā. That Buddha's lifespan shall be immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas. The Dharma shall abide for an extremely long time. After the Buddha's extinction, jeweled stūpas of seven treasures shall arise, pervading throughout that land."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"O bhikṣus, listen with care:
The path practiced by the Buddha's sons,
Through skillful learning of expedient means,
Is inconceivable and beyond thought.

"Knowing that beings delight in lesser dharmas
And fear the great wisdom,
The Bodhisattvas therefore
Appear as śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas.

"Through immeasurable skillful means
They transform the various classes of living beings.
They themselves declare: 'We are śrāvakas,'
'We are very far from the Buddha-Way,'

"Yet they liberate immeasurable multitudes,
All causing them to attain accomplishment.
Though [beings may be] of small aspiration and lazy,
Gradually they shall be caused to become Buddhas.

"Inwardly concealing Bodhisattva practice,
Outwardly manifesting as śrāvakas,
With few desires, weary of birth-and-death,
They actually purify Buddha-lands.

"Showing the masses that they have the three poisons,
Also manifesting marks of wrong views—
My disciples are thus,
Through skillful means liberating living beings.

"If I were to fully expound
The various transformative manifestations,
Living beings hearing these things
Would harbor doubts and perplexity in their minds.

"This present Pūrṇa,
Under thousands of koṭis of Buddhas in the past,
Diligently cultivated the path he practiced,
Proclaiming and guarding the Dharma of all Buddhas.

"Seeking the supreme wisdom,
In the presence of all those Buddhas,
He manifested as foremost among disciples,
Learned and possessed of wisdom.

"His speech was without fear—
He could cause multitudes to rejoice.
Never once was he weary,
But assisted the Buddha's work.

"He has already crossed over through great spiritual powers,
Completely possesses the four unobstructed wisdoms,
Knows the keen and dull faculties of all,
And constantly expounds the pure Dharma.

"Elucidating such meanings,
Teaching thousands of koṭis of multitudes,
He causes them to abide in the Mahāyāna Dharma,
And himself purifies Buddha-lands.

"In the future he shall also make offerings
To immeasurable, innumerable Buddhas,
Guarding and assisting in proclaiming the True Dharma,
And also purifying his own Buddha-land.

"Constantly through various skillful means,
Fearlessly expounding the Dharma,
He shall liberate beings beyond calculation,
Accomplishing the wisdom of all modes.

"Making offerings to the Tathāgatas,
Guarding and maintaining the Dharma-treasure,
Afterward he shall attain Buddhahood,
With the name Dharmaprabhāsa.

"His land shall be named Suviśuddhā,
Composed of the seven jewels.
The kalpa shall be named Ratnāvabhāsa;
The Bodhisattva multitude shall be exceedingly numerous—

"Their number immeasurable koṭis,
All having crossed over through great spiritual powers,
威德力具足,
Filling that land.

"Śrāvakas shall also be innumerable,
With the three clear knowledges and eight liberations,
Having attained the four unobstructed wisdoms—
Such shall constitute the saṅgha.

"The living beings of that land—
Sexual desire shall all be severed;
Purely born through transformation,
With adorned bodies possessing the marks.

"The food of Dharma-joy and meditative bliss—
No other thought of food shall there be.
There shall be no women,
Nor any evil destinies.

"The bhikṣu Pūrṇa,
His merits all completely perfected,
Shall attain this pure land,
With its multitude of worthies and sages exceedingly numerous.

"Such immeasurable matters
I now only briefly expound."

At that time the twelve hundred arhats whose minds had attained freedom had this thought: "We are joyful and have attained what we never before attained! If the World-Honored One would individually bestow predictions upon each of us as upon the other great disciples, would this not also be most gratifying!" The Buddha, knowing the thoughts in the minds of these persons, addressed Mahākāśyapa: "These twelve hundred arhats—I shall now, in their presence, bestow predictions of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi upon them in sequence. Among this assembly, my great disciple, the bhikṣu Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya, shall make offerings to sixty-two thousand koṭis of Buddhas, and afterward shall attain Buddhahood with the name Samantaprabhāsa Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna, Sugata, Lokavid, Anuttara, Puruṣa-damya-sārathi, Śāstā-deva-manuṣyāṇāṃ, Buddha, Bhagavat. The five hundred arhats—Uruvilvā-Kāśyapa, Gayā-Kāśyapa, Nadī-Kāśyapa, Kālodāyin, Udāyin, Aniruddha, Revata, Kapphiṇa, Bakkula, Cunda, Svāgata, and others—all shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, all sharing the same name: Samantaprabhāsa."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"The bhikṣu Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya
Shall see immeasurable Buddhas.
After asaṃkhyeya kalpas have passed,
He shall accomplish perfect enlightenment.

"Constantly emitting great radiance,
Completely possessed of all spiritual powers,
His fame heard throughout the ten directions,
Revered by all—

"He shall constantly expound the supreme Way,
Therefore his name shall be Samantaprabhāsa.
His land shall be pure;
The Bodhisattvas all courageous—

"All ascending wondrous pavilions and towers,
Traveling throughout the lands of the ten directions,
With supreme offerings
They shall present them to all Buddhas.

"Having made these offerings,
Their minds filled with great joy,
In an instant they shall return to their original land—
Such shall be their spiritual power.

"The Buddha's lifespan: sixty thousand kalpas.
The True Dharma shall abide for twice that lifespan.
The Semblance Dharma shall again be twice that.
When the Dharma perishes, devas and humans shall grieve.

"Those five hundred bhikṣus
In sequence shall become Buddhas,
All with the name Samantaprabhāsa,
Receiving predictions one after another in turn:

"'After my extinction,
A certain one shall become Buddha.'
The world he transforms
Shall also be like mine today.

"The adornment and purity of his land,
And the various spiritual powers;
The multitudes of Bodhisattvas and śrāvakas,
The True Dharma and Semblance Dharma;

"The lifespan and number of kalpas—
All shall be as described above.
Kāśyapa, you already know
The five hundred who have attained freedom.

"The remaining śrāvaka multitude
Shall likewise be thus.
Those not present at this assembly—
You should proclaim this to them."

At that time the five hundred arhats, having received predictions before the Buddha, were joyful and exultant. Immediately they arose from their seats, proceeded to the Buddha's presence, bowed their heads at his feet, and repented, reproaching themselves: "World-Honored One, we constantly had this thought, considering ourselves to have already attained ultimate extinction. Now we understand that we were like those without wisdom. Why is this? We should have attained the Tathāgata's wisdom, yet we were satisfied with the lesser wisdom."

"World-Honored One, it is as if there were a man who went to the home of a close friend and, becoming drunk with wine, lay down to sleep. At that time the close friend, having official business requiring his departure, took a priceless jewel and sewed it into the lining of his garment, gave it to him, and departed. That man, being drunk and asleep, was completely unaware and unknowing. Having arisen, he wandered forth, traveling to another land. For the sake of clothing and food, he diligently sought and labored with great difficulty. If he obtained even a little, he was content with that. Later, his close friend happened to encounter him and said: 'Alas, good man! Why, for the sake of clothing and food, have you come to such a state? In the past I wished to cause you to attain peace and happiness, to indulge freely in the five desires. On such-and-such a year, month, and day, I sewed a priceless jewel into the lining of your garment—it is still there now. Yet you, not knowing this, toiled in worry and distress seeking to sustain your life. How extremely foolish! Now you may use this jewel to trade for what you need, and you may constantly have your wishes fulfilled, lacking and wanting nothing.'"

"The Buddha is also thus. When he was a Bodhisattva, he taught and transformed us, causing us to arouse the mind of the wisdom of all modes. Yet we soon thereafter forgot and abandoned it, neither knowing nor perceiving it. Having attained the path of the arhat, we considered ourselves to have attained extinction. [Finding] sustaining life difficult, we were satisfied with obtaining little. The vow for the wisdom of all modes was still there, not lost. Now the World-Honored One has awakened us, speaking these words: 'O bhikṣus, what you have attained is not ultimate extinction. I long ago caused you to plant wholesome Buddha-roots. Through skillful means I manifested the characteristics of nirvāṇa, yet you thought you had truly attained extinction.'"

"World-Honored One, now we understand that we are truly Bodhisattvas, having received the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. For this reason we are exceedingly joyful, having attained what we never before attained."

At that time Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya and the others, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"We have heard the supreme,
Peaceful sound of the bestowal of predictions,
Joyful as never before—
We bow to the Buddha of immeasurable wisdom.

"Now in the World-Honored One's presence
We repent our various faults:
Regarding the immeasurable Buddha-treasure,
We obtained but a small portion of nirvāṇa—

"Like foolish persons without wisdom,
We were satisfied with ourselves.
It is as if a poor person
Went to the home of a close friend—

"That home being extremely wealthy,
With all manner of delicacies laid out.
A priceless jewel
Was sewn into the lining of his inner garment.

"[The friend] silently gave it and departed;
[The poor man], lying asleep, was unaware.
When that person had already arisen,
He wandered forth, proceeding to another land.

"Seeking clothing and food to sustain himself,
His livelihood exceedingly difficult—
Obtaining even a little, he was satisfied,
No longer wishing for better.

"Unaware that in the lining of his inner garment
There was a priceless jewel,
The close friend who gave the jewel
Later saw this poor person.

"After sharply reproaching him,
He showed him the jewel that had been sewn in.
The poor person, seeing this jewel,
Had great joy arise in his mind—

"Wealthy with all manner of goods,
Indulging freely in the five desires.
We are also thus:
The World-Honored One, throughout the long night,

"Constantly with compassion taught and transformed us,
Causing us to plant the supreme vow.
Because we were without wisdom,
We neither perceived nor knew—

"Obtaining a small portion of nirvāṇa,
We were self-satisfied and sought nothing further.
Now the Buddha has awakened us,
Saying: 'This is not true extinction.

"'When you attain the Buddha's supreme wisdom,
Then will that be true extinction.'
Now, hearing from the Buddha
The predictions and their solemn adornments,

"And receiving predictions one after another in succession,
Our bodies and minds are everywhere filled with joy."


CHAPTER NINE: PREDICTION FOR THOSE LEARNING AND BEYOND LEARNING

At that time Ānanda and Rāhula had this thought: "We often reflected to ourselves: if we could receive predictions, would this not also be most gratifying!" Immediately they arose from their seats, proceeded to the Buddha's presence, bowed their heads at his feet, and together addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, regarding this we also should have a share. There is only the Tathāgata to whom we belong and take refuge. Moreover, we are recognized and known by all in the world—devas, humans, and asuras. Ānanda has constantly served as attendant, guarding and maintaining the Dharma-treasury. Rāhula is the Buddha's son. If the Buddha would bestow upon us the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, our vows would be fulfilled and the expectations of the multitude would also be satisfied."

At that time the two thousand śrāvaka disciples—those learning and those beyond learning—all arose from their seats, bared their right shoulders, proceeded to the Buddha's presence, single-mindedly joined their palms, and gazed up at the World-Honored One. Like Ānanda and Rāhula, they cherished the same wish, and stood to one side. At that time the Buddha addressed Ānanda: "In a future age you shall attain Buddhahood with the name Sāgaravaradhara-buddhi-vikrīḍitābhijña Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna, Sugata, Lokavid, Anuttara, Puruṣa-damya-sārathi, Śāstā-deva-manuṣyāṇāṃ, Buddha, Bhagavat. You shall make offerings to sixty-two koṭis of Buddhas, guard and maintain the Dharma-treasury, and afterward attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. You shall teach and transform twenty thousand myriads of koṭis of Ganges' sands of Bodhisattvas, causing them to accomplish anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Your land shall be named Sadāparibhūta-patadraja-pratyutthita. That land shall be pure, with lapis lazuli for its ground. The kalpa shall be named Manojñasvara-ghoṣa-abhigarjita. That Buddha's lifespan shall be immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya kalpas. If a person, through thousands of myriads of koṭis of immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, were to calculate and reckon, he could not come to know it. The True Dharma shall abide in the world for twice that lifespan. The Semblance Dharma shall abide in the world for twice the True Dharma. Ānanda, this Sāgaravaradhara-buddhi-vikrīḍitābhijña Buddha shall be jointly praised by immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of Ganges' sands and more of Buddhas, Tathāgatas throughout the ten directions, who shall proclaim his meritorious virtues."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"I now proclaim in the midst of the saṅgha:
Ānanda, the upholder of the Dharma,
Shall make offerings to all Buddhas,
And afterward accomplish perfect enlightenment.

"His name shall be Sāgaravaradhara-buddhi
Vikrīḍitābhijña Buddha.
His land shall be pure,
Named Sadāparibhūta-patadraja-pratyutthita.

"He shall teach and transform Bodhisattvas
In number like Ganges' sands.
The Buddha shall possess great majesty and virtue;
His fame shall fill the ten directions.

"His lifespan shall be without measure,
Through compassion for living beings.
The True Dharma shall be twice his lifespan;
The Semblance Dharma shall again be twice that.

"Living beings equal to Ganges' sands,
Immeasurable in number,
Within this Buddha's Dharma
Shall plant causes and conditions for the Buddha-Way."

At that time the eight thousand newly-aspiring Bodhisattvas in the assembly all had this thought: "We have not even heard of the great Bodhisattvas receiving such predictions. For what causes and conditions have these śrāvakas received such predictions?"

At that time the World-Honored One, knowing the thoughts in the minds of those Bodhisattvas, addressed them, saying: "Good sons, Ānanda and I, in the presence of the Buddha Bhīṣmagarjita-svara-rāja, at the same time aroused the mind of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Ānanda constantly delighted in much learning; I constantly applied vigorous energy. Therefore I have already accomplished anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, while Ānanda guards and maintains my Dharma, and also guards and maintains the Dharma-treasury of Buddhas yet to come, teaching, transforming, and perfecting the multitudes of Bodhisattvas. Such was his original vow, and therefore he has obtained this prediction."

When Ānanda, before the Buddha, personally heard his prediction and the adornments of his land, his vows were completely fulfilled. His mind was greatly joyful; he attained what he had never before attained. Immediately he recalled the Dharma-treasuries of past immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, penetrating them without obstruction, as if what he now heard. He also recognized his original vow. At that time Ānanda spoke in verse:

"The World-Honored One is exceedingly rare,
Causing me to recall the past,
The Dharma of immeasurable Buddhas,
As if what I hear today.

"I now have no further doubts,
Peacefully abiding in the Buddha-Way—
Expediently serving as attendant,
Guarding and maintaining the Dharma of all Buddhas."

At that time the Buddha addressed Rāhula: "In a future age you shall attain Buddhahood with the name Saptaratnapadmavikrānta-gāmin Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna, Sugata, Lokavid, Anuttara, Puruṣa-damya-sārathi, Śāstā-deva-manuṣyāṇāṃ, Buddha, Bhagavat. You shall make offerings to Buddhas, Tathāgatas equal in number to the atoms of ten world-systems, constantly being the eldest son of those Buddhas, just as you are now. The adornments of the land of this Saptaratnapadmavikrānta-gāmin Buddha, the number of kalpas in his lifespan, the disciples he transforms, the True Dharma, and the Semblance Dharma shall also be no different from those of Sāgaravaradhara-buddhi-vikrīḍitābhijña Tathāgata. He shall also be the eldest son of that Buddha. After this has passed, he shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"When I was crown prince,
Rāhula was my eldest son.
Now I have accomplished the Buddha-Way;
He receives the Dharma as a Dharma-son.

"In a future age,
He shall see immeasurable koṭis of Buddhas,
Being the eldest son of them all,
Single-mindedly seeking the Buddha-Way.

"Rāhula's secret practice—
Only I am able to know it.
He manifests as my eldest son,
Showing this to living beings.

"Immeasurable koṭis, thousands, and myriads
Of merits beyond calculation—
He peacefully abides in the Buddha's Dharma,
Seeking the supreme Way."

At that time the World-Honored One, seeing the two thousand—those learning and those beyond learning—whose minds were gentle and soft, tranquil and pure, single-mindedly gazing at the Buddha, addressed Ānanda: "Do you see these two thousand—those learning and those beyond learning?" "Yes, I have already seen them." "Ānanda, these persons shall make offerings to Buddhas, Tathāgatas equal in number to the atoms of fifty world-systems, revering and honoring them, guarding and maintaining the Dharma-treasury. Ultimately, at the same time, throughout the lands of the ten directions, they shall each accomplish Buddhahood, all sharing the same name: Ratnacandrābha Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna, Sugata, Lokavid, Anuttara, Puruṣa-damya-sārathi, Śāstā-deva-manuṣyāṇāṃ, Buddha, Bhagavat. Their lifespans shall be one kalpa. The adornments of their lands, the śrāvakas and Bodhisattvas, the True Dharma and Semblance Dharma—all shall be completely equal."

At that time the World-Honored One, restating this meaning, spoke in verse:

"These two thousand śrāvakas
Now standing before me—
To all of them I bestow predictions:
In the future they shall become Buddhas.

"The Buddhas to whom they make offerings,
As described above in number of atoms,
After guarding and maintaining those Dharma-treasuries,
Afterward they shall accomplish perfect enlightenment.

"Each throughout the lands of the ten directions,
All sharing the same name,
Simultaneously sitting in the places of enlightenment,
Realizing the supreme wisdom—

"All being named Ratnacandrābha.
Their lands and disciples,
The True Dharma and Semblance Dharma,
All equal without difference.

"All through various spiritual powers
Liberating beings throughout the ten directions,
Their fame universally pervading everywhere,
Gradually entering nirvāṇa."

At that time the two thousand—those learning and those beyond learning—hearing the Buddha bestow predictions, were joyful and exultant, and spoke in verse:

"World-Honored One, lamp of wisdom bright—
We have heard the sound of the bestowal of predictions;
Our minds are filled with joy,
As if sprinkled with sweet dew."


CHAPTER TEN: THE DHARMA TEACHER

At that time the World-Honored One, through Medicine King Bodhisattva, addressed the eighty thousand great beings: "Medicine King, do you see in this great assembly the immeasurable devas, dragon kings, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans, as well as bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās—those seeking to be śrāvakas, those seeking to be Pratyekabuddhas, and those seeking the Buddha-Way? All such classes as these, in the Buddha's presence, hearing even a single verse or a single phrase of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra, or even having a single thought of rejoicing—to all of them I bestow predictions that they shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

The Buddha addressed Medicine King: "Moreover, after the Tathāgata's extinction, if there are persons who hear even a single verse or a single phrase of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra and have a single thought of rejoicing, I also bestow upon them the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. If furthermore there are persons who accept, uphold, read, recite, explain, or transcribe the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra—even a single verse—and toward this sutra roll regard it with reverence as they would the Buddha, making various offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners, garments, and music, and even joining their palms in reverence—Medicine King, you should know that such persons have already made offerings to hundreds of thousands of koṭis of Buddhas, and in the presence of all Buddhas have perfected great vows. Out of compassion for living beings, they are born in this human realm."

"Medicine King, if someone asks, 'What living beings in a future age shall be able to become Buddhas?'—one should show them that these persons in the future age shall certainly become Buddhas. Why is this? If good sons or good daughters, regarding the Dharma Lotus Sutra—even a single phrase—accept, uphold, read, recite, explain, or transcribe it, and make various offerings to the sutra roll with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners, garments, and music, joining their palms in reverence—such persons are worthy of being gazed upon with reverence by the entire world, and should be made offerings to with Tathāgata offerings. You should know that such persons are great Bodhisattvas who have accomplished anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Out of compassion for living beings, they have vowed to be born here to broadly expound and discriminate the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra. How much more so those who can completely accept, uphold, and make various offerings to it!"

"Medicine King, you should know that such persons have relinquished their pure karmic rewards, and after my extinction, out of compassion for living beings, have been born in this evil world to broadly expound this sutra. If such good sons or good daughters, after my extinction, are able secretly to expound the Dharma Lotus Sutra to even one person—even a single phrase—you should know that such persons are envoys of the Tathāgata, dispatched by the Tathāgata to carry out the Tathāgata's work. How much more so those who in the midst of great assemblies broadly expound it for people!"

"Medicine King, if there are evil persons who, with unwholesome minds, for an entire kalpa manifest themselves before the Buddha constantly reviling the Buddha, their offense would still be light. But if a person uses even a single evil word to slander lay or monastic persons who read and recite the Dharma Lotus Sutra, that offense is extremely grave."

"Medicine King, those who read and recite the Dharma Lotus Sutra—you should know that such persons adorn themselves with the Buddha's adornments, and are borne upon the Tathāgata's shoulders. Wherever they go, one should turn toward them and bow, single-mindedly joining palms in reverence and making offerings, honoring and praising them, with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners, garments, and delicacies, performing various kinds of music—the supreme offerings of the human realm should be offered to them. Heavenly treasures should be scattered upon them; heavenly jeweled accumulations should be presented as offerings. Why is this? Because such persons joyfully expound the Dharma, and if one hears it even briefly, one immediately attains ultimate anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If one wishes to abide in the Buddha-Way
And accomplish spontaneous wisdom,
One should constantly diligently make offerings
To those who accept and uphold the Dharma Lotus.

"Those who wish swiftly to attain
The wisdom of all modes
Should accept and uphold this sutra,
And also make offerings to those who uphold it.

"If there are those able to accept and uphold
The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra,
Know that they are the Buddha's envoys,
Compassionately mindful of all living beings.

"All those able to accept and uphold
The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra
Have abandoned pure lands—
Out of compassion for beings, they are born here.

"You should know that such persons
Are free in where they vow to be born,
Able in this evil world
To broadly expound the supreme Dharma.

"One should with heavenly flowers and incense,
And heavenly jeweled garments,
Heavenly wondrous jeweled accumulations,
Make offerings to those who expound the Dharma.

"In the evil world after my extinction,
Those able to uphold this sutra—
One should join palms and bow in reverence,
As in making offerings to the World-Honored One.

"Supreme delicacies and sweet offerings,
And various kinds of garments—
Make offerings to this Buddha-son,
Hoping to hear even briefly.

"If in a later age
One is able to accept and uphold this sutra,
I send him among humans
To carry out the Tathāgata's work.

"If throughout an entire kalpa
One constantly harbors an unwholesome mind,
Makes angry faces and reviles the Buddha,
One incurs immeasurable grave offenses.

"But those who read, recite, and uphold
This Dharma Lotus Sutra—
If one briefly speaks an evil word against them,
That offense far exceeds the former.

"If someone seeks the Buddha-Way
And throughout an entire kalpa,
Joins palms before me
And praises me with immeasurable verses,

"Through thus praising the Buddha,
One gains immeasurable merit.
But one who praises those who uphold the sutra—
That merit far exceeds the former.

"Throughout eighty koṭi kalpas,
With the most wondrous forms, sounds,
And also scents, tastes, and tangibles,
One makes offerings to those who uphold the sutra.

"Having made such offerings,
If one is able to hear even briefly,
One should then rejoice in oneself:
'I now have gained great benefit!'

"Medicine King, I now inform you:
Of all the sutras I have expounded,
Among these sutras,
The Dharma Lotus is foremost."

At that time the Buddha again addressed Medicine King Bodhisattva-mahāsattva: "The sutras I have expounded are immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis. Those already expounded, now being expounded, and to be expounded in the future—among all of them, this Dharma Lotus Sutra is the most difficult to believe and difficult to understand. Medicine King, this sutra is the secret essential treasury of all Buddhas. It must not be distributed or recklessly transmitted to people. It is guarded and protected by all Buddhas, World-Honored Ones. From ancient times until now, it has never been clearly expounded. Moreover, this sutra, even while the Tathāgata is present, arouses much resentment and jealousy—how much more so after his extinction!"

"Medicine King, you should know that after the Tathāgata's extinction, those able to transcribe, uphold, read, recite, make offerings to, and expound it for others—the Tathāgata shall cover them with his robe, and they shall also be protected and kept in mind by Buddhas of other regions who are presently abiding. Such persons possess great power of faith, power of aspiration, and power of wholesome roots. You should know that such persons dwell together with the Tathāgata, and the Tathāgata places his hand upon their heads."

"Medicine King, in whatever place—whether one expounds, reads, recites, or transcribes it, or wherever the sutra roll abides—one should erect a stūpa of the seven jewels, making it extremely lofty, vast, and magnificently adorned. There is no need to further enshrine relics within it. Why is this? Within it there already exists the Tathāgata's complete body. This stūpa should be made offerings to, revered, honored, and praised with all manner of flowers, incense, necklaces, silk canopies, banners, music, and songs. If people are able to see this stūpa, bow in worship, and make offerings, you should know that all such persons draw near to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

"Medicine King, many persons—whether lay or monastic—practice the Bodhisattva-Way. If they are unable to see, hear, read, recite, transcribe, uphold, or make offerings to this Dharma Lotus Sutra, you should know that such persons have not yet skillfully practiced the Bodhisattva-Way. If there are those who are able to hear this sutra, then they are able skillfully to practice the Bodhisattva-Way. Those living beings who seek the Buddha-Way—if they see or hear this Dharma Lotus Sutra, and having heard it believe, understand, and accept it—you should know that such persons draw near to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

"Medicine King, suppose there were a person thirsty and in need of water who, on a high plateau, dug seeking it. While still seeing dry earth, he would know the water was still far away. But applying effort without cease, progressively seeing moist earth and then gradually reaching mud, his mind would be resolute and certain, knowing water must be near. Bodhisattvas are also thus. If they have not heard, not understood, and are not able to cultivate and practice this Dharma Lotus Sutra, you should know that such persons are still far from anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. If they are able to hear, understand, reflect upon, and cultivate it, you must know they certainly draw near to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Why is this? All Bodhisattvas' anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi belongs to this sutra. This sutra opens the door of skillful means and reveals the characteristic of true reality. This Dharma Lotus treasury is profound, solid, secluded, and far-reaching—none can reach it. Now the Buddha teaches, transforms, and perfects Bodhisattvas, opening and revealing it for them."

"Medicine King, if there are Bodhisattvas who, upon hearing this Dharma Lotus Sutra, are startled, doubtful, and fearful, you should know they are newly-aspiring Bodhisattvas. If śrāvakas, upon hearing this sutra, are startled, doubtful, and fearful, you should know they are persons of overweening pride. Medicine King, if there are good sons or good daughters who, after the Tathāgata's extinction, wish to expound this Dharma Lotus Sutra for the fourfold assembly, how should they expound it? Such good sons or good daughters should enter the Tathāgata's chamber, wear the Tathāgata's robe, and sit upon the Tathāgata's seat—only then should they broadly expound this sutra for the fourfold assembly. The Tathāgata's chamber is the mind of great compassion among all living beings. The Tathāgata's robe is the mind of gentleness and patient endurance. The Tathāgata's seat is the emptiness of all dharmas. Peacefully abiding in these, and then with a mind free from indolence, one should broadly expound this Dharma Lotus Sutra for Bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly."

"Medicine King, in other lands I send conjured persons to gather audiences to hear the Dharma for them. I also send conjured bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās to listen to the Dharma exposition. These conjured persons, hearing the Dharma, believe, accept, and comply with it without opposition. If the Dharma teacher is in a secluded place, I at that time broadly send devas, dragons, spirits and gods, gandharvas, asuras, and others to listen to the Dharma exposition. Though I may be in another land, I from time to time cause the Dharma teacher to see my body. If regarding this sutra he forgets lines and verses, I then again expound it for him, causing him to be complete."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"One who wishes to cast aside all indolence
Should listen to this sutra—
This sutra is difficult to hear,
And believers and accepters are also rare.

"It is like a person thirsty and needing water,
Who digs seeking it on a high plateau.
While still seeing dry and parched earth,
He knows he is still far from water.

"Progressively seeing moist earth and mud,
He is resolute in knowing water is near.
Medicine King, you should know:
All such persons as these,

"Not hearing the Dharma Lotus Sutra,
Are very far from the Buddha's wisdom.
If they hear this profound sutra—
Which determines and clarifies the śrāvaka Dharma,

"This king of all sutras—
Having heard it, they reflect carefully,
You should know that such persons
Draw near to the Buddha's wisdom.

"If a person expounds this sutra,
He should enter the Tathāgata's chamber,
Wear the Tathāgata's robe,
And sit upon the Tathāgata's seat.

"Fearless when among the multitude,
He broadly discriminates and expounds.
Great compassion is the chamber;
Gentleness and patient endurance, the robe;

"The emptiness of all dharmas, the seat—
Abiding in this, he expounds the Dharma.
If when this sutra is being expounded
Someone speaks evil words or curses,

"Or adds swords, staves, tiles, or stones—
Mindful of the Buddha, one should endure.
Throughout thousands of myriads of koṭis of lands,
I manifest my pure, solid body.

"Throughout immeasurable koṭi kalpas,
I expound the Dharma for living beings.
If after my extinction
One is able to expound this sutra,

"I send conjured fourfold assemblies—
Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs,
And pure laymen and laywomen—
To make offerings to the Dharma teacher.

"Leading and guiding all living beings,
Gathering them to cause them to hear the Dharma.
If persons wish to add harm—
With swords, staves, tiles, and stones—

"I then send conjured persons
To serve as their guards and protectors.
If the Dharma teacher
Is alone in a secluded place,

"In solitude without human voices,
Reading and reciting this sutra,
I at that time manifest for him
A pure, luminous body.

"If he forgets passages or phrases,
I expound them for him, causing him to be proficient.
If a person possesses these virtues,
Whether expounding for the fourfold assembly

"Or in a secluded place reading and reciting the sutra,
All shall be able to see my body.
If a person is in a secluded place,
I send the dragon kings of the heavens,

"Yakṣas, spirits and gods, and others
To form an audience to hear the Dharma.
Such persons delight in expounding the Dharma,
Discriminating without impediment.

"Because all Buddhas protect and keep them in mind,
They are able to cause great assemblies to rejoice.
If one draws near to Dharma teachers,
One swiftly attains the Bodhisattva-Way.

"By following and learning from such teachers,
One shall see Buddhas numerous as Ganges' sands."


CHAPTER 11: THE APPEARANCE OF THE JEWELED STŪPA

At that time before the Buddha there was a stūpa of the seven jewels, five hundred yojanas in height and two hundred and fifty yojanas in width and depth, which arose from the earth and abided in empty space. It was adorned with various precious things. Five thousand railings, ten million niches and chambers, and innumerable banners and pennants served as magnificent decorations. Hanging jeweled necklaces and myriads of koṭis of precious bells were suspended from it. From its four sides wafted forth the fragrance of tamālapattra and sandalwood, pervading the entire world. Its various banners and canopies were composed of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, true pearls, and rose quartz—the seven jewels combined together—reaching up to the palaces of the Four Heavenly Kings. The thirty-three devas rained down heavenly mandārava flowers as offerings to the jeweled stūpa. The remaining devas, dragons, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and others—thousands of myriads of koṭis of multitudes—made offerings to the jeweled stūpa with all manner of flowers, incense, necklaces, banners, canopies, and music, revering, honoring, and praising it.

At that time from within the jeweled stūpa there issued forth a great sound, proclaiming in praise: "Excellent! Excellent! Śākyamuni, World-Honored One, you are able to teach the Bodhisattvas with the Dharma of great and equal wisdom, the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra treasured by all Buddhas, and to expound it for the great assembly. It is so! It is so! Śākyamuni, World-Honored One—all that you have expounded is entirely true!" At that time the fourfold assembly, seeing the great jeweled stūpa abiding in empty space and also hearing the sound issuing forth from within the stūpa, all attained Dharma-joy and marveled at what they had never before experienced. They arose from their seats, reverently joined their palms, and withdrew to stand to one side.

At that time there was a Bodhisattva-mahāsattva named Mahāpratibhāna who, knowing the doubts in the minds of all in the world—devas, humans, asuras, and others—addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, through what causes and conditions does this jeweled stūpa arise from the earth, and also from within it issue forth this sound?" At that time the Buddha addressed Mahāpratibhāna Bodhisattva: "Within this jeweled stūpa there is the complete body of a Tathāgata. Long ago, in the eastern direction, passing through immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya worlds, there was a land named Ratnaviśuddhā. In it there was a Buddha named Prabhūtaratna. When that Buddha was practicing the Bodhisattva-Way, he made a great vow: 'If, after I accomplish Buddhahood and become extinct, throughout the lands of the ten directions wherever the Dharma Lotus Sutra is expounded, my stūpa-shrine, in order to hear that sutra, shall surge forth and appear before it to bear witness, praising and saying: Excellent!'"

"After that Buddha accomplished the Way, when approaching extinction, in the midst of the great assembly of devas and humans, he addressed the bhikṣus: 'After my extinction, those who wish to make offerings to my complete body should erect a great stūpa.' Through that Buddha's spiritual powers and the power of his vow, throughout the worlds of the ten directions, in every place wherever someone expounds the Dharma Lotus Sutra, that jeweled stūpa surges forth and appears before him, with the complete body present within the stūpa, praising and saying: 'Excellent! Excellent!'"

"Mahāpratibhāna, now the stūpa of Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata, having heard the Dharma Lotus Sutra being expounded, has surged forth from the earth, praising and saying: 'Excellent! Excellent!'"

At that time Mahāpratibhāna Bodhisattva, through the Tathāgata's spiritual power, addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we wish to see the body of this Buddha." The Buddha addressed Mahāpratibhāna Bodhisattva-mahāsattva: "This Prabhūtaratna Buddha has a profound and weighty vow: 'If my jeweled stūpa, in order to hear the Dharma Lotus Sutra, appears before all Buddhas, and if there are those who wish to show my body to the fourfold assembly, then the division-bodies of that Buddha who are throughout the worlds of the ten directions expounding the Dharma must all return and assemble in one place—only then will my body manifest.'"

"Mahāpratibhāna, my division-bodies—those Buddhas who are throughout the worlds of the ten directions expounding the Dharma—should now assemble."

Mahāpratibhāna addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we also wish to see the World-Honored One's division-body Buddhas, to bow in worship and make offerings to them." At that time the Buddha emitted a single ray of light from his white tuft of hair. Immediately there were seen, in the eastern direction, five hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges' sands of lands, all those Buddhas. Those lands were all paved with lapis lazuli, adorned with jeweled trees and jeweled garments, filled throughout with immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of Bodhisattvas. Jeweled canopies were spread everywhere, and jeweled nets covered above. The Buddhas of those lands were expounding the various dharmas with great and wondrous sounds, and immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of Bodhisattvas were seen, pervading all those lands, expounding the Dharma for the multitudes. The southern, western, and northern directions, the four intermediate quarters, and above and below—wherever the light of the white tuft mark shone—all were likewise thus.

At that time all the Buddhas of the ten directions each addressed the multitudes of Bodhisattvas, saying: "Good sons, we should now proceed to the Sahā world, to Śākyamuni Buddha, and also make offerings to the jeweled stūpa of Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata." Thereupon the Sahā world immediately transformed into purity—the ground became lapis lazuli; it was adorned with jeweled trees; golden cords marked the eight paths. There were no villages, towns, cities, oceans, rivers, mountains, streams, or forests. Great jeweled incense was burned; mandārava flowers were strewn everywhere upon the ground. Jeweled nets and canopies covered above; precious bells were suspended. Only the assembly present was retained—the devas and humans were moved and placed in other lands. At that time all the Buddhas each brought one great Bodhisattva to serve as attendant, and arrived in the Sahā world, each proceeding to the base of a jeweled tree. Each jeweled tree was five hundred yojanas in height, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits magnificently adorned in sequence. Beneath all the jeweled trees there were lion-thrones, five yojanas in height, also magnificently decorated with great jewels. At that time all the Buddhas each sat in full lotus posture upon these thrones. Thus extending in succession, they filled the entire trichiliocosm. Yet the division-bodies from even one direction of Śākyamuni Buddha were still not all accommodated.

At that time Śākyamuni Buddha, wishing to accommodate his division-body Buddhas, in each of the eight directions again transformed two hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of lands, causing them all to be pure, without hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras. He also moved the devas and humans and placed them in other lands. The transformed lands were also paved with lapis lazuli and adorned with jeweled trees. The trees were five hundred yojanas in height, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits magnificently decorated in sequence. Beneath the trees there were jeweled lion-thrones, five yojanas in height, magnificently adorned with various jewels. There were also no great oceans, rivers, or Mount Mucilinda, Mahā-Mucilinda, the Iron Ring Mountains, the Great Iron Ring Mountains, Mount Sumeru, and other mountain kings. All were united as one Buddha-land. The jeweled ground was level and even; jeweled terraced canopies covered it throughout; banners and canopies were suspended; great jeweled incense was burned; heavenly jeweled flowers were strewn everywhere upon the ground.

Śākyamuni Buddha, in order that the Buddhas who were to come might have places to sit, again in each of the eight directions transformed two hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of lands, causing them all to be pure, without hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras. He also moved the devas and humans and placed them in other lands. The transformed lands were also paved with lapis lazuli and adorned with jeweled trees. The trees were five hundred yojanas in height, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits magnificently adorned in sequence. Beneath the trees there were jeweled lion-thrones, five yojanas in height, also magnificently decorated with great jewels. There were also no great oceans, rivers, or Mount Mucilinda, Mahā-Mucilinda, the Iron Ring Mountains, the Great Iron Ring Mountains, Mount Sumeru, and other mountain kings. All were united as one Buddha-land. The jeweled ground was level and even; jeweled terraced canopies covered it throughout; banners and canopies were suspended; great jeweled incense was burned; heavenly jeweled flowers were strewn everywhere upon the ground.

At that time the division-bodies of Śākyamuni Buddha from the eastern direction—from lands of hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges' sands—all those Buddhas each expounding the Dharma, came and assembled here. In this manner in sequence, all the Buddhas of the ten directions all came and assembled, sitting in the eight directions. At that time in each direction, the Buddhas, Tathāgatas of four hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of lands, pervaded and filled that entire space. At that time all those Buddhas each sat beneath a jeweled tree upon a lion-throne, and all sent attendants to inquire after Śākyamuni Buddha, each bearing handfuls of jeweled flowers and addressing them thus:

"Good son, you should proceed to Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa, to Śākyamuni Buddha, and convey our words thus: 'Are you free from illness and affliction? Are your strength and vitality peaceful and joyful? Are the Bodhisattvas and the śrāvaka multitude all peaceful and secure?' Scatter these jeweled flowers before the Buddha as an offering, and speak these words: 'That certain Buddha wishes to open this jeweled stūpa.'" All the Buddhas' dispatched envoys were likewise thus.

At that time Śākyamuni Buddha, seeing that his division-body Buddhas had all already come and assembled, each sitting upon a lion-throne, and hearing that all the Buddhas expressed the wish jointly to open the jeweled stūpa, immediately arose from his seat and abided in empty space. The entire fourfold assembly arose and stood, joining their palms, single-mindedly gazing at the Buddha. Thereupon Śākyamuni Buddha with his right finger opened the door of the seven-jeweled stūpa, issuing forth a great sound like removing a crossbar and opening the gate of a great city. Immediately the entire assembly all saw Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata within the jeweled stūpa, sitting upon a lion-throne, his complete body undispersed, as if he had entered meditative concentration. They also heard him speak these words: "Excellent! Excellent! Śākyamuni Buddha, you have well expounded this Dharma Lotus Sutra. I have come here in order to hear this sutra." At that time the fourfold assembly and others, seeing the Buddha who had become extinct immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas in the past speaking such words, praised this as unprecedented, and scattered accumulations of heavenly jeweled flowers upon Prabhūtaratna Buddha and Śākyamuni Buddha.

At that time Prabhūtaratna Buddha, within the jeweled stūpa, divided his seat in half and offered it to Śākyamuni Buddha, speaking these words: "Śākyamuni Buddha, take this seat." Immediately Śākyamuni Buddha entered that stūpa, sat upon half the seat, and sat in full lotus posture. At that time the great assembly, seeing the two Tathāgatas upon the lion-throne within the seven-jeweled stūpa sitting in full lotus posture, each had this thought: "The Buddha's seat is lofty and far away. We pray the Tathāgata, through his spiritual powers, may cause all of us to abide together in empty space." Immediately Śākyamuni Buddha, through his spiritual powers, received all the great assembly into empty space. With a great voice he universally addressed the fourfold assembly: "Who is able broadly to expound the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra in this Sahā world? Now is precisely the time. The Tathāgata will soon enter nirvāṇa. The Buddha wishes to entrust this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra to someone."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"The holy lord, the World-Honored One,
Though long extinct,
Within the jeweled stūpa
Still comes for the sake of the Dharma.

"How can people
Not strive diligently for the Dharma?
This Buddha became extinct
Immeasurable countless kalpas ago,

"Yet in place after place he hears the Dharma,
Because it is difficult to encounter.
That Buddha's original vow was:
'After my extinction,

"'Wherever I go,
It shall constantly be to hear the Dharma.'
Moreover my division-bodies—
Immeasurable Buddhas

"Numerous as Ganges' sands—
Come wishing to hear the Dharma,
And to see the extinct
Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata.

"Each abandoning their wondrous lands,
And their multitudes of disciples,
The devas, humans, dragons, spirits,
And all manner of offerings,

"In order to cause the Dharma to abide long,
They have come here.
To provide seats for all the Buddhas,
Through spiritual powers

"They have moved immeasurable multitudes,
Causing the lands to be pure.
Each Buddha, one by one,
Proceeds beneath jeweled trees—

"Like pure ponds
Adorned with lotus flowers.
Beneath those jeweled trees,
Upon all the lion-thrones,

"The Buddhas sit upon them,
Magnificently adorned with radiance—
Like in the darkness of night
Great torches are kindled.

"Their bodies emit wondrous fragrances
Pervading lands in the ten directions.
Living beings, receiving this perfume,
Rejoice beyond self-control—

"Like a great wind
Blowing small tree branches.
Through this skillful means
They cause the Dharma to abide long.

"I address the great assembly:
After my extinction,
Who is able to guard, uphold,
Read, and expound this sutra?

"Now before the Buddha
Let them speak their vow.
Though Prabhūtaratna Buddha
Was long extinct,

"Through his great vow
He roars the lion's roar.
Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata
And also my own body,

"And all the assembled emanation Buddhas—
You should understand this meaning.
All you Buddha-sons:
Who is able to guard the Dharma?

"One should arouse the great vow,
Causing it to abide long.
Those who are able to guard
This sutra Dharma

"Thereby make offerings
To me and to Prabhūtaratna.
This Prabhūtaratna Buddha,
Abiding in the jeweled stūpa,

"Constantly traveling throughout the ten directions
For the sake of this sutra—
One also thereby makes offerings
To all the emanation Buddhas who have come,

"Magnificently adorning with radiance
All these worlds.
If one expounds this sutra,
One thereby sees me,

"Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata,
And all the emanation Buddhas.
All you good sons,
Each reflect carefully:

"This is a difficult matter—
One should arouse the great vow.
The remaining sutras
Numerous as Ganges' sands—

"Though one expounds all these,
It is still not sufficient to be considered difficult.
If one were to grasp Mount Sumeru
And hurl it to another region,

"To immeasurable Buddha-lands,
This also would not be difficult.
If with the toe of one's foot
One were to move the great trichiliocosm,

"Casting it far to another land,
This also would not be difficult.
If one were to stand at the summit of existence
And for the multitude expound

"Immeasurable remaining sutras,
This also would not be difficult.
But if after the Buddha's extinction,
In an evil age,

"One is able to expound this sutra—
This, then, is difficult.
Suppose there were a person
Who grasped empty space in his hand

"And traveled about with it—
This also would not be difficult.
After my extinction,
If one oneself transcribes and upholds it,

"Or causes another to transcribe it—
This, then, is difficult.
If one were to take the great earth
And place it upon a toenail,

"Ascending to the Brahma heaven,
This also would not be difficult.
After the Buddha's extinction,
In an evil age,

"Briefly to read this sutra—
This, then, is difficult.
Suppose when the kalpa burns,
One bears a load of dry grass,

"Enters into it without being burned—
This also would not be difficult.
After my extinction,
If one upholds this sutra

"And expounds it for even one person—
This, then, is difficult.
If one were to uphold the eighty thousand
Four thousand Dharma treasuries,

"The twelve divisions of sutras,
Expounding them for people,
Causing all the listeners
To attain the six spiritual powers—

"Though one could do thus,
It would still not be difficult.
After my extinction,
To listen to and receive this sutra,

"Inquiring into its meaning and purport—
This, then, is difficult.
If a person expounds the Dharma,
Causing thousands of myriads of koṭis,

"Immeasurable, innumerable
Multitudes numerous as Ganges' sands
To attain arhatship,
Complete with the six spiritual powers—

"Though there be such benefit,
This also would not be difficult.
After my extinction,
If one is able reverently to uphold

"Such a sutra as this—
This, then, is difficult.
For the sake of the Buddha-Way,
Throughout immeasurable lands,

"From the beginning until now,
I have broadly expounded various sutras—
Yet among all of them,
This sutra is foremost.

"If one is able to uphold it,
One thereby upholds the Buddha's body.
All you good sons,
After my extinction,

"Who is able to receive, uphold,
And read and recite this sutra?
Now before the Buddha
Let them speak their vow.

"This sutra is difficult to uphold;
If one upholds it even briefly,
I shall then rejoice,
And all Buddhas likewise.

"Such a person as this
Is praised by all Buddhas.
This is valor;
This is vigor.

"This is called upholding the precepts,
Practicing the dhūta austerities.
One thereby swiftly attains
The supreme Buddha-Way.

"One who in a future age
Is able to read and uphold this sutra
Is a true Buddha-son,
Abiding in the ground of pure goodness.

"After the Buddha's extinction,
One able to understand its meaning
Is the eye
Of the devas, humans, and world.

"In a frightening world,
To be able to expound even briefly—
All devas and humans
Should make offerings."


CHAPTER TWELVE: DEVADATTA

At that time, the Buddha addressed all the bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly of devas and humans, saying: "In past kalpas immeasurable, I sought the Lotus Sutra without slackening or wearying. Throughout many kalpas I constantly served as a king, making vows to seek the unsurpassed bodhi, my mind never retreating or turning back. Wishing to fulfill the six pāramitās, I diligently practiced giving, my mind without stinginess—elephants, horses, the seven precious things, my kingdom, cities, wife and children, servants and attendants, head, eyes, marrow and brain, body, flesh, hands and feet—I did not spare even my own life. At that time, the people's lifespans were immeasurable. For the sake of the Dharma, I renounced my royal position, entrusted governance to the crown prince, struck the drum and issued a proclamation throughout the four directions, seeking the Dharma: 'Whoever can expound the Mahāyāna to me, I shall serve and attend throughout my life.' At that time, there was a seer who came and addressed the king, saying: 'I possess the Mahāyāna, named the Lotus Sutra. If you do not disobey me, I shall expound it for you.' The king, hearing the seer's words, rejoiced and leaped with joy, immediately following the seer and providing all that he needed—gathering fruit, drawing water, collecting firewood, preparing food—even using his own body as a seat, his body and mind without weariness. Thus he served for a thousand years, all for the sake of the Dharma, diligently attending and serving so that nothing was lacking."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"I recall past kalpas
When, seeking the Great Dharma,
Though I served as world-king,
I coveted not the pleasures of the five desires.

"I struck the bell, announcing to the four directions:
'Who possesses the Great Dharma?
If one can expound it for me,
My body shall serve as slave and servant.'

"At that time, there was the seer Asita
Who came and addressed the great king:
'I possess the subtle, wondrous Dharma,
Rare in this world.

"'If one can cultivate and practice it,
I shall expound it for you.'
The king, hearing the seer's words,
In his mind arose great joy and delight.

"Immediately he followed the seer,
Providing all that he needed—
Gathering firewood and fruits,
Respectfully offering them at the proper times.

"For the sake of cherishing the wondrous Dharma,
Body and mind were without slackening or wearying.
Universally for the sake of all beings,
He diligently sought the Great Dharma—

"Not for his own body
Or for the pleasures of the five desires.
Thus, as the great king of a nation,
Through diligent seeking he obtained this Dharma,

"And thereby achieved Buddhahood—
Now I expound it for you."

The Buddha told the bhikṣus: "At that time, the king was none other than myself. The seer was the present Devadatta. Through Devadatta as a good spiritual friend, I was able to fulfill the six pāramitās—loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity, the thirty-two marks, the eighty secondary characteristics, the purple-golden hue, the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, the four methods of gathering, the eighteen dharmas exclusive to Buddhas, spiritual penetrations and the power of the Way. Having achieved perfect enlightenment and broadly saving beings—all this was due to Devadatta as a good spiritual friend."

The Buddha addressed the fourfold assembly: "Devadatta, after immeasurable kalpas have passed, shall attain Buddhahood. His name shall be Devarāja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Humans, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His world shall be named Devaloka. At that time, Devarāja Buddha shall abide in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas, broadly expounding the wondrous Dharma for beings. Beings numerous as the sands of the Ganges shall attain the fruit of arhatship. Immeasurable beings shall awaken to the mind of pratyekabuddhas. Beings numerous as the sands of the Ganges shall generate the mind of the unsurpassed Way, attain the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas, and reach the stage of non-retrogression."

"When Devarāja Buddha enters parinirvāṇa, the True Dharma shall abide in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas. His complete bodily relics shall be enshrined in a stūpa of the seven precious things, sixty yojanas in height and forty yojanas in breadth. All devas and humans shall make offerings with various flowers, powdered incense, burning incense, paste incense, garments, necklaces, banners, canopies, music and songs, worshiping and making offerings to this stūpa of the seven precious things. Immeasurable beings shall attain the fruit of arhatship. Immeasurable beings shall awaken to pratyekabuddhahood. Inconceivable numbers of beings shall generate the mind of bodhi and reach the stage of non-retrogression."

The Buddha told the bhikṣus: "In a future age, should there be good men and good women who, hearing the Devadatta Chapter of the Lotus Sutra, believe and revere it with pure minds without generating doubts, they shall not fall into the hells, the realm of hungry ghosts, or the realm of animals, but shall be born before Buddhas of the ten directions. In whatever place they are born, they shall constantly hear this sutra. If born among humans or devas, they shall receive supremely wondrous pleasures. If in the presence of a Buddha, they shall be born by transformation from lotus flowers."

At that time, from below, a bodhisattva who had accompanied the World-Honored Prabhūtaratna, named Prajñākūṭa, addressed Prabhūtaratna Buddha: "We should return to our original land." Śākyamuni Buddha said to Prajñākūṭa: "Good man, wait a moment. There is here a bodhisattva named Mañjuśrī. You may meet with him and discuss the wondrous Dharma, then return to your original land."

At that time, Mañjuśrī was seated upon a thousand-petaled lotus flower, large as a cart-wheel. The bodhisattvas who had accompanied him were also seated upon jeweled lotus flowers. They arose naturally from the palace of Sāgara, the dragon-king, in the great ocean, abiding in empty space. They proceeded to Vulture Peak Mountain, descended from their lotus flowers, and approached the Buddha. They bowed their heads to the ground, paying homage to the feet of the two World-Honored Ones. Having completed these courtesies, they went to Prajñākūṭa, exchanged greetings with each other, and withdrew to sit to one side.

Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva asked Mañjuśrī: "When you went to the dragon palace, how many beings did you convert?" Mañjuśrī said: "Their number is immeasurable, incalculable, beyond what words can declare or the mind can fathom. Wait but a moment and evidence shall naturally appear." Before his words were finished, innumerable bodhisattvas seated upon jeweled lotus flowers surged forth from the sea, proceeded to Vulture Peak Mountain, and abided in empty space. These bodhisattvas had all been converted by Mañjuśrī. They had perfected the bodhisattva practices and all discoursed together on the six pāramitās. Those who had originally been śrāvakas discoursed in empty space on śrāvaka practices, but now all cultivated the practice of the Mahāyāna's emptiness teaching. Mañjuśrī said to Prajñākūṭa: "The work of teaching and conversion in the sea was thus." At that time, Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva spoke in verse in praise:

"O Great One of wisdom, virtue, valor, and strength,
Who has converted immeasurable multitudes—
This great assembly here
And I have all now seen.

"You have proclaimed the meaning of true reality,
Opened and revealed the One Vehicle Dharma,
Broadly guiding all beings
To swiftly achieve bodhi."

Mañjuśrī said: "While in the sea, I constantly expounded only the Lotus Sutra." Prajñākūṭa asked Mañjuśrī, saying: "This sutra is profoundly subtle and wondrous, a jewel among sutras, rare in the world. Are there any beings who, through diligent and vigorous practice of this sutra, have swiftly attained Buddhahood?" Mañjuśrī said: "There is the daughter of Sāgara, the dragon-king. She has just reached the age of eight years. Her wisdom is sharp and keen. She well knows the roots, conduct, and karma of all beings. She has attained dhāraṇī. All the profoundly secret treasuries expounded by the Buddhas she can fully receive and uphold. She has deeply entered meditative concentration and thoroughly comprehends all dharmas. In the space of an instant, she generated the mind of bodhi, attained the stage of non-retrogression, and her eloquence is unobstructed. Compassionately mindful of beings as though they were her own infants, her merit is complete. What her mind conceives and her mouth proclaims is subtle, wondrous, vast, and great. Compassionate, benevolent, and yielding, her intent and spirit are harmonious and refined. She is able to reach bodhi."

Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva said: "I have seen Śākyamuni Tathāgata throughout immeasurable kalpas practicing difficult and painful austerities, accumulating merit and amassing virtue, seeking the bodhisattva path without ever ceasing. Observing the great trichiliocosm, there is not even a spot the size of a mustard seed that was not a place where the Bodhisattva cast aside body and life for the sake of beings. Only thereafter did he attain the bodhi Way. I do not believe that this girl could, in the space of an instant, achieve perfect enlightenment." Before his words were finished, the dragon-king's daughter suddenly appeared before them, bowed her head to the ground in reverence, and then withdrew to stand to one side. She spoke in verse in praise:

"Deeply penetrating the marks of crime and merit,
Illuminating universally the ten directions,
The subtle, wondrous, pure Dharma-body
Is endowed with the thirty-two marks.

"With the eighty secondary characteristics
Adorning the Dharma-body,
Revered and looked up to by devas and humans,
Dragons and spirits all pay homage with respect.

"Among all categories of beings,
There are none who do not honor and serve.
Again I have heard that in achieving bodhi,
Only Buddha can bear witness and know.

"I expound the teaching of the Mahāyāna,
Delivering beings from suffering."

At that time, Śāriputra addressed the dragon-girl, saying: "You say that in no long time you shall attain the unsurpassed Way. This is difficult to believe. Why is this? A woman's body is filthy and defiled, not a vessel for the Dharma. How could you attain unsurpassed bodhi? The Buddha-Way is vast and remote. Throughout immeasurable kalpas, through diligent and painful practice of various austerities and the complete cultivation of the pāramitās—only thereafter can one succeed. Moreover, a woman's body still has five obstructions: first, she cannot become a Brahmā god-king; second, Śakra; third, Māra-king; fourth, a wheel-turning sage-king; fifth, a Buddha-body. How could a woman's body swiftly attain Buddhahood?"

At that time, the dragon-girl possessed a precious jewel worth an entire great trichiliocosm. She held it up and presented it to the Buddha. The Buddha immediately received it. The dragon-girl addressed Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva and the Venerable Śāriputra, saying: "I offered the precious jewel and the World-Honored One accepted it. Was this matter swift or not?" They answered: "Very swift." The girl said: "Through your spiritual power, observe my attainment of Buddhahood—it shall be even swifter than this." At that moment, the entire assembly beheld the dragon-girl suddenly transform into a male body, perfect the bodhisattva practices, immediately proceed to the Vimalā world in the southern direction, sit upon a jeweled lotus flower, and achieve perfect enlightenment. With the thirty-two marks and the eighty secondary characteristics, she universally expounded the wondrous Dharma for all beings throughout the ten directions. At that time, in the Sahā world, bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, the eight classes of dragons and spirits, humans and non-humans all beheld from afar that dragon-girl attain Buddhahood and universally expound the Dharma for the assembly of devas and humans at that time. Their minds rejoiced greatly and all made obeisance from afar. Immeasurable beings heard the Dharma, awakened understanding, and attained the stage of non-retrogression. Immeasurable beings received predictions of the Way. The Vimalā world trembled and quaked in six ways. In the Sahā world, three thousand beings abided on the stage of non-retrogression. Three thousand beings generated the mind of bodhi and received predictions. Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva, Śāriputra, and the entire assembly all silently believed and accepted.


CHAPTER THIRTEEN: EXHORTATION TO UPHOLD 

At that time, Medicine King Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva and Mahāpratibhāna Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva, together with twenty thousand bodhisattvas as their retinue, all made this vow before the Buddha: "We only pray that the World-Honored One will not be troubled. After the Buddha's extinction, we shall receive, uphold, read, recite, and expound this sutra. In the future evil age, beings' wholesome roots shall diminish and many shall increase in arrogance, coveting offerings and increasing unwholesome roots, becoming far removed from liberation. Though they shall be difficult to teach and convert, we shall summon up great powers of patient acceptance to read, recite, uphold, expound, write, and make various offerings to this sutra, not sparing body or life."

At that time, the five hundred arhats in the assembly who had received predictions addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we also make this vow ourselves: we shall broadly expound this sutra in other lands." Again, there were eight thousand learning and post-learning persons who had received predictions. They arose from their seats, pressed their palms together toward the Buddha, and made this vow: "World-Honored One, we also shall broadly expound this sutra in other lands. Why is this? In this Sahā land, people are many, evil, and corrupt, harboring arrogance. Their merit is shallow and slight. They are wrathful, turbid, flattering, and crooked, their minds insincere."

At that time, the Buddha's maternal aunt, Mahāprajāpatī Bhikṣuṇī, together with six thousand learning and post-learning bhikṣuṇīs, arose from their seats, single-mindedly pressed their palms together, gazed up at the Honored Countenance, and their eyes did not leave him for an instant. At that time, the World-Honored One addressed Gautamī: "Why do you gaze at the Tathāgata with a troubled expression? Does your mind perhaps think that I have not spoken your name and bestowed upon you the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi?"

"Gautamī, previously when I spoke in general that all śrāvakas have already received predictions, if now you wish to know your prediction: in the future age, you shall become a great Dharma teacher among the Dharma teachings of sixty-eight thousand koṭis of Buddhas, and the six thousand learning and post-learning bhikṣuṇīs shall also be Dharma teachers. Thus shall you gradually perfect the bodhisattva path. You shall attain Buddhahood with the name Sarvasattvapriyadarśana Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Humans, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. Gautamī, this Sarvasattvapriyadarśana Buddha and the six thousand bodhisattvas shall in turn receive predictions and attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

At that time, Yaśodharā Bhikṣuṇī, the mother of Rāhula, thought thus: "The World-Honored One in bestowing predictions has alone not spoken my name." The Buddha addressed Yaśodharā: "In a future age, among the Dharma teachings of hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, you shall cultivate the bodhisattva practices and be a great Dharma teacher, gradually perfecting the Buddha-Way. In the good land you shall attain Buddhahood with the name Raśmiśatasahasraparipūrṇadhvaja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Humans, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The Buddha's lifespan shall be immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas."

At that time, Mahāprajāpatī Bhikṣuṇī and Yaśodharā Bhikṣuṇī, together with their retinues, all rejoiced greatly, having gained what they had never had before. Immediately before the Buddha they spoke in verse:

"World-Honored One, our guide,
Who brings peace to devas and humans—
We, hearing this prediction,
Have peace of mind and complete fulfillment."

When the bhikṣuṇīs had spoken this verse, they addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we also are able to broadly proclaim this sutra in other lands." At that time, the World-Honored One gazed upon the eighty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas. These bodhisattvas were all avaivartika, who turn the irreversible Dharma-wheel and who had attained the various dhāraṇīs. They immediately arose from their seats, approached the Buddha, single-mindedly pressed their palms together, and thought thus: "If the World-Honored One commands us to uphold and expound this sutra, we shall do as the Buddha teaches and broadly proclaim this Dharma." They thought again: "The Buddha now remains silent and does not command us. What should we do?"

At that time, these bodhisattvas, reverently following the Buddha's intention and also wishing to fulfill their original vows, made a lion's roar before the Buddha and uttered this vow: "World-Honored One, after the Tathāgata's extinction, we shall travel back and forth throughout the worlds of the ten directions, enabling beings to write out this sutra, receive, uphold, read, recite it, explain its meaning, practice according to the Dharma, and maintain correct mindfulness—all through the Buddha's awesome power. We only pray that the World-Honored One, abiding in other regions, will watch over and protect us from afar." At that moment, the bodhisattvas all raised their voices in unison and spoke in verse:

"We only pray that you will not be troubled.
After the Buddha's extinction,
In the frightful and evil age,
We shall broadly proclaim.

"There shall be ignorant people
Who speak evil words of abuse
And who threaten us with swords and staves—
All these we shall patiently endure.

"In the evil age, bhikṣus
Of deviant wisdom, with minds flattering and crooked,
Who have not attained yet claim attainment,
Their minds filled with arrogance—

"Or forest-dwelling hermits
Wearing ragged robes in secluded places,
Claiming to practice the true Way
While despising those in the world—

"Greedy for gain and offerings,
They expound the Dharma to the white-robed
And are revered by the world
As though they were six-powered arhats.

"These persons harbor evil minds,
Always thinking worldly thoughts.
Borrowing the name of forest-dwellers,
They delight in proclaiming our faults,

"Speaking words such as these:
'These bhikṣus,
For the sake of greed for gain and offerings,
Expound the doctrines of non-Buddhists

"'And themselves compose these sutras
To delude the people of the world.
Seeking fame and renown,
They discriminatingly expound this sutra.'

"Always amidst great assemblies,
Wishing to defame us,
Before kings and great ministers,
Brahmins and householders,

"And other assemblies of bhikṣus,
They slander and speak evil of us,
Saying we are persons of deviant views
Who expound the doctrines of non-Buddhists.

"Out of reverence for the Buddha,
We shall patiently endure all these evils.
Those who speak contemptuously, saying:
'You are all Buddhas'—

"Such words of contempt
We shall all patiently accept.
In the turbid kalpa and evil age,
There shall be many things to fear.

"Evil spirits shall enter their bodies,
Reviling and defaming us.
We, revering and believing in the Buddha,
Shall don the armor of patient acceptance.

"For the sake of expounding this sutra,
We shall endure these difficulties.
We love not body or life,
But cherish only the unsurpassed Way.

"We, in the future age,
Shall protect what the Buddha has entrusted.
The World-Honored One himself should know:
The evil bhikṣus of the turbid world

"Know not the Buddha's expedient means,
The Dharma expounded according to circumstances.
With evil words and frowning faces,
They shall repeatedly expel us,

"Banishing us far from stūpas and monasteries.
All such various evils,
Mindful of the Buddha's commands,
We shall patiently endure all these things.

"In various villages and cities,
Should there be those seeking the Dharma,
We shall go to wherever they are
And expound the Dharma the Buddha has entrusted.

"We are the World-Honored One's emissaries,
Dwelling among assemblies without fear.
We shall skillfully expound the Dharma—
May the Buddha abide in peace.

"Before the World-Honored One
And the Buddhas who have come from the ten directions,
We make such vows as these—
The Buddha himself knows our minds."


CHAPTER FOURTEEN: PEACEFUL PRACTICES

At that time, Mañjuśrī, Dharma-Prince Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva, addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, these bodhisattvas are extremely rare, for out of reverence for the Buddha they have made great vows that in the future evil age they shall protect, read, and expound this Lotus Sutra. World-Honored One, how should bodhisattva-mahāsattvas be able to expound this sutra in the future evil age?" The Buddha told Mañjuśrī: "If bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in the future evil age wish to expound this sutra, they should abide in four dharmas. First, they should abide in the sphere of practice of bodhisattvas and the sphere of intimacy, and thus be able to expound this sutra for beings."

"Mañjuśrī, what is called the sphere of practice of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas? If bodhisattva-mahāsattvas abide on the ground of patient acceptance, are gentle, agreeable, and compliant, neither hasty nor violent, their minds also unperturbed; moreover, regarding dharmas they practice non-practice while contemplating all dharmas according to their true marks—also neither practicing nor discriminating—this is called the sphere of practice of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas."

"What is called the sphere of intimacy of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas? Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas do not intimately associate with kings, princes of royal blood, great ministers, or officials. They do not intimately associate with various non-Buddhist brahmins, nirgranthas, or those who compose worldly writings, compose poetry, or write in praise of external writings. Nor do they associate with Lokāyata or anti-Lokāyata thinkers. They also do not intimately associate with those engaged in violent sports, wrestling matches, nāṭya performances, or various illusory transformations and theatrical displays. They do not intimately associate with caṇḍālas or with those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens, or dogs, or who hunt, fish, or trap, or with any who practice evil livelihoods. Should such persons occasionally come, they shall expound the Dharma for them, seeking nothing in return. Moreover, they do not intimately associate with bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, or upāsikās who seek the śrāvaka path, nor do they inquire after them. Whether in private chambers, in walking meditation areas, or in lecture halls, they do not dwell together with them. Should such persons occasionally come, they expound the Dharma for them according to circumstances, seeking nothing in return."

"Mañjuśrī, moreover, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas should not, with regard to women's bodies, take the marks that can generate desire and expound the Dharma for them, nor should they delight in seeing them. If entering another's home, they should not converse with young girls, maidens, or widows. They also should not approach the five kinds of paṇḍakas to form close friendships. They should not enter another's home alone. If there are causes and conditions requiring them to enter alone, they should single-mindedly recollect the Buddha. When expounding the Dharma for women, they should not display their teeth in laughter or expose their chest. Even for the sake of the Dharma, they should not form close friendships, how much less for other matters. They should not delight in keeping young disciples, śrāmaṇeras, or small children, nor should they delight in sharing the same teacher. They should constantly delight in sitting in meditation, dwelling in secluded places and regulating their minds. Mañjuśrī, this is called the first sphere of intimacy."

"Furthermore, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas contemplate all dharmas as empty, according to their true mark—not inverted, not moving, not retreating, not revolving, like empty space, having the nature of non-existence. All verbal paths are cut off. Not born, not emerging, not arising. Without name, without mark, truly non-existent. Without measure, without boundary. Without obstruction, without hindrance. But only existing through causes and conditions, arising from inverted views—therefore we speak of them. Always delighting in contemplating the marks of dharmas in this way—this is called the second sphere of intimacy of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If there are bodhisattvas
In the future evil age
With minds free from fear
Who wish to expound this sutra,

"They should enter the sphere of practice
And the sphere of intimacy,
Always keeping far from kings
And princes of royal blood,

"Great ministers and officials,
Those engaged in violent sports,
Caṇḍālas,
And non-Buddhist brahmins.

"Nor should they intimately associate
With those of increased arrogance,
Those greedy for and attached to the Lesser Vehicle,
Scholars of the Three Baskets,

"Bhikṣus who violate the precepts,
Arhats in name only,
Bhikṣuṇīs
Who delight in jesting and laughter,

"Who are deeply attached to the five desires,
Who seek present extinction,
Or upāsikās—
From all these they should not draw near.

"If such persons
Come with good minds
To the bodhisattva's place
To hear the Buddha-Way,

"The bodhisattva then, with
Fearless mind,
Not harboring expectations,
Expounds the Dharma for them.

"Widows, maidens,
Or the various paṇḍakas—
From all these they should not draw near
To form close friendships.

"Nor should they approach
Butchers, executioners,
Hunters and fishermen,
Those who kill for profit,

"Who sell meat for their livelihood,
Who display and sell women—
From all such persons
They should not draw near.

"Violent wrestling,
Various kinds of amusements,
Prostitutes and others—
From all these they should completely avoid intimacy.

"They should not teach the Dharma
To women in solitary places.
When expounding the Dharma,
They should not engage in jesting and laughter.

"Entering villages to beg for food,
They should take along one bhikṣu.
If there is no bhikṣu available,
They should single-mindedly recollect the Buddha.

"These, then, are called
The sphere of practice and sphere of intimacy.
Through these two spheres,
They can expound peacefully and joyfully.

"Moreover, they do not practice
Superior, middling, or inferior dharmas,
Conditioned or unconditioned,
Real or unreal dharmas.

"Nor do they discriminate
Between male and female.
Not obtaining any dharmas,
Not knowing, not seeing—

"This, then, is called
The sphere of practice of bodhisattvas.
All dharmas
Are empty and non-existent,

"Without permanence or abiding,
Also without arising or perishing.
This is called what the wise
Intimately associate with.

"Inverted discrimination
That dharmas exist or do not exist,
Are real or not real,
Are born or not born—

"Dwelling in secluded places,
Regulating their minds,
Abiding motionless
Like Mount Sumeru,

"Contemplating all dharmas
As entirely non-existent,
Like empty space—
Without solidity,

"Not born, not emerging,
Not moving, not retreating,
Always abiding in the single mark—
This is called the sphere of intimacy.

"If there are bhikṣus
After my extinction
Who enter this sphere of practice
And sphere of intimacy,

"When they expound this sutra,
They shall have no timidity or weakness.
When bodhisattvas at times
Enter quiet chambers,

"With correct mindfulness
They contemplate dharmas according to their meaning.
Arising from meditative concentration,
They expound for various kings,

"Princes, ministers, and people,
Brahmins, and others,
Expounding and proclaiming
This sutra,

"Their minds peaceful and secure,
Without timidity or weakness.
Mañjuśrī,
This is called the bodhisattva

"Abiding in the first dharma,
Able in the future age
To expound the Lotus Sutra."

"Again, Mañjuśrī, after the Tathāgata's extinction, in the Dharma-ending age, those who wish to expound this sutra—whether proclaiming orally or reading the sutra—should not delight in speaking of people's or sutras' faults. They should also not slight or disparage other Dharma teachers. They should not speak of other people's good or bad qualities or faults. Regarding śrāvaka persons, they should also not call them by name to speak of their faults, nor should they call them by name to praise their virtues. Moreover, they should not generate resentful or disaffected minds. Through skillfully cultivating such a mind of peace and joy, those who listen shall not oppose their intentions. When questioned with difficulties, they should not answer with the Dharma of the Lesser Vehicle, but only explain with the Mahāyāna, enabling them to attain the wisdom of all modes."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Bodhisattvas always delight
In expounding the Dharma peacefully and securely.
On pure ground
They establish seats,

"Anoint their bodies with oil,
Bathe away dust and defilement,
Don fresh, clean robes—
Pure within and without.

"Peacefully taking their Dharma-seat,
They answer questions as asked.
If there are bhikṣus
And bhikṣuṇīs,

"Upāsakas
And upāsikās,
Kings, princes,
Ministers, officers, and people,

"With subtle and wondrous meaning,
They expound with pleasant countenance.
When questioned with difficulties,
They answer according to the meaning,

"Through causes, conditions, and parables,
Expounding and discriminating,
By these expedient means
Causing all to generate the aspiration,

"Gradually increasing and advancing,
Entering upon the Buddha-Way,
Removing thoughts of laziness
And slackness,

"Abandoning all sorrows and troubles,
Compassionately expounding the Dharma.
Day and night, constantly expounding
The teaching of the unsurpassed Way,

"Through various causes and conditions
And immeasurable parables,
They enlighten beings,
Causing all to rejoice.

"Concerning garments, bedding,
Food and medicine,
They harbor no expectations
Among these things,

"But single-mindedly recollect
The causes and conditions for expounding the Dharma,
Wishing to achieve the Buddha-Way
And cause others to be thus as well.

"This, then, is great benefit,
The offering of peace and joy.
After my extinction,
If there are bhikṣus

"Able to proclaim
This Lotus Sutra,
Their minds without jealousy, anger,
Or various troubling obstructions,

"Also without sorrows, troubles,
Or those who revile and curse,
Also without fear
Of swords, staves, or the like,

"Also without expulsion—
Abiding in patient acceptance.
The wise, in this way,
Skillfully regulate their minds,

"Able to abide peacefully and joyfully
As I have explained above.
The merit of such persons,
Throughout thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas,

"Through calculations or parables,
Cannot be exhaustively explained."

"Again, Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in the future final age, when the Dharma is about to perish, who receive, uphold, read, and recite this sutra should not harbor jealous, deceitful, or flattering minds. Nor should they slight or revile those who study the Buddha-Way or seek out their faults. Whether bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, or upāsikās—whether they seek to be śrāvakas, seek to be pratyekabuddhas, or seek the bodhisattva path—one should not trouble them or cause them doubt or regret, saying to such persons: 'You are far from the Way and shall never attain the wisdom of all modes. Why is this? Because you are lazy and lax persons, negligent regarding the Way.' Moreover, they should not engage in frivolous discussions about dharmas or disputes and contentions. They should generate thoughts of great compassion toward all beings, thoughts of compassionate fathers toward all Tathāgatas, and thoughts of great teachers toward all bodhisattvas. Regarding the great bodhisattvas of the ten directions, they should always deeply and reverently worship them. Toward all beings they should expound the Dharma equally. According to the Dharma, they do not speak much or little. Even to those who deeply love the Dharma, they should not speak excessively."

"Mañjuśrī, if bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in the future final age when the Dharma is about to perish achieve this third practice of peace and joy, when expounding this Dharma, none shall be able to trouble or disturb them. They shall gain good companions to read and recite this sutra together. They shall also gain great assemblies who come to listen and receive. Having listened, they can uphold. Having upheld, they can recite. Having recited, they can expound. Having expounded, they can write or cause others to write. They shall make offerings to the sutra scrolls, revering, honoring, and praising them."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If one wishes to expound this sutra,
One should abandon jealousy, anger, arrogance,
Flattery, deceit, and devious minds,
Constantly cultivating straightforward conduct.

"Not slighting or despising people,
Nor frivolously discussing the Dharma,
Not causing others doubt or regret,
Saying: 'You shall not attain Buddhahood.'

"When this Buddha-son expounds the Dharma,
He is always gentle and patient,
Compassionate toward all,
Not generating a mind of slackness.

"Toward the great bodhisattvas of the ten directions
Who practice the Way out of pity for multitudes,
He should generate a mind of reverence:
'These are my great teachers.'

"Toward the Buddhas, World-Honored Ones,
He generates thoughts of unsurpassed fathers.
Breaking the mind of arrogance,
He expounds the Dharma without obstruction.

"Such is this third dharma—
The wise should guard and protect it.
Single-mindedly practicing peacefully and joyfully,
He is revered by immeasurable multitudes."

"Again, Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in the future final age when the Dharma is about to perish, who uphold this Lotus Sutra, should generate minds of great compassion toward both householders and renunciants. Toward those who are not bodhisattvas, they should generate minds of great pity, thinking thus: 'Such persons have suffered great loss. For though the Tathāgata through expedient means expounds the Dharma according to circumstances, they do not hear, do not know, do not awaken, do not inquire, do not believe, and do not understand. Though such persons do not inquire about, believe in, or understand this sutra, when I attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, wherever they may be, through spiritual penetration powers and wisdom powers, I shall draw them in and cause them to abide in this Dharma.' Mañjuśrī, if bodhisattva-mahāsattvas after the Tathāgata's extinction achieve this fourth dharma, when expounding this Dharma they shall be without faults, constantly receiving offerings, reverence, honor, and praise from bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, kings, princes, great ministers, people, brahmins, and householders. The devas in empty space, for the sake of hearing the Dharma, shall also constantly attend upon them. Whether in villages, cities, or secluded forests, should anyone come wishing to raise difficult questions, the devas day and night, constantly for the sake of the Dharma, shall guard and protect them, enabling all who listen to rejoice. Why is this? Because this sutra is protected by the spiritual powers of all past, future, and present Buddhas. Mañjuśrī, in immeasurable lands, this Lotus Sutra cannot even be heard by name, how much less seen, received, upheld, or recited!"

"Mañjuśrī, suppose there were a powerful wheel-turning sage-king who wished to subdue various nations through his majestic authority, but the various petty kings do not obey his command. At that time, the wheel-turning king raises various troops and goes forth to punish them. When the king sees that his troops have fought with merit, he greatly rejoices and according to their merit bestows rewards—perhaps granting fields, houses, villages, cities, or garments and personal adornments, or various precious things—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, coral, amber, elephants, horses, carriages, servants, and people. Only the bright pearl in his topknot he does not give. Why is this? Only on the king's crown is this one pearl. Were he to give it, the king's retinue would surely be greatly astonished."

"Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata is also like this. Through the power of meditative concentration and wisdom, he has obtained the land of the Dharma and reigns over the triple realm. Yet the various Māra-kings are unwilling to submit. The Tathāgata's worthy and sage generals do battle with them. To those who have merit, his mind also rejoices. In the midst of the fourfold assembly, he expounds various sutras, causing their minds to rejoice, bestowing meditative concentration, liberation, the faculties and powers of the undefiled root, and the wealth of various dharmas. Moreover, he bestows the city of nirvāṇa, declaring that they attain extinction. He guides their minds, causing all to rejoice—yet he does not expound this Lotus Sutra for them."

"Mañjuśrī, just as the wheel-turning king, seeing his troops possessing great merit, his mind greatly rejoicing, finally gives this pearl that is difficult to believe in, which has long been in his topknot and which he does not casually give to people—and now gives it to them—the Tathāgata is also like this. In the triple realm, he is the great Dharma-king, teaching and converting all beings through the Dharma. Seeing the worthy and sage army doing battle with the five-aggregate demons, the affliction demons, and the death demon, achieving great merit and glory, destroying the three poisons, emerging from the triple realm, and breaking the nets of Māra—at this time, the Tathāgata also greatly rejoices. This Lotus Sutra can enable beings to reach the wisdom of all modes. It is greatly resented and difficult to believe in by all the world. Previously it had not been expounded—yet now he expounds it."

"Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the foremost teaching of all Tathāgatas. Among all teachings, it is the most profound. Bestowed at the very end, it is like that powerful king who long protected the bright pearl and now finally gives it. Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the secret treasury of all Buddhas and Tathāgatas. Among all sutras, it is supreme above all. Long protected throughout the night, it has not been rashly expounded. Only today do I give it to you and others, expounding it widely."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Always practicing patient acceptance,
Pitying all,
One is then able to proclaim
The sutra praised by the Buddha.

"In the future final age,
Those who uphold this sutra
Should generate compassion
Toward householders, renunciants, and non-bodhisattvas.

"These who do not hear
Or believe in this sutra
Suffer a great loss.

"When I attain the Buddha-Way,
Through various expedient means,
I shall expound this Dharma for them,
Causing them to abide within it.

"Suppose there were a powerful
Wheel-turning king
Who, when troops fight with merit,
Rewards various things—

"Elephants, horses, carriages,
Personal adornments,
And various fields, houses,
Villages, and cities,

"Or grants garments,
Various precious things,
Servants and wealth,
Joyfully bestowing them.

"If there are valiant and strong ones
Able to perform difficult deeds,
The king removes from his topknot
The bright pearl and bestows it on them.

"The Tathāgata is also thus—
The king of all dharmas,
Possessing great powers of patient acceptance
And the treasure-house of wisdom.

"With great compassion,
According to the Dharma, he transforms the world.
Seeing all people
Receiving various sufferings and troubles,

"Seeking liberation,
They do battle with the demons.
For the sake of these beings
He expounds various dharmas.

"With great expedient means
He expounds these sutras.
Once he knows that beings
Have obtained their strength,

"Finally, at the very end,
He expounds this Lotus Sutra,
Like the king who removes from his topknot
The bright pearl and gives it to them.

"This sutra is most honored,
Supreme among sutras.
I constantly guard and protect it,
Not rashly revealing it.

"Now is precisely the time
To expound it for you and others.
After my extinction,
Those who seek the Buddha-Way

"And wish to attain peace and security
In proclaiming this sutra
Should draw near
Such four dharmas as these.

"Readers of this sutra
Shall constantly be without sorrows or troubles,
Also without sicknesses or pains,
Their complexions fresh and fair.

"Not born into poverty,
Baseness, or ugliness,
Beings delight in seeing them,
As they would admire worthy sages.

"The various sons of devas
Shall serve as their attendants.
Swords and staves shall not strike them;
Poisons cannot harm them.

"If people speak evil words of abuse,
Their mouths shall close and seal.
They shall travel without fear,
Like the lion king.

"The brilliance of their wisdom
Shall be like the shining of the sun.
If in dreams,
They shall see only wondrous things:

"They shall see all Tathāgatas
Seated upon lion thrones,
Surrounded by assemblies of bhikṣus,
Expounding the Dharma.

"Also seeing dragons, spirits,
Asuras, and others,
Numerous as Ganges' sands,
Reverently pressing palms together.

"They shall see themselves
Expounding the Dharma for them.
Also seeing various Buddhas,
Their bodies the color of gold,

"Emitting immeasurable light,
Illuminating all,
With Brahma-voiced sounds
Proclaiming all dharmas.

"The Buddha, for the fourfold assembly,
Expounds the unsurpassed Dharma.
They see themselves in the midst,
Palms pressed together, praising the Buddha.

"Hearing the Dharma and rejoicing,
They make offerings.
They attain dhāraṇī
And realize irreversible wisdom.

"The Buddha, knowing their minds
Have deeply entered the Buddha-Way,
Immediately bestows upon them predictions
Of achieving perfect enlightenment:

"'Good man,
In a future age
You shall obtain immeasurable wisdom—
The great Way of the Buddha.

"'Your land shall be adorned and pure,
Vast, great, and incomparable.
There shall also be a fourfold assembly
With palms pressed together, listening to the Dharma.'

"They also see themselves
In mountain forests,
Cultivating wholesome dharmas,
Realizing all true marks,

"Deeply entering meditative concentration,
Beholding Buddhas of the ten directions."

"The Buddhas' bodies are golden-hued,
Adorned with a hundred marks of merit.
Hearing the Dharma and expounding it for others—
They constantly have such excellent dreams.

"They also dream of becoming kings,
Abandoning palaces, retinues,
And supremely wondrous sensual pleasures,
Proceeding to the place of the Way.

"Under the bodhi tree,
Taking their place upon the lion seat,
Seeking the Way for seven days,
They attain the wisdom of all Buddhas.

"Having achieved the unsurpassed Way,
They arise and turn the Dharma-wheel.
For the fourfold assembly expounding the Dharma
Throughout thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas,

"Expounding the undefiled, wondrous Dharma,
Saving immeasurable beings.
Thereafter they enter nirvāṇa,
Like smoke exhausted and lamps extinguished.

"If, in the future evil age,
One expounds this foremost Dharma,
Such persons shall gain great benefit—
The merit and virtue described above."


CHAPTER FIFTEEN: EMERGING FROM THE EARTH

At that time, the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas who had come from other lands, exceeding the sands of eight Ganges Rivers in number, arose in the great assembly, pressed their palms together, made obeisance, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, if you permit us, after the Buddha's extinction, in this Sahā world, to diligently and vigorously protect, read, recite, write out, and make offerings to this sutra, we shall broadly expound it in this land." At that time, the Buddha told the assembly of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas: "Stop, good men. There is no need for you to protect this sutra. Why is this? In my Sahā world, there are already bodhisattva-mahāsattvas equal to the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers. Each bodhisattva has a retinue equal to the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers. After my extinction, these persons shall be able to protect, read, recite, and broadly expound this sutra."

When the Buddha spoke these words, throughout the Sahā world's great trichiliocosm, the earth everywhere split open and from within it, immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas simultaneously surged forth. The bodies of these bodhisattvas were all golden-hued, with the thirty-two marks and immeasurable brilliance. Previously they had all been dwelling below this Sahā world, in the empty space beneath this realm. These bodhisattvas, hearing the sound of Śākyamuni Buddha's voice, arose from below. Each bodhisattva was the foremost leader among the great multitude, each leading retinues equal to the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers—not to mention those leading retinues equal to fifty thousand, forty thousand, thirty thousand, twenty thousand, or ten thousand Ganges' sands. Not to mention those leading retinues equal to one Ganges' sands, half a Ganges' sands, one quarter, or even one out of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas. Not to mention those with thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of retinues. Not to mention those with koṭis of myriads of retinues. Not to mention those with thousands of myriads, hundreds of thousands, or even ten thousand. Not to mention those with one thousand, one hundred, or even ten. Not to mention those leading five, four, three, two, or one disciple. Not to mention those alone, delighting in solitary practice. Such as these and more, immeasurable and boundless, beyond what calculations or parables can know.

When these bodhisattvas had emerged from the earth, they each proceeded to the jeweled stūpa in empty space where Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata and Śākyamuni Buddha were. Having arrived, they bowed their heads to the ground, paying homage to the feet of the two World-Honored Ones. They also went to the Buddhas beneath the jeweled trees on lion thrones and likewise made obeisance, circumambulating them three times to the right, pressing their palms together in reverence. With various bodhisattva methods of praise, they offered praise and then stood to one side, joyfully gazing up at the two World-Honored Ones. These bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, from their initial emergence, offered praise to the Buddhas with various bodhisattva methods of praise. The time that passed was fifty minor kalpas. At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha sat in silence, and the fourfold assembly likewise sat in silence for fifty minor kalpas. Through the Buddha's spiritual power, he caused the great assembly to perceive it as if only half a day. At that time, through the Buddha's spiritual power, the fourfold assembly also saw the bodhisattvas filling the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of lands' empty space.

Among this assembly of bodhisattvas were four leaders. The first was named Viśiṣṭacāritra, the second named Anantacāritra, the third named Viśuddhacāritra, and the fourth named Supratiṣṭhitacāritra. These four bodhisattvas were the foremost leaders and teachers among the multitude. Before the great assembly, they each pressed their palms together, gazed upon Śākyamuni Buddha, and inquired, saying: "World-Honored One, are you in good health, with few ailments and few troubles? Do you dwell at ease? Are those who are to be saved receiving your teachings easily? Do they not cause the World-Honored One to become weary and tired?"

At that time, the four great bodhisattvas spoke in verse:

"Is the World-Honored One at ease,
With few ailments and few troubles?
In teaching and converting beings,
Are you without weariness?

"And do the various beings
Receive the teaching easily?
Do they not cause the World-Honored One
To become weary and tired?"

At that time, the World-Honored One, in the midst of the great assembly of bodhisattvas, spoke thus: "Just so, just so, good men. The Tathāgata is at ease, with few ailments and few troubles. The various beings are easy to convert and save, without causing weariness. Why is this? These various beings, life after life since time without beginning, have constantly received my teaching and conversion. They have also revered and honored past Buddhas, planting various wholesome roots. When these various beings first saw my body and heard what I expounded, they all immediately believed and accepted, entering into the Tathāgata's wisdom—except for those who previously cultivated and studied the Lesser Vehicle. Even such persons as these I now also cause to hear this sutra and enter into the Buddha's wisdom." At that time, the various great bodhisattvas spoke in verse:

"Excellent, excellent!
Great Hero, World-Honored One—
The various beings
Are easy to convert and save.

"Able to inquire about
The profoundly deep wisdom of the Buddhas,
Having heard, they believe and practice—
We rejoice along with them."

At that time, the World-Honored One praised the foremost great bodhisattvas: "Excellent, excellent, good men! You are able to rejoice along with the Tathāgata." At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva and the assembly of bodhisattvas numbering as the sands of eight thousand Ganges Rivers all thought thus: "From time immemorial until now, we have never seen or heard of such a great assembly of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas emerging from the earth, standing before the World-Honored One with palms pressed together, making offerings and inquiring after the Tathāgata."

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva, knowing the thoughts in the minds of the bodhisattvas numbering as the sands of eight thousand Ganges Rivers, and also wishing to resolve his own doubts, pressed his palms together toward the Buddha and inquired in verse:

"Immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis—
A great multitude of bodhisattvas
Such as has never before been seen—
We pray the Two-Footed Honored One will explain:

"From where have they come?
For what causes and conditions have they assembled?
With gigantic bodies and great spiritual powers,
Wisdom inconceivable,

"Their resolute wills firm,
Possessing great powers of patient acceptance—
Beings delight in seeing them.
From where have they come?

"Each of these bodhisattvas
Leads retinues
Whose number is immeasurable,
Like Ganges' sands.

"Some great bodhisattvas
Lead retinues of sixty thousand Ganges' sands.
Such great multitudes as these,
Single-mindedly seeking the Buddha-Way.

"These great teachers,
Numbering sixty thousand Ganges' sands,
Have all come to make offerings to the Buddha
And to protect this sutra.

"Those leading fifty thousand Ganges' sands—
Their numbers exceed even these.
Those leading forty thousand, thirty thousand,
Twenty thousand, down to ten thousand,

"One thousand, one hundred, and so on,
Down to one Ganges' sands,
Half, and three-quarters,
One out of myriads of koṭis—

"Thousands of myriads of nayutas,
Myriads of koṭis of disciples,
Down to half a koṭi—
Their numbers further exceed the above.

"From hundreds of thousands down to ten thousand,
One thousand and one hundred,
Fifty and down to ten,
Down to three, two, or one—

"Alone, without retinues,
Delighting in solitary dwelling,
All have come to the Buddha's presence—
Their numbers further exceed the above.

"Of such great multitudes as these,
If a person were to calculate with counting-rods
For kalpas exceeding Ganges' sands,
Still they could not fully know them.

"This great assembly
Of bodhisattvas of majestic virtue and vigor—
Who expounded the Dharma for them,
Teaching and perfecting them?

"Under whom did they first generate the aspiration?
What Buddha-Dharma did they praise?
Whose sutras did they receive and uphold?
What Buddha-Way did they cultivate?

"Such bodhisattvas as these,
With spiritual powers and great wisdom-power—
The earth in the four directions split open
And all surged forth from within.

"World-Honored One, from times past until now,
I have never seen such a thing.
We pray you will explain from where they came—
The name of their land.

"I constantly travel throughout various lands,
Yet never have I seen this assembly.
Among this multitude,
I do not recognize a single person.

"Suddenly they have emerged from the earth—
We pray you will explain the causes and conditions.
In this great assembly now,
Immeasurable hundreds of thousands of koṭis—

"All these bodhisattvas
Wish to know about this matter.
Concerning the original causes and conditions
Of this assembly of bodhisattvas,

"O World-Honored One of immeasurable virtue,
We only pray you will resolve the assembly's doubts."

At that time, the emanation Buddhas of Śākyamuni who had come from immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of other lands were seated in cross-legged posture upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees in the eight directions. The attendants of those Buddhas each saw this great assembly of bodhisattvas emerging from the earth in the four directions of the great trichiliocosm and abiding in empty space. Each addressed their Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, from where has this immeasurable, boundless, asaṃkhyeya great assembly of bodhisattvas come?" At that time, the various Buddhas each told their attendants: "Good men, wait a moment. There is a bodhisattva-mahāsattva named Maitreya, to whom Śākyamuni Buddha has bestowed a prediction that he shall next become a Buddha. He has already inquired about this matter, and the Buddha is now answering him. You should all hear it through this."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva: "Excellent, excellent, Ajita! You are able to inquire of the Buddha about such a great matter. You should all single-mindedly don the armor of vigor and generate firm resolve. The Tathāgata now wishes to display and proclaim the wisdom of the Buddhas, the Buddhas' self-mastered spiritual power, the Buddhas' lion-like vigorous power, and the Buddhas' awesome and mighty power of great authority."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Be vigorous and single-minded—
I wish to expound this matter.
Do not harbor doubts or regrets;
The Buddha's wisdom is inconceivable.

"Now put forth the power of faith,
Abiding in patience and goodness.
The Dharma you have never heard before,
You shall now all be able to hear.

"I now give you comfort;
Do not harbor doubts or fears.
The Buddha speaks no false words;
His wisdom is immeasurable.

"The foremost Dharma he has obtained
Is profoundly deep and difficult to discern.
As it is, I shall now expound it—
All of you, listen with single minds."

When the World-Honored One had spoken this verse, he addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva: "I now proclaim to you and this great assembly: Ajita, these great bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, immeasurable and countless asaṃkhyeyas, who have emerged from the earth and whom you have never seen before—after I attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi in this Sahā world, I taught, converted, guided, and led these bodhisattvas, tamed their minds, and caused them to generate the aspiration for the Way. These bodhisattvas all dwell in the empty space beneath this Sahā world. Regarding the various sutras, they read, recite, penetrate, and comprehend them, contemplate and discriminate them, and correctly keep them in mind. Ajita, these good men do not delight in dwelling among multitudes or in speaking much. They constantly delight in quiet places, diligently practicing with vigor, never resting. Nor do they abide relying upon humans or devas. They constantly delight in profound wisdom, without any obstructions. They also constantly delight in the Dharmas of all Buddhas, single-mindedly and vigorously seeking the unsurpassed wisdom."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Ajita, you should know:
These great bodhisattvas,
From immeasurable kalpas past,
Have cultivated the Buddha's wisdom.

"They are all those I have converted,
Causing them to generate the aspiration for the great Way.
These are my sons,
Relying upon and abiding in this world.

"They constantly practice dhūta austerities,
Delighting in quiet places,
Abandoning the clamor of great multitudes,
Not delighting in much speaking.

"Sons such as these
Study and practice my Way and Dharma,
Day and night constantly vigorous,
For the sake of seeking the Buddha-Way.

"They dwell in the empty space
Below the Sahā world.
Firm in will and mindfulness-power,
They constantly, diligently seek wisdom,

"Expounding various wondrous dharmas,
Their minds without any fear.
At Gayā city,
Seated beneath the bodhi tree,

"I achieved perfect enlightenment
And turned the unsurpassed Dharma-wheel.
Then I taught and converted them,
Causing them first to generate the aspiration for the Way.

"Now they all abide in non-retrogression;
All shall achieve Buddhahood.
I now speak true words—
All of you, believe with single minds:

"From the long and distant past,
I have taught and converted this multitude."

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva and the immeasurable assembly of bodhisattvas gave rise to doubt in their minds—a strange and unprecedented occurrence—and they thought thus: "How could the World-Honored One in such a short time have taught and converted such an immeasurable, boundless, asaṃkhyeya great assembly of bodhisattvas, causing them to abide in anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi?" They immediately addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, when the Tathāgata was a crown prince, he departed from the Śākya palace. Not far from Gayā city, he sat at the place of the Way and attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. From that time until now, only slightly more than forty years have passed. World-Honored One, how, in this short time, could you have accomplished such great Buddha-work? Through the Buddha's power and the Buddha's merit, how could you have taught and converted such an immeasurable great assembly of bodhisattvas to attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi?"

"World-Honored One, this great assembly of bodhisattvas—even if a person were to count them for thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas, they could not exhaust their number or reach their limit. These have, from the distant past, planted wholesome roots in the presence of immeasurable, boundless Buddhas, perfected the bodhisattva path, and constantly cultivated pure conduct. World-Honored One, such matters as these are difficult for the world to believe. It is as if there were a person, youthful in appearance with black hair, twenty-five years of age, who pointed to a hundred-year-old person and said, 'This is my son.' And the hundred-year-old person also pointed to the youth and said, 'This is my father who gave birth to and raised me.' Such a matter would be difficult to believe."

"The Buddha is also like this. Having attained the Way, in truth it has not been long. Yet this great assembly of bodhisattvas have, for immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas, for the sake of the Buddha-Way, diligently practiced with vigor, skillfully entering, emerging from, and abiding in immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of samādhis, attaining great spiritual powers, cultivating pure conduct for a long time, skillfully and in proper sequence practicing various wholesome dharmas, skillful in questions and answers—precious among people, extremely rare in all the world. Today the World-Honored One merely says that when he attained the Buddha-Way, he first caused them to generate the aspiration, taught, converted, guided, and directed them toward anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. The World-Honored One attained Buddhahood not long ago, yet he has been able to accomplish such great meritorious works. Though we believe that what the Buddha says accords with circumstances and that the words spoken by the Buddha are never false, and that the Buddha's knowledge penetrates all—nevertheless, newly-aspiring bodhisattvas, after the Buddha's extinction, if they hear such words, perhaps will not believe or accept them and shall thereby generate the karmic causes and conditions for breaking the Dharma. Therefore, World-Honored One, we pray you will explain and remove our doubts. And in future ages, when good men hear of this matter, they also shall not generate doubts."

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"In the past, the Buddha departed from the Śākya clan,
Left home near Gayā,
And sat beneath the bodhi tree—
From then until now, not long ago.

"These sons of the Buddha,
Whose number is immeasurable,
Have long practiced the Buddha-Way,
Abiding in spiritual powers.

"They have skillfully studied the bodhisattva path,
Unstained by worldly dharmas,
Like lotuses in water.
They have emerged from the earth,

"All generating minds of reverence,
Standing before the World-Honored One.
Such matters are difficult to conceive—
How can they be believed?

"The Buddha attained the Way very recently,
Yet his accomplishments are very many.
We pray you will remove the assembly's doubts
And explain according to reality.

"Suppose there were a youthful person,
Just twenty-five years of age,
Who pointed to a hundred-year-old child,
With white hair and wrinkled face,

"Saying: 'These are born of me.'
And the child also said: 'This is my father.'
Father young and child old—
This is not believed by the whole world.

"The World-Honored One is also like this—
He attained the Way very recently.
Yet these bodhisattvas,
Firm in will, without timidity,

"From immeasurable kalpas past
Have practiced the bodhisattva path,
Skillful in difficult questions and answers,
Their minds without any fear.

"Patient and accepting, minds determined,
Upright, possessed of awesome virtue,
Praised by Buddhas of the ten directions,
Able to discriminate skillfully in expounding.

"Not delighting in dwelling among people,
Always preferring meditative concentration,
For the sake of seeking the Buddha-Way,
They dwell in the empty space below.

"We, hearing from the Buddha,
Have no doubts about this matter.
We pray the Buddha, for the sake of the future,
Will expound so they may understand.

"If there are those who, regarding this sutra,
Generate doubts and do not believe,
They shall immediately fall into evil paths.
We pray you will now explain:

"These immeasurable bodhisattvas—
How, in such a short time,
Were they taught and converted, causing them to generate the aspiration
And abide on the stage of non-retrogression?"


CHAPTER SIXTEEN: THE LIFESPAN OF THE TATHĀGATA

At that time, the Buddha addressed the bodhisattvas and the entire great assembly: "Good men, you should believe and understand the Tathāgata's true and honest words." Again he addressed the great assembly: "You should believe and understand the Tathāgata's true and honest words." And again he addressed the various great assemblies: "You should believe and understand the Tathāgata's true and honest words." At that time, the great assembly of bodhisattvas, with Maitreya as their head, pressed their palms together and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we only pray you will expound. We shall believe and accept the Buddha's words." Having thus spoken three times, they again said: "We only pray you will expound. We shall believe and accept the Buddha's words."

At that time, the World-Honored One, knowing that the bodhisattvas' three requests would not cease, addressed them, saying: "All of you, listen carefully to the Tathāgata's secret spiritual powers. All the worlds—devas, humans, and asuras—all say that the present Śākyamuni Buddha departed from the Śākya palace, and not far from Gayā city, sat at the place of the Way and attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. However, good men, in truth, since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kalpas."

"Suppose there were a person who ground into dust five hundred thousand myriad koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeyas of great trichiliocosms. Passing eastward through five hundred thousand myriad koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeya lands, he deposits one mote of dust. Proceeding eastward in this way until all the dust-motes are exhausted. Good men, what is your opinion? Can these worlds be conceived of, calculated, and their number known?"

Maitreya Bodhisattva and the others all addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, these worlds are immeasurable and boundless, beyond what calculations can know or the power of mind can reach. All śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, with their undefiled wisdom, cannot conceive of or know their numerical limit. Though we abide on the stage of avaivartika, regarding this matter we also cannot comprehend it. World-Honored One, such worlds as these are immeasurable and boundless."

At that time, the Buddha addressed the great assembly of bodhisattvas: "Good men, I shall now clearly proclaim to you: All these worlds, whether or not they received a dust-mote—take them all and reduce them to dust. One dust-mote equals one kalpa. Since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been more than this by hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeya kalpas. From that time onward, I have constantly been in this Sahā world expounding the Dharma and teaching. Also in other places, in hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeya lands, I have guided and benefited beings."

"Good men, during this intermediate period, I have spoken of Dīpaṅkara Buddha and others, and moreover said that they entered nirvāṇa. All this was discriminated through expedient means. Good men, when beings come to me, with the Buddha-eye I observe whether their faith and other faculties are sharp or dull. According to what is appropriate for their salvation, I declare in various places my name to be different, my age to be greater or smaller, and also indicate that I shall enter nirvāṇa. Moreover, through various expedient means, I expound the subtle and wondrous Dharma, able to cause beings to generate joyful minds. Good men, when the Tathāgata sees beings who delight in lesser dharmas, who possess scant virtue and heavy defilement, for such persons I say that when young I left home and attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. However, in truth, since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been as long and distant as this. But through expedient means, I teach and convert beings, causing them to enter the Buddha-Way, and thus I speak."

"Good men, the sutras expounded by the Tathāgata are all for the sake of saving and liberating beings. Whether speaking of my own body or others' bodies, whether revealing my own body or others' bodies, whether revealing my own affairs or others' affairs—all that is said is true and not false. Why is this? The Tathāgata knows and sees the marks of the triple realm according to reality. There is no birth or death, no retreating or emerging. There is neither existence in the world nor extinction. Neither real nor unreal, neither thus nor otherwise. Not as the triple realm sees the triple realm. In such matters as these, the Tathāgata sees clearly without error or delusion. Because beings have various natures, various desires, various conduct, and various thoughts and discriminations, wishing to cause them to generate wholesome roots, through various causes and conditions, parables, words, and phrases, and various expounding of the Dharma, the Buddha-work I perform has never ceased for even a moment. Thus, since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been extremely long and distant. My lifespan is immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, constantly abiding and never extinguished."

"Good men, the lifespan I originally achieved through practicing the bodhisattva path has not yet been exhausted and is still double the above number. However, though now I do not truly enter extinction, I nevertheless proclaim that I shall enter extinction. The Tathāgata uses this expedient means to teach and convert beings. Why is this? If the Buddha abides in the world for a long time, persons of scant virtue will not plant wholesome roots. Poor, lowly, and greedy for and attached to the five desires, they shall enter into the nets of false thoughts and inverted views. If they see that the Tathāgata constantly abides without extinction, they shall become arrogant, self-indulgent, weary, and lazy, unable to generate thoughts of difficulty in encountering him or minds of reverence. Therefore, the Tathāgata uses expedient means to speak, saying: 'Bhikṣus, you should know that encountering the emergence of Buddhas in the world is difficult.' Why is this? Throughout immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas, persons of scant virtue may see a Buddha, or may not. For this reason, I speak thus: 'Bhikṣus, the Tathāgata is difficult to encounter and see.' When these beings hear such words, they shall certainly generate thoughts of the difficulty of encountering, their minds harboring longing and thirst for the Buddha. They shall then plant wholesome roots. Therefore, though the Tathāgata does not truly enter extinction, he speaks of entering extinction."

"Moreover, good men, the Dharmas of all Buddhas and Tathāgatas are all thus—for the sake of saving beings, all are true and not false. Suppose there were a skilled physician, wise and intelligent, thoroughly versed in medicinal formulas, skillful in curing all illnesses. This person has many sons—perhaps ten, twenty, or even a hundred. Due to certain matters, he travels afar to another land. After his departure, his sons drink other people's poison. When the poison takes effect, they writhe in confusion and agony upon the ground. At that time, their father returns home. Among the sons who have drunk the poison, some have lost their original minds, while others have not. Seeing their father from afar, they all greatly rejoice, kneel down, bow, and inquire: 'How excellent that you have returned safely! We were foolish and mistakenly took poison. We pray you will save and heal us, restoring our lifespans.' The father, seeing his sons suffering thus, according to various medical texts seeks fine medicinal herbs, perfect in color, fragrance, and flavor, grinds, sifts, and mixes them together, and gives them to his sons to take, speaking these words: 'This great fine medicine possesses perfect color, fragrance, and flavor. All of you should take it. It shall swiftly remove your suffering and troubles, and you shall have no further afflictions.'"

"Among those sons who have not lost their minds, seeing this fine medicine with its perfect color and fragrance, they immediately take it and are completely cured and healed. The others who have lost their minds, though they also rejoice upon seeing their father and inquire after him, seeking healing for their illness, when they are given the medicine they refuse to take it. Why is this? The poison has deeply entered, causing them to lose their original minds. Regarding this medicine of fine color and fragrance, they consider it unpleasant. The father thinks: 'These sons are pitiable. Poisoned and confused, their minds are all inverted. Though they rejoice upon seeing me and seek salvation and healing, they refuse to take such fine medicine. I should now employ expedient means to cause them to take this medicine.' He immediately speaks these words: 'You should know that I am now aged and decrepit. The time of my death has arrived. This fine medicine I now leave here. You may take it—do not worry that it will not cure you.' Having given these instructions, he again departs to another land and sends a messenger back to announce: 'Your father has died.' At that time, the sons, hearing that their father had died and they were orphaned, feel great sorrow and distress and think thus: 'If our father were alive, he would pity us and be able to save and protect us. Now he has abandoned us and died far away in another land.' They consider themselves solitary and bereft, without anyone to rely upon. Constantly harboring grief and sorrow, their minds finally awaken and they realize that this medicine possesses excellent color, flavor, and fragrance. They immediately take it, and the poison and illness are all cured. Their father, hearing that his sons have all recovered, soon returns home so that all may see him."

"Good men, what is your opinion? Could anyone say that this skilled physician committed the offense of falsehood?" "No, World-Honored One." The Buddha said: "I am also like this. Since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeya kalpas. For the sake of beings, through the power of expedient means, I say that I shall enter extinction. Yet there is no one who could, according to the Dharma, speak of me as committing the offense of falsehood."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Since I attained Buddhahood,
The number of kalpas that have passed
Is immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads
Of koṭis and asaṃkhyeyas.

"I have constantly expounded the Dharma and taught
Immeasurable koṭis of beings,
Causing them to enter the Buddha-Way.
Since then, immeasurable kalpas have passed.

"For the sake of saving beings,
I skillfully manifest nirvāṇa,
Yet in truth I do not become extinct—
I constantly abide here expounding the Dharma.

"I constantly abide here,
Through various spiritual powers
Causing inverted beings,
Though near, not to see me.

"The multitudes, seeing my extinction,
Broadly make offerings to my relics.
All harbor longing and thirst,
Generating minds of yearning.

"When beings have become faithful and compliant,
Upright and gentle in intent,
Single-mindedly wishing to see the Buddha,
Not sparing their own bodies or lives,

"At that time, I and the assembly of monks
All appear on Vulture Peak Mountain.
I then tell the beings
That I constantly abide here without extinction,

"Through the power of expedient means,
I manifest extinction and non-extinction.
In other lands there are beings
Who are reverent, faithful, and joyful—

"Among them also
I expound the unsurpassed Dharma.
You do not hear of this
And merely think that I have entered extinction.

"I see the various beings
Drowning in suffering and trouble.
Therefore I do not manifest my body,
Causing them to generate thirst and yearning.

"When their minds harbor longing and thirst,
I then emerge to expound the Dharma.
My spiritual power is like this:
Throughout asaṃkhyeya kalpas,

"I constantly abide on Vulture Peak Mountain
And in various other dwelling places.
When beings see the kalpa ending,
The great fire burning all,

"My land is peaceful and secure,
Constantly filled with devas and humans.
Gardens, groves, halls, and pavilions,
Adorned with various jewels,

"Jeweled trees full of flowers and fruits—
Beings sport and enjoy themselves there.
The devas strike celestial drums,
Constantly making various kinds of music,

"Raining māndārava flowers,
Scattering them upon the Buddha and the great assembly.
My Pure Land is not destroyed,
Yet the multitudes see it burned to exhaustion,

"Filled with worry, fear,
And various sufferings and troubles.
These various sinful beings,
Through evil karmic causes and conditions,

"Pass asaṃkhyeya kalpas
Without hearing the name of the Three Jewels.
All those who cultivate merit and virtue,
Who are gentle, upright, and honest,

"All see my body
Abiding here expounding the Dharma.
At times, for this multitude,
I expound that the Buddha's lifespan is immeasurable.

"For those who see the Buddha only after a long time,
I explain that encountering the Buddha is difficult.
My wisdom-power is like this—
The light of my wisdom illuminates immeasurably.

"My lifespan is immeasurable kalpas,
Obtained through long cultivation of karma.
You who possess wisdom,
Do not generate doubts about this.

"You should cause them to be forever exhausted—
The Buddha's words are true and not false.
Like a physician using skillful expedients,
To cure his deranged sons,

"Though truly alive, he speaks of death—
None can speak of him as false.
I am also the father of the world,
Saving those with various sufferings and troubles.

"Because ordinary beings are inverted,
Though truly present, I speak of extinction.
Because they constantly see me,
They generate arrogant and self-indulgent minds,

"Unrestrained, attached to the five desires,
They fall into evil paths.
I constantly know all beings—
Whether they practice the Way or not.

"According to what is appropriate for their salvation,
I expound various dharmas for them.
Each time, I think thus:
'How can I cause beings

"'To enter the unsurpassed wisdom
And swiftly achieve the Buddha-body?'"


CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: DISCERNING MERIT

At that time, the great assembly, hearing the Buddha expound his lifespan in terms of kalpas so long and distant, immeasurable, boundless, asaṃkhyeya beings obtained great benefit. At that time, the World-Honored One addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva: "Ajita, when I spoke of the Tathāgata's long and distant lifespan, beings numbering six hundred and eighty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges' sands attained the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas a thousand times this number attained the dhāraṇī-gate of hearing and upholding. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of one world attained unobstructed eloquence in joyful speaking. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of one world attained hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of immeasurable dhāraṇīs of revolution. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of a great trichiliocosm were able to turn the irreversible Dharma-wheel. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of two middling lands were able to turn the pure Dharma-wheel. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of a small-thousand land shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after eight more births. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of four four-continent worlds shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after four more births. Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of three four-continent worlds shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after three more births. Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of two four-continent worlds shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after two more births. Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of one four-continent world shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after one more birth. Again, beings numbering as the dust-motes of eight worlds all generated the mind of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

When the Buddha spoke of these bodhisattva-mahāsattvas obtaining great Dharma-benefit, from empty space rained māndārava flowers and mahā-māndārava flowers, scattering them upon the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas seated upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees, and also scattering them upon Śākyamuni Buddha and Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata who had long since entered extinction, seated upon lion thrones within the seven-jeweled stūpa, and also scattering them upon all the great bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly. Moreover, it rained finely powdered sandalwood and aloeswood incense. In empty space, heavenly drums sounded of themselves, their wondrous sounds profound and far-reaching. It also rained thousands of kinds of heavenly garments, and there hung various necklaces—pearl necklaces, mani-pearl necklaces, wish-fulfilling pearl necklaces—pervading throughout the nine directions. Jeweled incense burners burned priceless incense, naturally arriving everywhere, making offerings to the great assembly. Above each Buddha were bodhisattvas holding banners and canopies, ascending in succession up to Brahma Heaven. These bodhisattvas, with wondrous voices and sounds, sang immeasurable verses in praise of all Buddhas.

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva arose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, pressed his palms together toward the Buddha, and spoke in verse:

"The Buddha has expounded this rare Dharma,
Never before heard.
The World-Honored One possesses great power—
His lifespan is immeasurable.

"Immeasurable sons of the Buddha,
Hearing the World-Honored One discriminatingly
Explain those who obtain Dharma-benefit,
Are filled throughout their bodies with joy.

"Some abide on the stage of non-retrogression,
Some attain dhāraṇī,
Or unobstructed joyful eloquence,
Myriads of koṭis of revolution in total retention.

"Some, numbering as dust-motes of the great trichiliocosm,
Each able to turn
The irreversible Dharma-wheel.

"Again, those numbering as dust-motes of middling chiliocosms,
Each able to turn
The pure Dharma-wheel.

"Again, those numbering as dust-motes of small chiliocosms,
The remainder each having eight more births,
Shall attain the Buddha-Way.

"Again, those numbering as dust-motes of four, three, and two—
Such four-continent worlds—
Bodhisattvas numbering accordingly
Shall achieve Buddhahood after that many births.

"Or those numbering as dust-motes of one four-continent world,
The remainder having one more birth,
Shall achieve the wisdom of all modes.

"Beings such as these,
Hearing of the Buddha's long lifespan,
Attain immeasurable, undefiled,
Pure fruition and reward.

"Again, those numbering as dust-motes of eight worlds,
Hearing the Buddha expound his lifespan,
All generate the unsurpassed mind.

"The World-Honored One has expounded immeasurable,
Inconceivable dharmas
With much that benefits,
Like empty space without bounds.

"It rains heavenly māndārava
And mahā-māndārava flowers.
Śakras and Brahmas, like Ganges' sands,
Come from immeasurable Buddha-lands.

"It rains sandalwood and aloeswood,
Swirling and falling in confusion,
Like birds flying down from the sky,
Scattering offerings upon all Buddhas.

"In empty space, heavenly drums
Naturally emit wondrous sounds.
Thousands of myriads of kinds of heavenly garments
Whirl and descend,

"Wondrous jeweled incense burners
Burning priceless incense
Naturally arriving everywhere,
Making offerings to all World-Honored Ones.

"The great assemblies of bodhisattvas
Hold seven-jeweled banners and canopies,
Lofty, wondrous, numbering myriads of koṭis,
Ascending in succession to Brahma Heaven.

"Before each Buddha,
Jeweled pennants hang with victorious banners.
Also with thousands of myriads of verses,
They sing in praise of all Tathāgatas.

"Such various matters as these
Have never before occurred.
Hearing that the Buddha's lifespan is immeasurable,
All rejoice.

"The Buddha's name is heard throughout the ten directions,
Broadly benefiting beings.
All possess wholesome roots
To aid the unsurpassed mind."

At that time, the Buddha addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva: "Ajita, should there be beings who, hearing that the Buddha's lifespan is long and distant like this, are able to generate even one thought of faith and understanding, the merit they obtain shall be without limit or measure. If there are good men or good women who, for the sake of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, throughout eighty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kalpas practice the five pāramitās—dāna-pāramitā, śīla-pāramitā, kṣānti-pāramitā, vīrya-pāramitā, dhyāna-pāramitā, excluding prajñā-pāramitā—the merit of this practice compared with the previous merit cannot equal it by a hundredth part, a thousandth part, a hundred-thousandth-myriad-koṭith part—indeed, it cannot be known even through calculation or parable. If good men or good women possess such merit, regarding anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi they cannot possibly regress."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If a person seeks the Buddha's wisdom,
Throughout eighty myriads of koṭis
Of nayutas of kalpas,
Practices the five pāramitās:

"Throughout all these kalpas,
Making offerings to Buddhas
And pratyekabuddha disciples,
And various assemblies of bodhisattvas,

"With precious and rare food and drink,
Fine garments and bedding,
Building monasteries of sandalwood,
Adorned with gardens and groves;

"Gifts such as these,
Various and all subtle and wondrous,
Throughout all these kalpas' duration,
Dedicating them toward the Buddha-Way;

"If one again upholds the precepts,
Pure and without breach or flaw,
Seeking the unsurpassed Way,
Praised by all Buddhas;

"If one again practices patient acceptance,
Abiding on the ground of gentleness and compliance,
When various evils come to assail,
One's mind is not perturbed or moved.

"Also, those who obtain the Dharma
Yet harbor the conceit of superiority—
Being troubled and slighted by them,
One is also able to patiently endure.

"If one is again diligent and vigorous,
Will and mindfulness constantly firm,
Throughout immeasurable koṭis of kalpas
Single-mindedly without slackening;

"Also, throughout immeasurable kalpas,
Dwelling in secluded places,
Whether sitting or walking meditation,
Except for sleep, constantly regulating the mind—

"Through such causes and conditions,
One can generate the various dhyānas.
Throughout eighty koṭis of myriads of kalpas,
Abiding with mind unconfused,

"Upholding the merit of this single-minded concentration,
Vowing to seek the unsurpassed Way,
I attain the wisdom of all modes,
Exhausting all the limits of the dhyānas—

"Such a person, throughout hundreds of thousands
Of myriads of koṭis of kalpas,
Practicing all these merits
As described above.

"If there are good men and women
Who hear me expound my lifespan,
Even believing for a single thought—
Their merit exceeds that.

"If a person is completely without
Any doubts or regrets whatsoever,
And with deep mind believes for even a brief moment—
Their merit is like this.

"Those bodhisattvas
Who have practiced the Way for immeasurable kalpas,
Hearing me expound my lifespan,
Are then able to believe and accept.

"Persons such as these
Shall reverently receive this sutra,
Vowing that in the future
They shall long live to save beings,

"Just as today's World-Honored One,
King of the Śākyas,
With a lion's roar at the place of the Way,
Expounding the Dharma fearlessly.

"We, in future ages,
Shall be universally revered.
When sitting at the place of the Way,
We shall expound lifespans likewise.

"If there are those of deep mind,
Pure and upright,
Much learning, able to retain and uphold,
Understanding the Buddha's words according to their meaning—

"Persons such as these
Shall have no doubts about this."

"Moreover, Ajita, should there be those who hear of the Buddha's long lifespan and understand its meaning and purport, the merit obtained by such persons shall be without limit or measure, able to arouse the Tathāgata's unsurpassed wisdom. How much more so if one broadly hears this sutra, or causes others to hear it; if one upholds it oneself, or causes others to uphold it; if one writes it oneself, or causes others to write it; or if with flowers, incense, necklaces, banners, canopies, fragrant oil, butter lamps, one makes offerings to the sutra scrolls! Such a person's merit shall be immeasurable and boundless, able to generate the wisdom of all modes. Ajita, if good men or good women, hearing me expound my long lifespan, with deep minds believe and understand, they shall see the Buddha constantly abiding on Vulture Peak Mountain, surrounded by great bodhisattvas and assemblies of śrāvakas, expounding the Dharma. They shall also see this Sahā world—its ground of lapis lazuli, level and even, with jambu-river gold marking out the eight paths, jeweled trees in rows, and various towers and pavilions all made of jewels, with assemblies of bodhisattvas all dwelling therein. If one is able to contemplate thus, one should know this is the mark of deep faith and understanding."

"Moreover, after the Tathāgata's extinction, if one hears this sutra and does not slander it but generates a mind of joyful acceptance, one should know this is already the mark of deep faith and understanding—how much more so for one who reads, recites, receives, and upholds it! Such a person shall carry the Tathāgata upon their head. Ajita, such good men and good women need not, for my sake, again erect stūpas and monasteries or build monastic dwellings or make the fourfold offerings to the Saṅgha. Why is this? Such good men and good women who receive, uphold, read, and recite this sutra have already erected stūpas, established monastic dwellings, and made offerings to the Saṅgha. They shall be considered as having erected stūpas of the seven precious things for the Buddha's relics, lofty and broad, gradually tapering up to Brahma Heaven, with various banners, canopies, and numerous jeweled bells hung, with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, numerous drums, music, flutes, pipes, harps, various kinds of dance and entertainment, with wondrous sounds and voices singing praises and eulogies—they shall be considered as having already made such offerings for immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas."

"Ajita, after my extinction, should there be those who hear this sutra and are able to receive and uphold it, whether writing it themselves or causing others to write it, they shall be considered as having erected monastic dwellings, built with red sandalwood various halls and chambers numbering thirty-two, eight tāla trees in height, lofty, broad, adorned, and excellent, with hundreds of thousands of bhikṣus dwelling therein, with gardens, groves, bathing ponds, walking meditation paths, meditation caves, garments, food and drink, bedding, medicines, all pleasurable things filling them completely—such monastic dwellings, halls, and pavilions, numbering in the several hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis, immeasurable in number, presenting them before me and making offerings to me and the Saṅgha of bhikṣus. Therefore I say: After the Tathāgata's extinction, if there are those who receive, uphold, read, recite, or expound for others, whether writing themselves or causing others to write, and make offerings to the sutra scrolls, they need not again erect stūpas and monasteries or build monastic dwellings or make offerings to the Saṅgha. How much more so for those who are able to uphold this sutra and also practice giving, upholding precepts, patient acceptance, vigor, single-mindedness, and wisdom! Their virtue is most supreme, immeasurable and boundless, just as empty space in the east, west, south, north, the four intermediate directions, above, and below is immeasurable and boundless—so too is such a person's merit immeasurable and boundless, swiftly reaching the wisdom of all modes. If one reads, recites, receives, and upholds this sutra, expounds it for others, whether writing it oneself or causing others to write it; moreover, is able to erect stūpas and build monastic dwellings, making offerings to and praising the Saṅgha of śrāvakas; also with hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of methods of praise, praises the merit of bodhisattvas; moreover, for others, through various causes and conditions, explains this Lotus Sutra according to its meaning; again, is able to purely uphold the precepts, dwelling together with those who are gentle and compliant; is patient and accepting without anger, with will and mindfulness firm and solid, constantly valuing sitting in meditation, attaining various deep concentrations; is vigorous and valiant, gathering in all wholesome dharmas; is sharp in faculties and wisdom, skillful in answering difficult questions..."

"Ajita, after my extinction, should there be good men and good women who receive, uphold, read, and recite this sutra, they shall again possess such various wholesome merits. One should know that such persons have already approached the place of the Way, are near to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, and sit beneath the tree of the Way. Ajita, wherever such good men and good women sit, stand, or walk about, there should one erect a stūpa, and all devas and humans should make offerings as they would to a stūpa of the Buddha."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If, after my extinction,
One can reverently uphold this sutra,
Such a person's merit is immeasurable,
As described above.

"They shall be considered as having completely fulfilled
All manner of offerings—
Erecting stūpas with relics,
Adorned with the seven precious things,

"With pennant-poles extremely lofty and broad,
Gradually tapering up to Brahma Heaven,
With jeweled bells by thousands of myriads of koṭis,
Moved by wind, emitting wondrous sounds.

"Also, throughout immeasurable kalpas,
Making offerings to this stūpa
With flowers, incense, various necklaces,
Heavenly garments, and various kinds of music,

"Burning fragrant oil and butter lamps,
Constantly illuminating all around.
In the evil age of the Dharma's ending,
One able to uphold this sutra

"Shall be considered as already, as above,
Completely fulfilling all offerings.
If one is able to uphold this sutra,
It is as if the Buddha were present.

"With ox-head sandalwood,
Building monastic dwellings as offerings,
With halls numbering thirty-two,
Eight tāla trees in height,

"With superior food and wondrous garments,
Bedding all complete,
Hundreds of thousands of dwelling places,
With gardens, groves, and various bathing ponds,

"Walking meditation paths and meditation caves,
Various kinds, all adorned excellently.
If one has the mind of faith and understanding,
Receiving, upholding, reading, reciting, and writing,

"Or again causing others to write,
And making offerings to the sutra scrolls,
Scattering flowers, powdered incense,
Sumanas, campaka,

"Atimuktaka flowers,
Constantly burning fragrant oil—
One who makes offerings thus
Obtains immeasurable merit.

"Like empty space without bounds,
So too is their merit.
How much more so for one who upholds this sutra
While also practicing giving, upholding precepts,

"Patient acceptance, delighting in dhyāna,
Not angry, not speaking evil,
Reverent toward stūpas and monasteries,
Humble toward all bhikṣus,

"Far removed from arrogant minds,
Constantly contemplating wisdom—
When questioned with difficulties, not angered,
Responding in accordance with explanations.

"If one is able to practice such conduct,
Their merit is immeasurable.
If one sees this Dharma teacher
Who has achieved such virtues as these,

"One should scatter heavenly flowers upon them,
Cover their body with heavenly garments,
Bow with head touching their feet,
And in one's mind generate thoughts as of the Buddha.

"One should also think thus:
'It shall not be long before they proceed to the place of the Way,
Attain the undefiled and unconditioned,
Broadly benefiting devas and humans.'

"Wherever they dwell and abide,
Whether walking meditation, sitting, or lying down,
Or even expounding a single verse—
There should one erect a stūpa,

"Adorning it to make it wondrous and excellent,
Making various kinds of offerings.
When a Buddha-son dwells in this place,
It is then a place the Buddha uses.

"Constantly dwelling therein,
Walking meditation, sitting, and lying down."


CHAPTER EIGHTEEN: THE MERIT OF JOYFUL ACCEPTANCE

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, if there are good men and good women who, hearing this Lotus Sutra, joyfully accept it, how much merit shall they obtain?" And he spoke in verse:

"After the World-Honored One's extinction,
Should there be those who hear this sutra—
If they are able to joyfully accept it,
How much merit shall they obtain?"

At that time, the Buddha addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva: "Ajita, after the Tathāgata's extinction, whether bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, or other wise persons, whether senior or junior, having heard this sutra and joyfully accepted it, depart from the Dharma assembly and go to another place—whether in a monastic dwelling, a secluded place, a city, an alley, a village, or a hamlet—and, as they have heard it, expound it to the utmost of their ability for their parents, relatives, good friends, and acquaintances. These persons, having heard, also joyfully accept it and again go forth to teach others. Those others, having heard, also joyfully accept and teach yet others. Thus, transmitting it in succession unto the fiftieth person—Ajita, I shall now explain to you the merit of joyful acceptance of this fiftieth good man or good woman. Listen well."

"Suppose throughout the six destinies and four modes of birth of beings in four hundred myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya worlds—whether egg-born, womb-born, moisture-born, or transformation-born; whether having form or formless; having thought or thoughtless; neither having thought nor thoughtless; without feet, two-footed, four-footed, or many-footed—all such as these who are numbered among beings: suppose there were a person seeking merit who, according to their desires for pleasurable things, gave to them all, granting to each being all of Jambudvīpa's gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, coral, amber, and various wondrous precious things, as well as elephants, horses, carriages, palaces and towers made of the seven precious things. Having practiced such great giving for eighty full years, this great benefactor then thinks: 'I have already given beings pleasurable things according to their desires. However, these beings are all aged and decrepit, over eighty years old, with white hair and wrinkled faces. They shall die before long. I should now guide and instruct them with the Buddha-Dharma.' He immediately gathers these beings, proclaims and expounds the Dharma's transformation, instructing, benefiting, and delighting them. All at once they attain the path of stream-enterer, the path of once-returner, the path of non-returner, and the path of arhatship. They exhaust all outflows and, in profound dhyāna concentrations, all attain self-mastery, perfecting the eight liberations. What is your opinion? Is the merit obtained by this great benefactor abundant or not?"

Maitreya addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, this person's merit is extremely great, immeasurable and boundless. If this benefactor merely gave beings all pleasurable things, their merit would already be immeasurable. How much more so for causing them to attain arhatship!" The Buddha told Maitreya: "I now speak clearly to you: This person, giving all pleasurable things to beings of the six destinies throughout four hundred myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya worlds, and moreover causing them to attain arhatship—the merit they obtain does not equal that of this fiftieth person who hears one verse of the Lotus Sutra and joyfully accepts it. It cannot equal it by a hundredth part, a thousandth part, a hundred-thousandth-myriad-koṭith part, indeed cannot be known even by calculation or parable. Ajita, the merit of joyful acceptance of the Dharma Flower Sutra by this fiftieth person who has heard it transmitted in succession is already immeasurable, boundless, and asaṃkhyeya. How much more so for the first person in the assembly who hears and joyfully accepts it! Their merit is even more superior—immeasurable, boundless, asaṃkhyeya, incomparable."

"Moreover, Ajita, if a person, for the sake of this sutra, goes to a monastic dwelling and, whether sitting or standing, listens and receives it even briefly, through the merit of this cause and condition, when reborn in their next life, they shall receive supremely fine elephants, horses, carriages, precious palanquins, and shall ride in heavenly palaces. If again there is a person who, at a place where the Dharma is being expounded, sits, and another person comes whom they urge to sit and listen, or if they share their seat to allow them to sit—the merit of this person, when reborn in their next life, shall be to obtain the seat of Śakra, or the seat of a Brahmā king, or the seat of a wheel-turning sage-king."

"Ajita, if again there is a person who says to another: 'There is a sutra named the Lotus Flower; let us go together to hear it'—and they receive the teaching and, even for the briefest moment, hear it—the merit of this person, when reborn in their next life, shall be to be born together with dhāraṇī bodhisattvas. They shall possess sharp faculties and wisdom. Throughout hundreds of thousands of myriads of lives they shall never be mute or dumb. Their breath shall not be foul. Their tongue shall always be without illness. Their mouth also shall be without illness. Their teeth shall not be stained or black, not yellow, not sparse, nor missing, crooked, or asymmetrical. Their lips shall not droop down or curl back, nor be coarse or chapped, nor erupted or broken, nor crooked or distorted, neither thick nor large, neither dark black nor with any distasteful features. Their nose shall not be flat or crooked. Their face's color shall not be black, nor shall it be narrow or long, nor sunken or twisted. They shall have no unpleasant features whatsoever. Their lips, tongue, teeth—all shall be excellent and fine. Their nose long and slender, lofty and straight. Their face shall be full and round. Their eyebrows shall be high and long. Their forehead broad, level, and upright. Human marks shall be complete. In life after life wherever they are born, they shall see the Buddha, hear the Dharma, and believe and receive the teachings."

"Ajita, merely observe this: merely urging one person to go and listen to the Dharma produces such merit as this. How much more so for one who single-mindedly listens, expounds, reads, and recites, and in the midst of great assemblies discriminatingly explains it for others and practices according to what is taught?"

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If a person, at a Dharma assembly,
Hears this sutra,
Even a single verse,
And joyfully accepts it and expounds it for others,

"Thus transmitting and teaching
Unto the fiftieth person,
The merit obtained by this last person
I shall now discriminate:

"Suppose there were a great benefactor
Who provided for immeasurable multitudes,
Fully for eighty years,
According to their desires.

"Seeing their aged and decrepit marks,
White hair and wrinkled faces,
Teeth sparse and form withered,
Mindful that their death is not far off,

"'I should now teach them,
Causing them to obtain the fruits of the Way.'
Immediately, through expedient means, I expound
The true Dharma of nirvāṇa:

"'The world is all impermanent,
Like foam, bubbles, and flames.
All of you should
Swiftly generate minds of renunciation.'

"All the people, hearing this Dharma,
Attain arhatship,
Perfecting the six spiritual powers,
The three sciences and eight liberations.

"This fiftieth person
Who hears one verse and joyfully accepts it—
This person's merit exceeds that
And cannot be compared by parable.

"Thus, hearing it transmitted in succession,
Their merit is still immeasurable.
How much more so for one at the Dharma assembly
Who first hears and joyfully accepts!

"If there is one who urges another person,
Leading and guiding them to hear the Lotus Flower,
Saying: 'This sutra is profoundly wondrous,
Difficult to encounter in thousands of myriads of kalpas,'

"And they receive the teaching and go to listen,
Even hearing it for the briefest moment,
The merit and reward of such a person
I shall now discriminatingly explain:

"Life after life without oral afflictions,
Teeth neither sparse, yellow, nor black;
Lips neither thick, curled, nor missing—
Without any distasteful marks.

"Tongue neither dry, black, nor short;
Nose lofty, long and slender, and straight;
Forehead broad, level, and upright;
Face and eyes all upright and dignified—

"Delightful for people to see.
Breath without foul odor—
The fragrance of utpala flowers
Shall issue from their mouth.

"If one purposely goes to a monastic dwelling
Wishing to hear the Lotus Sutra,
Hearing it briefly and rejoicing,
I shall now explain their merit:

"In future lives, born among devas and humans,
They shall obtain wondrous elephants, horses, carriages,
Precious palanquins,
And ride in heavenly palaces.

"If at a place where Dharma is being expounded
One urges others to sit and listen to the sutra,
Through the merit of these causes and conditions they obtain
The seats of Śakra, Brahmā, and wheel-turning kings.

"How much more so for one who single-mindedly listens,
Explains its meaning and purport,
And practices according to what is taught—
Their merit is immeasurable!"

CHAPTER NINETEEN: THE MERITS OF THE DHARMA TEACHER


At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ever Diligent, saying: "If a good man or good woman receives and upholds this Lotus Sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, that person shall obtain eight hundred merits of the eye faculty, twelve hundred merits of the ear faculty, eight hundred merits of the nose faculty, twelve hundred merits of the tongue faculty, eight hundred merits of the body faculty, and twelve hundred merits of the mind faculty. Through these merits, the six sense faculties shall be adorned and made perfectly pure. This good man or good woman, with the pure physical eyes received from their parents, shall see throughout the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds—all the mountains, forests, rivers, and seas, both within and without. From the Avīci Hell below to the Summit of Existence above, they shall also see all sentient beings therein, as well as their karmic causes and conditions, their karmic recompense, and the places of their rebirth. All this they shall see and all this they shall know."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If one in the great assembly,
With a mind free from fear,
Expounds this Lotus Sutra—
Hear now of such merits.

That person obtains eight hundred
Meritorious and supreme eyes,
And being thus adorned,
Their vision becomes most pure.

With eyes received from parents,
They see the thousand triple cosmos entire—
Mount Sumeru within and without,
Sumeru and the Iron Ring Mountains,

Together with all other mountain forests,
The great seas and the flowing rivers.
From the Avīci Hell below
To the Summit of Existence above,

All sentient beings therein—
These they completely perceive.
Though not yet possessing the divine eye,
The power of the physical eye is thus."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall obtain twelve hundred merits of the ear faculty. With these pure ears, they shall hear throughout the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds, from the Avīci Hell below to the Summit of Existence above, all the various words and sounds within and without: the sounds of elephants, horses, cattle, and carriages; the sounds of weeping and lamentation; the sounds of conches, drums, bells, and chimes; the sounds of laughter and speech; the sounds of men and women, boys and girls; the sounds of Dharma and non-Dharma; the sounds of suffering and joy; the sounds of ordinary beings and noble ones; the sounds of delight and displeasure; the sounds of deities, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas; the sounds of fire, water, and wind; the sounds of hell beings, animals, and hungry ghosts; the sounds of monks and nuns; the sounds of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; the sounds of bodhisattvas and Buddhas. In brief, all sounds whatsoever within and without the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds—though not yet having obtained the divine ear, with the pure ordinary ear received from their parents, they shall hear and know all. Thus distinguishing the various kinds of sounds, their ear faculty shall remain unimpaired."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"The ear received from parents,
Pure and without defilement—
With this ordinary ear they hear
The sounds of the thousand triple worlds.

Sounds of elephants, horses, chariots, and oxen,
Sounds of bells, chimes, conches, and drums,
Sounds of lutes, zithers, and harps,
Sounds of flutes and pipes—

The pure and beautiful sounds of songs
They hear without attachment.
Countless varieties of human speech
They hear and fully comprehend.

They also hear the voices of the deities,
The wondrous sounds of their songs,
And hear the voices of men and women,
The voices of boys and girls.

In mountain ravines and perilous valleys,
The call of the kalaviṅka bird,
The jīvajīvaka and other birds—
All their sounds they hear.

The many suffering torments of hell,
The various anguished cries,
The hungry ghosts oppressed by hunger and thirst,
Their voices seeking food and drink—

The asuras and others
Dwelling at the ocean's edge,
When they converse among themselves,
Emitting great sounds—

Thus does the Dharma teacher,
Abiding safely in this realm,
Hear these many sounds from afar,
Yet their ear faculty remains unimpaired.

In the worlds of the ten directions,
When birds and beasts call to one another,
The person who expounds the Dharma
Hears all of these.

In the Brahma heavens above,
The Ābhāsvara and Śubhakṛtsna realms,
And up to the Summit of Existence,
The sounds of speech—

The Dharma teacher, dwelling here,
Hears them all.
All the assembly of monks
And all the nuns,

Whether reading or reciting scriptures,
Or teaching them to others—
The Dharma teacher, dwelling here,
Hears them all.

Moreover, the bodhisattvas,
Reading and reciting the Dharma of the sutras,
Or teaching it to others,
Compiling commentaries and explaining its meaning—

All such sounds as these
They completely hear.
The Buddhas, Great Holy Honored Ones,
Teachers and transformers of sentient beings,

In the midst of great assemblies,
Expounding the wondrous Dharma—
The upholder of this Lotus Sutra
Hears it all.

Throughout the thousand triple great cosmos,
All sounds within and without,
From the Avīci Hell below
To the Summit of Existence above—

They hear all these sounds
While their ear faculty remains unimpaired.
Because their ears are keen and sharp,
They can distinguish and know all.

The upholder of this Lotus Sutra,
Though not yet having the divine ear,
But using only the ear they were born with—
Such are their merits already."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall perfect eight hundred merits of the nose faculty. With this pure nose faculty, they shall smell all the various fragrances throughout the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds, above and below, within and without: the fragrance of sumanas flowers, jāti flowers, mallikā flowers, campaka flowers, pāṭala flowers, red lotus flowers, blue lotus flowers, white lotus flowers; the fragrance of flowering trees and fruit trees; the fragrance of sandalwood, aloeswood, tamālapattra, and tagara; and thousands upon thousands of kinds of blended incenses, whether powdered, formed into pellets, or prepared as ointments. The upholder of this sutra, dwelling in this realm, shall be able to distinguish them all. Moreover, they shall separately know the fragrances of sentient beings: the scent of elephants, horses, cattle, sheep, and so forth; the scent of men and women, boys and girls; and the scent of grasses, trees, thickets, and forests. Whether near or far, all these fragrances they shall perceive and distinguish without error. Though the upholder of this sutra dwells here, they shall also smell the fragrances of the deities in heaven: the fragrance of the pārijāta and kovidāra trees; the fragrance of mandārava flowers and mahā-mandārava flowers; the fragrance of mañjūṣaka flowers and mahā-mañjūṣaka flowers; sandalwood and aloeswood; various powdered incenses; and the fragrance of various mixed flowers. The fragrances produced by blending all such celestial incenses—none of these shall remain unknown. They shall also smell the bodily fragrances of the deities: the fragrance of Śakra Devānām Indra when in the Hall of Victory, delighting in the five desires and sporting there; his fragrance when in the Hall of Wondrous Dharma, expounding the Dharma to the Trāyastriṃśa deities; his fragrance when roaming in various parks; and the bodily fragrances of other male and female deities—all these they shall smell from afar. Thus continuing upward through the Brahma realms and reaching to the Summit of Existence, the bodily fragrances of all the deities they shall smell. They shall also smell the fragrances of incense burned by the deities, as well as the fragrances of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and the bodily fragrances of Buddhas—all these they shall smell from afar and know where they are. Though smelling these fragrances, their nose faculty shall neither be impaired nor confused. If they wish to distinguish and explain them to others, their recollection shall be without error."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"That person's nose is pure;
In this world,
Whether fragrant or foul things—
All varieties they perceive and know.

Sumanas and jāti,
Tamālapattra and sandalwood,
Aloeswood and cassia fragrance,
Various flower and fruit fragrances,

And they know sentient beings' scents—
The scent of men and women.
The teacher of the Dharma, dwelling far away,
Smells the fragrance and knows their location.

Great wheel-turning kings,
Lesser wheel-turning kings and their sons,
Ministers and palace attendants—
Smelling their fragrance, they know where they are.

The precious jewels adorning their bodies,
And treasures buried in the earth,
The jeweled maidens of wheel-turning kings—
Smelling their fragrance, they know where they are.

The ornaments adorning people's bodies,
Their garments and necklaces,
The various ointments they apply—
Smelling their fragrance, they know whose body.

Whether the deities walk or sit,
Sport or perform spiritual transformations—
The upholder of this Lotus Sutra,
Smelling their fragrance, knows it all.

The flowers, fruits, and seeds of trees,
And the fragrance of ghee and oil—
The sutra upholder, dwelling here,
Knows exactly where they are.

In the deep and perilous places of mountains,
Where sandalwood trees flower in bloom,
And sentient beings dwell therein—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

In the Iron Ring Mountains, the great seas,
And sentient beings within the earth—
The sutra upholder smells their fragrance
And knows exactly where they are.

Male and female asuras
And all their retinues,
When fighting or at play—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

In wilderness and dangerous narrow places,
Lions, elephants, tigers, wolves,
Wild oxen, water buffalo, and so forth—
Smelling their fragrance, they know where they are.

If someone is pregnant,
Before the sex is determined,
Whether lacking faculties or inhuman—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

By the power of smelling fragrance,
They know of the first conception,
Whether it will come to completion or not,
And whether a blessed child will be safely born.

By the power of smelling fragrance,
They know the thoughts of men and women—
Their lustful, deluded, or angry minds,
And also know those who cultivate goodness.

The many hidden treasures in the earth—
Gold, silver, and various jewels
Stored in copper vessels—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

Various kinds of necklaces
Whose value no one can assess—
Smelling their fragrance, they know their worth,
Their origin and location.

The various flowers of heaven—
Mandāravas and mañjūṣakas,
The pārijāta tree—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

The celestial palaces of heaven,
Their superior, middle, and inferior distinctions,
Adorned with multitudes of jewels and flowers—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

The celestial gardens, forests, and splendid halls,
The various towers and Halls of Wondrous Dharma,
Those taking pleasure therein—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

Whether the deities listen to the Dharma
Or receive the five desires,
Coming and going, walking, sitting, or lying—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

The garments worn by celestial maidens,
Beautifully adorned with fine flowers and fragrances,
As they move about at play—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

Thus continuing upward by degrees,
Even to the Brahma realm,
Those entering and emerging from meditative absorption—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

The Ābhāsvara and Śubhakṛtsna heavens,
And up to the Summit of Existence—
Those first born there and those departing—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

The assembly of monks
Ever diligent in the Dharma,
Whether sitting or walking in meditation,
Or reading and reciting scriptures,

Or beneath forest trees,
Concentrating in meditative absorption—
The sutra upholder smells their fragrance
And knows exactly where they are.

Bodhisattvas of firm resolve,
Whether sitting in meditation or reciting,
Or teaching the Dharma to others—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

The World-Honored Ones in all directions,
Revered by all,
Having compassion and teaching the Dharma—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

Sentient beings in the Buddha's presence,
Hearing the sutra, all rejoicing,
Practicing according to the Dharma—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

Though not yet having obtained the bodhisattva's
Undefiled Dharma-born nose,
This sutra upholder
First obtains these nasal characteristics."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall obtain twelve hundred merits of the tongue faculty. Whether good or bad, beautiful or not beautiful, or even bitter and astringent things—when they come to their tongue faculty, all are transformed into supreme flavors, like heavenly ambrosia, with nothing that is not delicious. If, with their tongue faculty, they expound the Dharma before a great assembly, they shall emit profound and wondrous sounds that can penetrate the hearts of all, causing all to rejoice and be delighted. Moreover, the sons and daughters of the deities, Śakra, Brahmā, and the various deities, hearing these profound and wondrous sounds and this orderly exposition and discourse, shall all come to listen. The nāgas and nāga maidens, yakṣas and yakṣa maidens, gandharvas and gandharva maidens, asuras and asura maidens, garuḍas and garuḍa maidens, kinnaras and kinnara maidens, mahoragas and mahoraga maidens—all, for the sake of hearing the Dharma, shall come to draw near, show reverence, and make offerings. Monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, kings, princes, ministers, and retinues, lesser wheel-turning kings, great wheel-turning kings with their seven treasures and thousand sons, and their inner and outer retinues, shall all ride in their palaces and come together to hear the Dharma, because the bodhisattva teaches the Dharma well. Brahmins, householders, and the people of the land shall, for their entire lives, attend and make offerings. Moreover, śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas shall always delight in seeing them. In whatever direction this person dwells, all Buddhas shall turn toward that place and teach the Dharma. They shall be able to receive and uphold all the Buddha's teachings, and also be able to emit profound and wondrous Dharma sounds."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"That person's tongue faculty is pure;
They shall never receive evil flavors.
Whatever they eat
All becomes like ambrosia.

With profound, pure, and wondrous voice,
They teach the Dharma to the great assembly.
Through various causes and parables,
They guide the minds of sentient beings.

All who hear rejoice
And present supreme offerings.
The deities, nāgas, yakṣas,
Asuras, and others—

All with reverent minds
Come together to hear the Dharma.
This teacher of the Dharma,
If wishing with wondrous sounds

To pervade the thousand triple cosmos,
Can accomplish this at will.
Great and lesser wheel-turning kings
And their thousand sons and retinues,

With palms joined and reverent minds,
Always come to hear and receive the Dharma.
The deities, nāgas, yakṣas,
Rākṣasas, and piśācas—

Also with joyful minds,
Always delight in making offerings.
The King of the Brahma Heaven, the King of Māra,
Īśvara and Maheśvara—

Such hosts of deities as these
Always come to that place.
The Buddhas and their disciples,
Hearing the sound of that one's Dharma teaching,

Always think of and protect them,
And sometimes manifest their bodies."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall obtain eight hundred merits of the body faculty. They shall obtain a pure body like pure lapis lazuli, which sentient beings delight to see. Because their body is pure, all sentient beings of the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds—at the time of their birth and death, whether superior or inferior, beautiful or ugly, born in good or evil destinies—all shall be manifested therein. The Iron Ring Mountain, the Great Iron Ring Mountain, Mount Sumeru, Mount Mahāsumeru, and all such mountains, as well as the sentient beings therein, all shall be manifested therein. From the Avīci Hell below to the Summit of Existence above, all that exists and all sentient beings shall be manifested therein. If śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas expound the Dharma, their forms and images shall all be manifested within that body."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If one upholds the Lotus Sutra,
Their body becomes most pure,
Like that pure lapis lazuli—
All sentient beings delight to see them.

And like a pure, bright mirror
That reflects all forms and images,
The bodhisattva, in their pure body,
Sees all that exists in the world,

They alone clearly perceive this;
Others cannot see it.
Throughout the thousand triple cosmos,
All the multitudes of living beings—

Deities, humans, and asuras,
Hell beings, ghosts, and animals—
All such forms and images
Are manifested within their body.

The palaces of the deities and so forth,
Even up to the Summit of Existence,
The Iron Ring and Sumeru Mountains,
Mount Mahāsumeru,

The great seas and waters—
All are manifested within their body.
The Buddhas and the śrāvakas,
The Buddha's sons, the bodhisattvas,

Whether alone or in assemblies,
Teaching the Dharma—all are manifested.
Though not yet having obtained the undefiled
Wondrous body of the Dharma nature,

With their pure ordinary body,
All is manifested therein."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman, after the Tathāgata's parinirvāṇa, receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall obtain twelve hundred merits of the mind faculty. With this pure mind faculty, upon hearing even a single verse or phrase, they shall penetrate limitless and boundless meanings. Having understood these meanings, they shall be able to expound upon a single phrase or verse for one month, four months, or even a full year. All the teachings they expound, in accordance with their meaning and purport, shall never contradict true reality. If they teach worldly classics, governmental discourse, or matters of livelihood and occupation, all shall accord with the correct Dharma. As for the sentient beings of the six destinies throughout the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds—the movements of their minds, the actions of their minds, the conceptual elaborations of their minds—all shall be known. Though not yet having obtained the wisdom free from defilements, yet their mind faculty shall be pure to this extent. Whatever this person thinks, deliberates upon, or speaks about shall all be the Buddha's teaching, without anything false, and shall also be what was spoken by previous Buddhas in the sutras."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"That person's mind is pure,
Bright, sharp, and without defilement.
With this wondrous mind faculty,
They know superior, middling, and inferior teachings.

Upon hearing even a single verse,
They penetrate limitless meanings.
In proper sequence they teach according to the Dharma,
For a month, four months, or up to a year.

Within and without this world,
All sentient beings—
Whether deities, nāgas, or humans,
Yakṣas, ghosts, spirits, and so forth—

Those in the six destinies,
Their various thoughts and intentions—
As recompense for upholding the Lotus Sutra,
They know them all at once.

The countless Buddhas of the ten directions,
With the marks adorned by a hundred merits,
Teaching the Dharma to sentient beings—
They hear all and can receive and uphold it.

They contemplate limitless meanings
And teach the Dharma also without limit,
From beginning to end without forgetting or erring—
Because they uphold the Lotus Sutra.

They fully know the marks of all dharmas,
Understand their sequence according to meaning,
Comprehend names, words, and expressions,
And teach them as they are known.

What this person expounds
Is all the Dharma of previous Buddhas.
Because they expound this Dharma,
Before assemblies they have nothing to fear.

The upholder of the Lotus Sutra
Has a mind faculty pure like this.
Though not yet having the undefiled state,
They first possess these characteristics.

This person upholding this sutra
Abides in a rare and wondrous state,
And for the sake of all sentient beings,
They are joyfully loved and revered.

Able to use thousands upon thousands of kinds
Of skillful expressions,
They distinguish and expound the Dharma—
Because they uphold the Lotus Sutra."

CHAPTER TWENTY: THE BODHISATTVA NEVER DISPARAGING


At that time the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta, saying: "You should now understand that if any bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī, upāsaka, or upāsikā who upholds the Lotus Sutra should be subject to evil speech, reviling, or slander, they will incur great karmic retribution as previously explained. Yet the merit they obtain shall be as has been described—the purity of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, in the ancient past, immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable, incalculable kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Humans and Gods, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa was named離衰 (离衰, Free from Decline), and the land was named Great Achievement. That Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja, in that world, expounded the Dharma for humans, gods, and asuras. For those seeking to be śrāvakas, he taught the Four Noble Truths to transcend birth, old age, sickness, and death, and to attain final nirvāṇa. For those seeking to be pratyekabuddhas, he taught the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. For bodhisattvas seeking anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, he taught the Six Pāramitās to perfect the Buddha's wisdom.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, the lifespan of that Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja was forty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges' sands of kalpas. The True Dharma abided in the world for a number of kalpas equal to the dust motes of one Jambudvīpa. The Semblance Dharma abided in the world for a number of kalpas equal to the dust motes of the four continents. After that Buddha had brought benefit to sentient beings, he then entered parinirvāṇa. After both the True Dharma and the Semblance Dharma had become extinct, in that land another Buddha appeared, also named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Humans and Gods, Buddha, World-Honored One. In this succession there were two myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, all bearing the same name."

"After the first Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata had entered parinirvāṇa, and after the True Dharma had become extinct, during the age of the Semblance Dharma, there were bhikṣus of overweening pride who wielded great influence. At that time there was a bodhisattva-bhikṣu named Sadāparibhūta (Never Disparaging). Mahāsthāmaprāpta, for what reason was he named Never Disparaging? This bhikṣu, whenever he encountered anyone—whether bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī, upāsaka, or upāsikā—would bow in reverence and offer praise, saying: 'I deeply respect you all and dare not treat you with contempt. Why is this so? Because you are all practicing the bodhisattva path and shall attain Buddhahood.'

"This bhikṣu did not devote himself to the recitation of sutras, but only practiced making obeisance. Even when he saw the four assemblies from afar, he would deliberately approach them to bow and offer praise, saying: 'I dare not disparage you, for you shall all become Buddhas.' Among the four assemblies, those who harbored anger and impure minds would revile him with harsh words, saying: 'This ignorant bhikṣu—whence has he come? He claims not to despise us and confers upon us the prediction that we shall attain Buddhahood. We have no use for such false predictions!' Year after year he endured such revilement without giving rise to anger, always proclaiming: 'You shall become Buddhas.' When he spoke thus, some would beat him with sticks, tiles, and stones. Yet even as he fled to a distance, he would still call out in a loud voice: 'I dare not disparage you, for you shall all become Buddhas.' Because he always spoke in this manner, the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās of overweening pride called him Sadāparibhūta (Never Disparaging)."

"When this bhikṣu was approaching death, he heard in the space above him all twenty thousand myriads of koṭis of verses of the Lotus Sutra that had been expounded by the Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja. He was able to receive and uphold them all, and immediately attained purity of the eye faculty as described above, as well as purity of the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind faculties. Having obtained the purity of these six faculties, his lifespan was extended by two hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of years, and he extensively expounded this Lotus Sutra for the people.

"At that time, those of the four assemblies of overweening pride—the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who had treated this person with contempt and given him the name Never Disparaging—saw that he had obtained great supernatural powers, the power of eloquent discourse, and the power of great meditative equipoise. When they heard what he taught, they all came to believe, submit, and follow him. This bodhisattva also converted thousands of myriads of koṭis of beings, causing them to dwell in anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"After his life ended, he encountered two thousand koṭis of Buddhas, all named Sun-Moon-Lamp Radiance. Under their Dharma he expounded this Lotus Sutra. Through this causal connection, he again encountered two thousand koṭis of Buddhas, all named Cloud-Freedom-Lamp King. Under the Dharma of these Buddhas he received, upheld, recited, and expounded this sutra for the four assemblies. Thus he obtained this constant purity of the eye, and purity of the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind faculties. Among the four assemblies he taught the Dharma without fear."

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, this Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Sadāparibhūta made offerings to such numbers of Buddhas, revering, honoring, and praising them, planting roots of virtue. Afterward he encountered thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, and under the Dharma of all these Buddhas he expounded this sutra. His merit perfected, he was destined to attain Buddhahood.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, what do you think? Could that Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta of that time have been another person? He was none other than myself. If in past lives I had not received, upheld, recited, and expounded this sutra for others, I would not have been able to speedily attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. Because at the places of former Buddhas I received, upheld, recited, and expounded this sutra for others, I speedily attained anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, at that time the four assemblies—the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās—who with angry minds treated me with contempt, did not encounter any Buddha for two hundred koṭis of kalpas. They heard no Dharma and saw no Saṅgha. For one thousand kalpas they suffered great anguish in the Avīci Hell. After their offenses were expiated, they again met the Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta, who taught them toward anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, what do you think? Could those four assemblies who constantly disparaged that bodhisattva have been other persons? They are none other than the five hundred bodhisattvas including Bhadrapāla, the five hundred bhikṣus including Lion-Moon, and the five hundred upāsakas including Thoughtful-of-Buddha now in this assembly—all of whom shall never regress from anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, you should understand that this Lotus Sutra greatly benefits all bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and enables them to reach anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. Therefore, after the Tathāgata's parinirvāṇa, all bodhisattva-mahāsattvas should always receive, uphold, recite, expound, and transcribe this sutra."


At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"In the past there was a Buddha
Named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja,
Of measureless spiritual wisdom,
Guiding and leading all beings,

Gods, humans, dragons, and spirits
Together made offerings to him.
After that Buddha's parinirvāṇa,
When the Dharma was about to end,

There was one bodhisattva
Named Never Disparaging.
At that time the four assemblies
Were attached to the Dharma.

The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging
Would approach their presence
And speak these words to them:
'I do not despise you,

For you all practice the Path
And shall all become Buddhas.'
When the people heard this,
They belittled and reviled him.

The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging
Was able to endure this patiently.
When his offenses were exhausted,
At the time of his approaching death,

He heard this sutra
And his six faculties became pure.
Through his supernatural powers
His lifespan was increased,

And again for the people
He widely expounded this sutra.
All those attached to the Dharma
Received the bodhisattva's

Instruction and perfection,
Causing them to dwell in the Buddha Path.
When Never Disparaging's life ended,
He encountered countless Buddhas.

Because he expounded this sutra
He obtained immeasurable merit,
Gradually perfecting merit and virtue,
Speedily achieving the Buddha Path.

That Never Disparaging of former times
Was none other than myself.
The four assemblies at that time—
Those attached to the Dharma—

Who heard Never Disparaging's words,
'You shall all become Buddhas,'
Through this causal condition
Encountered countless Buddhas.

The five hundred bodhisattvas
In this assembly,
Together with the four groups
Of pure believing laymen and laywomen,

Now before me
Listening to the Dharma—these are they.
In past lives I
Exhorted all these people

To hear and receive this sutra,
The foremost of all Dharmas.
I revealed and taught people,
Causing them to dwell in nirvāṇa,

Life after life upholding
Sutras such as this.
Only after koṭis upon koṭis of kalpas,
Inconceivably many,

Does one get to hear
This Lotus Sutra.
Only after koṭis upon koṭis of kalpas,
Inconceivably many,

Do the Buddhas, World-Honored Ones,
Preach this sutra.
Therefore, practitioners,
After the Buddha's parinirvāṇa,

Upon hearing such a sutra,
Should harbor no doubt.
With single-minded devotion
They should widely expound this sutra,

Life after life encountering Buddhas,
Speedily achieving the Buddha Path."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE: THE TRANSCENDENT POWERS OF THE TATHĀGATA


At that time, the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas equal in number to the dust particles of a thousand worlds, who had emerged from the earth, all with single-minded concentration joined their palms before the Buddha, gazed reverently upon his countenance, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, after the Buddha's extinction, in all the lands where the World-Honored One's emanation bodies are present, and in the places where he enters into parinirvāṇa, we shall extensively expound this sutra. For what reason? Because we ourselves also wish to obtain this true, pure, and great Dharma, to receive and maintain it, to read and recite it, to expound and explain it, to copy it in writing, and to make offerings to it."

At that time, the World-Honored One, in the presence of Mañjuśrī and the countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas who had long dwelt in the sahā world, as well as the assembly of bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, human and nonhuman beings, and all others, manifested great transcendent powers. He extended his broad and long tongue upward to the Brahma world, and from all his pores emitted countless, immeasurable beams of colored light, which universally illuminated the worlds in all ten directions. The buddhas seated upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees also did likewise, extending their broad and long tongues and emitting immeasurable light. When Śākyamuni Buddha and the buddhas beneath the jeweled trees were manifesting these transcendent powers, a full one hundred thousand years passed. Thereafter, they withdrew their tongues. At the same moment, they cleared their throats and snapped their fingers together. These two sounds reached throughout the buddha-worlds of the ten directions, and the earth in all of them quaked and trembled in six ways. The beings therein—devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, human and nonhuman beings, and others—by virtue of the Buddha's transcendent power, all beheld this sahā world with its immeasurable, limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of buddhas seated upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees, and also beheld Śākyamuni Buddha together with the Tathāgata Many Jewels, both seated upon the lion throne within the jeweled stūpa. Moreover, they beheld the immeasurable, limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and the fourfold assembly reverently surrounding Śākyamuni Buddha. Having beheld all this, they experienced great joy and obtained that which they had never before attained.

At that very moment, the devas in the air proclaimed aloud: "Beyond these immeasurable, limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of asaṃkhyeya worlds, there is a land called Sahā, wherein dwells a buddha named Śākyamuni. Now, for the sake of the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, he expounds the Great Vehicle sutra called the Lotus Blossom of the Sublime Dharma, the Dharma for Teaching Bodhisattvas, the Dharma Cherished and Protected by the Buddhas. You should all rejoice deeply in this, and should also pay reverence and make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha." When those beings heard this voice in the air, they joined their palms toward the sahā world and spoke thus: "Homage to Śākyamuni Buddha! Homage to Śākyamuni Buddha!" With various flowers, incense, necklaces, banners, canopies, and personal adornments, as well as precious and wondrous objects, they all scattered these remotely toward the sahā world. The scattered objects came from the ten directions, gathering like clouds, and were transformed into a jeweled canopy that universally covered all the buddhas assembled there. At that time, the worlds of the ten directions became perfectly penetrable without obstruction, as though they were a single buddha-land.

At that time, the Buddha addressed the great assembly of bodhisattvas led by Superior Conduct and the others: "The transcendent powers of the buddhas are thus immeasurable, limitless, and inconceivable. If I were to employ these transcendent powers to expound the merits and virtues of this sutra for the sake of entrusting it to you, doing so for immeasurable, limitless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, I still could not exhaust them. To speak concisely: all the dharmas possessed by the Tathāgata, all the sovereign transcendent powers of the Tathāgata, all the storehouse of profound essentials of the Tathāgata, all the most profound matters of the Tathāgata—all are proclaimed, revealed, and expounded in this sutra. Therefore, after the Tathāgata's extinction, you should all single-mindedly receive and maintain it, read and recite it, expound and explain it, copy it in writing, and practice according to the teachings. In whatever land there are those who receive and maintain it, read and recite it, expound and explain it, copy it in writing, and practice according to the teachings; wherever the sutra scrolls are present—whether in a garden, in a forest, beneath a tree, in a monastery, in a layman's dwelling, in a palace hall, or in mountain valleys and wilderness—in all such places, a stūpa should be erected and offerings made. For what reason? You should know that such places are the site of enlightenment, where all buddhas attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, where all buddhas turn the wheel of the Dharma, and where all buddhas enter into parinirvāṇa."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

The buddhas, saviors of the world,
Abiding in great transcendent powers,
To bring joy to all living beings,
Manifest immeasurable divine powers.

Their tongues reach to the Brahma heavens,
Their bodies emit countless rays of light;
For those who seek the Buddha's path,
They manifest these rare occurrences.

The sound of the buddhas clearing their throats
And the sound of their snapping fingers
Are heard throughout the lands of the ten directions,
And the earth everywhere quakes in six ways.

Because after the Buddha's extinction
There will be those able to maintain this sutra,
All the buddhas rejoice
And manifest immeasurable transcendent powers.

In entrusting this sutra to others,
And in praising those who receive and maintain it,
Even throughout immeasurable kalpas,
They still could not exhaust such praise.

The merits and virtues of such persons
Are boundless and without limit,
Like the void in the ten directions—
One cannot find their boundaries.

Those able to maintain this sutra
Are regarded as having already beheld me,
As well as the Buddha Many Jewels
And all the emanation buddhas.

They are also regarded as beholding me now
Teaching and transforming the bodhisattvas.
Those able to maintain this sutra
Cause me and the emanation buddhas,

As well as the extinct Buddha Many Jewels,
All to rejoice.
The buddhas presently dwelling in the ten directions,
And those of the past and future as well,

They shall also behold and make offerings to them,
And also cause them to rejoice.
The secret and essential Dharma
That the buddhas obtained while seated at the place of enlightenment—

Those able to maintain this sutra
Before long shall also obtain it.
Those able to maintain this sutra,
Regarding the meaning of all dharmas,

Names, words, and phrases,
Shall delight in expounding without exhaustion,
Like the wind in the sky
That encounters no obstacles whatsoever.

After the Tathāgata's extinction,
They shall know the sutras expounded by the Buddha,
Their causes and conditions and proper sequence,
And expound them truthfully in accord with their meaning,

Like the light of the sun and moon
That dispels all darkness.
Such persons moving through the world
Are able to extinguish the darkness of living beings,

Teaching immeasurable bodhisattvas
To ultimately abide in the One Vehicle.
Therefore, those possessed of wisdom,
Hearing of these merits and benefits,

After my extinction
Should receive and maintain this sutra.
Such persons, regarding the Buddha path,
Decidedly shall harbor no doubts whatsoever.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO: ENTRUSTMENT

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha arose from his Dharma seat and manifested great supernatural power. With his right hand, he rubbed the heads of the immeasurable bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and spoke these words: "Throughout immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, I have cultivated and practiced this Dharma of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, which is difficult to attain. Now I entrust it to you all. You should single-mindedly propagate this Dharma and cause it to increase extensively."

In this manner, three times he rubbed the heads of the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and spoke these words: "Throughout immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, I have cultivated and practiced this Dharma of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, which is difficult to attain. Now I entrust it to you all. You should receive, uphold, recite, and extensively proclaim this Dharma, causing all sentient beings universally to hear and know it. Why is this so? The Tathāgata possesses great compassion. He is without stinginess or parsimony and is also without fear. He is able to bestow upon sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom, the Tathāgata's wisdom, and the self-arising wisdom. The Tathāgata is the great benefactor of all sentient beings. You also should follow and study the Tathāgata's Dharma and not give rise to stinginess. In future ages, if there are good men or good women who have faith in the Tathāgata's wisdom, you should expound this Lotus Sutra for them, enabling them to hear and know it, so as to cause such persons to attain the Buddha's wisdom. If there are sentient beings who do not believe and accept it, then among the Tathāgata's other profound Dharmas you should instruct, benefit, and gladden them. If you are able to do this, then you will have already repaid the kindness of all buddhas."

At that time, when the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas heard what the Buddha had said, they were all filled with great joy throughout their bodies. With ever-increasing reverence, they bent their bodies, lowered their heads, joined their palms toward the Buddha, and with one voice proclaimed: "We shall carry out all that the World-Honored One has commanded. Yes, World-Honored One, may you have no concern." The assembly of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in this manner three times with one voice proclaimed: "We shall carry out all that the World-Honored One has commanded. Yes, World-Honored One, may you have no concern."

Then Śākyamuni Buddha caused the buddhas who were his emanations and had come from the ten directions each to return to their original lands, saying: "May each buddha proceed according to his ease. The stūpa of Many Jewels Buddha may also return to its former state." When he spoke these words, the immeasurable emanation buddhas from the ten directions who were seated upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees, as well as Many Jewels Buddha, and the boundless and asaṃkhyeya great assembly of bodhisattvas such as Superior Conduct, as well as Śāriputra and others of the śrāvaka assembly and the fourfold congregation, together with all the worlds—the gods, humans, asuras, and others—hearing what the Buddha had said, all rejoiced greatly.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE: THE FORMER LIVES OF THE BODHISATTVA MEDICINE KING

At that time, the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, how does the Bodhisattva Medicine King travel throughout the sahā world? World-Honored One, this Bodhisattva Medicine King has undergone countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of difficult practices and ascetic disciplines. Excellent, World-Honored One! We pray that you will expound this matter briefly." All the devas, nāgas, spirits, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, beings human and nonhuman, as well as bodhisattvas who had come from other lands, and the assembly of śrāvakas present—all rejoiced to hear this.

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower: "In ages past, immeasurable Ganges sand kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Tathāgata, One Worthy of Offerings, One of Right and Universal Knowledge, One Perfect in Clarity and Conduct, Well Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. That Buddha had eight billion great bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and seventy-two Ganges sands of great śrāvaka disciples. The Buddha's lifespan was forty-two thousand kalpas, and the bodhisattvas' lifespans were equal to that. In that land there were no women, no hells, no hungry ghosts, no animals, no asuras, and none of the various difficulties. The ground was level as a palm, composed of lapis lazuli. Jeweled trees adorned it; jeweled canopies covered it from above; jeweled banners and streamers hung down; jeweled vessels and incense burners filled the entire realm. There were platforms of seven jewels—one tree, one platform—and each tree was the distance of an arrow's flight from its platform. Beneath all these jeweled trees sat bodhisattvas and śrāvakas. Upon each of the jeweled platforms, ten billion devas played celestial music, singing hymns to the Buddha as an offering."

"At that time, that Buddha expounded the Lotus Sutra for the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana, for the assembly of bodhisattvas, and for the śrāvaka disciples. This Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana delighted in practicing ascetic disciplines. Within the Dharma of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, he practiced vigorously, single-mindedly seeking buddhahood. After twelve thousand years had passed, he attained the samādhi of the manifestation of all physical forms. Having attained this samādhi, his heart was greatly joyful, and he immediately thought: 'My attainment of the samādhi of the manifestation of all physical forms has come entirely through the power of hearing the Lotus Sutra. I must now make offerings to Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha and to the Lotus Sutra.' He then entered into this samādhi, and in the空中, he caused mandārava flowers and mahā-mandārava flowers to rain down, along with finely powdered solid black sandalwood, filling the空 and descending like clouds. Moreover, he caused sandalwood from the shores of the sea to rain down—this incense, worth six śu, had the value of an entire sahā world—all as an offering to the Buddha."

"After making this offering, he arose from samādhi and thought to himself: 'Though I have made offerings to the Buddha through supernatural powers, this does not compare to making an offering with my body.' He then ingested various fragrances—sandalwood, frankincense, turushka, pṛkkā, aloeswood, and resin incense—and drank the fragrant oils of campaka and other flowers. After twelve hundred years had passed, he anointed his body with fragrant oils, and in the presence of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, wrapped himself in celestial jeweled garments, poured fragrant oils over himself, and through the power of his supernatural vows, set his own body aflame. The radiance illuminated eighty koṭis of Ganges sand worlds. Within those worlds, all the buddhas simultaneously praised him, saying: 'Excellent, excellent, good man! This is true vigor; this is called the true Dharma offering to the Tathāgata. Though one may make offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, burning incense, powdered incense, paste incense, celestial silks, banners, canopies, and sandalwood from the shores of the sea—all such various things as offerings—none can equal this. Even should one give in charity one's kingdom, cities, wife, and children, still it cannot compare. Good man, this is called the foremost gift, the most honored and supreme among all gifts, for it is a Dharma offering to all the tathāgatas.' Having spoken thus, each fell silent. His body burned with flames for twelve hundred years. After that time had passed, his body was completely consumed. After the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana had made this Dharma offering, his life ended, and he was reborn in the land of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, spontaneously appearing in the household of King Pure Virtue, seated in full lotus posture, suddenly manifesting by transformation. Immediately he spoke a verse for his father:

Great king, you should know this now:
While I practiced walking there,
I straightaway attained the samādhi
Of manifesting all physical forms.

I practiced great vigorous effort,
Abandoned my beloved body,
Made offering to the World-Honored One,
Seeking the supreme wisdom.

"After speaking this verse, he addressed his father: 'Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha still abides in the world at present. Previously, after making offerings to that Buddha, I obtained the dhāraṇī of understanding the languages of all living beings. Moreover, I have heard this Lotus Sutra—eight hundred thousand myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kiṃkaras, viṃvaras, and aupāśas of verses. Great king, I must now return to make offerings to that Buddha.' Having spoken thus, he sat upon a platform of seven jewels, ascended into the空中 to a height of seven tāla trees, went to where the Buddha was, bowed his head to the Buddha's feet, joined his ten fingernails together, and praised the Buddha in verse:

Your countenance is most wondrous and sublime,
Your radiance illuminates the ten directions;
I but recently made offerings to you,
And now I have returned to behold you again.

"At that time, the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana, having spoken this verse, addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the World-Honored One still abides in the world.' Then Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana: 'Good man, the time of my nirvāṇa has arrived; the time of extinction is at hand. You may arrange the bed and seat; tonight I shall enter nirvāṇa.' He further commanded the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana: 'Good man, I entrust to you the Buddha Dharma, as well as all the bodhisattvas and great disciples, together with the Dharma of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. I also entrust to you the great trichiliocosm of seven-jeweled worlds, the jeweled trees, jeweled platforms, and the devas in attendance. After my extinction, my śarīra relics I also entrust to you. You must cause them to be distributed and widely venerated. You should erect many thousands of stūpas.' Having thus commanded the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana, Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha entered nirvāṇa in the latter part of that night."

"At that time, the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana, seeing the Buddha's extinction, felt grief, anguish, and longing for the Buddha. He then used sandalwood from the shores of the sea as fuel for the pyre, made offerings to the Buddha's body, and cremated it. After the fire had died out, he gathered the śarīra relics, made eighty-four thousand jeweled vessels, and erected eighty-four thousand stūpas as tall as three worlds, adorned with towering banners and canopies, and hung with numerous jeweled bells."

"At that time, the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana again thought to himself: 'Though I have made these offerings, my heart is still not satisfied. I must now make further offerings to the śarīra relics.' He then addressed the bodhisattvas, great disciples, as well as the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, and the entire great assembly: 'You should all concentrate your minds. I shall now make offerings to the śarīra relics of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha.' Having spoken thus, he immediately burned his arms adorned with a hundred merits before the eighty-four thousand stūpas for seventy-two thousand years as an offering. This caused innumerable persons seeking the śrāvaka path and immeasurable asaṃkhyeyas of people to generate the mind of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, and all were enabled to abide in the samādhi of the manifestation of all physical forms."

"At that time, the bodhisattvas, devas, humans, asuras, and others, seeing him without arms, became distressed, sorrowful, and grieving, and spoke thus: 'This Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana is our teacher, the one who instructs us, yet now he has burned his arms and his body is incomplete.' At that moment, the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana made this vow before the great assembly: 'Having sacrificed both my arms, I shall certainly attain the Buddha's golden-hued body. If this is truly not false, may my two arms be restored as before.' Having made this vow, they were naturally restored, due to the pure and deep merit, virtue, and wisdom of that bodhisattva. At that time, the great trichiliocosm quaked in six ways, and heaven rained jeweled flowers. All humans and devas experienced what they had never experienced before."

The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower: "What is your opinion? Was the Bodhisattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana some other person? He is none other than the present Bodhisattva Medicine King. The number of times he has sacrificed his body in charity is thus immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas. Constellation King Flower, if there are those who have generated the aspiration to attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi and are able to burn a finger or even a single toe as an offering to a buddha stūpa, this surpasses offering one's kingdom, cities, wife, and children, as well as all the mountains, forests, rivers, ponds, and precious treasures of the great trichiliocosm. Moreover, if someone fills the great trichiliocosm with the seven jewels and makes offerings to the Buddha, to the great bodhisattvas, to the pratyekabuddhas, and to the arhats, the merit that person obtains does not compare to accepting and upholding this Lotus Sutra, even a single four-line verse of it; that merit is greatest of all."

"Constellation King Flower, just as among all streams, rivers, and waters, the ocean is foremost, so too is this Lotus Sutra the most profound and great among all the sutras expounded by the tathāgatas. Just as among all mountains—earth mountains, black mountains, the small Iron Ring Mountains, the great Iron Ring Mountains, and the ten jeweled mountains—Mount Sumeru is foremost, so too is this Lotus Sutra supreme among all sutras. Just as among all the stars, the moon deity is foremost, so too is this Lotus Sutra the most illuminating among thousands of myriads of koṭis of kinds of sutra dharmas. Just as the sun deity can dispel all darkness, so too can this sutra destroy all darkness of unwholesomeness. Just as among all lesser kings, the wheel-turning sage king is foremost, so too is this sutra the most honored among all sutras. Just as Śakra is king among the thirty-three devas, so too is this sutra king among all sutras. Just as the great Brahmā king is father of all living beings, so too is this sutra father of all worthies and sages, learners and non-learners, and those who have generated the bodhisattva mind. Just as among all ordinary persons, the stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, arhat, and pratyekabuddha are foremost, so too is this sutra foremost among all sutras expounded by tathāgatas, bodhisattvas, or śrāvakas. One who is able to accept and uphold this scripture is likewise foremost among all living beings. Among all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, the bodhisattva is foremost; so too is this sutra foremost among all sutra dharmas. Just as the Buddha is king of all dharmas, so too is this sutra king among all sutras."

"Constellation King Flower, this sutra can save all living beings; this sutra can enable all living beings to separate from all sufferings and distress; this sutra can greatly benefit all living beings and fulfill their wishes. Like a cool pond that can satisfy all who are thirsty and parched; like one who is cold obtaining fire; like one who is naked obtaining clothing; like a merchant obtaining a leader; like a child obtaining its mother; like one who would cross over obtaining a boat; like one who is ill obtaining a physician; like one in darkness obtaining a lamp; like one who is poor obtaining treasure; like the people obtaining a king; like a merchant obtaining the sea; like a torch dispelling darkness—so too is this Lotus Sutra able to enable living beings to separate from all suffering and all illness, able to release all the bonds of birth and death. If a person hears this Lotus Sutra and either copies it himself or causes others to copy it, the merit obtained—even were one to measure it with the Buddha's wisdom—could not reach its limit. If one copies this sutra and makes offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, burning incense, powdered incense, paste incense, banners, canopies, garments, and various kinds of lamps—ghee lamps, oil lamps, lamps of various fragrant oils, campaka oil lamps, sumanas oil lamps, pāṭala oil lamps, vārṣika oil lamps, and navamallikā oil lamps—the merit obtained is likewise immeasurable."

"Constellation King Flower, if anyone hears this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King, that person also obtains immeasurable and boundless merit. If any woman hears this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King and is able to accept and uphold it, this shall be the end of her female body, and she shall not receive it again. If, after the extinction of the Tathāgata, in the latter five hundred years, any woman hears this scripture and practices according to its teachings, when her life ends she shall immediately proceed to the Land of Peace and Bliss, where Amitābha Buddha and the assembly of great bodhisattvas dwell, and be born within a lotus flower upon a jeweled throne. She shall no longer be tormented by desire, nor shall she be tormented by anger or delusion, nor shall she be tormented by arrogance, jealousy, or other defilements. She shall obtain the bodhisattva's supernatural powers and the tolerance of the non-arising of dharmas. Having obtained this tolerance, her eye faculty shall become pure. With this pure eye faculty, she shall see seven million two hundred thousand koṭis of nayutas of Ganges sand tathāgatas. At that time, those buddhas shall praise her from afar, saying: 'Excellent, excellent, good man! You have been able to accept, uphold, read, recite, and contemplate this sutra within the Dharma of Śākyamuni Buddha, and expound it for others. The merit you have obtained is immeasurable and boundless. Fire cannot burn it; water cannot sweep it away. Your merit is such that even a thousand buddhas speaking together could not exhaust it. You have now been able to destroy all demonic adversaries and to demolish the army of birth and death; all other enemies have been entirely vanquished. Good man, hundreds of thousands of buddhas, by their supernatural powers, protect you together. Among all in the worlds of devas and humans, there is none like you, except only the Tathāgata. As for the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and even bodhisattvas, in wisdom and meditative concentration, none are equal to you.' Constellation King Flower, this bodhisattva achieves such power of merit, virtue, and wisdom."

"If anyone hears this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King and is able to rejoice and praise it, in the present world that person's mouth shall constantly emit the fragrance of blue lotus flowers, and from the pores of that person's body shall constantly issue the fragrance of ox-head sandalwood. The merit obtained is as described above. Therefore, Constellation King Flower, I entrust this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King to you. After my extinction, in the latter five hundred years, widely proclaim and propagate it throughout Jambudvīpa. Do not allow it to be cut off, lest evil demons, demonic people, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, kumbhāṇḍas, and others gain advantage."

"Constellation King Flower, you must use your supernatural powers to protect this sutra. Why is this so? This sutra is the excellent medicine for the illnesses of the people of Jambudvīpa. If a person is ill and hears this sutra, the illness shall immediately be eliminated, and that person shall not grow old or die. Constellation King Flower, if you see someone who accepts and upholds this sutra, you should take blue lotus flowers filled with powdered incense and scatter them over that person. After scattering them, think thus: 'Before long, this person shall certainly take up grass, sit upon the place of enlightenment, defeat the demonic armies, sound the Dharma conch, strike the great Dharma drum, and ferry all living beings across the sea of old age, sickness, and death.' Therefore, those who seek the Buddha path, upon seeing a person who accepts and upholds this scripture, should thus generate a mind of reverence."

When this Chapter on the Former Lives of the Bodhisattva Medicine King was expounded, eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas obtained the dhāraṇī of understanding the languages of all living beings. The Tathāgata Many Jewels, from within the jeweled stūpa, praised the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower, saying: "Excellent, excellent, Constellation King Flower! You have achieved inconceivable merit and virtue in being able to question Śākyamuni Buddha about such matters, thereby benefiting immeasurable multitudes of living beings."

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR: THE BODHISATTVA WONDERFUL SOUND

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha emitted great light from the mark of the fleshy protuberance upon his head, one of the thirty-two major characteristics, and also emitted light from the white tuft between his eyebrows, illuminating throughout the eastern direction one hundred eighty myriads of koṭīs of nayutas of Ganges' sands of buddha-worlds. Beyond this number, there was a world named Pure Light Adorned. In that land there was a buddha named Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Thus Come One, Worthy of Offerings, One of Right and Universal Knowledge, One Perfected in Clarity and Conduct, Well Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Heavenly and Human Beings, Buddha, World-Honored One, who was expounding the Dharma, reverently surrounded by immeasurable and boundless assemblies of bodhisattvas and great multitudes. The white tuft light of Śākyamuni Buddha illuminated throughout that land.

At that time, in the land of Pure Light Adorned, there was a bodhisattva named Wonderful Sound who had long since planted the roots of manifold virtue, made offerings to and drawn near to immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭīs of buddhas, and had fully perfected exceedingly profound wisdom. He had attained the Wonderful Banner Characteristic Samādhi, the Dharma Flower Samādhi, the Pure Virtue Samādhi, the Constellation King Sport Samādhi, the Samādhi Without Conditions, the Wisdom Seal Samādhi, the Samādhi of Understanding All Sentient Beings' Languages, the Samādhi of Assembling All Merit, the Pure Samādhi, the Samādhi of Supernatural Powers' Sport, the Wisdom Torch Samādhi, the King of Adornment Samādhi, the Pure Light Samādhi, the Pure Treasury Samādhi, the Unshared Samādhi, the Sun Rotation Samādhi—he had attained such great samādhis as these, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭīs of Ganges' sands in number. When the light of Śākyamuni Buddha illuminated his body, he forthwith addressed Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I should go to the Sahā world to pay reverence, draw near, and make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha, and also to see Mañjuśrī, Dharma Prince and Son of the Dharma King, the Bodhisattva Medicine King, the Bodhisattva Brave Donation, the Bodhisattva Constellation King Flower, the Bodhisattva Superior Conduct and Intent, the Bodhisattva King of Adornment, and the Bodhisattva Superior Medicine."

At that time, Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha spoke to the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound: "You must not slight that land or give rise to thoughts of inferiority. Good man, that Sahā world is uneven and irregular, with earth, stones, and various mountains; it is filled with filth and evil. The Buddha's body is diminutive, and the assembly of bodhisattvas likewise has small forms. Yet your body measures forty-two thousand yojanas in height, while my body measures six million eight hundred thousand yojanas. Your body is supremely handsome, having hundreds of thousands of myriads of blessings, and your radiance is especially wondrous. Therefore, when you go there, you must not slight that land—whether buddha, bodhisattvas, or the land itself—do not give rise to thoughts of inferiority." The Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound addressed his buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, that I now go to the Sahā world is entirely due to the Thus Come One's power, the Thus Come One's supernatural powers' sport, and the Thus Come One's merit, wisdom, and adornment." Thereupon, the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound, without rising from his seat and without his body stirring, entered into samādhi. Through the power of samādhi, at Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain, not far from the Dharma seat, he magically created eighty-four thousand jeweled lotus flowers with stems of Jambūnada gold, leaves of silver, pistils of diamond, and platforms of mahāmaṇi-ratna jewels.

At that time, Mañjuśrī, Dharma Prince and Son of the Dharma King, seeing these lotus flowers, addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, what causes and conditions have brought about this auspicious portent? There are several thousands of myriads of lotus flowers with stems of Jambūnada gold, leaves of silver, pistils of diamond, and platforms of mahāmaṇi-ratna jewels." At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha told Mañjuśrī: "It is the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound who, together with eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas surrounding him, desires to come from the land of Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha to this Sahā world to make offerings, draw near, and pay reverence to me, and also desires to make offerings and hear the Dharma Flower Sutra."

Mañjuśrī addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, what good roots has this bodhisattva planted? What merit has he cultivated to possess such great supernatural powers? What samādhi does he practice? I pray that you will expound for us the name of this samādhi. We also wish to diligently cultivate and practice it. Practicing this samādhi, we shall be able to see this bodhisattva's physical characteristics, his size, his majestic deportment, and his comings and goings. I only pray that the World-Honored One, through supernatural powers, will cause that bodhisattva to come so that we may see him." At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha told Mañjuśrī: "This Tathāgata Many Jewels, who long ago entered extinction, shall manifest his form for you."

At that time, Many Jewels Buddha spoke to that bodhisattva: "Good man, come. Mañjuśrī, Dharma Prince and Son of the Dharma King, desires to see your body." Thereupon, the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound vanished from that land and, together with eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas, set forth to come here. In all the lands through which they passed, there were the six kinds of earthquakes, and jeweled lotus flowers of the seven treasures rained down everywhere; hundreds of thousands of heavenly musical instruments sounded without being struck. The eyes of this bodhisattva were like broad and great blue lotus petals; even if one were to combine the faces of hundreds of thousands of myriads of moons, his countenance was still more handsome than these. His body was the color of true gold, adorned with immeasurable hundreds of thousands of meritorious attributes. His威德 was blazing with intensity, his radiance illuminating all around. He possessed all the bodily characteristics perfectly, like Nārāyaṇa's firm and solid body. He entered a platform of the seven jewels and ascended into the sky to a height of seven tāla trees. Surrounded reverently by the assembly of bodhisattvas, he came to this Sahā world, to Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain.

Having arrived, he descended from the platform of the seven jewels, took a necklace worth hundreds of thousands, brought it before Śākyamuni Buddha, touched his head to the Buddha's feet in reverence, presented the necklace as an offering, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha inquires of the World-Honored One: Are you free from illness and affliction? Are your daily activities light and comfortable? Are you dwelling in peace and happiness? Are the four elements in harmony? Are worldly matters bearable? Are sentient beings easy to save? Do they not have excessive greed, hatred, delusion, jealousy, and arrogant pride? Do they not show disrespect to father and mother or fail to honor śramaṇas? Do they not hold wrong views, unwholesome thoughts, or fail to control the five sense faculties? World-Honored One, are sentient beings able to subdue the enmity of all māras? Has the Tathāgata Many Jewels, who long ago entered extinction, come in his seven-jeweled stūpa to hear the Dharma? He also inquires of the Tathāgata Many Jewels: Is he dwelling peacefully with few afflictions? Can he patiently endure to abide for long? World-Honored One, I now wish to see the body of Many Jewels Buddha. I only pray that the World-Honored One will show him to me so that I may see him."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha spoke to Many Jewels Buddha: "This Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound desires to see you." At that time, Many Jewels Buddha told Wonderful Sound: "Excellent, excellent! You have been able to come here for the sake of making offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha, hearing the Dharma Flower Sutra, and seeing Mañjuśrī and others."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, what good roots has this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound planted? What merit has he cultivated to possess such supernatural powers?" The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue: "In the past there was a buddha named Cloud Thunder Sound King Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-Saṃbuddha. His land was named Manifesting All Worlds. The kalpa was named Joyfully Seen. The Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound, for twelve thousand years, used one hundred thousand kinds of musical performances to make offerings to Cloud Thunder Sound King Buddha, and also presented eighty-four thousand bowls of the seven jewels. As a consequence of these causes and conditions and their karmic rewards, he was now born in the land of Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha and possesses these supernatural powers. Flower Virtue, what do you think? Was the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound who, at that time in the presence of Cloud Thunder Sound King Buddha, made offerings with musical performances and presented jeweled vessels anyone else? It is this present Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound. Flower Virtue, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound has already made offerings to and drawn near to immeasurable buddhas, long ago planted the roots of virtue, and has also encountered hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭīs of nayutas of buddhas equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River."

"Flower Virtue, you merely see the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound with his body present here, yet this bodhisattva manifests various bodies everywhere, expounding this sutra for assemblies of sentient beings. Sometimes he manifests the body of King Brahmā, sometimes the body of Śakra, sometimes the body of the Īśvara deity, sometimes the body of Maheśvara deity, sometimes the body of a great heavenly general, sometimes the body of Vaiśravaṇa Heavenly King, sometimes the body of a wheel-turning sage king, sometimes the bodies of lesser kings, sometimes the body of an elder, sometimes the body of a householder, sometimes the body of a government minister, sometimes the body of a brāhmaṇa, sometimes the bodies of a bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī, upāsaka, or upāsikā, sometimes the body of the wife of an elder or householder, sometimes the body of the wife of a government minister, sometimes the body of the wife of a brāhmaṇa, sometimes the bodies of boys or girls, sometimes the bodies of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and so forth, and expounds this sutra. All those in hells, among hungry ghosts, among animals, and in places of difficulty—he is able to rescue them all. Even in the inner palaces of kings, he transforms into a woman's body and expounds this sutra."

"Flower Virtue, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound is able to rescue and protect the sentient beings of the Sahā world. This Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound manifests transformations of various bodies in this manner throughout the Sahā land, expounding this sutra for assemblies of sentient beings, yet his supernatural powers, transformations, and wisdom suffer no diminishment whatsoever. Through his various kinds of wisdom, this bodhisattva illuminates the Sahā world, causing all sentient beings each to attain what they need to know. And in the worlds throughout the ten directions, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, he likewise does the same. If one should be saved by the form of a śrāvaka, he manifests a śrāvaka's form and expounds the Dharma for them. If one should be saved by the form of a pratyekabuddha, he manifests a pratyekabuddha's form and expounds the Dharma for them. If one should be saved by the form of a bodhisattva, he manifests a bodhisattva's form and expounds the Dharma for them. If one should be saved by the form of a buddha, he immediately manifests a buddha's form and expounds the Dharma for them. In this manner, he variously manifests whatever form is appropriate for saving beings. Even for those who should be saved through extinction, he demonstrates extinction. Flower Virtue, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound has accomplished the power of great supernatural penetrations and wisdom. His deeds are such as these."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, this Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound has deeply planted good roots. World-Honored One, in what samādhi does this bodhisattva dwell such that he is able to manifest transformations everywhere in this manner and save sentient beings?" The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue: "Good man, that samādhi is named the Manifestation of All Physical Bodies. The Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound, dwelling in this samādhi, is able to benefit immeasurable multitudes of sentient beings in this manner." When this chapter on the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound was expounded, the eighty-four thousand persons who had come together with the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound all attained the Samādhi of Manifesting All Physical Bodies. The immeasurable bodhisattvas in this Sahā world also attained this samādhi and the dhāraṇīs.

At that time, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Wonderful Sound, having made offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha and the stūpa of Many Jewels Buddha, returned to his original land. In all the lands through which he passed, there were the six kinds of earthquakes, jeweled lotus flowers rained down, and hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭīs of varieties of musical performances were played. Upon arriving at his original land, together with the eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas surrounding him, he went before Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I went to the Sahā world and benefited sentient beings. I saw Śākyamuni Buddha and saw the stūpa of Many Jewels Buddha, paid reverence and made offerings. I also saw Mañjuśrī, Dharma Prince and Son of the Dharma King, as well as the Bodhisattva Medicine King, the Bodhisattva Attained Through Diligent Vigorous Effort, the Bodhisattva Brave Donation, and others. I also caused these eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas to attain the Samādhi of Manifesting All Physical Bodies." When this chapter on the comings and goings of the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound was expounded, forty-two thousand sons of heaven attained the Patience of the Non-Arising of Dharmas, and the Bodhisattva Flower Virtue attained the Dharma Flower Samādhi.

CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE: THE UNIVERSAL GATEWAY OF THE BODHISATTVA AVALOKITEŚVARA

At that time, the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati immediately rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, joined his palms toward the Buddha, and spoke these words: "World-Honored One, for what cause and condition is the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara called Avalokiteśvara?"

The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati: "Good son, if there are immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of sentient beings who are suffering various afflictions, and they hear of this Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and single-mindedly call upon his name, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will immediately perceive the sounds of their voices, and they shall all attain deliverance. If there are those who uphold the name of this Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, should they enter into a great fire, the fire will be unable to burn them, by virtue of the majestic spiritual power of this bodhisattva. If they are being swept away by great waters and call upon his name, they will immediately reach the shallows. If there are hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of sentient beings who, seeking for gold, silver, lapis lazuli, giant clam shell, carnelian, coral, amber, pearls, and other treasures, enter upon the great ocean, and even if a black wind should blow their ships and boats, casting them adrift into the lands of the rākṣasa demons—if among them there is even one person who calls upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, all those people shall attain deliverance from the difficulties posed by the rākṣasas. For this cause and condition, he is called Avalokiteśvara."

"If again there are persons who are about to be harmed and they call upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, the swords and staves that their assailants hold will immediately break into pieces, and they shall attain deliverance. If the lands of a great trichiliocosm were filled with yakṣas and rākṣasas who wished to come and torment people, should these people hear them calling upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, these evil demons would not even be able to look upon them with evil eyes, much less cause them harm. If again there are persons, whether guilty or innocent, whose bodies are fettered with stocks, chains, manacles, and bonds, and they call upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, all these restraints shall be severed and broken, and they will immediately attain deliverance. If the lands of a great trichiliocosm were filled with adversaries and bandits, and there was a merchant leader guiding a caravan of merchants, carrying precious treasures and passing through dangerous roads, and if among them one person spoke these words of proclamation: 'Good sons, do not be fearful. You should all single-mindedly call upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. This bodhisattva is able to bestow fearlessness upon sentient beings. If you call upon his name, you shall attain deliverance from these adversaries and bandits.' When the merchants heard this, they raised their voices together, saying: 'Homage to the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara!' Because they called upon his name, they immediately attained deliverance."

"Akṣayamati, the majestic spiritual power of the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is sublime and exalted in this manner. If there are sentient beings who are given to excessive sensual desire, and they constantly recollect and venerate the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with reverence, they will attain freedom from desire. If they are given to excessive anger, and they constantly recollect and venerate the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with reverence, they will attain freedom from anger. If they are given to excessive folly, and they constantly recollect and venerate the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with reverence, they will attain freedom from folly. Akṣayamati, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara possesses such great majestic spiritual power and bestows abundant benefit; therefore, sentient beings should constantly bear him in mind. If there is a woman who wishes to seek a male child, and she worships and makes offerings to the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, she will give birth to a son endowed with merit, virtue, and wisdom. If she wishes to seek a female child, she will give birth to a daughter of upright appearance and auspicious features, one who has planted roots of virtue in past lives and is beloved and respected by all people. Akṣayamati, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara possesses such power. If there are sentient beings who venerate and worship the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with reverence, their merit will not be expended in vain. Therefore, all sentient beings should uphold the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara."

"Akṣayamati, if there is a person who upholds the names of bodhisattvas numbering as many as sixty-two koṭis of Ganges sands, and furthermore exhausts his bodily form in making offerings of food and drink, clothing, bedding, and medicine—what is your opinion? Would the merit and virtue of this good son or good daughter be abundant or not?"

Akṣayamati said: "Extremely abundant, World-Honored One."

The Buddha said: "If again there is a person who upholds the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, and even for but a single moment worships and makes offerings, the merit of these two persons is precisely equal without difference, and cannot be exhausted throughout hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas. Akṣayamati, upholding the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara brings the benefits of such immeasurable and boundless merit and virtue."

The Bodhisattva Akṣayamati addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, how does the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara travel throughout this sahā world? How does he expound the Dharma for sentient beings? What is the nature of his skillful means and power?"

The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati: "Good son, if there are sentient beings in any land who should be saved by means of a buddha body, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara immediately manifests a buddha body and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of a pratyekabuddha body, he immediately manifests a pratyekabuddha body and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of a śrāvaka body, he immediately manifests a śrāvaka body and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of Brahmā, the king of gods, he immediately manifests the body of Brahmā and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of Śakra, he immediately manifests the body of Śakra and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of the Īśvara deity, he immediately manifests the body of the Īśvara deity and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of the Maheśvara deity, he immediately manifests the body of the Maheśvara deity and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a great heavenly general, he immediately manifests the body of a great heavenly general and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of Vaiśravaṇa, he immediately manifests the body of Vaiśravaṇa and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a minor king, he immediately manifests the body of a minor king and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of an elder, he immediately manifests the body of an elder and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a householder, he immediately manifests the body of a householder and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a chief minister, he immediately manifests the body of a chief minister and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a brahman, he immediately manifests the body of a brahman and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the bodies of a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman, he immediately manifests the bodies of a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of the wife of an elder, householder, chief minister, or brahman, he immediately manifests a female body and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a boy or girl, he immediately manifests the body of a boy or girl and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the bodies of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and so forth, he immediately manifests all of them and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a vajra-bearing spirit, he immediately manifests the body of a vajra-bearing spirit and expounds the Dharma for them."

"Akṣayamati, this Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara has accomplished such meritorious virtues, and with various forms travels throughout the lands of all directions, delivering sentient beings. Therefore, you should all single-mindedly make offerings to the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. This Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is able to bestow fearlessness in the midst of terrifying and urgent difficulties. For this reason, all in this sahā world call him the Bestower of Fearlessness."

The Bodhisattva Akṣayamati addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I shall now make an offering to the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara." He then removed from his neck a necklace of precious jeweled beads valued at hundreds of thousands of taels of gold, and presented it to him, saying: "Venerable One, receive this gift of Dharma, this precious jeweled necklace." At that time, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara was unwilling to accept it. Akṣayamati again addressed the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, saying: "Venerable One, out of compassion for us, receive this necklace."

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara: "Out of compassion for this Bodhisattva Akṣayamati and the fourfold assembly—the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and so forth—receive this necklace."

Immediately the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, out of compassion for the fourfold assembly and for the devas, nāgas, humans, non-humans, and so forth, received the necklace and divided it into two portions. One portion he offered to Śākyamuni Buddha, and one portion he offered to the stūpa of the Buddha Many Jewels. "Akṣayamati, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara possesses such sovereign spiritual power in traveling throughout the sahā world."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati posed this question in verse:

     World-Honored One, replete with wondrous features,
     I now ask again of him:
     For what cause and condition
     Is the son of the Buddha called Avalokiteśvara?

The Honored One, replete with wondrous features, answered Akṣayamati in verse:

     Hear now of Avalokiteśvara's conduct,
     How skillfully he responds in all quarters.
     His vast vow is deep as the ocean;
     Throughout kalpas inconceivable, he has
     Attended upon many thousands of koṭis of buddhas,
     And has made great pure vows.

     I shall explain to you in brief:
     Hearing his name and seeing his body,
     Bearing him in mind does not pass in vain,
     For he can extinguish the sufferings of all forms of existence.

     Even if someone with harmful intent
     Should push you into a great pit of fire,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     The pit of fire will transform into a pool.

     Or if you are drifting on the vast ocean,
     With dangers from dragons, fish, and demons,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     The waves will be unable to drown you.

     Or if from the peak of Mount Sumeru
     Someone should push you down,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     You will abide in space like the sun.

     Or if you are pursued by evil persons
     And fall from Diamond Mountain,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     Not a single hair will be harmed.

     Or if you encounter hostile bandits surrounding you,
     Each wielding swords to cause harm,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     All will immediately give rise to compassionate minds.

     Or if you suffer the distress of royal punishment,
     Your life about to end at the execution ground,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     The swords will immediately break into pieces.

     Or if you are imprisoned in cangue and chains,
     Your hands and feet bound in fetters,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     You will be freely released and attain deliverance.

     When mantras, curses, and various poisons
     Are intended to harm your body,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     They will return to afflict the original person.

     Or if you encounter evil rākṣasas,
     Poisonous dragons, demons, and the like,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     At that time none will dare to harm you.

     If you are surrounded by fierce beasts
     With sharp fangs and claws, dreadful to behold,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     They will swiftly flee to the boundless distance.

     When venomous serpents and vipers,
     Their poisonous breath blazing like smoke and fire,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     Will turn back at the sound of his name.

     When clouds thunder with rolling drums and flashing lightning,
     Hail falling and great rains pouring down,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     These will instantly be dispersed and dissipated.

     When sentient beings are oppressed by distress,
     Immeasurable sufferings pressing upon their bodies,
     The power of Avalokiteśvara's wondrous wisdom
     Can rescue the suffering of the world.

     Replete with the power of supernatural penetrations,
     Extensively cultivating wisdom and skillful means,
     In the lands of the ten directions,
     There is no realm where he does not manifest his body.

     The various evil destinies—
     The hells, the realms of hungry ghosts and animals,
     The sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death—
     He gradually causes all to be extinguished.

     True perception, pure perception,
     Perception of vast and great wisdom,
     Perception of compassion and perception of kindness—
     May we constantly vow to venerate and behold them.

     Stainless and pure radiance,
     The sun of wisdom that breaks through all darkness,
     Able to subdue the winds and fires of calamity,
     Universally illuminating the world with brightness.

     The precepts embodying compassion shake like thunder;
     The mind of kindness, a wondrous great cloud,
     Raining down the sweet dew of Dharma rain,
     Extinguishing the flames of afflictions.

     In disputes passing through the courts,
     Or in the terror of battle arrays,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     All enemies will completely withdraw and scatter.

     Wondrous Voice, Avalokiteśvara,
     Voice of Brahmā, Voice of the Ocean Tide,
     Surpassing all worldly voices—
     Therefore one must constantly be mindful of him.

     Moment by moment, give rise to no doubt.
     Avalokiteśvara, pure and sagely,
     In the distress of suffering and the peril of death,
     Is able to serve as a refuge and protection.

     Replete with all meritorious virtues,
     With compassionate eyes beholding sentient beings,
     His accumulation of merit is an immeasurable ocean.
     Therefore, one should bow in reverence to him.

At that time, the Bodhisattva Dharaṇīṃdhara immediately rose from his seat, came forward, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, if there are sentient beings who hear this chapter on the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara—of his sovereign works, his universal gateway manifestations, and his powers of supernatural penetration—it should be known that the merit and virtue of such persons is not small."

When the Buddha expounded this Universal Gateway chapter, eighty-four thousand sentient beings in the assembly all generated the mind set upon anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, the unsurpassed, equal, and perfect enlightenment.

CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX: DHĀRANĪS

At that time, Medicine King Bodhisattva immediately arose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, joined his palms toward the Buddha, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, if good men and good women are able to receive and uphold the Lotus Sutra, whether they recite it until they have mastered it, or whether they copy the sūtra scrolls, what measure of merit will they obtain?" The Buddha said to Medicine King: "If there are good men and good women who make offerings to eight hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges sands' worth of buddhas, what is your opinion? Would the merit they obtain be much or not?" "Very much, World-Honored One." The Buddha said: "If good men and good women are able to receive and uphold even a single four-line verse of this sūtra, recite it, understand its meaning, and practice in accordance with what it teaches, their merit will be exceedingly abundant." At that time, Medicine King Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I shall now bestow upon the preachers of the Dharma a dhāraṇī incantation to protect them." Then he spoke the incantation, saying:

an'er man'er moni momanei zhili zhelidei sha□ shalitawei shandi mudi mutuoli suoli aweisafu sangli suoli chaye achaye ajini shandi shalai tuolani alujiaposasuozhe pishani nipiti abiantaoluolieti adantapoluishudie oujuoli moujuoli aluoli poluoli shoujiecha asanmosuanli fotuopijili□di damopolichadei sengqieniejushani posheposhashudi mantaoluao mantaoluochayetuo youloutuao youloutuo jiaoshelüe echachaluao echachaluoyetuoyeo apolu amoruonatuoya

"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī divine incantation has been spoken by sixty-two koṭis of Ganges sands' worth of buddhas. If anyone violates or harms this Dharma teacher, then he violates and harms all these buddhas."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha praised Medicine King Bodhisattva, saying: "Excellent, excellent, Medicine King! Out of compassion, you protect this Dharma teacher and speak this dhāraṇī. It will bring abundant benefit to the multitude of living beings."

At that time, Brave Donor Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I too, for the sake of protecting those who recite, receive, and uphold the Lotus Sutra, shall speak a dhāraṇī. If this Dharma teacher obtains this dhāraṇī, then whether yakṣas, or rākṣasas, or pūtanas, or kṛtyas, or kumbhāṇḍas, or hungry ghosts, or the like seek to find his faults, they will be unable to gain any advantage." Then, in the Buddha's presence, he spoke the incantation, saying:

zhuoli moheizhuoli yuzhi muzhi ali aluopodi nielidi nieliduopodi yizhinei weizhinei zhizhinei nielichi nei nielichi podi

"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī divine incantation has been spoken by Ganges sands' worth of buddhas, and all rejoice in it. If anyone violates or harms this Dharma teacher, then he violates and harms all these buddhas."

At that time, Vaiśravaṇa Heavenly King, protector of the world, addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I too, out of compassion for living beings and for the sake of protecting this Dharma teacher, speak this dhāraṇī." Then he spoke the incantation, saying:

ali nali □nali analü nali junaofu

"World-Honored One, with this divine incantation I protect the Dharma teacher. I myself shall also protect those who uphold this sūtra, so that within a hundred yojanas they will have no decline or suffering."

At that time, Dhṛtarāṣṭra Heavenly King was present in this assembly, together with thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of gandharvas respectfully surrounding him. He proceeded to the place where the Buddha was, joined his palms, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I too, with the divine incantation of the dhāraṇī, shall protect those who uphold the Lotus Sutra." Then he spoke the incantation, saying:

aganei ganei quli qiantuli zhantuli modengqi changqiuli fuloushani edi

"World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī divine incantation has been spoken by forty-two koṭis of buddhas. If anyone violates or harms this Dharma teacher, then he violates and harms all these buddhas."

At that time there were rākṣasī demonesses and others—the first named Lambā, the second named Vilambā, the third named Crooked Teeth, the fourth named Flower Teeth, the fifth named Black Teeth, the sixth named Much Hair, the seventh named Insatiable, the eighth named Necklace Holder, the ninth named Hārītī, and the tenth named Stealer of the Vital Essence of All Living Beings. These ten rākṣasī demonesses, together with the Mother of Demon Children, her sons, and her retinue, all proceeded to the place where the Buddha was and with one voice addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we too wish to protect those who recite, receive, and uphold the Lotus Sutra, to eliminate their decline and suffering. If there are any who seek to find the faults of the Dharma teacher, we shall cause them to gain no advantage." Then, in the Buddha's presence, they spoke the incantation, saying:

yitili yitimin yitili aitili yitili neili neili neili neili neili louhei louhei louhei louhei duohei duohei duohei douhei □hei

"Let them rather tread upon our heads than torment the Dharma teacher! Whether yakṣas, or rākṣasas, or hungry ghosts, or pūtanas, or kṛtyas, or vetalas, or kaṇṭhakas, or umarakas, or apasmarakas, or yakṣa kṛtyas, or human kṛtyas, or fevers—whether one-day, or two-day, or three-day, or four-day, up to seven-day, or chronic fevers; whether in male form, or female form, or boy form, or girl form—let them not torment even in dreams!" Then, in the Buddha's presence, they spoke verses, saying:

If they do not obey our incantation
And torment the preacher of the Dharma,
Their heads shall split into seven pieces
Like the branches of the arjaka tree.

As with the sin of killing parents,
Or the calamity of pressing oil,
Or cheating people with false measures,
Or Devadatta's sin of splitting the Saṅgha—

Those who violate this Dharma teacher
Shall obtain such calamities.

After the rākṣasī demonesses spoke these verses, they addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we too shall personally protect those who receive, uphold, recite, and practice this sūtra, causing them to attain peace and be free from all decline and suffering, eliminating all poisonous medicines." The Buddha said to the rākṣasī demonesses: "Excellent, excellent! If you are able to protect those who uphold the name of the Lotus Sutra, your merit will be immeasurable. How much more so if you protect those who perfectly receive and uphold it, making offerings to the sūtra scrolls with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, banners, canopies, music, and lighting various lamps—sesame oil lamps, oil lamps, various fragrant oil lamps, sumanā flower oil lamps, campaka flower oil lamps, vārṣika flower oil lamps, utpala flower oil lamps—with hundreds of thousands of kinds of offerings such as these. Hārītī, you and your retinue should protect such Dharma teachers."

When this Chapter on Dhāraṇīs was preached, sixty-eight thousand persons attained the Patient Acceptance of the Unborn Dharmas.

CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN: THE FORMER LIVES OF OF KING WONDERFUL ADORNMENT

At that time, the Buddha addressed the great assembly: "Long ago in the past, beyond immeasurable, boundless, inconceivable, incalculable asamkhyeya kalpas, there was a Buddha named Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom, Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-sambuddha. His land was called Luminous Adornment, and the kalpa was called Joyful Vision."

"In the Dharma of that Buddha, there was a king named Wonderful Adornment. The king's consort was named Lady Pure Virtue. He had two sons: one named Pure Repository and the other named Pure Eye. These two sons possessed great spiritual powers, blessings, virtue, and wisdom. For a long time they had cultivated the bodhisattva path—namely, the perfection of giving, the perfection of moral discipline, the perfection of patience, the perfection of vigor, the perfection of meditation, the perfection of wisdom, and the perfection of skillful means. They had mastered loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity, and even the thirty-seven factors conducive to enlightenment—all these they thoroughly comprehended and penetrated. Moreover, they had attained the bodhisattva's Pure Samādhi, the Constellation Samādhi, the Pure Light Samādhi, the Pure Form Samādhi, the Pure Illumination Samādhi, the Long Adornment Samādhi, and the Great Majestic Virtue Repository Samādhi—in all these samādhis they were thoroughly penetrating."

"At that time, that Buddha, wishing to guide King Wonderful Adornment and out of compassion for all living beings, expounded this Lotus Sutra. Then the two sons, Pure Repository and Pure Eye, went to their mother, pressed their ten fingers together with palms joined, and said: 'We pray that our mother will go to the place where Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha dwells. We too shall attend upon you, draw near, make offerings, and pay reverence. Why is this so? Because this Buddha, in the midst of all the assemblies of gods and humans, expounds the Lotus Sutra. It is fitting that we should listen and receive it.' Their mother told her sons: 'Your father believes in and accepts the heterodox paths, being deeply attached to the Brahmanical teachings. You should go and speak to your father, so that we may all go together.' Pure Repository and Pure Eye pressed their ten fingers together with palms joined and addressed their mother: 'We are sons of the Dharma King, yet we have been born into this household of wrong views.' Their mother told her sons: 'You should be concerned for your father. Manifest spiritual transformations for him. If he is able to see them, his mind will certainly become pure, and he may allow us to go to the Buddha's place.'"

"Thereupon, the two sons, out of concern for their father, rose up into the sky to a height of seven tāla trees and manifested various spiritual transformations. In the sky they walked, stood, sat, and reclined. From the upper part of their bodies they emitted water, and from the lower part they emitted fire. From the lower part of their bodies they emitted water, and from the upper part they emitted fire. Sometimes they manifested great bodies that filled the sky, and then manifested small bodies again; from small bodies they again manifested great bodies. They disappeared in the sky and suddenly appeared on the ground. They entered the earth as if it were water, and walked upon water as if it were earth. Manifesting such various spiritual transformations, they caused their father the king's mind to become pure and to develop faith and understanding. When the father saw the spiritual powers of his sons, his mind was filled with great joy, having obtained what he had never had before. He joined his palms and addressed his sons: 'Who is your teacher? Whose disciples are you?' The two sons replied: 'Great King, that Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha is now seated upon the Dharma seat beneath the jeweled bodhi tree of seven treasures. In the midst of all the assemblies of gods and humans throughout the world, he extensively expounds the Lotus Sutra. He is our teacher, and we are his disciples.' The father said to his sons: 'I too now wish to see your teacher. We may go together.' Thereupon, the two sons descended from the sky and went to their mother. Joining their palms, they addressed their mother: 'Our father the king has now developed faith and understanding and is capable of aspiring to awaken anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. We have accomplished the Buddha's work on behalf of our father. We pray that our mother will grant us permission to leave home and cultivate the Way in the presence of that Buddha.'"

At that time, the two sons, wishing to restate their meaning, spoke in verse to their mother:

We pray our mother will release us
To leave home and become śramaṇas.
Buddhas are exceedingly difficult to encounter;
We shall follow and learn from the Buddha.

Like the udumbara flower,
To encounter a Buddha is even more difficult than this.
To escape from all difficulties is also difficult;
We pray you will allow us to leave home.

"The mother then told them: 'I permit you to leave home. Why is this so? Because Buddhas are difficult to encounter.' Thereupon, the two sons addressed their father and mother: 'Excellent, father and mother! We pray that you will now go to the place where Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha dwells, to draw near and make offerings. Why is this so? Because Buddhas are difficult to encounter, like the udumbara flower, and also like a one-eyed turtle encountering the hole in a floating log. Through our deep and abundant blessings from former lives, we have been born at a time when the Buddha-Dharma exists. Therefore, father and mother should permit us to leave home. Why is this so? Because Buddhas are difficult to encounter, and the time is also difficult to meet.'"

"At that time, the eighty-four thousand persons in the inner palace of King Wonderful Adornment were all capable of upholding this Lotus Sutra. Pure Eye Bodhisattva had long been thoroughly penetrating the Lotus Samādhi. Pure Repository Bodhisattva had, for immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of kalpas, been thoroughly penetrating the Samādhi of Freeing All from Evil Destinies, because he wished to cause all living beings to be freed from the evil destinies. The king's consort had attained the Samādhi of the Assembly of All Buddhas, and was able to know the secret treasury of all Buddhas. The two sons, through such skillful means and power, skillfully converted their father, causing his mind to develop faith and understanding and to delight in the Buddha-Dharma. Then King Wonderful Adornment, together with his ministers and retinue, Lady Pure Virtue together with the women of the inner palace and her retinue, and the king's two sons together with forty-two thousand persons—all at the same time proceeded together to the Buddha's place. Having arrived, they bowed with their heads at his feet, circumambulated the Buddha three times, and withdrew to stand to one side."

"At that time, that Buddha expounded the Dharma for the king, revealing, instructing, benefiting, and gladdening him. The king greatly rejoiced. Then King Wonderful Adornment and his consort removed the pearl necklaces from their necks, worth hundreds of thousands, and scattered them over the Buddha. In the sky the necklaces transformed into a four-pillared jeweled platform. Within the platform was a great jeweled couch, spread with hundreds of thousands of myriads of heavenly garments, and upon it was a Buddha seated in cross-legged position, emitting great radiance. At that time, King Wonderful Adornment had this thought: 'The Buddha's body is rare, dignified, majestic, and distinctive, perfecting the supremely wondrous form.' Then Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha addressed the fourfold assembly: 'Do you see this King Wonderful Adornment standing with palms joined before me? This king, within my Dharma, shall become a monk and diligently cultivate and practice the dharmas that aid the Buddha Way. He shall become a Buddha named Śāla Tree King. His land will be called Great Light, and the kalpa will be called Great Lofty King. That Śāla Tree King Buddha will have immeasurable multitudes of bodhisattvas and immeasurable multitudes of śrāvakas. His land will be level and upright. Such will be his merits and virtues.' The king immediately ceded his kingdom to his younger brother and, together with his consort, his two sons, and all his retinue, left home within the Buddha-Dharma to cultivate the Way. After the king had left home, for eighty-four thousand years he constantly practiced diligently and cultivated the Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra. After this time had passed, he attained the Samādhi of Adornment with All Pure Meritorious Virtues. Immediately he rose into the sky to a height of seven tāla trees and addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, these two sons of mine have accomplished the Buddha's work. Through spiritual powers and transformations, they have turned my mind from wrong views, causing me to abide securely in the Buddha-Dharma and to be able to see the World-Honored One. These two sons are my good spiritual friends. Wishing to awaken the good roots from my past lives and to benefit me, they came to be born in my household.'"

"At that time, Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha addressed King Wonderful Adornment: 'So it is, so it is, just as you say. If good men and good women plant good roots, life after life they will obtain good spiritual friends. These good spiritual friends are able to accomplish the Buddha's work, revealing, instructing, benefiting, and gladdening them, causing them to enter anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Great King, you should know that good spiritual friends are a great causal connection, bringing about transformation and guidance so that one may see the Buddha and awaken the mind of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Great King, do you see these two sons? These two sons have already made offerings to sixty-five hundred thousand myriads of millions of nayutas of Ganges' sands of Buddhas, drawing near and showing reverence. In the presence of all these Buddhas, they upheld the Lotus Sutra. Out of compassion for living beings of wrong views, they cause them to abide in right views.' King Wonderful Adornment then descended from the sky and addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the Tathāgata is extremely rare. Through the power of his meritorious virtues and wisdom, the fleshy protuberance atop his head radiates brilliant light. His eyes are long and broad, of deep blue color. The tuft of white hair between his eyebrows is white as the moon or snow. His teeth are white, even, and close-set, always emitting radiance. His lips are of excellent reddish color, like the bimba fruit.' At that time, King Wonderful Adornment, having thus praised the Buddha's immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of meritorious virtues, with single-minded palms joined before the Tathāgata, again addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, this is unprecedented! The Tathāgata's Dharma is fully perfected with inconceivable, subtle, and wondrous meritorious virtues. The precepts and instructions that guide conduct bring peace, stability, and excellent goodness. From this day forward, I shall no longer willfully follow my mind's impulses, nor shall I give rise to wrong views or to the evil minds of arrogance, anger, or hatred.' Having spoken these words, he paid reverence to the Buddha and departed."

The Buddha addressed the great assembly: "What do you think? Could King Wonderful Adornment be anyone else? He is now Flower Virtue Bodhisattva. Lady Pure Virtue is now the bodhisattva before the Buddha named Radiance Adorning Characteristics, who, out of compassion for King Wonderful Adornment and his retinue, was born in that place. As for those two sons, they are now Medicine King Bodhisattva and Superior Medicine Bodhisattva. These Medicine King and Superior Medicine Bodhisattvas have accomplished such great meritorious virtues as these. Before immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas they have planted roots of virtue and accomplished inconceivable good meritorious virtues. If there are persons who know the names of these two bodhisattvas, all the gods and humans throughout the world should also pay reverence to them." When the Buddha expounded this Chapter on the Former Lives of King Wonderful Adornment, eighty-four thousand persons cast off the dust and defilement from afar, and with regard to all dharmas attained the pure Dharma eye.

CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT: THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE BODHISATTVA SAMANTABHADRA

At that time, the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, through his power of sovereign spiritual penetration, his majestic virtue and renown, together with great bodhisattvas immeasurable, boundless, and beyond reckoning, came from the east. In all the lands through which he passed, the earth universally quaked and trembled, jeweled lotus flowers rained down, and immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kinds of music were played. Moreover, accompanied by innumerable devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans and nonhumans, and others, a great assembly surrounded him, each manifesting the power of majestic virtue and spiritual penetration. Arriving at this Sahā world, at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa, he bowed his head to the feet of Śākyamuni Buddha, circumambulated him seven times to the right, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, from the land of the Buddha Jewel Majestic Virtue Superior King, I heard from afar that in this Sahā world the Dharma Flower Sutra was being expounded. Together with immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of bodhisattvas, I have come to hear and receive it. I only pray that the World-Honored One will expound it for us. If, after the extinction of the Tathāgata, good sons and good daughters wish to obtain this Dharma Flower Sutra, how may they do so?"

The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra: "If good sons and good daughters fulfill four dharmas, after the extinction of the Tathāgata they shall obtain this Dharma Flower Sutra. First, they shall be protected and kept in mind by the buddhas. Second, they shall plant the roots of all virtues. Third, they shall enter the assembly of those fixed in correctness. Fourth, they shall arouse the mind to save all sentient beings. Good sons and good daughters who fulfill these four dharmas in this way shall, after the extinction of the Tathāgata, unfailingly obtain this sutra."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, in the latter five hundred years, in the evil and turbid age, whoever receives and upholds this sutra, I shall guard and protect, removing their decline and afflictions, causing them to obtain peace and stability, making it so that none who seek opportunity to harm them shall succeed—whether māras, māra-sons, māra-daughters, māra-subjects, those possessed by māras, yakṣas, rākṣasas, kumbhāṇḍas, piśācas, kṛtyas, pūtanas, vetāḍas, and others who harass people—none shall gain advantage. When this person, whether walking or standing, recites this sutra, I shall at that time mount my six-tusked white elephant king and, together with the assembly of great bodhisattvas, proceed to that place and manifest my body, making offerings, guarding and protecting them, and comforting their minds, also for the sake of making offerings to the Dharma Flower Sutra. If this person sits and contemplates this sutra, at that time I shall again mount my white elephant king and appear before that person. If that person has forgotten even a single phrase or verse of the Dharma Flower Sutra, I shall teach it to them, reciting it together with them, causing them to become thoroughly proficient again. At that time, those who receive, uphold, recite, and chant the Dharma Flower Sutra shall see my body and experience great joy, and through this shall progress with even greater vigor. Because they see me, they shall immediately attain samādhi and dhāraṇīs—namely, the Revolving Dhāraṇī, the Dhāraṇī of Hundreds of Thousands of Myriads of Koṭis of Revolutions, and the Dhāraṇī of Skillful Means in the Dharma Voice. They shall obtain dhāraṇīs such as these."

"World-Honored One, if in the latter age, in the latter five hundred years, in the evil and turbid age, there are bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, or upāsikās who seek, who uphold, who recite and chant, who copy, and who wish to cultivate this Dharma Flower Sutra, they should, for twenty-one days, single-mindedly advance with vigor. After the full twenty-one days have passed, I shall mount my six-tusked white elephant and, surrounded by immeasurable bodhisattvas, with a body pleasing to the sight of all sentient beings, appear before that person and expound the Dharma for them, showing, teaching, benefiting, and gladdening them. I shall moreover give them dhāraṇī spells. Having obtained this dhāraṇī, no nonhuman shall be able to destroy them, nor shall they be deluded and confused by women. I myself shall also always protect this person. I only pray that the World-Honored One will permit me to speak this dhāraṇī spell."

Then, in the presence of the Buddha, he spoke a spell, saying:

adaṇḍe daṇḍapati daṇḍāvarte daṇḍakuśale daṇḍasudhāri sudhāri sudhārapati buddhapaśyane sarvadhāraṇyāvartani sarvabhāṣyāvartani suāvartani saṃghaparīkṣaṇi saṃghanirghātani asaṃge saṃgāpanate tryadhvasaṃgate ratriprāpte saṃgharahūte ārati pratihate sarvasaṃghasamatikrānte sarvadharmasuparīkṣite sarvasattvarutakauśalyānugate siṃhavikrīḍite

"World-Honored One, if there are bodhisattvas who hear this dhāraṇī, they should know this to be the spiritual power of Samantabhadra. If the Dharma Flower Sutra circulates in Jambudvīpa and there are those who uphold it, they should think thus: 'This is all due to the majestic spiritual power of Samantabhadra.' If there are those who uphold, recite and chant, correctly retain in memory, understand its meaning and purport, and cultivate practice according to what is spoken, know that such persons practice the practices of Samantabhadra. In the presence of immeasurable, boundless buddhas, they have deeply planted roots of goodness, and the Tathāgatas have placed their hands upon their heads. If they merely copy it, when this person's life ends, they shall be born in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven. At that time, eighty-four thousand heavenly maidens, playing all kinds of music, shall come to welcome them. That person shall immediately don a crown of seven treasures and, amidst the palace ladies, experience pleasure and delight. How much more so for those who uphold, recite and chant, correctly retain in memory, understand its meaning and purport, and cultivate practice according to what is spoken! If there are persons who uphold, recite and chant, and understand its meaning and purport, when this person's life ends, they shall be received in the hands of a thousand buddhas, so that they feel no fear and do not fall into the evil destinies. They shall proceed immediately to the Tuṣita Heaven, to the place of the Bodhisattva Maitreya. The Bodhisattva Maitreya possesses the thirty-two marks and is surrounded by a great assembly of bodhisattvas. He has hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of heavenly maiden attendants, and one is born in their midst. Such are the meritorious virtues and beneficial advantages. Therefore, the wise should single-mindedly copy it themselves or cause others to copy it, upholding, reciting and chanting, correctly retaining in memory, and cultivating practice according to what is spoken."

"World-Honored One, I now, through my power of spiritual penetration, guard and protect this sutra so that, after the extinction of the Tathāgata, it may be widely propagated throughout Jambudvīpa and never be cut off."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha spoke words of praise, saying: "Excellent, excellent, Samantabhadra! You are able to protect and assist this sutra, causing multitudes of sentient beings to obtain peace, advantage, and benefit. You have already accomplished inconceivable meritorious virtues and profound great compassion. From the remote past, you aroused the intention toward anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, and you are able to make this vow of spiritual penetration to guard and protect this sutra. I shall, through my power of spiritual penetration, guard and protect those who are able to uphold the name of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra."

"Samantabhadra, if there are those who uphold, recite and chant, correctly retain in memory, cultivate and practice, and copy this Dharma Flower Sutra, know that such persons then see Śākyamuni Buddha. It is as if they heard this sutra from the mouth of the Buddha. Know that such persons make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha. Know that such persons are praised as 'excellent' by the Buddha. Know that such persons have their heads rubbed by the hand of Śākyamuni Buddha. Know that such persons are covered by the robe of Śākyamuni Buddha. Such persons no longer greedily crave worldly pleasures. They do not delight in the scriptures and writings of non-Buddhist paths, nor do they take pleasure in approaching such persons or any who are evil—whether butchers, those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens, or dogs, hunters, or those who peddle feminine charms. The minds and intentions of such persons are upright and honest. They possess correct mindful retention and the power of merit and virtue. Such persons are not afflicted by the three poisons, nor are they afflicted by jealousy, self-conceit, arrogant conceit, or overweening conceit. Such persons have few desires, know contentment, and are able to cultivate the practices of Samantabhadra."

"Samantabhadra, if after the extinction of the Tathāgata, in the latter five hundred years, there are persons who see those who uphold, recite, and chant the Dharma Flower Sutra, they should think thus: 'This person shall before long proceed to the place of enlightenment, defeat the hosts of māras, attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, turn the wheel of the Dharma, beat the drum of the Dharma, blow the conch of the Dharma, rain the rain of the Dharma, and shall sit upon the lion throne of the Dharma amidst the great assembly of devas and humans.'"

"Samantabhadra, if in a latter age there are those who uphold, recite, and chant this sutra, such persons shall no longer greedily crave clothing, bedding, food and drink, or the necessities of life. Their vows shall not be in vain, and they shall moreover obtain their blessed reward in the present world. If there are persons who disparage them, saying, 'You are a madman! You perform these practices in vain and shall ultimately gain nothing'—the karmic retribution for such offense shall be to be without eyes, world after world. If there are those who make offerings and speak their praises, they shall in the present world obtain manifest rewards. If, moreover, one sees those who uphold this sutra and exposes their faults, whether real or unreal, such a person shall in the present world contract white leprosy. If there are those who ridicule them with scorn, such persons shall, world after world, have gaps in their teeth, ugly lips, a flat nose, hands and feet that are twisted and gnarled, eyes that squint, a body that is foul and fetid, evil sores, pus and blood, water belly, shortness of breath, and all manner of severe and evil diseases. Therefore, Samantabhadra, if one sees those who uphold this sutra, one should rise up and go to greet them from afar, and one should revere them as one reveres the Buddha."

When this chapter on the Encouragement of Samantabhadra was spoken, bodhisattvas immeasurable and boundless as the sands of the Ganges River obtained hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of revolving dhāraṇīs, and bodhisattvas equal in number to the dust motes of a great trichiliocosm perfected the practices of Samantabhadra. When the Buddha spoke this sutra, Samantabhadra and other bodhisattvas, Śāriputra and other śrāvakas, as well as the devas, nāgas, humans and nonhumans, and others—the entire great assembly—all rejoiced greatly. Receiving and upholding the Buddha's words, they bowed in reverence and departed.
