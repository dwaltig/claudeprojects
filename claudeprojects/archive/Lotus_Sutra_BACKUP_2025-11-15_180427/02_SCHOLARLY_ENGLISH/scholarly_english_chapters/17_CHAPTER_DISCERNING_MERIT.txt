CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: DISCERNING MERIT

At that time, the great assembly, hearing the Buddha expound his lifespan in terms of kalpas so long and distant, immeasurable, boundless, asaṃkhyeya beings obtained great benefit. At that time, the World-Honored One addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva: "Ajita, when I spoke of the Tathāgata's long and distant lifespan, beings numbering six hundred and eighty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges' sands attained the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas a thousand times this number attained the dhāraṇī-gate of hearing and upholding. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of one world attained unobstructed eloquence in joyful speaking. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of one world attained hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of immeasurable dhāraṇīs of revolution. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of a great trichiliocosm were able to turn the irreversible Dharma-wheel. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of two middling lands were able to turn the pure Dharma-wheel. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of a small-thousand land shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after eight more births. Again, bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of four four-continent worlds shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after four more births. Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of three four-continent worlds shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after three more births. Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of two four-continent worlds shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after two more births. Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas numbering as the dust-motes of one four-continent world shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi after one more birth. Again, beings numbering as the dust-motes of eight worlds all generated the mind of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

When the Buddha spoke of these bodhisattva-mahāsattvas obtaining great Dharma-benefit, from empty space rained māndārava flowers and mahā-māndārava flowers, scattering them upon the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas seated upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees, and also scattering them upon Śākyamuni Buddha and Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata who had long since entered extinction, seated upon lion thrones within the seven-jeweled stūpa, and also scattering them upon all the great bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly. Moreover, it rained finely powdered sandalwood and aloeswood incense. In empty space, heavenly drums sounded of themselves, their wondrous sounds profound and far-reaching. It also rained thousands of kinds of heavenly garments, and there hung various necklaces—pearl necklaces, mani-pearl necklaces, wish-fulfilling pearl necklaces—pervading throughout the nine directions. Jeweled incense burners burned priceless incense, naturally arriving everywhere, making offerings to the great assembly. Above each Buddha were bodhisattvas holding banners and canopies, ascending in succession up to Brahma Heaven. These bodhisattvas, with wondrous voices and sounds, sang immeasurable verses in praise of all Buddhas.

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva arose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, pressed his palms together toward the Buddha, and spoke in verse:

"The Buddha has expounded this rare Dharma,
Never before heard.
The World-Honored One possesses great power—
His lifespan is immeasurable.

"Immeasurable sons of the Buddha,
Hearing the World-Honored One discriminatingly
Explain those who obtain Dharma-benefit,
Are filled throughout their bodies with joy.

"Some abide on the stage of non-retrogression,
Some attain dhāraṇī,
Or unobstructed joyful eloquence,
Myriads of koṭis of revolution in total retention.

"Some, numbering as dust-motes of the great trichiliocosm,
Each able to turn
The irreversible Dharma-wheel.

"Again, those numbering as dust-motes of middling chiliocosms,
Each able to turn
The pure Dharma-wheel.

"Again, those numbering as dust-motes of small chiliocosms,
The remainder each having eight more births,
Shall attain the Buddha-Way.

"Again, those numbering as dust-motes of four, three, and two—
Such four-continent worlds—
Bodhisattvas numbering accordingly
Shall achieve Buddhahood after that many births.

"Or those numbering as dust-motes of one four-continent world,
The remainder having one more birth,
Shall achieve the wisdom of all modes.

"Beings such as these,
Hearing of the Buddha's long lifespan,
Attain immeasurable, undefiled,
Pure fruition and reward.

"Again, those numbering as dust-motes of eight worlds,
Hearing the Buddha expound his lifespan,
All generate the unsurpassed mind.

"The World-Honored One has expounded immeasurable,
Inconceivable dharmas
With much that benefits,
Like empty space without bounds.

"It rains heavenly māndārava
And mahā-māndārava flowers.
Śakras and Brahmas, like Ganges' sands,
Come from immeasurable Buddha-lands.

"It rains sandalwood and aloeswood,
Swirling and falling in confusion,
Like birds flying down from the sky,
Scattering offerings upon all Buddhas.

"In empty space, heavenly drums
Naturally emit wondrous sounds.
Thousands of myriads of kinds of heavenly garments
Whirl and descend,

"Wondrous jeweled incense burners
Burning priceless incense
Naturally arriving everywhere,
Making offerings to all World-Honored Ones.

"The great assemblies of bodhisattvas
Hold seven-jeweled banners and canopies,
Lofty, wondrous, numbering myriads of koṭis,
Ascending in succession to Brahma Heaven.

"Before each Buddha,
Jeweled pennants hang with victorious banners.
Also with thousands of myriads of verses,
They sing in praise of all Tathāgatas.

"Such various matters as these
Have never before occurred.
Hearing that the Buddha's lifespan is immeasurable,
All rejoice.

"The Buddha's name is heard throughout the ten directions,
Broadly benefiting beings.
All possess wholesome roots
To aid the unsurpassed mind."

At that time, the Buddha addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva: "Ajita, should there be beings who, hearing that the Buddha's lifespan is long and distant like this, are able to generate even one thought of faith and understanding, the merit they obtain shall be without limit or measure. If there are good men or good women who, for the sake of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, throughout eighty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kalpas practice the five pāramitās—dāna-pāramitā, śīla-pāramitā, kṣānti-pāramitā, vīrya-pāramitā, dhyāna-pāramitā, excluding prajñā-pāramitā—the merit of this practice compared with the previous merit cannot equal it by a hundredth part, a thousandth part, a hundred-thousandth-myriad-koṭith part—indeed, it cannot be known even through calculation or parable. If good men or good women possess such merit, regarding anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi they cannot possibly regress."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If a person seeks the Buddha's wisdom,
Throughout eighty myriads of koṭis
Of nayutas of kalpas,
Practices the five pāramitās:

"Throughout all these kalpas,
Making offerings to Buddhas
And pratyekabuddha disciples,
And various assemblies of bodhisattvas,

"With precious and rare food and drink,
Fine garments and bedding,
Building monasteries of sandalwood,
Adorned with gardens and groves;

"Gifts such as these,
Various and all subtle and wondrous,
Throughout all these kalpas' duration,
Dedicating them toward the Buddha-Way;

"If one again upholds the precepts,
Pure and without breach or flaw,
Seeking the unsurpassed Way,
Praised by all Buddhas;

"If one again practices patient acceptance,
Abiding on the ground of gentleness and compliance,
When various evils come to assail,
One's mind is not perturbed or moved.

"Also, those who obtain the Dharma
Yet harbor the conceit of superiority—
Being troubled and slighted by them,
One is also able to patiently endure.

"If one is again diligent and vigorous,
Will and mindfulness constantly firm,
Throughout immeasurable koṭis of kalpas
Single-mindedly without slackening;

"Also, throughout immeasurable kalpas,
Dwelling in secluded places,
Whether sitting or walking meditation,
Except for sleep, constantly regulating the mind—

"Through such causes and conditions,
One can generate the various dhyānas.
Throughout eighty koṭis of myriads of kalpas,
Abiding with mind unconfused,

"Upholding the merit of this single-minded concentration,
Vowing to seek the unsurpassed Way,
I attain the wisdom of all modes,
Exhausting all the limits of the dhyānas—

"Such a person, throughout hundreds of thousands
Of myriads of koṭis of kalpas,
Practicing all these merits
As described above.

"If there are good men and women
Who hear me expound my lifespan,
Even believing for a single thought—
Their merit exceeds that.

"If a person is completely without
Any doubts or regrets whatsoever,
And with deep mind believes for even a brief moment—
Their merit is like this.

"Those bodhisattvas
Who have practiced the Way for immeasurable kalpas,
Hearing me expound my lifespan,
Are then able to believe and accept.

"Persons such as these
Shall reverently receive this sutra,
Vowing that in the future
They shall long live to save beings,

"Just as today's World-Honored One,
King of the Śākyas,
With a lion's roar at the place of the Way,
Expounding the Dharma fearlessly.

"We, in future ages,
Shall be universally revered.
When sitting at the place of the Way,
We shall expound lifespans likewise.

"If there are those of deep mind,
Pure and upright,
Much learning, able to retain and uphold,
Understanding the Buddha's words according to their meaning—

"Persons such as these
Shall have no doubts about this."

"Moreover, Ajita, should there be those who hear of the Buddha's long lifespan and understand its meaning and purport, the merit obtained by such persons shall be without limit or measure, able to arouse the Tathāgata's unsurpassed wisdom. How much more so if one broadly hears this sutra, or causes others to hear it; if one upholds it oneself, or causes others to uphold it; if one writes it oneself, or causes others to write it; or if with flowers, incense, necklaces, banners, canopies, fragrant oil, butter lamps, one makes offerings to the sutra scrolls! Such a person's merit shall be immeasurable and boundless, able to generate the wisdom of all modes. Ajita, if good men or good women, hearing me expound my long lifespan, with deep minds believe and understand, they shall see the Buddha constantly abiding on Vulture Peak Mountain, surrounded by great bodhisattvas and assemblies of śrāvakas, expounding the Dharma. They shall also see this Sahā world—its ground of lapis lazuli, level and even, with jambu-river gold marking out the eight paths, jeweled trees in rows, and various towers and pavilions all made of jewels, with assemblies of bodhisattvas all dwelling therein. If one is able to contemplate thus, one should know this is the mark of deep faith and understanding."

"Moreover, after the Tathāgata's extinction, if one hears this sutra and does not slander it but generates a mind of joyful acceptance, one should know this is already the mark of deep faith and understanding—how much more so for one who reads, recites, receives, and upholds it! Such a person shall carry the Tathāgata upon their head. Ajita, such good men and good women need not, for my sake, again erect stūpas and monasteries or build monastic dwellings or make the fourfold offerings to the Saṅgha. Why is this? Such good men and good women who receive, uphold, read, and recite this sutra have already erected stūpas, established monastic dwellings, and made offerings to the Saṅgha. They shall be considered as having erected stūpas of the seven precious things for the Buddha's relics, lofty and broad, gradually tapering up to Brahma Heaven, with various banners, canopies, and numerous jeweled bells hung, with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, numerous drums, music, flutes, pipes, harps, various kinds of dance and entertainment, with wondrous sounds and voices singing praises and eulogies—they shall be considered as having already made such offerings for immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas."

"Ajita, after my extinction, should there be those who hear this sutra and are able to receive and uphold it, whether writing it themselves or causing others to write it, they shall be considered as having erected monastic dwellings, built with red sandalwood various halls and chambers numbering thirty-two, eight tāla trees in height, lofty, broad, adorned, and excellent, with hundreds of thousands of bhikṣus dwelling therein, with gardens, groves, bathing ponds, walking meditation paths, meditation caves, garments, food and drink, bedding, medicines, all pleasurable things filling them completely—such monastic dwellings, halls, and pavilions, numbering in the several hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis, immeasurable in number, presenting them before me and making offerings to me and the Saṅgha of bhikṣus. Therefore I say: After the Tathāgata's extinction, if there are those who receive, uphold, read, recite, or expound for others, whether writing themselves or causing others to write, and make offerings to the sutra scrolls, they need not again erect stūpas and monasteries or build monastic dwellings or make offerings to the Saṅgha. How much more so for those who are able to uphold this sutra and also practice giving, upholding precepts, patient acceptance, vigor, single-mindedness, and wisdom! Their virtue is most supreme, immeasurable and boundless, just as empty space in the east, west, south, north, the four intermediate directions, above, and below is immeasurable and boundless—so too is such a person's merit immeasurable and boundless, swiftly reaching the wisdom of all modes. If one reads, recites, receives, and upholds this sutra, expounds it for others, whether writing it oneself or causing others to write it; moreover, is able to erect stūpas and build monastic dwellings, making offerings to and praising the Saṅgha of śrāvakas; also with hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of methods of praise, praises the merit of bodhisattvas; moreover, for others, through various causes and conditions, explains this Lotus Sutra according to its meaning; again, is able to purely uphold the precepts, dwelling together with those who are gentle and compliant; is patient and accepting without anger, with will and mindfulness firm and solid, constantly valuing sitting in meditation, attaining various deep concentrations; is vigorous and valiant, gathering in all wholesome dharmas; is sharp in faculties and wisdom, skillful in answering difficult questions..."

"Ajita, after my extinction, should there be good men and good women who receive, uphold, read, and recite this sutra, they shall again possess such various wholesome merits. One should know that such persons have already approached the place of the Way, are near to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, and sit beneath the tree of the Way. Ajita, wherever such good men and good women sit, stand, or walk about, there should one erect a stūpa, and all devas and humans should make offerings as they would to a stūpa of the Buddha."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If, after my extinction,
One can reverently uphold this sutra,
Such a person's merit is immeasurable,
As described above.

"They shall be considered as having completely fulfilled
All manner of offerings—
Erecting stūpas with relics,
Adorned with the seven precious things,

"With pennant-poles extremely lofty and broad,
Gradually tapering up to Brahma Heaven,
With jeweled bells by thousands of myriads of koṭis,
Moved by wind, emitting wondrous sounds.

"Also, throughout immeasurable kalpas,
Making offerings to this stūpa
With flowers, incense, various necklaces,
Heavenly garments, and various kinds of music,

"Burning fragrant oil and butter lamps,
Constantly illuminating all around.
In the evil age of the Dharma's ending,
One able to uphold this sutra

"Shall be considered as already, as above,
Completely fulfilling all offerings.
If one is able to uphold this sutra,
It is as if the Buddha were present.

"With ox-head sandalwood,
Building monastic dwellings as offerings,
With halls numbering thirty-two,
Eight tāla trees in height,

"With superior food and wondrous garments,
Bedding all complete,
Hundreds of thousands of dwelling places,
With gardens, groves, and various bathing ponds,

"Walking meditation paths and meditation caves,
Various kinds, all adorned excellently.
If one has the mind of faith and understanding,
Receiving, upholding, reading, reciting, and writing,

"Or again causing others to write,
And making offerings to the sutra scrolls,
Scattering flowers, powdered incense,
Sumanas, campaka,

"Atimuktaka flowers,
Constantly burning fragrant oil—
One who makes offerings thus
Obtains immeasurable merit.

"Like empty space without bounds,
So too is their merit.
How much more so for one who upholds this sutra
While also practicing giving, upholding precepts,

"Patient acceptance, delighting in dhyāna,
Not angry, not speaking evil,
Reverent toward stūpas and monasteries,
Humble toward all bhikṣus,

"Far removed from arrogant minds,
Constantly contemplating wisdom—
When questioned with difficulties, not angered,
Responding in accordance with explanations.

"If one is able to practice such conduct,
Their merit is immeasurable.
If one sees this Dharma teacher
Who has achieved such virtues as these,

"One should scatter heavenly flowers upon them,
Cover their body with heavenly garments,
Bow with head touching their feet,
And in one's mind generate thoughts as of the Buddha.

"One should also think thus:
'It shall not be long before they proceed to the place of the Way,
Attain the undefiled and unconditioned,
Broadly benefiting devas and humans.'

"Wherever they dwell and abide,
Whether walking meditation, sitting, or lying down,
Or even expounding a single verse—
There should one erect a stūpa,

"Adorning it to make it wondrous and excellent,
Making various kinds of offerings.
When a Buddha-son dwells in this place,
It is then a place the Buddha uses.

"Constantly dwelling therein,
Walking meditation, sitting, and lying down."
