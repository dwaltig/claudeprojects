Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was dwelling at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa near the city of Rājagṛha, together with a great assembly of twelve thousand bhikṣus. All were Arhats whose outflows had been exhausted, who had no further afflictions, who had attained their own benefit, who had severed all bonds of existence, and whose minds had attained freedom. Their names were: Ājñātakauṇḍinya, Mahākāśyapa, Uruvilvākāśyapa, Gayākāśyapa, Nadīkāśyapa, Śāriputra, Mahāmaudgalyāyana, Mahākātyāyana, Aniruddha, Kapphiṇa, Gavāṃpati, Revata, Pilindavatsa, Bakkula, Mahākauṣṭhila, Nanda, Sundarananda, Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra, Subhūti, Ānanda, and Rāhula—great Arhats such as these, well known to all.

Furthermore, there were two thousand persons of learning and those beyond learning. The bhikṣuṇī Mahāprajāpatī was present with her retinue of six thousand. The bhikṣuṇī Yaśodharā, mother of Rāhula, was also present with her retinue. There were eighty thousand Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, all of whom were irreversible from anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. All had attained dhāraṇī, eloquence in joyful exposition, and had turned the irreversible Dharma wheel. They had made offerings to innumerable hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, and in the presence of all Buddhas had planted roots of virtue. They were constantly praised by all Buddhas. They cultivated themselves with compassion, skillfully entered into Buddha-wisdom, thoroughly penetrated the great wisdom, and reached the farther shore. Their fame was universally heard throughout immeasurable worlds, and they were able to liberate innumerable hundreds of thousands of living beings. Their names were: the Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, the Bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta, the Bodhisattva Nityodyukta, the Bodhisattva Aniksiptadhura, the Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi, the Bodhisattva Medicine King, the Bodhisattva Pradānaśūra, the Bodhisattva Ratnacandra, the Bodhisattva Candraprabha, the Bodhisattva Pūrṇacandra, the Bodhisattva Mahāvikramin, the Bodhisattva Anantavikramin, the Bodhisattva Trailokyavikrama, the Bodhisattva Bhadrapāla, the Bodhisattva Maitreya, the Bodhisattva Ratnākara, and the Bodhisattva Susārthavāha—eighty thousand Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas such as these were all present.

At that time Śakra Devānām Indra was present with his retinue of twenty thousand celestial sons. Also present were the celestial sons Candravimala, Manojñasvara, Ratnacchattra, and the Four Great Heavenly Kings, with their retinue of ten thousand celestial sons. The celestial sons Īśvara and Maheśvara were present with their retinue of thirty thousand celestial sons. The Brahmā Heavenly King, lord of the Sahā world, together with Śikhin Mahābrahman, Jyotiṣprabha Mahābrahman and others, were present with their retinue of twelve thousand celestial sons. There were eight Dragon Kings: the Dragon King Nanda, the Dragon King Upananda, the Dragon King Sāgara, the Dragon King Vāsukin, the Dragon King Takṣaka, the Dragon King Anavatapta, the Dragon King Manasvin, and the Dragon King Utpalaka—each with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members. There were four Kiṃnara Kings: the Kiṃnara King Dharma, the Kiṃnara King Sudharma, the Kiṃnara King Mahādharma, and the Kiṃnara King Dharmadhara—each with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members. There were four Gandharva Kings: the Gandharva King Manojña, the Gandharva King Manojñasvara, the Gandharva King Madhura, and the Gandharva King Madhurasvara—each with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members. There were four Asura Kings: the Asura King Balin, the Asura King Kharaskandha, the Asura King Vemacitra, and the Asura King Rāhu—each with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members. There were four Garuḍa Kings: the Garuḍa King Mahātejas, the Garuḍa King Mahākāya, the Garuḍa King Mahāpūrṇa, and the Garuḍa King Manojña—each with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members. King Ajātaśatru, son of Vaidehī, was present with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members. Each bowed at the Buddha's feet and withdrew to sit to one side.

At that time the World-Honored One, surrounded by the fourfold assembly, having received offerings with reverence, honor, and praise, expounded for the Bodhisattvas a Mahāyāna sutra entitled the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas. Having concluded the exposition of this sutra, the Buddha sat in full lotus posture and entered the samādhi of the abode of immeasurable meanings, his body and mind unmoving. Thereupon heavenly mandārava flowers, great mandārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, and great mañjūṣaka flowers rained down, scattering upon the Buddha and the great assembly. The entire Buddha-world quaked and trembled in six ways.

At that time, all in the assembly—bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans, lesser kings, and wheel-turning sage kings—the entire great assembly experienced what they had never experienced before. They rejoiced, placed their palms together, and single-mindedly gazed upon the Buddha.

At that time the Buddha emitted a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows, illuminating eighteen thousand worlds to the east, omitting none, extending downward to the Avīci hells and upward to the Akaniṣṭha Heaven. From this world, the beings of the six destinies in all those lands were completely visible. Moreover, the Buddhas presently dwelling in those lands were seen, and the sutras and Dharma that those Buddhas expounded were heard. Also visible were the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who had cultivated practice and attained the Way. Furthermore, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas were seen practicing the Bodhisattva path through various causes and conditions, various faiths and understandings, and various appearances and forms. Also seen were Buddhas entering parinirvāṇa. Also seen, after those Buddhas' parinirvāṇa, were stūpas of the seven precious materials being erected for their śarīra.

At that time the Bodhisattva Maitreya had this thought: "Now the World-Honored One has manifested this spiritual transformation. For what cause and condition has this auspicious sign appeared? Now the Buddha, the World-Honored One, has entered samādhi—this inconceivable manifestation of rare phenomena—whom should I ask? Who can answer?" Then he had this further thought: "This Mañjuśrī, prince of the Dharma King, has previously drawn near and made offerings to immeasurable Buddhas of the past. Surely he must have witnessed this rare sign. I shall now inquire of him."

At that time the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, and all the devas, nāgas, and spirits all had this thought: "This Buddha-light and spiritual power—of whom should we now inquire?"

At that time the Bodhisattva Maitreya, wishing to resolve his own doubt and observing the minds of the fourfold assembly—bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, and all the devas, nāgas, and spirits of the assembly—addressed Mañjuśrī, saying: "For what cause and condition has this auspicious spiritual sign appeared—this emission of great light illuminating the eighteen thousand lands to the east, whereby all the adornments of those Buddha-lands are completely visible?"

Thereupon the Bodhisattva Maitreya, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, inquiring:

"Mañjuśrī!
Why does the Guide,
From the white hair between his brows,
Universally illuminate with great light?

"Raining mandārava
And mañjūṣaka flowers,
While sandalwood-scented breezes
Delight the hearts of all—

"By this cause and condition,
The earth is perfectly adorned,
And this world
Quakes in six ways.

"At this time the fourfold assembly
All rejoice,
Their bodies and minds delighted,
Experiencing what they have never experienced.

"The light between the brows
Illuminates the east—
Eighteen thousand lands
All become golden in hue.

"From Avīci hell
Up to the Summit of Existence,
In all those worlds,
The beings of the six paths—

"Where birth and death lead,
The karmic connections of good and evil,
The beautiful and ugly results they receive—
All these are seen here.

"Also visible are the Buddhas,
Those sage lords and lions,
Expounding sutras and teachings,
Most subtle and supreme.

"Their voices pure,
Emitting gentle tones,
Teaching Bodhisattvas
Numbering countless myriads—

"Brahman voices profound and wondrous,
Causing people to delight in hearing.
In each world,
They expound the correct Dharma—

"Through various causes and conditions,
With immeasurable parables,
Illuminating the Buddha-Dharma,
Awakening living beings.

"If people encounter suffering,
Weary of old age, sickness, and death,
For them they expound nirvāṇa,
The ending of all suffering's limits.

"If people possess merit,
Having made offerings to Buddhas,
And aspire to the supreme Dharma,
For them they expound pratyekabuddhas.

"If there are sons of Buddha
Cultivating various practices
And seeking supreme wisdom,
For them they expound the pure path.

"Mañjuśrī!
Dwelling here,
I see and hear such things,
And thousands of billions more—

"So numerous,
I shall now briefly speak.
I see in those lands
Bodhisattvas numerous as Ganges' sands,

"Through various causes and conditions
Seeking the Buddha-Way.
Some practice giving—
Gold, silver, coral,

"Pearls, māṇi jewels,
Giant clam shells, agate,
Diamonds and precious things,
Servants, carriages,

"Jeweled palanquins and sedan chairs—
Joyfully giving these as gifts,
Dedicating toward the Buddha-Way,
Wishing to attain this vehicle,

"First in the three realms,
Praised by all Buddhas.
Or there are Bodhisattvas
Giving teams of jeweled carriages,

"With railings and canopies
Exquisitely adorned, as gifts.
I also see Bodhisattvas
Giving their body's flesh, hands, and feet,

"Even wives and children,
Seeking the supreme Way.
I also see Bodhisattvas
Joyfully giving their heads, eyes, and bodies,

"Seeking Buddha-wisdom.
Mañjuśrī!
I see various kings
Going to where the Buddhas are,

"Inquiring about the supreme Way,
Then abandoning their delightful lands,
Palaces and consorts,
Shaving hair and beards,

"Donning the Dharma robes.
Or I see Bodhisattvas
Becoming bhikṣus,
Dwelling alone in quietude,

"Delighting in reciting sutras.
I also see Bodhisattvas
Vigorously and energetically advancing,
Entering deep into mountains,

"Contemplating the Buddha-Way.
I also see those renouncing desire,
Always dwelling in empty places,
Deeply cultivating dhyāna concentration,

"Attaining the five spiritual powers.
I also see Bodhisattvas
Peacefully meditating with palms joined,
With thousands upon myriads of verses

"Praising the Dharma Kings.
I again see Bodhisattvas
Whose wisdom is profound and resolve firm,
Able to question the Buddhas,

"Hearing and completely upholding all.
I also see sons of Buddha
Perfected in concentration and wisdom,
Who, through immeasurable parables,

"Expound Dharma for the multitudes,
Joyfully teaching the Dharma,
Transforming all Bodhisattvas,

"Defeating the hosts of Māra,
Beating the Dharma drum.
I also see Bodhisattvas
Serene in silent tranquility,

"Though devas and nāgas revere them,
They take no joy in this.
I also see Bodhisattvas
Dwelling in forests, emitting light,

"Relieving the suffering of hells,
Causing entry to the Buddha-Way.
I also see sons of Buddha
Who have never slept,

"Walking through forests,
Diligently seeking the Buddha-Way.
I also see those perfected in precepts,
Whose deportment is flawless,

"Pure as precious gems,
Thus seeking the Buddha-Way.
I also see sons of Buddha
Dwelling in the power of patience—

"When arrogant people
Revile and beat them,
They are able to endure all,
Thus seeking the Buddha-Way.

"I also see Bodhisattvas
Who have left frivolous laughter
And foolish companions,
Drawing near to the wise,

"Single-mindedly eliminating confusion,
Gathering their thoughts in mountain forests
For myriads of thousands of years,
Thus seeking the Buddha-Way.

"Or I see Bodhisattvas
Offering choice foods and beverages
And hundreds of medicinal remedies
To the Buddha and the Saṃgha.

"Fine robes and superior garments
Worth thousands of myriads,
Or priceless robes,
Offered to Buddha and Saṃgha.

"Thousands of myriads of billions of kinds
Of sandalwood treasure houses,
Marvelous beds and bedding,
Offered to Buddha and Saṃgha.

"Pure gardens and forests
Where flowers and fruits flourish,
With flowing springs and bathing pools,
Offered to Buddha and Saṃgha.

"Such giving as this,
Of various wondrous things,
With joy and without weariness,
Seeking the supreme Way.

"Or there are Bodhisattvas
Expounding the Dharma of tranquil extinction,
Teaching and instructing in various ways
Countless multitudes of beings.

"Or I see Bodhisattvas
Contemplating the nature of dharmas—
That there is no duality,
Like empty space.

"I also see sons of Buddha
Whose minds cling to nothing,
Who, through this wondrous wisdom,
Seek the supreme Way.

"Mañjuśrī!
I also see Bodhisattvas
Who, after the Buddha's final nirvāṇa,
Make offerings to his śarīra.

"I also see sons of Buddha
Constructing stūpas and shrines
Numerous as Ganges' sands,
Adorning the lands,

"Jeweled stūpas lofty and wondrous,
Five thousand yojanas high,
Their length and breadth equal,
Two thousand yojanas each.

"Each stūpa and shrine
Has a thousand banners and pennants,
With pearl-woven canopies and curtains,
And precious bells harmoniously chiming.

"Devas, nāgas, spirits,
Humans and non-humans,
With incense, flowers, and music
Constantly make offerings.

"Mañjuśrī!
These sons of Buddha,
To make offerings to śarīra,
Adorn stūpas and shrines—

"Causing those lands naturally
To become extraordinarily wondrous and beautiful,
Like heavenly jeweled trees
Whose flowers have opened.

"The Buddha emitted one light,
And I and this assembly
See these lands'
Various wondrous things.

"The Buddhas' spiritual powers
And wisdom are rare—
Emitting one pure light,
Illuminating immeasurable lands.

"We, seeing this,
Attain what we have never attained.
Son of Buddha, Mañjuśrī,
We pray you resolve the assembly's doubts.

"The fourfold assembly looks with longing,
Gazing at you and me—
Why has the World-Honored One
Emitted this light?

"Son of Buddha, answer now,
Resolve our doubts and bring us joy.
What benefit is to be gained?
For what purpose is this light manifested?

"The Dharma attained by the Buddha
As he sat at the place of enlightenment—
Does he wish to expound this?
Or is he about to bestow predictions?

"The manifestation of those Buddha-lands,
Adorned with all precious things,
And the sight of those Buddhas—
This is no small matter.

"Mañjuśrī, you should know—
The fourfold assembly, nāgas, and spirits
Gaze upon you, worthy one,
Awaiting your explanation."

At that time Mañjuśrī addressed the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Maitreya and all the great beings, good men and others: "According to my consideration, the Buddha, the World-Honored One, now wishes to expound the great Dharma, to rain down the great Dharma rain, to blow the great Dharma conch, to beat the great Dharma drum, to elucidate the meaning of the great Dharma. Good men! In the presence of past Buddhas, I have witnessed this auspicious sign. After emitting this light, they immediately expounded the great Dharma. Therefore you should know that now, when the Buddha manifests this light, it is likewise thus—he wishes to cause all living beings to hear and know the Dharma that is difficult for all the world to believe, and therefore he manifests this auspicious sign.

"Good men! In the past, immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable, asaṃkhya kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named Candrasūryapradīpa Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna, Sugata, Lokavid, Anuttara, Puruṣa-damya-sārathi, Śāstā-deva-manuṣyānām, Buddha, Bhagavat. He expounded the correct Dharma, good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, profound in meaning and skillful in wording, pure and unmixed, complete, and perfecting the characteristics of the pure holy life. For those seeking to be śrāvakas, he expounded the Dharma appropriate to the Four Noble Truths, ferrying them across birth, old age, sickness, and death, and ultimately to nirvāṇa. For those seeking to be pratyekabuddhas, he expounded the Dharma appropriate to the twelve links of dependent origination. For the Bodhisattvas, he expounded the Dharma appropriate to the six pāramitās, causing them to attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi and perfect the wisdom of all modes.

"Next there was another Buddha, also named Candrasūryapradīpa. Next there was another Buddha, also named Candrasūryapradīpa. In this way there were twenty thousand Buddhas, all sharing the same single name, Candrasūryapradīpa, and all sharing the same surname, the surname Bharadvāja. Maitreya, you should know that from the first Buddha to the last Buddha, all shared the same name, Candrasūryapradīpa, and were perfected in the ten epithets. The Dharma they expounded was good in the beginning, middle, and end. The very last Buddha, before leaving the household life, had eight royal sons: the first named Sumati, the second named Sudhārmati, the third named Amitamati, the fourth named Ratnāmati, the fifth named Viśeṣamati, the sixth named Vimatipranaśana, the seventh named Abhimati, and the eighth named Dharmāmati. These eight princes were majestic and self-possessed, each ruling over four continents. When these princes heard that their father had left home and attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, they all renounced their royal positions and likewise left home, generated the intention for the Great Vehicle, constantly cultivated the pure holy life, and all became Dharma teachers, having planted roots of goodness in the presence of thousands of myriads of Buddhas.

"At that time, the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa expounded the Mahāyāna sutra entitled the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas. Having concluded the exposition of this sutra, immediately before the great assembly he sat in full lotus posture and entered the samādhi of the abode of immeasurable meanings, his body and mind unmoving. At that time, heavenly mandārava flowers, great mandārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, and great mañjūṣaka flowers rained down, scattering upon the Buddha and the great assembly. The entire Buddha-world quaked and trembled in six ways. At that time, all in the assembly—bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans, lesser kings, wheel-turning sage kings, and others—the entire great assembly experienced what they had never experienced before. They rejoiced, placed their palms together, and single-mindedly gazed upon the Buddha.

"At that time the Tathāgata emitted a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows, illuminating eighteen thousand Buddha-lands to the east, omitting none, just as those Buddha-lands are now seen. Maitreya, you should know that at that time there were two billion Bodhisattvas in the assembly who delighted in hearing the Dharma. These Bodhisattvas, seeing this light universally illuminating the Buddha-lands, experienced what they had never experienced before and wished to know the cause and condition of this light. At that time there was a Bodhisattva named Varaprabha who had eight hundred disciples. Then the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa arose from samādhi, and because of the Bodhisattva Varaprabha, he expounded the Mahāyāna sutra entitled the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas. For sixty lesser kalpas he did not rise from his seat. Those listening in the assembly also sat in one place for sixty lesser kalpas, their bodies and minds unmoving, listening to what the Buddha expounded, each regarding it as if only a mealtime had passed. At that time, among the multitude, not a single person, whether in body or mind, experienced weariness or exhaustion.

"After the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa had expounded this sutra for sixty lesser kalpas, he then made this proclamation before the assembly of Brahmas, Māras, śramaṇas, brāhmaṇas, devas, humans, and asuras: 'The Tathāgata shall enter parinirvāṇa without residue at midnight this very day.' At that time there was a Bodhisattva named Yaśaskāma. The Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa then conferred upon him a prediction, telling the bhikṣus: 'This Bodhisattva Yaśaskāma shall next become a Buddha named Vimalakāya, Tathāgata Arhat Samyak-saṃbuddha.' After the Buddha bestowed this prediction, at midnight he entered parinirvāṇa without residue. After the Buddha's final nirvāṇa, the Bodhisattva Varaprabha upheld the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma and for a full eighty lesser kalpas expounded it for people. The eight sons of the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa all took Varaprabha as their teacher. Varaprabha taught and transformed them, causing them to become firmly established in anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. These princes, having made offerings to immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas, all accomplished the Buddha-Way. The last to become Buddha was named Dīpaṃkara. Among the eight hundred disciples, there was one person named Yaśaskāma who was greedy for gain and offerings. Though he repeatedly recited numerous sutras, he did not penetrate them and forgot much, hence his name Yaśaskāma—Fame-Seeker. Yet this person also, through having planted various roots of goodness, encountered immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas, making offerings with reverence, honor, and praise.

"Maitreya, you should know that the Bodhisattva Varaprabha at that time—could he have been anyone else? He was none other than myself. The Bodhisattva Yaśaskāma was none other than you. Now, witnessing this auspicious sign is no different from before. Therefore I consider that today the Tathāgata shall expound the Mahāyāna sutra entitled the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas."

At that time Mañjuśrī, wishing to restate this meaning before the great assembly, spoke in verse, saying:

"I recall ages past,
Immeasurable countless kalpas—
There was a Buddha, honored among people,
Named Candrasūryapradīpa.

"The World-Honored One expounded Dharma,
Ferrying across immeasurable beings,
Countless billions of Bodhisattvas,
Causing them to enter Buddha-wisdom.

"Before the Buddha left the household,
The eight princes born to him—
Seeing the Great Sage leave home,
Also followed in cultivating the pure life.

"At that time the Buddha expounded the Great Vehicle,
A sutra named Immeasurable Meanings,
Before the great assembly
He extensively explained and clarified it.

"After the Buddha expounded this sutra,
Immediately upon the Dharma seat,
He sat in lotus samādhi
Named the Abode of Immeasurable Meanings.

"Heaven rained mandārava flowers,
Heavenly drums spontaneously sounded,
Devas, nāgas, ghosts, and spirits
Made offerings to the Honored One among humans.

"All those Buddha-lands
At once greatly quaked and trembled.
The Buddha emitted light from between his brows,
Manifesting various rare phenomena.

"This light illuminated to the east
Eighteen thousand Buddha-lands,
Revealing all living beings'
Places of birth-death karmic retribution.

"I saw those Buddha-lands,
Adorned with various precious things,
The color of lapis lazuli and crystal—
This was due to the Buddha's illuminating light.

"And I saw devas and humans,
Nāgas, spirits, yakṣas,
Gandharvas and kiṃnaras,
Each making offerings to their Buddha.

"I also saw those Tathāgatas
Naturally accomplishing the Buddha-Way,
Their body color like golden mountains,
Supremely dignified and most wondrous—

"Like pure lapis lazuli
Containing a true golden image within.
The World-Honored Ones, in great assemblies,
Expounded the profound Dharma's meaning.

"In each of those Buddha-lands,
Śrāvakas beyond counting—
Due to the Buddha's illuminating light—
That entire great assembly was visible.

"Or there were bhikṣus
In mountain forests,
Energetically upholding pure precepts,
Guarding them like bright pearls.

"I also saw Bodhisattvas
Practicing giving, patience, and the like,
Their number like Ganges' sands—
This was due to the Buddha's illuminating light.

"I also saw Bodhisattvas
Deeply entering various dhyāna concentrations,
Bodies and minds serene and unmoving,
Thus seeking the supreme Way.

"I also saw Bodhisattvas
Who knew the Dharma's mark of tranquil extinction,
Each in their own lands
Expounding Dharma, seeking the Buddha-Way.

"At that time the fourfold assembly,
Seeing the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa
Manifest great spiritual powers,
All rejoiced in their hearts,

"Each asking one another,
'What is the cause of this?'
The Honored One revered by devas and humans
Had just arisen from samādhi,

"And praised the Bodhisattva Varaprabha:
'You are the eye of the world,
Trusted and taken refuge in by all,
Able to uphold the Dharma treasury.

"'The Dharma I have expounded—
Only you can bear true witness to it.'
The World-Honored One, having offered this praise,
Causing Varaprabha to rejoice,

"Expounded this Lotus Sutra
For a full sixty lesser kalpas
Without rising from his seat.
The supreme wondrous Dharma he expounded

"Was completely upheld and received
By that Dharma Teacher Varaprabha.
After the Buddha expounded the Lotus,
Causing the assembly to rejoice,

"On that very day
He proclaimed to the assembly of devas and humans:
'The true characteristics of all dharmas' meaning
Has already been expounded for you.

"'I now at midnight
Shall enter into nirvāṇa.
You must single-mindedly advance with vigor,
Separating from indolence.

"'Buddhas are extremely difficult to encounter—
Once in billions of kalpas.'
The World-Honored One's disciples,
Hearing the Buddha would enter nirvāṇa,

"Each harbored grief and distress:
'How quickly the Buddha is extinguished!'
The Sage Lord, King of Dharma,
Comforted the immeasurable multitudes:

"'When the time of my final nirvāṇa comes,
You should not worry or fear.
This Bodhisattva Yaśaskāma
Has penetrated in mind the true mark without outflows.

"'He shall next become Buddha,
Named Vimalakāya,
Also ferrying across immeasurable multitudes.'
That night the Buddha was extinguished,

"Like firewood exhausted and fire extinguished.
Śarīra were distributed
And immeasurable stūpas erected.

"Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs,
Their number like Ganges' sands,
Redoubled their energetic vigor,
Seeking the supreme Way.

"That Dharma Teacher Varaprabha
Upheld the Buddha's Dharma treasury—
For eighty lesser kalpas
He extensively proclaimed the Lotus Sutra.

"Those eight princes
Were taught and transformed by Varaprabha,
Firm in the supreme Way—
They would see innumerable Buddhas.

"Having made offerings to all Buddhas,
Following and practicing the great Way,
They successively accomplished Buddhahood,
Conferring predictions in turn.

"The last among heavenly honored ones
Was named the Buddha Dīpaṃkara,
Guide of all seers,
Who liberated immeasurable multitudes.

"That Dharma Teacher Varaprabha
At that time had one disciple
Whose mind constantly harbored indolence,
Greedily attached to fame and gain.

"Seeking fame and gain without satiation,
Frequently visiting noble households,
He abandoned what he had memorized,
Forgot it and could not penetrate it.

"Because of this cause and condition,
He was called Yaśaskāma.
Yet he also practiced various good deeds,
And was able to see innumerable Buddhas.

"Making offerings to all Buddhas,
Following and practicing the great Way,
Perfecting the six pāramitās,
He now sees the Lion of the Śākyas.

"Afterward he shall become a Buddha
Whose name shall be Maitreya,
Widely ferrying across living beings,
Their number beyond measure.

"After that Buddha's final nirvāṇa,
The indolent one—that is you.
That Dharma Teacher Varaprabha
Is now my very self.

"I witnessed the Buddha Dīpaṃkara—
The original light-sign was like this.
From this I know the present Buddha
Wishes to expound the Lotus Sutra.

"The present sign is like the original auspice—
This is the skillful means of all Buddhas.
Now the Buddha emits this light
To help reveal the meaning of true characteristics.

"All people should now know:
Join your palms single-mindedly and wait—
The Buddha shall rain down the Dharma rain,
Satisfying all who seek the Way.

"Those seeking the Three Vehicles—
If they harbor doubts or regrets—
The Buddha shall dispel and sever them,
Causing them to be exhausted without remainder."

End of Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION.



At that time, the World-Honored One arose from samādhi with tranquil composure and addressed Śāriputra: "The wisdom of the Buddhas is extremely profound and immeasurable. The gateway to this wisdom is difficult to comprehend and difficult to enter. It cannot be known by any śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha. Wherefore is this so? The Buddhas have personally drawn near to hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of innumerable Buddhas, and have exhaustively practiced the immeasurable Dharma-ways of all Buddhas, advancing vigorously and courageously, until their names were universally heard. They have perfected the extremely profound and unprecedented Dharma, and whatever they teach in accordance with circumstances has a meaning difficult to comprehend.

"Śāriputra, since attaining Buddhahood, through various causes and conditions, various parables, I have extensively proclaimed teachings with words, and through immeasurable skillful means have guided living beings, causing them to separate from all attachments. Wherefore is this so? The Tathāgata's skillful means and the pāramitā of insight and vision are both completely perfected.

"Śāriputra, the insight and vision of the Tathāgata are vast, profound, and far-reaching—immeasurable, unobstructed. [He possesses] powers, fearlessnesses, dhyāna concentrations, liberations, and samādhis, having penetrated deeply without limit, and has perfected all unprecedented Dharmas.

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is able to make various distinctions and skillfully expound all dharmas. His words are gentle and soft, delighting the hearts of all.

"Śāriputra, to speak concisely: the Buddha has completely perfected the immeasurable, limitless, unprecedented Dharma.

"Cease, Śāriputra! There is no need to speak further. Wherefore is this so? Because what the Buddha has perfected is the foremost, rare, and difficult-to-understand Dharma. Only a Buddha together with a Buddha can fathom the true mark of all dharmas—that is to say: the suchness of their marks, the suchness of their nature, the suchness of their embodiment, the suchness of their power, the suchness of their function, the suchness of their causes, the suchness of their conditions, the suchness of their effects, the suchness of their retributions, and the suchness of their ultimate equality from beginning to end."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"The Hero of the World is immeasurable—
All devas and worldly people,
All categories of living beings,
None can know the Buddha.

"The Buddha's powers and fearlessnesses,
His liberations and samādhis,
And all the Buddha's other dharmas—
None can measure them.

"Originally, from innumerable Buddhas,
Having completely practiced all Ways,
The profound and wondrous Dharma,
Difficult to see and difficult to comprehend—

"Throughout immeasurable billions of kalpas,
Having practiced all these Ways,
At the place of enlightenment he attained the fruit.
I have completely known and seen it all.

"Such great fruition and retribution,
The meaning of various natures and marks—
I, together with the Buddhas of the ten directions,
Alone can know this matter.

"This Dharma cannot be demonstrated;
The mark of words is extinguished.
Of all other categories of living beings,
None are able to comprehend it,

"Except for the multitude of Bodhisattvas
Whose power of faith is firm and solid.
The multitude of Buddha-disciples
Who have made offerings to all Buddhas,

"Who have exhausted all outflows
And dwell in this final body—
Even such people as these
Cannot bear this burden.

"Even if the world were filled
Entirely with ones like Śāriputra,
Who exhausted their thinking to measure it together,
They could not fathom the Buddha's wisdom.

"Even if the ten directions were filled
Entirely with ones like Śāriputra,
And the rest of the disciples
Also filled the lands of the ten directions,

"And exhausted their thinking to measure it together,
Still they could not know it.
Pratyekabuddhas of keen wisdom,
Without outflows, in their final bodies,

"Also filling the ten directions' realms,
Their number like bamboo forests—
If these all with one mind,
Throughout billions of immeasurable kalpas,

"Wished to contemplate the Buddha's true wisdom,
They could not know even a small portion.
Newly-resolved Bodhisattvas
Who have made offerings to innumerable Buddhas,

"Who thoroughly understand all meanings
And are moreover able to expound Dharma well—
Like rice, hemp, bamboo, and reeds
Filling the lands of the ten directions—

"With one mind, through wondrous wisdom,
Throughout kalpas numerous as Ganges' sands,
All together contemplating and measuring,
They could not know the Buddha's wisdom.

"Irreversible Bodhisattvas,
Their number like Ganges' sands—
With one mind seeking together,
Still they could not know it.

"Again I tell Śāriputra:
The inconceivable, without outflows,
Extremely profound and wondrous Dharma—
I have now completely attained it.

"Only I know this mark;
The Buddhas of the ten directions are likewise thus.
Śāriputra, you should know:
The words of all Buddhas do not differ.

"Toward the Dharma the Buddha has expounded,
You should generate great power of faith.
After the World-Honored One's Dharma has long endured,
He must in the end proclaim the truth.

"I tell the multitude of śrāvakas
And those seeking the pratyekabuddha vehicle:
'I enable you to escape the bonds of suffering
And attain nirvāṇa.'

"Through the power of skillful means,
The Buddha manifests the teaching of the Three Vehicles.
Living beings are attached in various places;
He draws them forth and enables them to emerge.

At that time in the great assembly, there were śrāvakas—Arhats whose outflows were exhausted, such as Ājñātakauṇḍinya and twelve hundred others, as well as bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who had generated the resolve for the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha vehicles. Each had this thought: "For what reason does the World-Honored One now so earnestly extol skillful means and make this statement: 'The Dharma the Buddha has attained is extremely profound and difficult to comprehend. Whatever he says has a meaning difficult to know, which all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas cannot reach. The Buddha has expounded the single meaning of liberation, yet we also have attained this Dharma and arrived at nirvāṇa. But now we do not know toward what this meaning tends.'"

At that time Śāriputra, perceiving the doubts in the minds of the fourfold assembly and being himself not yet comprehending, addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, by what cause and condition do you now so earnestly extol the foremost skillful means of all Buddhas—the extremely profound, wondrous, and difficult-to-comprehend Dharma? From times past until now, I have never heard such an exposition from the Buddha. Now the fourfold assembly all harbor doubts. We only pray that the World-Honored One will expound this matter. World-Honored One, for what reason do you so earnestly extol this extremely profound, wondrous, and difficult-to-comprehend Dharma?"

At that time Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Sun of Wisdom, Great Sage and Honored One,
After so long you now expound this Dharma.
You yourself proclaim having attained such
Powers, fearlessnesses, and samādhis,

"Dhyāna concentrations, liberations, and such—
Inconceivable dharmas.
The Dharma attained at the place of enlightenment—
None can raise questions about it.

"My intention is difficult to fathom;
There is also none who can question it.
Without being questioned, you speak of your own accord,
Extolling the Way you have practiced:

"'The wisdom is extremely wondrous—
What all Buddhas have attained.'
The outflow-free Arhats
And those seeking nirvāṇa

"Have now all fallen into a net of doubts:
'Why does the Buddha speak of this?'
Those seeking the pratyekabuddha vehicle,
Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs,

"Devas, dragons, ghosts, and spirits,
Gandharvas and such,
Gaze at one another harboring hesitation,
Looking up to the Honored One of Two Feet:

"'What is the meaning of this matter?'
We pray the Buddha will explain.
Among the multitude of śrāvakas,
The Buddha has said I am foremost.

"Yet now regarding my own wisdom,
I am doubtful and cannot comprehend:
Is this the ultimate Dharma?
Or is this the path to be practiced?

"Sons born from the Buddha's mouth,
With palms joined, gaze upward and wait,
Praying you will emit wondrous sound
And timely expound the truth.

"Devas, dragons, spirits, and such,
Their number like Ganges' sands,
Bodhisattvas seeking Buddhahood,
Eighty thousand in great number,

"And from myriads of billions of lands,
Wheel-turning sage kings have arrived,
With palms joined and reverent minds,
Wishing to hear the complete Way."

At that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Cease, cease! There is no need to speak further. If I were to speak of this matter, all the devas and humans in all worlds would be shocked and doubtful."

Śāriputra again addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we only pray you will speak of it, we only pray you will speak of it. Wherefore is this so? In this assembly are immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of asaṃkhya living beings who have seen all Buddhas, whose faculties are keen and sharp, whose wisdom is clear and luminous. If they hear what the Buddha expounds, they will be able to believe it with reverence."

At that time Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Dharma King, Supreme and Honored One,
Only speak—pray have no concern!
In this assembly of immeasurable multitudes,
There are those able to believe with reverence."

The Buddha again stopped Śāriputra: "If I were to speak of this matter, all the devas, humans, and asuras in all the world would be shocked and doubtful, and the bhikṣus of overweening pride would fall into a great pit."

At that time the World-Honored One repeated this in verse, saying:

"Cease, cease—there is no need to speak!
My Dharma is wondrous and difficult to contemplate.
Those of overweening pride,
Hearing it, will certainly not believe with reverence."

At that time Śāriputra again addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we only pray you will speak of it, we only pray you will speak of it! In this present assembly, hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions such as we have, world after world, already received transformation from the Buddha. People such as these will surely be able to believe with reverence, attaining peace and security for the long night, receiving much benefit."

At that time Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Supreme Honored One of Two Feet,
Pray expound the foremost Dharma!
I am the Buddha's eldest son—
I only pray you will explain with discrimination.

"The immeasurable multitude in this assembly
Can believe this Dharma with reverence.
The Buddha has already, world after world,
Taught and transformed ones such as these.

"All with one mind and palms joined,
They wish to hear and receive the Buddha's words.
We twelve hundred,
And others seeking Buddhahood,

"Pray for the sake of this multitude
That you will explain with discrimination.
When these hear this Dharma,
They will experience great joy."

At that time the World-Honored One told Śāriputra: "Since you have now earnestly requested three times, how can I not speak? You should now listen attentively and think well upon this. I shall explain and analyze it for you." As he spoke these words, in the assembly there were bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās—five thousand persons who immediately rose from their seats, bowed to the Buddha, and withdrew. Wherefore was this so? The roots of transgression of this group were deep and grave, and [they harbored] overweening pride. Thinking they had attained what they had not attained, thinking they had realized what they had not realized, having such faults as these, therefore they did not remain. The World-Honored One remained silent and did not restrain them.

At that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: "My present assembly is now free of branches and leaves and is purely composed of the true and substantial. Śāriputra, it is well that such people of overweening pride have withdrawn. You should now listen well; I shall expound for you." Śāriputra said: "So be it, World-Honored One! I joyfully wish to hear."

The Buddha told Śāriputra:

"Such wondrous Dharma as this is expounded by the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, only occasionally, like the uḍumbara flower which appears but once in a great while. Śāriputra, you should all believe what the Buddha says; his words are not false or vain.

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas expound the Dharma in accordance with what is appropriate, and its meaning is difficult to comprehend. Wherefore is this so? Through immeasurable skillful means, through various causes and conditions, through parables and expressions, I expound all dharmas. This Dharma is not something that thought and discrimination can comprehend; only the Buddhas can know it. Wherefore is this so? The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world for the sake of one great cause and condition alone.

"Śāriputra, what is meant by 'the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world for the sake of one great cause and condition alone'? The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world because they wish to cause living beings to open the Buddha's insight and vision, enabling them to attain purity. They appear in the world because they wish to demonstrate to living beings the Buddha's insight and vision. They appear in the world because they wish to cause living beings to awaken to the Buddha's insight and vision. They appear in the world because they wish to cause living beings to enter the path of the Buddha's insight and vision. Śāriputra, this is the one great cause and condition for which all Buddhas appear in the world."

The Buddha told Śāriputra: "The Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, merely teach and transform Bodhisattvas. All their actions are always for one matter alone: solely to demonstrate and awaken living beings to the Buddha's insight and vision.

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata expounds the Dharma for living beings solely through the One Buddha Vehicle. There are no other vehicles, whether two or three.

"Śāriputra, the Dharma of all the Buddhas of the ten directions is likewise thus.

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the past expounded dharmas for living beings through immeasurable, innumerable skillful means, through various causes and conditions, through parables and expressions. All these dharmas were for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All these living beings, hearing the Dharma from the Buddhas, ultimately attain the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, when the Buddhas of the future appear in the world, they too will expound dharmas for living beings through immeasurable, innumerable skillful means, through various causes and conditions, through parables and expressions. All these dharmas will be for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All these living beings, hearing the Dharma from the Buddhas, will ultimately attain the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, presently in the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddha-lands throughout the ten directions, who bring much benefit and peace to living beings—these Buddhas too expound dharmas for living beings through immeasurable, innumerable skillful means, through various causes and conditions, through parables and expressions. All these dharmas are for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All these living beings, hearing the Dharma from the Buddhas, ultimately attain the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, these Buddhas merely teach and transform Bodhisattvas. They wish to demonstrate to living beings the Buddha's insight and vision. They wish to cause living beings to awaken to the Buddha's insight and vision. They wish to cause living beings to enter the Buddha's insight and vision.

"Śāriputra, I too am now likewise thus. Knowing that living beings have various desires and that the attachments in the depths of their minds differ, in accordance with their fundamental natures, through various causes and conditions, parables, and expressions, through the power of skillful means, I expound the Dharma for them.

"Śāriputra, all of this is for the purpose of enabling them to attain the One Buddha Vehicle and the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions there are not even two vehicles, how much less three!

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas appear in the five turbidities of an evil world—namely, the turbidity of the kalpa, the turbidity of afflictions, the turbidity of living beings, the turbidity of views, and the turbidity of lifespan. It is thus, Śāriputra: when the kalpa is turbid and chaotic, living beings are heavily defiled, avaricious, jealous, and envious, thereby perfecting various unwholesome roots. Therefore the Buddhas, through the power of skillful means, within the One Buddha Vehicle, make distinctions and expound three.

"Śāriputra, if any of my disciples claim to be Arhats or pratyekabuddhas but do not hear or know that the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, merely teach and transform Bodhisattvas—such are not disciples of the Buddha, not Arhats, and not pratyekabuddhas.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra, if these bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs claim to have already attained Arhatship, to be in their final body, to have reached final nirvāṇa, and consequently do not further aspire to seek anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, you should know that all such people harbor overweening pride. Wherefore is this so? It is impossible for a bhikṣu who has truly attained Arhatship not to believe this Dharma—except after the Buddha's final nirvāṇa when there is no Buddha present. Wherefore is this so? After the Buddha's final nirvāṇa, those who can receive, uphold, read, recite, and comprehend the meaning of sutras such as these will be difficult to find. If they encounter other Buddhas, they will then attain decisive understanding regarding this Dharma.

"Śāriputra, you should all single-mindedly believe, comprehend, receive, and uphold the Buddha's words. The words of the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, are not false or vain. There is no other vehicle; there is only the One Buddha Vehicle."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs
Harboring overweening pride,
Upāsakas with self-conceit,
And upāsikās lacking faith—

"These four groups and such,
Five thousand in number,
Do not perceive their own faults;
Their precepts have deficiencies and flaws,

"Yet they guard and treasure their imperfections.
These people of small wisdom have departed—
The chaff amidst the multitude.
By the Buddha's awesome virtue they left.

"These people have scant merit and virtue
And cannot receive this Dharma.
This assembly is now free of branches and leaves,
Remaining only the purely true and substantial.

"Śāriputra, listen well!
The Dharma attained by all Buddhas,
Through the power of immeasurable skillful means,
Is expounded for living beings.

"What living beings think in their minds,
The various paths they practice,
Their manifold natures and desires,
And the good and evil karma of past lives—

"The Buddha completely knows all this,
And through various conditions and parables,
Through expressions and the power of skillful means,
He causes all to rejoice.

"Whether expounding sūtras,
Gāthās, or accounts of previous events,
Of past births and unprecedented matters,
Or also expounding causality,

"Parables together with geyas,
And upadeśa sūtras—
Those of dull faculties who delight in lesser dharmas,
Greedily attached to birth and death,

"Who, despite innumerable Buddhas,
Do not practice the profound and wondrous Way,
Who are harassed and confused by manifold sufferings—
For these I expound nirvāṇa.

"I established these skillful means
To cause them to enter into Buddha-wisdom.
I have never yet told you
That you shall attain the Buddha-Way.

"The reason I have never yet spoken
Is because the time to speak had not yet arrived.
Now precisely is that time
To decisively expound the Great Vehicle.

"These nine divisions of my Dharma,
Expounded in accordance with living beings,
Have as their foundation entry into the Great Vehicle—
Therefore I expound this sutra.

"There are Buddha-sons whose minds are pure,
Who are gentle and also of keen faculties,
Who in the presence of immeasurable Buddhas
Have practiced the profound and wondrous Way.

"For these Buddha-sons
I expound this Great Vehicle sutra.
I predict that such people
In future lives shall attain the Buddha-Way,

"Because with profound minds they are mindful of the Buddha
And uphold the pure precepts.
When these hear they shall become Buddhas,
Great joy fills their bodies.

"The Buddha, knowing their mental conduct,
Therefore expounds the Great Vehicle for them.
When śrāvakas or Bodhisattvas
Hear the Dharma I expound,

"Even a single verse,
All without doubt shall become Buddhas.
In the Buddha-lands of the ten directions,
There is only the Dharma of One Vehicle—

"There is no second and no third,
Except the Buddha's expedient teaching,
Where he merely uses provisional names
To guide living beings,

"Expounding the Buddha's wisdom.
The Buddhas appear in the world
Solely for this one true matter;
The other two are not true.

"They will never use a Lesser Vehicle
To ferry living beings across.
The Buddha himself dwells in the Great Vehicle,
And according to the Dharma he has attained—

"Adorned with the power of concentration and wisdom—
With this he ferries living beings across.
Having himself realized the supreme Way,
The Great Vehicle's equal Dharma,

"If he were to transform even one person
By means of the Lesser Vehicle,
I would be guilty of stinginess and greed—
Such a thing is impossible.

"If a person has faith in and takes refuge with the Buddha,
The Tathāgata does not deceive or delude,
Nor has he thoughts of avarice or envy;
He has severed evil in all dharmas.

"Therefore, throughout the ten directions,
The Buddha alone is without fear.
I adorn my body with the marks,
My light illuminates the world.

"Honored by immeasurable multitudes,
I expound the seal of true characteristics.
Śāriputra, you should know
That I originally made a vow,

"Wishing to cause all the multitude
To be equal to me without difference.
As was my vow in times past,
Now it has been completely fulfilled—

"I transform all living beings,
Causing them all to enter the Buddha-Way.
If when I encounter living beings,
I were to teach them all the Buddha-Way,

"Those without wisdom would become confused,
Deluded and unable to receive the teaching.
I know these living beings
Have never cultivated wholesome roots,

"Are firmly attached to the five desires,
And through delusion and craving generate afflictions.
Through the causes and conditions of various desires,
They fall into the three evil paths,

"Revolving through the six destinies,
Thoroughly experiencing all sufferings and poisons.
Receiving the minute form in the womb,
World after world it constantly increases.

"People of scant virtue and little merit,
Oppressed by manifold sufferings,
Enter the dense forest of wrong views—
Existence, non-existence, and the like.

"Relying upon all these views,
Fully possessed of sixty-two,
Deeply attached to false and empty dharmas,
Firmly clinging and unable to release them,

"They are arrogant and self-exalting,
Flattering and crooked, their minds insincere.
Throughout thousands of myriads of billions of kalpas,
They hear not the Buddha's name,

"Nor do they hear the correct Dharma—
Such people are difficult to ferry across.
Therefore, Śāriputra,
I establish skillful means,

"Expounding the path that exhausts all suffering,
Demonstrating nirvāṇa to them.
Though I speak of nirvāṇa,
This too is not true extinction.

"All dharmas from the origin
Have always borne the mark of tranquil extinction.
When Buddha-sons have practiced the Way,
In a future age they shall become Buddhas.

"I possess the power of skillful means
And demonstrate the teaching of the Three Vehicles.
All the World-Honored Ones
Expound the path of One Vehicle.

"Now this great assembly
Should all eliminate doubts and perplexities.
The words of all Buddhas do not differ—
There is only One, not Two Vehicles.

"Throughout past immeasurable kalpas,
Innumerable Buddhas who have entered extinction—
Hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of kinds,
Their number beyond measure—

"Such World-Honored Ones as these,
Through various conditions and parables,
Through the power of innumerable skillful means,
Have expounded the characteristics of all dharmas.

"These World-Honored Ones
All expound the Dharma of One Vehicle,
Transforming immeasurable multitudes,
Causing them to enter the Buddha-Way.

"Moreover, these Great Sage Lords,
Knowing all the world—
Devas, humans, and all categories of beings—
The deep desires of their minds,

"Further employ different skillful means
To help illuminate the foremost meaning.
If there are categories of living beings
Who encountered Buddhas of the past—

"Whether they heard Dharma, practiced giving,
Or upheld precepts, practiced patience,
Vigor, dhyāna, wisdom, and such,
Cultivating merit and wisdom in various ways—

"All such people as these
Have already attained the Buddha-Way.
After the Buddhas' final nirvāṇa,
If people have gentle and pliant minds,

"All such living beings as these
Have already attained the Buddha-Way.
After the Buddhas' final nirvāṇa,
Those who make offerings to śarīra,

"Erecting myriads of billions of kinds of stūpas—
Of gold, silver, and crystal,
Giant clam shell and agate,
Rose quartz and lapis lazuli jewels,

"Pure, vast, and well adorned,
Decorating all the stūpas—
Or some who erect stone temples,
Of sandalwood and aloe wood,

"Hovenia and other timbers,
Brick, tile, clay, and earth—
Or in a deserted wilderness
Pile earth to form a Buddha-shrine—

"Or even children at play
Heap sand to make a Buddha-stūpa—
All such people as these
Have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"If people, for the Buddha's sake,
Establish various images,
Carved and sculpted in manifold forms,
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"Whether made of seven jewels,
Copper—red or white,
Pewter, lead, or tin,
Iron, wood, or also clay,

"Or fashioned with lacquer-coated cloth
To adorn and create Buddha-images—
All such people as these
Have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"Those who painted Buddha-images
With the hundred merits adorning their marks—
Whether doing so themselves or employing others—
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"Or even children at play,
With grass, wood, or brush,
Or using fingernails
To draw and create Buddha-images—

"All such people as these,
Gradually accumulating merit and virtue,
Perfecting a heart of great compassion,
Have already attained the Buddha-Way,

"Merely transforming Bodhisattvas
And ferrying across immeasurable multitudes.
If people, before stūpas and shrines,
Or precious images and painted images,

"With flowers, incense, banners, and canopies,
Make offerings with reverent minds—
Or if they employ others to make music,
Beating drums, blowing horns and conches,

"Flutes, pipes, lutes, and harps,
Lutes, cymbals, and gongs—
Such manifold wondrous sounds
All continuously offered,

"Or with joyful minds
Singing songs praising the Buddha's virtue—
Even with but one small sound—
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"If a person with scattered mind,
Even with but a single flower,
Makes offerings to a painted image,
They shall gradually see innumerable Buddhas.

"Or if people make prostrations,
Or merely join their palms,
Or even raise a single hand,
Or slightly bow their heads,

"Making offerings to images with these—
They shall gradually see immeasurable Buddhas,
Themselves attaining the supreme Way,
Extensively ferrying across innumerable multitudes,

"Entering nirvāṇa without residue,
Like firewood exhausted and fire extinguished.
If people with scattered minds
Enter stūpas or shrines

"And recite but once 'Namo Buddha,'
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.
Regarding all Buddhas of the past,
Whether while living or after extinction,

"If there were those who heard this Dharma,
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.
The World-Honored Ones of the future,
Whose number is without measure—

"These Tathāgatas
Shall also expound the Dharma through skillful means.
All the Tathāgatas,
Through immeasurable skillful means,

"Ferry across all living beings,
Causing them to enter the Buddha's outflow-free wisdom.
Of those who hear the Dharma,
Not one fails to become a Buddha.

"The original vow of all Buddhas:
'The Buddha-Way that I practice—
I universally wish to cause living beings
Also to attain this same Way.'

"The Buddhas of future ages,
Though they expound hundreds of thousands of billions,
Innumerable Dharma-gates,
In truth these are for the One Vehicle.

"All Buddhas, Honored Ones of Two Feet,
Know the Dharma is always without nature;
The Buddha-seed arises from conditions—
Therefore they expound the One Vehicle.

"This Dharma dwells in the Dharma-position;
The marks of the world constantly abide.
Having known this at the place of enlightenment,
The guiding teacher expounds through skillful means.

"The presently existing Buddhas of the ten directions,
Honored and offered by devas and humans,
Their number like Ganges' sands,
Appearing in the world

"To bring peace to living beings,
Also expound this Dharma thus,
Knowing the foremost tranquil extinction,
Through the power of skillful means.

"Though they manifest various paths,
In truth these are for the Buddha Vehicle.
Knowing living beings' various practices,
The thoughts deep within their minds,

"The karma they practiced in the past,
Their desires, natures, and vigor-power,
And the keenness or dullness of their faculties—
Through various causes and conditions,

"Parables and also expressions,
In accordance with what is suitable, they expound through skillful means.
I too am now likewise thus,
To bring peace to living beings,

"Through various Dharma-gates
I proclaim and demonstrate the Buddha-Way.
Through the power of my wisdom,
Knowing living beings' natures and desires,

"I expound all dharmas through skillful means,
Causing all to attain joy.
Śāriputra, you should know
That with the Buddha-eye I observe

"And see living beings of the six paths,
Impoverished, without merit and wisdom,
Entering the dangerous path of birth and death,
Suffering continuing uninterrupted,

"Deeply attached to the five desires
Like a yak loving its tail—
Through greed and craving they cover themselves,
Blind and unseeing, they see nothing.

"Not seeking the Buddha of great power
Or the Dharma that severs suffering,
They deeply enter wrong views,
Wishing through suffering to cast off suffering.

"For the sake of these living beings
I generate a heart of great compassion.
When I first sat at the place of enlightenment,
Contemplating the tree and also walking,

"Throughout three times seven days,
I contemplated matters such as these:
'The wisdom I have attained
Is wondrous and most supreme.

"'But living beings' faculties are dull;
Attached to pleasures, blinded by delusion—
How can categories such as these
Possibly be ferried across?'

"At that time all the Brahma Kings
And the Śakra Devānām Indras,
The Four Heavenly Kings who protect the world,
And the Great Īśvara Deva,

"Together with other hosts of devas,
With retinues of hundreds of thousands of myriads,
Reverently joining palms and making obeisances,
Requested that I turn the Dharma-wheel.

"I then thought to myself:
'If I merely praise the Buddha Vehicle,
Living beings sunk in suffering
Will be unable to believe this Dharma.

"'Through breaking the Dharma and not believing,
They would fall into the three evil paths.
I would rather not expound the Dharma
And swiftly enter into nirvāṇa.'

"Then recalling the Buddhas of the past,
The power of skillful means they practiced,
'The Way I have now attained
Should also be expounded as the Three Vehicles.'

"While making such contemplation,
The Buddhas of the ten directions all appeared,
With Brahma voices comforting and exhorting me:
'Excellent, Śākyamuni!

"'Foremost guiding teacher,
Having attained this supreme Dharma,
Following all the Buddhas,
You employ the power of skillful means.

"'We too have all attained
The most wondrous, foremost Dharma,
And for all categories of living beings
Make distinctions expounding the Three Vehicles.

"'Those of little wisdom who delight in lesser dharmas,
Not believing themselves capable of becoming Buddhas—
Therefore through skillful means
We make distinctions expounding various fruits.

"'Though we furthermore expound the Three Vehicles,
It is solely to teach Bodhisattvas.'
Śāriputra, you should know:
I heard the Sacred Lion's

"Profound, pure, and wondrous voice,
Joyfully proclaiming 'Namo Buddha!'
I furthermore made this contemplation:
'I have emerged into a turbid and evil world.

"'As all the Buddhas have expounded,
I too shall follow and practice accordingly.'
Having contemplated this matter,
I immediately proceeded to Vārāṇasī.

"The mark of tranquil extinction of all dharmas
Cannot be conveyed in words.
Through the power of skillful means,
I expounded it for the five bhikṣus.

"This is called turning the Dharma-wheel;
There arose then the sound of 'nirvāṇa,'
As well as 'Arhat,'
And the distinct names 'Dharma' and 'Saṅgha.'

"From distant kalpas until now,
I have praised this nirvāṇa Dharma:
'The suffering of birth and death is eternally exhausted'—
I constantly expound thus.

"Śāriputra, you should know:
I see Buddha-sons
Aspiring to seek the Buddha-Way,
Immeasurable thousands of myriads of billions—

"All with reverent minds
Coming to where the Buddha is.
They have heard from all Buddhas
The Dharma expounded through skillful means.

"I then made this contemplation:
'The reason the Tathāgata appears
Is to expound the Buddha-wisdom—
Now precisely is the time.'

"Śāriputra, you should know:
People of dull faculties and small wisdom,
Attached to marks and arrogant—
These cannot believe this Dharma.

"Now I joyfully and without fear,
Among the Bodhisattvas,
Frankly casting aside skillful means,
Expound solely the supreme Way.

"When Bodhisattvas hear this Dharma,
All their nets of doubt are removed.
The twelve hundred Arhats
Shall likewise all become Buddhas.

"Like the Buddhas of the three periods of time,
In their manner of expounding the Dharma,
I too am now likewise thus,
Expounding the undifferentiated Dharma.

"The Buddhas' emergence in the world
Is remote and difficult to encounter.
Even when they appear in the world,
To expound this Dharma is also difficult.

"Throughout immeasurable, innumerable kalpas,
To hear this Dharma is also difficult.
Those able to listen to this Dharma—
Such people are also rare.

"Like the uḍumbara flower,
Which all love and delight in,
Rare for devas and humans—
It appears only occasionally.

"Those who hear the Dharma and joyfully praise it,
Even uttering but a single word,
Have thereby already made offerings
To all Buddhas of the three periods of time.

"Such people are extremely rare,
Surpassing even the uḍumbara flower.
You should harbor no doubts—
I am the King of all Dharmas,

"Proclaiming to the entire great assembly:
'Solely through the path of One Vehicle
I teach and transform Bodhisattvas;
There are no śrāvaka disciples.'

"You, Śāriputra,
Śrāvakas and Bodhisattvas,
Should know this wondrous Dharma
Is the secret essential of all Buddhas.

"In this evil world of five turbidities,
Where beings merely delight in attachment to desires,
Living beings such as these
Will never seek the Buddha-Way.

"The evil people of future ages,
Hearing the Buddha expound the One Vehicle,
Shall be deluded, unable to believe and receive it,
And through breaking the Dharma shall fall into evil paths.

"There are those with humility and purity
Who aspire to seek the Buddha-Way—
For ones such as these
I should extensively praise the path of One Vehicle.

"Śāriputra, you should know
The Dharma of all Buddhas is thus:
Through myriads of billions of skillful means,
They expound the Dharma in accordance with what is suitable.

"Those who are not practiced and learned in this
Cannot comprehend it thoroughly.
Since you have already come to know
That all Buddhas, teachers of the world,

"Employ skillful means in accordance with what is suitable,
You should have no further doubts or perplexities.
Let your minds give rise to great joy,
Knowing you shall become Buddhas."

End of Chapter 2: SKILLFUL MEANS.



At that time Śāriputra, leaping with joy, immediately rose, joined his palms together, gazed up at the Honored Countenance, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "Now, hearing this Dharma-sound from the World-Honored One, my heart leaps with joy and I have experienced what I have never before experienced. Wherefore is this so? In former times when I heard such Dharma from the Buddha and saw the Bodhisattvas receive predictions of Buddhahood, while we were not included in these matters, I deeply lamented and grieved at having lost the Tathāgata's immeasurable insight and vision.

"World-Honored One, when I would constantly dwell alone in mountain forests and beneath trees, whether sitting or walking, I would always have this thought: 'We have all equally entered into the Dharma-nature—why does the Tathāgata ferry us across through the Lesser Vehicle Dharma?' This is our fault, not the World-Honored One's. Wherefore is this so? Had we waited for the exposition of the causes for perfecting anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, we would certainly have been ferried across through the Great Vehicle. However, we did not comprehend that [the Buddha] expounds in accordance with what is appropriate through skillful means. Upon first hearing the Buddha-Dharma, we immediately encountered it, believed, received, contemplated, and realized it.

"World-Honored One, from times past until now, throughout the day and night, I have constantly reproached myself. But now, from the Buddha, I have heard this Dharma never before heard, this unprecedented Dharma, and all my doubts and regrets have been severed. My body and mind are at ease; I have quickly attained peace and security. Today at last I know that truly I am a Buddha-son, born from the Buddha's mouth, born from the Dharma through transformation, having obtained my share of the Buddha-Dharma."

At that time Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Hearing this Dharma-sound,
I have attained what I never before had.
My heart harbors great joy;
All nets of doubt have been removed.

"From ancient times receiving the Buddha's teaching,
I have not lost the Great Vehicle.
The Buddha's voice is extremely rare—
It can remove the afflictions of living beings.

"I have already attained the exhaustion of outflows;
Hearing this also removes my cares and afflictions.
I dwelt in mountain valleys
Or beneath forest trees,

"Whether sitting or walking,
Constantly contemplating this matter.
Alas! I deeply reproached myself:
'Why have I deceived myself?

"'We too are Buddha-sons,
Having equally entered the outflow-free Dharma,
Yet cannot in the future
Expound the supreme Way.

"'The golden color and thirty-two marks,
The ten powers and various liberations—
We share in one Dharma together,
Yet have not attained these things.

"'The eighty kinds of wondrous excellences,
The eighteen unique Buddha-dharmas—
Such merits as these,
All of them I have lost.'

"When I would walk alone,
Seeing the Buddha amidst the great assembly,
His fame filling the ten directions,
Extensively benefiting living beings,

"I thought I had lost this benefit;
I had deceived and deluded myself.
Constantly, day and night,
I would contemplate this matter,

"Wishing to ask the World-Honored One
Whether I had lost it or not.
I constantly saw the World-Honored One
Praising all the Bodhisattvas;

"Thus throughout day and night
I pondered over this matter.
Now, hearing the Buddha's voice
Expounding in accordance with what is appropriate,

"The outflow-free, inconceivable [Dharma],
Causing multitudes to reach the place of enlightenment—
I originally adhered to wrong views,
Serving as a teacher for the brāhmaṇas.

"The World-Honored One, knowing my mind,
Uprooted the wrong and expounded nirvāṇa.
I completely eliminated wrong views
And attained realization of the Dharma of emptiness.

"At that time my mind declared to itself
That I had attained extinction.
But now I realize myself
That this was not true extinction.

"When I attain Buddhahood,
Perfected with the thirty-two marks,
Revered by devas, humans, yakṣas,
Dragons, spirits, and others—

"At that time it may be said
I am forever exhausted and extinguished without remainder.
The Buddha, amidst the great assembly,
Has said I shall become a Buddha.

"Hearing such Dharma-sound,
All doubts and regrets have been removed.
When first I heard what the Buddha expounded,
In my mind great shock and doubt arose:

"'Could this not be Māra
Assuming the Buddha's form,
To harass and disturb my mind?'
The Buddha through various conditions,

"Parables and skillful expressions,
With a mind tranquil as the sea—
Hearing it, my net of doubts was severed.
The Buddha spoke of Buddhas of past ages,

"Immeasurable numbers who entered extinction,
Dwelling secure in skillful means;
They too all expounded this Dharma.
Present and future Buddhas,

"Whose number is without measure,
Also through various skillful means
Expound this Dharma thus.
Just as the present World-Honored One,

"From his birth and leaving home,
Attaining the Way and turning the Dharma-wheel,
Also expounds through skillful means.
The World-Honored One expounds the true path;

"Pāpīyān [the evil one] has no such matter.
Through this I definitely know
This is not Māra assuming the Buddha's form.
Because I had fallen into a net of doubts,

"I thought it was Māra's doing.
Hearing the Buddha's gentle, soft voice,
Profound, far-reaching, and extremely wondrous,
Expounding and manifesting the pure Dharma,

"My heart experienced great joy.
Doubts and regrets are forever exhausted;
I dwell secure in true wisdom.
I definitely shall become a Buddha,

"Honored by devas and humans.
I shall turn the supreme Dharma-wheel,
Teaching and transforming the Bodhisattvas."

At that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: "I now amidst this assembly of devas, humans, śramaṇas, brāhmaṇas, and others proclaim: In the past, in the presence of two myriads of billions of Buddhas, for the sake of the supreme Way, I constantly taught and transformed you. Throughout the long night you followed me in receiving instruction. Because I guided you through skillful means, you were born into my Dharma.

"Śāriputra, in former times I taught you to aspire to the Buddha-Way. You have now completely forgotten this and便自謂已得滅度 [consider yourself to have already attained extinction]. I now once again wish to cause you to recall the original vow and the Way you practiced. Therefore, for the śrāvakas, I expound this Great Vehicle sutra called the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas.

"Śāriputra, in a future age, after immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable kalpas, having made offerings to several thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas, having upheld the correct Dharma and perfected the path practiced by Bodhisattvas, you shall attain Buddhahood. Your name shall be Padmaprabha Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna, Sugata, Lokavid, Anuttara, Puruṣa-damya-sārathi, Śāstā-deva-manuṣyānām, Buddha, Bhagavat. Your land shall be named Vimalā ['Free from Defilement']. The earth shall be level and pure, adorned and exquisite, peaceful, prosperous, and happy, with devas and humans flourishing. The ground shall be of lapis lazuli with eight crossroads, bordered with golden cords. Alongside shall be rows of seven-jeweled trees, constantly bearing flowers and fruits. The Tathāgata Padmaprabha shall also teach and transform living beings through the Three Vehicles.

"Śāriputra, although that Buddha appears at a time that is not an evil age, because of his original vows he expounds the Dharma of the Three Vehicles. That kalpa shall be named Mahāratnapratimaṇḍita ['Great Jeweled Adornment']. Why is it named Great Jeweled Adornment? In that land, Bodhisattvas are regarded as great jewels. Those Bodhisattvas shall be immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable, beyond what calculations or parables can reach; no one besides those with the Buddha's power of wisdom can know their number. When they wish to walk, jeweled flowers support their feet. These Bodhisattvas are not those who have newly generated the resolve; all have long planted roots of virtue. In the presence of immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas they have purely cultivated the holy life, constantly receiving praise from all Buddhas. They constantly cultivate Buddha-wisdom, possess great spiritual powers, thoroughly know all the gateways to the Dharmas, are straightforward, genuine, and undeceptive, and their aspirations and mindfulness are firm and solid. Bodhisattvas such as these shall fill that land.

"Śāriputra, the lifespan of the Buddha Padmaprabha shall be twelve lesser kalpas—excluding the time when he was a prince before becoming a Buddha. The people of that land shall live eight lesser kalpas. After twelve lesser kalpas, the Tathāgata Padmaprabha shall confer upon the Bodhisattva Dhṛtipariparipūrṇa the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, telling the bhikṣus: 'This Bodhisattva Dhṛtipariparipūrṇa shall next become a Buddha, whose name shall be Padmapadaviśīrṇagāmin, Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha. His Buddha-land shall also be thus.'

"Śāriputra, after this Buddha Padmaprabha enters final nirvāṇa, the correct Dharma shall dwell in the world for thirty-two lesser kalpas, and the semblance Dharma shall also dwell for thirty-two lesser kalpas."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Śāriputra, in a future age
Shall become a Buddha, universally honored in wisdom,
Whose name shall be Padmaprabha,
Ferrying across immeasurable multitudes.

"Having made offerings to innumerable Buddhas,
Perfecting the practices of Bodhisattvas,
The ten powers and other merits,
He shall realize the supreme Way.

"After immeasurable kalpas have passed,
The kalpa shall be named Great Jeweled Adornment,
The world named Free from Defilement—
Pure, without impurities or blemishes.

"With lapis lazuli as its ground,
Golden cords bordering its paths,
Seven-jeweled trees of mixed colors
Constantly bearing flowers and fruits.

"The Bodhisattvas of that land,
Their aspirations constantly firm and solid,
Having all perfected
Spiritual powers and pāramitās—

"In the presence of innumerable Buddhas,
They have well studied the Bodhisattva-Way.
Great beings such as these
Are transformed by the Buddha Padmaprabha.

"When the Buddha was a prince,
He renounced his kingdom and worldly glory.
In his very final body
He left home and perfected the Buddha-Way.

"The Buddha Padmaprabha shall dwell in the world
For twelve lesser kalpas.
The people of that land
Shall have lifespans of eight lesser kalpas.

"After the Buddha's extinction,
The correct Dharma shall dwell in the world
For thirty-two lesser kalpas,
Extensively ferrying across all living beings.

"When the correct Dharma is exhausted,
The semblance [Dharma shall last] thirty-two [kalpas].
Śarīra shall be widely distributed,
Universally receiving offerings from devas and humans.

"What the Buddha Padmaprabha accomplishes—
These matters shall all be thus.
That Honored Sage of Two Feet
Shall be most supreme, without equal or match.

"That one shall be none other than you—
You should rejoice and celebrate!"

At that time the fourfold assembly—bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās—together with devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, and other members of the great assembly, seeing Śāriputra before the Buddha receive the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, experienced great joy in their hearts, leaping with immeasurable delight. Each removed the upper garment they were wearing and offered it to the Buddha. Śakra Devānām Indra, the Brahmā Heavenly King, and others, together with innumerable celestial sons, also made offerings to the Buddha with wondrous celestial garments, celestial mandārava flowers, mahāmandārava flowers, and such. The celestial garments they scattered remained in empty space, revolving of themselves. Celestial music of hundreds of thousands of myriads of kinds simultaneously played in empty space, raining down multitudes of celestial flowers. And they spoke these words: "Long ago at Vārāṇasī the Buddha first turned the Dharma-wheel; now he again turns the supreme and greatest Dharma-wheel!"

At that time the celestial sons, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Long ago at Vārāṇasī
He turned the Dharma-wheel of the Four Noble Truths,
Making distinctions and expounding all dharmas—
The arising and cessation of the five aggregates.

"Now again he turns the most wondrous,
Supreme and great Dharma-wheel.
This Dharma is extremely deep and mysterious;
Few are able to believe it.

"We from ancient times until now
Have repeatedly heard the World-Honored One expound,
But have never before heard
Such profound, wondrous, and supreme Dharma.

"Since the World-Honored One expounds this Dharma,
We all rejoice accordingly.
The greatly wise Śāriputra
Has now received the honored prediction.

"We too are likewise thus—
We shall certainly attain Buddhahood.
Throughout all the world
Most honored, without any superior.

"The Buddha-Way is inconceivable;
He expounds through skillful means in accordance with what is appropriate.
Whatever merit and karmic activity we possess,
Whether of this life or past lives,

"Together with seeing the Buddha's merit—
All of it we dedicate toward the Buddha-Way."

At that time Śāriputra addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I now have no further doubts or regrets. Personally before the Buddha I have received the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. These twelve hundred whose minds are self-mastered formerly dwelt at the stage of learning. The Buddha constantly taught and transformed them, saying: 'My Dharma can separate one from birth, old age, sickness, and death, ultimately reaching nirvāṇa.' Whether at the stage of learning or beyond learning, these people also each considered that, having separated from the view of self as well as views of existence and non-existence, they had attained nirvāṇa. But now, before the World-Honored One, hearing what they had never before heard, they have all fallen into doubt and perplexity. Excellent, World-Honored One! We pray that for the sake of the fourfold assembly you will explain the cause and condition, causing them to separate from doubt and regret."

At that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Did I not previously say that all Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, through various causes and conditions, parables, and expressions, expound the Dharma through skillful means, all for the sake of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi? All these expositions are for the sake of transforming Bodhisattvas. However, Śāriputra, I shall now once more through a parable clarify this meaning further. Those with wisdom comprehend through parables.

"Śāriputra, suppose in a certain land, province, or village there was a great elder who was aged and declining, possessing immeasurable wealth, with many fields, estates, and servants. His house was vast and great, having only a single gate. A great many people—one, two, or even five hundred—were dwelling within it. The halls and pavilions were decayed and old, the walls crumbling down, the pillar bases rotten and decomposed, the beams and ridgepoles tilting precariously. All around, simultaneously, fire suddenly broke out, engulfing the dwelling. The elder's sons—perhaps ten, twenty, or as many as thirty—were inside this house.

"The elder, seeing this great fire arise from the four directions, immediately felt great alarm and terror, and had this thought: 'Though I am able to emerge safely through this burning gate, my sons within the burning house are engrossed in play and amusements, unaware, unknowing, unalarmed, unafraid. Though the fire approaches and presses upon their bodies, causing them pain and suffering, their minds harbor no aversion or distress, and they have no thought of escaping.'

"Śāriputra, this elder made this reflection: 'I have physical strength in my body and hands. I could use a robe or a table to carry them out of the dwelling.' Then he further reflected: 'This house has only one gate, which moreover is narrow and small. My sons are young and immature, lacking understanding. They are attached to their place of play and may fall down and be burned by the fire. I should tell them of this frightening matter: this house is already burning—they must quickly get out now, lest they be harmed by the fire.' Having thought thus, in accordance with his reflections, he informed all his sons: 'You must quickly come out!' Though the father showed compassion and skillfully coaxed and admonished them, the sons were engrossed in amusements and play, unwilling to believe and receive [his warning], neither alarmed nor afraid, and completely lacking any thought of escape. Moreover, they did not even know what fire was, what a house was, or what 'losing' meant. They merely ran about from east to west, playing, glancing at their father and nothing more.

"At that time the elder made this reflection: 'This house is already being consumed by a great fire. If my sons and I do not get out in time, we shall certainly be burned. I shall now employ skillful means to cause my sons to escape this calamity.' The father, knowing what each of his sons had previously enjoyed—various rare and unusual playthings and objects to which they would certainly be attached—spoke to them, saying: 'The playthings you enjoy, rare and difficult to obtain—if you do not take them now, you will surely regret it later. Various sheep-carts, deer-carts, and ox-carts are now outside the gate, where you can play with them. You should quickly come out of this burning house. Whatever you desire, I shall give to you all.'

"At that time, the sons, hearing their father describe these precious playthings—things that suited their wishes—each became emboldened and brave. Pushing and jostling one another, they raced competitively forth, scrambling to escape the burning house.

"At that time, when the elder saw that his sons had safely escaped and were all seated in the open at the crossroads, no longer obstructed, his mind became tranquil and he was filled with joy and rapture. Each of the sons then addressed their father, saying: 'Father, the playthings you promised us earlier—the sheep-carts, deer-carts, and ox-carts—please give them to us now.'

"Śāriputra, at that time the elder gave to each of his sons an identical great cart. These carts were tall and spacious, adorned and decorated with manifold jewels, surrounded with railings, with bells hanging from all four sides. A canopy was spread over the top, also decorated and adorned with rare and various jewels. Jeweled cords crisscrossed, with hanging garlands of flowers. Inside, layered mats were spread with cushions of red pillows. They were yoked to white oxen, their skin lustrous and pure, their physical form beautiful, possessing great muscular strength, their gait steady and even, as swift as the wind. Moreover, many servants attended and guarded them. Wherefore was this so? This great elder possessed immeasurable wealth; all his various storehouses were completely full to overflowing. And he made this reflection: 'My wealth is limitless. I should not give inferior small carts to my sons. These young children are all my sons, whom I love without partiality. Possessing such great seven-jeweled carts, immeasurable in number, I should with equal mind give one to each, without showing favoritism. Wherefore is this so? Even if I were to distribute these possessions throughout an entire land, there would still be no shortage—how much more so for my sons!' At that time, each of the sons mounted his great cart, experiencing what they had never before experienced, beyond their original expectations.

"Śāriputra, what is your opinion? Did that elder, in giving precious great carts equally to his sons, commit any falsehood or not?"

Śāriputra replied: "No, World-Honored One. That elder merely enabled his sons to escape the fire's calamity, preserving their bodies and lives—this was not falsehood. Why is this so? Precisely by preserving their bodies and lives, they had already obtained wonderful playthings—how much more so through skillful means used to rescue them from that burning house! World-Honored One, even if that elder had not given them so much as the smallest cart, it still would not have been falsehood. Why is this so? That elder had previously formed this intention: 'I shall employ skillful means to cause my sons to escape.' For this reason, there is no falsehood. How much less falsehood is there when the elder, knowing himself to possess immeasurable wealth, wishing to benefit his sons equally, gave them each great carts!"

The Buddha told Śāriputra: "Excellent, excellent! It is just as you have said. Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is also likewise thus—he is the father of all the world. Regarding all fear, decline, distress, anxiety, ignorance, and dark obscuration, he has forever exhausted them without remainder, and has perfected immeasurable insight and vision, powers, fearlessnesses, great spiritual power, and the power of wisdom. He possesses perfect skillful means and the pāramitā of wisdom. His great compassion and great kindness are constant and unwearying; he eternally seeks wholesome matters, benefiting all.

"Thus he is born into the triple world—a decaying and burning house—in order to ferry across living beings from birth, old age, sickness, death, grief, sorrow, suffering, distress, delusion, darkness, and the three poisons of fire. He teaches and transforms them, causing them to attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. He sees all living beings being seared and boiled by birth, old age, sickness, death, grief, sorrow, suffering, and distress. Moreover, due to the five desires and wealth they undergo various kinds of suffering. Further, through greedy attachment and pursuit, they presently undergo manifold sufferings and afterward undergo the sufferings of the hells, animals, and hungry ghosts. Even if born in the heavens or in the human realm, they undergo the sufferings of poverty and destitution, the suffering of separation from the beloved, the suffering of encountering the hateful—such various kinds of suffering as these. Yet living beings, sunken within all this, delight and play joyfully, unaware, unknowing, unalarmed, unafraid. They also do not become weary or seek liberation. In this burning house of the triple world they run about from east to west. Though they encounter great suffering, they do not regard it as affliction.

"Śāriputra, having seen this, the Buddha then made this reflection: 'I am the father of living beings. I should extract them from suffering and distress and give them the joy of the immeasurable, limitless Buddha-wisdom, causing them to find amusement in it.'

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata further made this reflection: 'If I merely use spiritual power and the power of wisdom, casting aside skillful means, and for the sake of living beings praise the Tathāgata's insight and vision, powers, and fearlessnesses, living beings will be unable to be ferried across through this. Wherefore is this so? These living beings have not yet escaped birth, old age, sickness, death, grief, sorrow, suffering, and distress. They are being burned by the burning house of the triple world—how could they comprehend the Buddha's wisdom?'

"Śāriputra, just as that elder, though he had physical strength and power in his body and hands, did not use it but merely through diligent skillful means rescued his sons from the calamity of the burning house, and afterward gave each the precious great carts—the Tathāgata is also likewise thus. Though he possesses power and fearlessness, he does not use it. He merely through the power of wisdom and skillful means extracts and rescues living beings from the burning house of the triple world, expounding for them the Three Vehicles—those of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and Buddhas. And he speaks thus: 'You should not delight in dwelling in the burning house of the triple world. Do not greedily crave crude and inferior forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles. If through greedy attachment you generate love, you will be burned by it. You should quickly exit the triple world and obtain the Three Vehicles of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and Buddhas. I now guarantee this matter for you; it shall never prove false. You should merely be diligently vigorous.'

"Through these skillful means the Tathāgata entices living beings forward. He furthermore says: 'You should know that these Three Vehicle Dharmas are all praised by sages. They are free, unbound, without anything upon which they depend or which they seek. Riding these Three Vehicles, through outflow-free faculties, powers, limbs of enlightenment, factors of the Path, dhyāna concentrations, liberations, samādhis, and such, you yourselves experience amusement and thereby attain immeasurable peace, security, and joy.'

"Śāriputra, if there are living beings who internally possess the nature of wisdom, who, hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, the World-Honored One, believe and receive it, who are diligent and vigorous, wishing to quickly exit the triple world and seeking nirvāṇa for themselves—these are called those of the Śrāvaka Vehicle, like those sons who sought the sheep-carts and exited the burning house.

"If there are living beings who, hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, the World-Honored One, believe and receive it, who are diligent and vigorous, seeking self-arising wisdom, delighting in solitary goodness and tranquility, and deeply understanding the causes and conditions of all dharmas—these are called those of the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle, like those sons who sought the deer-carts and exited the burning house.

"If there are living beings who, hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, the World-Honored One, believe and receive it, who diligently cultivate and vigorously advance, seeking the wisdom of all modes, Buddha-wisdom, self-arising wisdom, teacherless wisdom, the Tathāgata's insight and vision, powers, and fearlessnesses, who pity, bring peace, and benefit immeasurable multitudes of living beings, benefiting devas and humans and ferrying across all—these are called those of the Great Vehicle. Because Bodhisattvas seek this Vehicle, they are called Mahāsattvas, like those sons who sought the ox-carts and exited the burning house.

"Śāriputra, just as that elder, seeing his sons safely escape the burning house and reach a place without fear, reflecting on his immeasurable wealth, gave great carts equally to his sons—the Tathāgata is also likewise thus, being the father of all living beings. If he sees immeasurable billions of thousands of myriads of living beings, through the Buddha's teaching-gateway, escape the suffering, fear, and dangerous paths of the triple world and attain the joy of nirvāṇa, the Tathāgata at that time makes this reflection: 'I possess immeasurable, limitless wisdom, powers, fearlessnesses, and other treasuries of Buddha-Dharmas. All these living beings are my sons. I give equally to all the Great Vehicle, not allowing anyone to individually attain extinction. All shall attain extinction through the Tathāgata's extinction.' Those living beings who escape the triple world are all given the amusements and tools of the Buddhas' dhyāna concentrations and liberations. They are all of one mark, one kind, praised by sages, able to generate pure, wondrous, foremost joy.

"Śāriputra, just as that elder first used the three carts to entice his sons, but afterward gave them only the great cart adorned with jewels, safest and foremost—yet that elder is not guilty of falsehood—the Tathāgata is also likewise thus, without any falsehood. First he expounds the Three Vehicles to guide living beings, but afterward he ferries them across solely through the Great Vehicle. Wherefore is this so? The Tathāgata possesses the treasury of immeasurable wisdom, powers, fearlessnesses, and all dharmas, and is able to give all living beings the Dharma of the Great Vehicle. However, not all are able to receive it.

"Śāriputra, for this cause and condition you should know: through the power of skillful means, within the One Buddha Vehicle, the Buddhas make distinctions and expound three."

The Buddha, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Suppose there is an elder
Who has a great dwelling,
Which, being of long standing,
Moreover is now dilapidated and ruinous.

"The halls and houses are lofty and dangerous,
The pillar bases decayed and rotten,
The beams and ridgepoles tilting askew,
The foundations and steps crumbling and destroyed.

"Walls and partitions are cracked and gaping,
The mud coating has peeled and fallen off,
The thatch covering is scattered and collapsing,
The rafters and crossbeams are loose and dislodged.

"Surroundings winding and crooked,
Filth fills them everywhere.
Five hundred people
Dwell and reside within it.

"Kites, owls, eagles, and vultures,
Crows, magpies, doves, and pigeons,
Vipers, snakes, vipers, and scorpions,
Centipedes and millipedes,

"Geckos and hundred-leggers,
Weasels, raccoons, and mice—
Various evil insect tribes
Run crisscross back and forth.

"Places of excrement and urine stench,
With impure matter flowing and overflowing—
Dung beetles and other insects
Gather and collect upon them.

"Foxes, wolves, and wild dogs
Chew, trample, and gnaw at corpses,
Scattering bones and flesh about.
Due to this, packs of dogs

"Competitively come to snatch and grab,
Starving, emaciated, frightened, and frantic,
Everywhere seeking food,
Fighting and struggling, tearing and pulling,

"Snarling and howling, barking—
Such is the fearful condition
And changing state of that dwelling.

"Everywhere throughout
Are sprites and demons.
Yakṣas and evil ghosts
Devour human flesh.

"Poisonous insect tribes
And various evil birds and beasts
Hatch and bear offspring,
Each hiding and protecting them.

"Yakṣas compete to come
And struggle to seize and devour them.
Having eaten their fill,
Their evil minds become even fiercer.

"The sounds of their fighting and struggling
Are extremely fearful.
Kumbhāṇḍa ghosts
Squat upon mounds of earth,

"Sometimes rising from the ground
One or two feet,
Wandering back and forth,
Indulging in frivolous play,

"Seizing dogs by both feet,
Striking them so they lose their voice,
Placing feet upon their necks,
Terrifying the dogs for their own amusement.

"Again there are various ghosts
Whose bodies are tall and large,
Naked, black, and emaciated,
Constantly dwelling therein,

"Emitting great evil sounds,
Crying and calling out for food.
Again there are ghosts
Whose throats are like needles.

"Again there are ghosts
With heads like ox heads—
Some eat human flesh,
Others also devour dogs.

"Hair disheveled and wild,
Cruel and dangerous in harming,
Oppressed by hunger and thirst,
They cry out and run about.

"Yakṣas, hungry ghosts,
And various evil birds and beasts,
Desperately hungry, facing in all directions,
Peering through windows and openings—

"Such difficulties as these,
And fears immeasurable,
Belong to this decayed old dwelling,
Which is owned by one person.

"That person had recently gone out
Not long before
When, in the rear of that dwelling,
Fire suddenly broke out.

"Simultaneously on all four sides
Its flames burned fiercely together.
Ridgepoles, beams, rafters, and pillars
Exploded with震裂 [震crackling sounds],

"Crumbling, breaking, and falling down,
Walls and partitions collapsing.
All the ghosts and spirits
Raised their voices in great cries.

"Eagles, vultures, and various birds,
Kumbhāṇḍas and such,
In frantic terror and fear,
Were unable to escape by themselves.

"Evil beasts and poisonous insects
Hid and burrowed into holes and crevices.
Piśāca ghosts
Also dwelt therein.

"Due to scant merit and virtue,
Oppressed by the fire,
They mutually harmed one another,
Drinking blood and devouring flesh.

"Wild dog tribes
Had already died before.
Various large evil beasts
Competed to come and devour them.

"Foul smoke and flames
Filled and blocked all four sides.
Centipedes and millipedes,
Poisonous snake tribes,

"Burned by the fire,
Struggled to exit their holes.
Kumbhāṇḍa ghosts
Seized and devoured them.

"Moreover, all the hungry ghosts
Had fire burning atop their heads.
Afflicted by hunger, thirst, heat, and distress,
They frantically ran about in anguish.

"Such is the condition of that dwelling—
Extremely fearful,
With calamities of poison, harm, and fire,
Manifold difficulties, not just one.

"At that time the master of the dwelling
Was standing outside the gate.
He heard someone say:
'Your various sons

"'Earlier, due to play and amusement,
Entered into this dwelling.
Young and lacking knowledge,
They delight and are attached to amusements.'

"The elder, hearing this,
Alarmed, entered the burning house,
Appropriately planning rescue,
To prevent them from being burned or harmed.

"He admonished and instructed his sons,
Explaining the manifold troubles and difficulties:
'Evil ghosts and poisonous insects,
The calamity of fire spreading everywhere,

"'Manifold sufferings continuously,
One after another without cease.
Poisonous snakes and vipers,
Together with all the yakṣas,

"'Kumbhāṇḍa ghosts,
Wild dogs, foxes, and jackals,
Eagles, vultures, and kites,
And hundred-legged tribes,

"'Afflicted by hunger and thirst,
Extremely fearful—
This is a place of suffering and difficulty,
How much worse with the great fire!'

"The sons, lacking knowledge,
Though hearing their father's instruction,
Still remained attached and delighted,
Playing without cease.

"At that time the elder
Made this reflection:
'The sons are like this,
Increasing my grief and distress.

"'Now in this dwelling
There is nothing delightful,
Yet these sons,
Engrossed in frivolous play,

"'Do not receive my teaching
And will be harmed by the fire.'
He immediately reflected,
Establishing various skillful means,

"And told all his sons:
'I have various
Precious playthings—
Wonderful jeweled fine carts,

"'Sheep-carts and deer-carts,
And great ox-carts,
Now outside the gate.
Come out, you!

"'For your sake
I have created these carts.
According to your desires,
You can play with them.'

"Hearing these carts described,
The sons immediately raced competitively,
Running forth and emerging,
Reaching the open ground,

"Separating from all suffering and difficulties.
The elder, seeing his sons
Escape the burning house,
Dwelling at the crossroads,

"Seated on lion thrones,
Made this joyful declaration:
'I am now happy and at ease!
These sons

"'Were extremely difficult to give birth to and raise.
Foolish, small, and lacking knowledge,
They entered a dangerous dwelling
With many poisonous insects

"'And frightful sprites and demons.
The great fire with fierce flames
Arose simultaneously from all four sides,
Yet these sons,

"'Greedy and attached to play,
I have now rescued them,
Causing them to escape difficulty.
Therefore, all people,

"'I am now happy and at ease.'
At that time the sons,
Knowing their father was seated securely,
All approached their father's place

"And addressed their father, saying:
'Please grant us
The three kinds of jeweled carts
As you previously promised:

"'When the sons emerge,
You shall give three carts
According to our desires.'
Now is precisely the time—

"'We only pray you will bestow them!'
The elder, greatly wealthy,
With many treasuries and storehouses—
Gold, silver, lapis lazuli,

"Giant clam shell, and agate—
With manifold jeweled materials
He fashioned various great carts,
Decorated and adorned,

"Surrounded with railings,
With bells hanging from four sides,
And golden cords crisscrossing.
Pearl netting

"Spread and extended above,
With golden flower garlands
Hanging down everywhere.
Multicolored decorations

"Surrounded them all about.
Soft silk and cotton
Served as cushions and mats.
Superior, wondrous fine cloth

"Worth thousands of billions,
Pure white and immaculately clean,
Covered them above.
There were great white oxen,

"Fat, strong, and powerful,
Beautiful in physical form,
Yoked to the jeweled carts,
With many attendants

"Serving and guarding them.
With these wonderful carts
He gave equally to his sons.
The sons at that time

"Experienced joy and rapture,
Mounting these jeweled carts,
Roaming in the four directions,
Playing joyfully,

"At ease without obstruction.
I tell Śāriputra:
I too am likewise thus—
Among sages most honored,

"Father of the world.
All living beings
Are all my sons,
Deeply attached to worldly pleasures,

"Without minds of wisdom.
The triple world has no peace—
It is like a burning house,
Filled with manifold sufferings,

"Extremely fearful,
Constantly having birth, old age,
Sickness, death, and anxieties—
Fires such as these

"Blaze fiercely without cease.
The Tathāgata has already separated
From the burning house of the triple world,
Dwelling serenely and leisurely at ease,

"Peacefully residing in forests and wilds.
Now this triple world
Is all my possession.
The living beings within it

"Are all my sons.
Yet now this place
Has many troubles and difficulties.
Only I alone

"Am able to provide rescue and protection.
Though I furthermore teach and instruct,
They do not believe or receive it,
Due to being deeply attached

"To desires through greed.
Through these skillful means
I expound the Three Vehicles,
Causing all living beings

"To know the triple world's sufferings,
Demonstrating and expounding
The transcendent worldly path.
If these sons

"Have minds that are resolute and determined,
Perfecting the three clarities
And the six spiritual powers,
Some attaining pratyekabuddhahood,

"And irreversible Bodhisattvas—
Śāriputra,
For the sake of living beings,
Through this parable

"I expound the One Buddha Vehicle.
If you are able
To believe and receive these words,
You shall all

"Attain accomplishment of the Buddha-Way.
This Vehicle is wondrous,
Pure and foremost.
Throughout all worlds

"There is none superior to it—
That which the Buddha delights in.
All living beings
Should praise it,

"Make offerings to it, and bow to it.
Immeasurable billions of thousands
Of powers and liberations,
Dhyāna concentrations and wisdom,

"Together with the Buddha's other dharmas—
Having attained such a Vehicle,
It causes all the sons
Throughout days, nights, and kalpa-periods

"Constantly to find amusement and play,
Together with Bodhisattvas
And the multitude of śrāvakas,
Mounting this jeweled Vehicle,

"Going directly to the place of enlightenment.
For this cause and condition,
Seeking throughout the ten directions,
There is no other Vehicle,

"Except the Buddha's skillful means.
I tell Śāriputra
That you and all others
Are all my sons,

"And I am your father.
Throughout accumulated kalpas
You have been burned by manifold sufferings,
And I have rescued and extracted you all,

"Causing you to exit the triple world.
Though I previously said
You had all attained extinction,
You have merely exhausted birth and death

"But have not truly become extinct.
What you should now accomplish
Is solely Buddha-wisdom.
If there are Bodhisattvas

"Within this assembly
Who can single-mindedly listen to
The true Dharma of all Buddhas—
Though the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones,

"Through skillful means
Transform living beings,
All those transformed are Bodhisattvas.

"If people have small wisdom,
Deeply attached to craving and desire—
For ones such as these
I expound the Truth of Suffering.

"Living beings' minds rejoice,
Experiencing what they never before had:
'The Buddha's exposition of the Truth of Suffering
Is true and without difference!'

"If there are living beings
Who do not know suffering's root,
Who are deeply attached to suffering's cause
And cannot temporarily relinquish it—

"For ones such as these,
I expound the Path through skillful means.
The cause of all sufferings
Is greed and desire as the root.

"If one extinguishes greed and desire,
It has nothing upon which to depend.
Extinguishing and exhausting all sufferings
Is called the Third Truth.

"For the sake of the Truth of Extinction,
One cultivates and practices the Path.
Separating from all bonds of suffering
Is called attaining liberation.

"Regarding what matter
Do these people attain liberation?
They merely separate from falsity and emptiness—
This is called liberation.

"In reality they have not yet attained
Complete liberation.
The Buddha says these people
Have not truly attained extinction,

"Because these people have not yet attained
The supreme Way.
My intention does not wish
To cause them to reach extinction.

"I am the Dharma King,
Sovereign over all dharmas.
To bring peace to living beings,
I therefore appear in the world.

"Śāriputra,
This Dharma-seal of mine,
Wishing to benefit
The world, I expound it.

"Wherever you roam,
Do not transmit it carelessly.
If there are those who hear it
And rejoice, receiving it reverently,

"You should know such people
Are irreversible [from enlightenment].
If there are those who believe and receive
This sutra-Dharma,

"Such people have already
Seen Buddhas of the past,
Reverently making offerings
And also hearing this Dharma.

"If people are able
To believe what you expound,
They thereby see me
And also see you

"Together with the bhikṣu Saṅgha
And all the Bodhisattvas.
This Dharma Flower Sutra
Is expounded for those of deep wisdom.

"Those of shallow knowledge hearing it
Become confused and fail to comprehend.
All śrāvakas
And pratyekabuddhas

"Regarding this sutra
Find it beyond their power's reach.
Even you, Śāriputra,
Regarding this sutra

"Gained entry through faith—
How much more so other śrāvakas!
The other śrāvakas,
Due to believing the Buddha's words,

"Comply with this sutra,
Not through their own wisdom's portion.
Furthermore, Śāriputra,
To the arrogant and lazy,

"Those who calculate [views of] self—
Do not expound this sutra.
Common people of shallow knowledge,
Deeply attached to the five desires,

"Hearing it, cannot comprehend—
Also do not expound it to them.
If people do not believe
And slander this sutra,

"They thereby sever all
The Buddha-seeds of the world.
Or they may frown with furrowed brows
And harbor doubts and perplexities—

"You should now listen
To the karmic retribution of such people:
Whether the Buddha is in the world
Or after his extinction,

"If there are those who slander
Sutras such as this,
Who see those reading, reciting,
Or upholding and copying the sutra,

"Who despise, hate, envy them,
And harbor resentful thoughts—
Listen now to the karmic retribution
Of such people:

"When their lives end,
They enter Avīci hell,
Fully remaining for one kalpa.
When the kalpa ends they are reborn,

"Turning and revolving thus
Through innumerable kalpas.
Emerging from the hells,
They shall fall into the animal realm—

"As dogs or wild jackals,
Their forms gaunt and emaciated,
Dark, mottled with mange and scabies,
Objects for people to torment.

"Moreover, they shall be
Loathed and despised by people,
Constantly afflicted by hunger and thirst,
Their bones and flesh withered and desiccated.

"In life receiving cruel torment,
In death struck by tiles and stones—
Due to severing the Buddha-seed,
They receive such karmic retribution.

"If they become camels
Or are born among donkeys,
Their bodies constantly bearing heavy loads,
With sticks and whips added,

"They think only of water and grass,
Knowing nothing else.
Due to slandering this sutra,
They obtain retribution such as this.

"Some become wild jackals
Entering villages and settlements,
Their bodies afflicted with mange and scabies,
Moreover lacking one eye,

"Struck and pelted
By various children,
Receiving all manner of suffering and pain,
Sometimes even unto death.

"Having died in this [state],
They again receive python bodies,
Their forms long and large,
Five hundred yojanas,

"Deaf, stupid, and without feet,
Writhing and crawling on their bellies.
By various small insects
They are bitten and devoured,

"Day and night undergoing suffering
Without any respite.
Due to slandering this sutra,
They obtain retribution such as this.

"If they attain human form,
All their faculties are dull and dark—
Dwarfed, hunched, lame, and paralyzed,
Blind, deaf, and hunchbacked.

"Whatever they say,
People do not believe or receive.
Their breath is constantly foul;
They are possessed by ghosts and demons.

"Poor and lowly,
Employed by others,
Afflicted with many illnesses, emaciated,
Without anyone to rely upon.

"Though they attach themselves to people,
People pay them no mind.
If they obtain anything,
They soon again forget and lose it.

"If they practice the medical way,
Following prescriptions to treat illness,
They further increase others' diseases
Or also cause death.

"If they themselves have illness,
No one rescues or treats them.
Though they take good medicine,
It further increases their suffering.

"If others rebel,
Plundering and robbing through theft—
Transgressions such as these
Befall them as calamities.

"Such sinful people
Forever never see the Buddha,
The King of Multitudes of Sages,
Expounding Dharma and teaching transformation.

"Such sinful people
Are constantly born in difficult places—
Mad, deaf, with minds confused,
Forever never hearing the Dharma.

"Throughout innumerable kalpas
Numerous as Ganges' sands,
Whenever born, deaf and mute,
Their faculties incomplete,

"They constantly dwell in the hells
As if roaming in parks and gardens.
In other evil paths
As if in their own dwelling places.

"Camels, donkeys, pigs, and dogs—
These are their places of movement.
Due to slandering this sutra,
They obtain retribution such as this.

"If they attain human form,
Deaf, blind, mute, and dumb,
Poverty and all manner of decline
Serve as their adornments.

"Dropsy, emaciation,
Scabies, ulcers, and boils—
Such diseases as these
Serve as their clothing.

"Their bodies constantly stink and are foul,
Filthy and impure.
Deeply attached to the view of self,
They increase in anger and rage.

"Sexual desire burns fiercely—
They do not distinguish birds from beasts.
Due to slandering this sutra,
They obtain retribution such as this.

"I tell Śāriputra:
Those who slander this sutra—
If I were to speak of their transgressions,
I could not exhaust them throughout a kalpa.

"For this cause and condition,
I therefore tell you:
Among people without wisdom,
Do not expound this sutra.

"If there are those of keen faculties,
Whose wisdom is clear and luminous,
Much learning and strong retention,
Seeking the Buddha-Way—

"For people such as these,
One may expound it.
If people have seen
Billions of hundreds of thousands of Buddhas,

"Having planted all manner of wholesome roots,
With profound minds firm and solid—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"If people are vigorously advancing,
Constantly cultivating compassionate minds,
Not begrudging body or life—
For such one may expound it.

"If people are reverent,
Without any divergent minds,
Separated from all common fools,
Dwelling alone in mountains and marshlands—

"For people such as these,
One may expound it.
Furthermore, Śāriputra,
If you see someone

"Who has renounced evil acquaintances
And drawn near to good friends—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"If you see Buddha-sons
Upholding precepts purely,
Like pure, bright jewels,
Seeking Great Vehicle sutras—

"For people such as these,
One may expound it.
If people are without anger,
Straightforward, gentle, and pliant,

"Constantly pitying all,
Revering all Buddhas—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"Again, there are Buddha-sons
Who, within great assemblies,
With pure minds,
Through various causes and conditions,

"Parables and expressions,
Expound Dharma without obstruction—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"If there are bhikṣus
Who, for the sake of the wisdom of all modes,
Seek the Dharma in the four directions,
Joining palms and reverently receiving it,

"Who merely delight in receiving and upholding
Great Vehicle sutras,
Not even receiving
A single verse of other sutras—

"For people such as these,
One may expound it.
Like one who single-mindedly
Seeks the Buddha's śarīra,

"Seeking sutras in such manner,
Having obtained them, reverently receiving them on the crown of the head—
Such a person no longer
Aspires to seek other sutras,

"Nor has ever thought of
Non-Buddhist scriptures—
For people such as these,
One may expound it.

"I tell Śāriputra:
If I were to speak of the characteristics
Of those seeking the Buddha-Way,
I could not exhaust them throughout a kalpa.

"People such as these
Are then able to believe and comprehend.
You should expound for them
The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma."
