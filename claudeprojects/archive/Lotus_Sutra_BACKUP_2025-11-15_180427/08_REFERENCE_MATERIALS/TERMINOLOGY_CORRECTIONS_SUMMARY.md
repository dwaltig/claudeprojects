## Terminology Reference

### Correct Usage
- **"Blues Interpretation"** - The act of rendering the classical text into blues vernacular
- **"INTERPRETATION NOTES"** - The section at the end of each chapter explaining interpretation choices
- **"Interpretation choices"** - Decisions made in rendering the text
- **"Blues Interpretation from Classical Chinese by Kumārajīva"** - The byline for all chapters
- **"Kumārajīva"** - The original translator of the Classical Chinese text (406 CE)

### Incorrect Usage (Now Corrected)
- ~~"Blues Translation"~~ → "Blues Interpretation"
- ~~"TRANSLATION NOTES"~~ → "INTERPRETATION NOTES"
- ~~"Translation choices"~~ → "Interpretation choices"
- ~~"Blues Translation from Classical Chinese"~~ → "Blues Interpretation from Classical Chinese"

## Important Note

**Kumārajīva** (406 CE) was the original translator from Sanskrit into Classical Chinese. Your work is an **interpretation** of that Classical Chinese version into contemporary blues vernacular English. The byline correctly attributes the original translation to Kumārajīva while your work is the interpretation.
