EXTENDED BIOGRAPHY (500-750 words for proposal and media)

William Altig is the musician, translator, and visionary behind the *Lotus Sutra Trilogy in Blues*. He brings together a rare combination of expertise in Buddhist philosophy, scriptural translation, American vernacular music, and the performance arts to make ancient wisdom traditions resonate in the modern world.

MUSICAL & SPIRITUAL BACKGROUND

For over two decades, William Altig has immersed himself in Buddhist study and practice. His journey has been one of both deep intellectual inquiry and profound creative expression. This dual path led him to explore the powerful connections between the liberating teachings of the Dharma and the raw, soulful honesty of the blues.

Seeing a parallel between the scriptural focus on overcoming suffering and the blues tradition’s articulation of life’s struggles and triumphs, Altig embarked on a decade-long project to bridge these two worlds. This wasn’t merely a translation of words, but a translation of spirit—rendering the essence of the Mahayana teachings into a language that sings with the weight and hope of American history.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

As a composer and recording artist, Altig has built a substantial and engaged audience for his Dharma-infused music. His work, which he describes as a ‘Buddhist Blues Opera,’ comprises over 3,000 original songs that explore Buddhist themes through the lens of blues, gospel, and spiritual expression.

His primary platform has been SoundCloud, where he has cultivated a following of over 1,400 listeners, with his 300+ tracks garnering widespread attention. Across all streaming platforms, his audience exceeds 2,500 listeners. He actively engages with this community, as well as with broader Buddhist and spiritual music groups on social media, sharing his work and fostering dialogue.

The *Lotus Sutra Trilogy in Blues* is the culmination of this artistic and spiritual endeavor. It includes new blues-vernacular translations of *The Lotus Sutra*, *The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*, and a practice guide based on the *Samantabhadra (Universal Worthy) Sutra*.

WHY THIS TRANSLATION?

The inspiration for this work arose from a desire to unlock the Lotus Sutra’s radical message of universal enlightenment from the confines of academic language. While traditional translations are invaluable, Altig felt their formal tone could obscure the raw, transformative power of the text. The Sutra’s message—that all beings, regardless of their station, possess the capacity for Buddhahood—is a deeply democratic and revolutionary one.

Altig sought a language that could carry this power into the heart of contemporary American life. He found it in the blues. The blues is a language born of suffering, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of freedom. It is a spiritual language of the people. By translating the Sutra into this vernacular, Altig aims to create a living, breathing scripture that speaks directly to the soul, making its profound teachings on compassion and liberation feel both immediate and timeless.

This translation is an act of devotion—an offering designed to bring two great wisdom traditions into a powerful and illuminating dialogue.
