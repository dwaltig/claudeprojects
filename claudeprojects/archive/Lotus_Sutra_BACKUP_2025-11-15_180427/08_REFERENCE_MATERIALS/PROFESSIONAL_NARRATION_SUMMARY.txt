EVERY point where a voice should change based on:

✓ Tone and emotional content
✓ Character personality and archetype
✓ Purpose of the text (teaching, storytelling, revelation, etc.)
✓ Gender of the speaker (100% alignment)

METHODOLOGY: 6-LAYER ANALYSIS

The Voice Narration Specialist analyzed the manuscript using six
simultaneous layers:

LAYER 1: EXPLICIT SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION
Who is speaking grammatically? Buddha, disciples, narrator, etc.

LAYER 2: EMOTIONAL REGISTER ANALYSIS
How are they speaking? Warmly, sternly, wisely, eagerly, etc.

LAYER 3: SPIRITUAL AUTHENTICITY
What dharma transmission is happening? Is this cosmic truth or personal guidance?

LAYER 4: NARRATIVE PERSPECTIVE
Is this epic/cosmic scope or intimate/personal address?

LAYER 5: CHARACTER ARCHETYPE
What kind of being are they? Noble teacher, maternal figure, celestial being, etc.

LAYER 6: CULTURAL/SPIRITUAL CONTEXT
Does this honor both Buddhist tradition AND African American blues/gospel tradition?

================================================================================

KEY ANALYSIS DECISIONS

BUDDHA SPEAKS IN MULTIPLE VOICES DEPENDING ON CONTEXT:
✓ Contemplative teaching → [Iapetus] (gentle, patient)
✓ Authoritative proclamation → [Sadaltager] (powerful command)
✓ Cosmic revelation → [Charon] (eternal truth)
✓ Parable telling → [Rasalgethi] (warm storyteller)

MALE DISCIPLES USE [GACRUX] AS DEFAULT:
✓ Śāriputra - [Gacrux] (chief disciple, noble authority)
✓ Mañjuśrī - [Gacrux] or [Puck] (noble or clever paradoxical moments)
✓ Maitreya - [Gacrux] (future Buddha, noble authority)

FEMALE CHARACTERS VOICE POWER AND TRANSFORMATION:
✓ Mahāprajāpatī - [Leda] (raised Buddha, maternal authority)
✓ Dragon princess - [Schedar] (power and transformation of enlightenment)
✓ Yaśodharā - [Leda] (wisdom and strength, maternal love)

BODHISATTVAS MATCH THEIR SPIRITUAL NATURE:
✓ Avalokiteśvara - [Sulafat] (ethereal, cosmic compassion)
✓ Wise bodhisattvas - [Iapetus] (ancient wisdom)
✓ Powerful bodhisattvas - [Schedar] or [Sadaltager] (authority)
✓ Mysterious beings - [Zubenelgenubi] (enigmatic cosmic knowledge)

PARABLES GET SPECIAL TREATMENT:
✓ Setup/telling - [Rasalgethi] (warm storyteller draws listener in)
