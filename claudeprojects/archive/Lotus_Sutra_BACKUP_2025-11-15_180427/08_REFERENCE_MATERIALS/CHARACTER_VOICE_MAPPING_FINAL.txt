════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRODUCTION GUIDANCE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RECORDING APPROACH:

1. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY
   - Same voice actor maintains character throughout
   - Voice actors should review full character description before recording
   - Note the dual use of [Orus] for both Śāriputra and editorial

2. SPIRITUAL AUTHENTICITY
   - This is sacred text; approach with appropriate reverence
   - Blues/vernacular style serves accessibility, not irreverence
   - Let dharma truth guide performance, not theatrical effect

3. GENRE FUSION
   - Buddhist sutra meets American vernacular tradition
   - Think: sacred text told in the people's language
   - Parallel: how Black church makes scripture come alive

4. VOICE DIRECTION PRIORITIES
   a) Dharma role first (what spiritual function does this serve?)
   b) Character archetype second (what kind of being is this?)
   c) Narrative function third (what does this voice do in the story?)
   d) Emotional tone last (but still important)

5. PACING & RHYTHM
   - Allow space for contemplation
   - Verse sections have rhythmic flow - find it
   - Repetitions are intentional - honor them
   - Blues pacing: not rushed, not dragged, just right


════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FUTURE EXPANSION POSSIBILITIES
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If additional named characters are added to the narration:

MALE VOICES AVAILABLE:
[Gacrux]   - Heroic, noble, leadership (ideal for general male disciples)
[Fenrir]   - [characteristics to be determined]

FEMALE VOICES AVAILABLE:
[Cassiopeia]  - Regal, powerful (ideal for Mahāprajāpatī)
[Callirrhoe]  - Elegant, quiet authority (ideal for Yaśodharā)
[Kore]        - Warm, welcoming (alternative for female assembly)
[Andromeda]   - [characteristics to be determined]
[Erinome]     - [characteristics to be determined]
[Nyx]         - [characteristics to be determined]
[Schedar]     - [characteristics to be determined]
[Umbriel]     - [characteristics to be determined]
[Zephyr]      - [characteristics to be determined]


════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DEFENSIBILITY STATEMENT
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Every voice assignment in this mapping serves three criteria:

1. SPIRITUAL FIDELITY
   Voice choice honors the character's dharma role and spiritual function
   in the text

2. GENDER ALIGNMENT
   100% alignment between character gender identity and voice gender,
   respecting Buddhist tradition while acknowledging transcendent nature
   of enlightened beings

3. NARRATIVE EFFECTIVENESS
   Voice serves the story, making characters distinct and recognizable
   while serving the overall flow of the teaching

This is not arbitrary casting but thoughtful matching of voice characteristics
to spiritual archetypes, honoring both the Buddhist tradition and the
vernacular accessibility that makes this dharma teaching come alive.
