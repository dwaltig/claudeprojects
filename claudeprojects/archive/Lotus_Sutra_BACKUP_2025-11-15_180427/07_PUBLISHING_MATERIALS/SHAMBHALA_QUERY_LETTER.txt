Dear Shambhala Acquisitions Team:

I am writing to query whether you would consider for acquisition a complete trilogy of Mahayana Buddhist sutras in a contemporary English translation I have completed. Before submitting the full package, I want to clarify one important point given your submission guidelines.

THE PROJECT

I have translated three foundational texts from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese Buddhist canon into contemporary American English:

* The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra (complete)
* The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma (190,000 words, 28 chapters, complete)
* The Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra (complete)

This is rigorous translation work. The texts maintain complete fidelity to the original Classical Chinese meaning and Buddhist doctrine. However, I have chosen to render them in contemporary blues and gospel vernacular—a deliberate stylistic choice to make the profound teachings accessible to contemporary American seekers without compromising doctrinal depth.

THE CLARIFICATION

Your submission guidelines state you do not accept fiction. My work is translation (not fiction), but uses poetic vernacular language and contemporary idiom. The blues vernacular is a deliberate translation choice—similar to how other translators choose whether to render Buddhist texts in formal academic language, poetic metaphor, or accessible contemporary speech.

The question I have for your acquisitions team: Would a serious Buddhist translation rendered in contemporary blues/gospel vernacular fall within your acquisition interests, or would this stylistic approach disqualify it under your fiction exclusion policy?

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR SHAMBHALA

Shambhala has always understood something critical: Buddhist teachings must be accessible to the people who need them. Your catalog reflects this mission—600+ Buddhist titles, deliberately chosen for their ability to bridge ancient wisdom and contemporary life.

This trilogy represents exactly that bridge. It takes the most revolutionary Buddhist text (the Lotus Sutra's teaching of universal Buddha-nature) and translates it into the language of American struggle, resilience, and liberation. The blues tradition is itself a spiritual language—born of suffering, articulated through liberation, rooted in human dignity. This is not appropriation; this is translation into an authentic American spiritual vernacular.

The translation has been shared with 2,500+ active listeners who already understand its value. I have lived this practice for over a decade—reading one chapter of the Lotus Sutra daily for 28 consecutive days, then alternating with the other two sutras. This is not a theoretical project; it is translation emerging from deep spiritual practice.

MY REQUEST

If your team believes this work falls within your acquisition interests (despite the unconventional vernacular styling), I would be delighted to submit:

* Complete manuscript of all three volumes
* Sample chapters (Burning House Parable from Lotus Sutra)
* Comprehensive author biography
* Table of contents with chapter descriptions
* Discussion of translation methodology and Buddhist authenticity

If the vernacular styling falls outside your current acquisition scope, I respect that guidance and will not pursue a full submission.

I believe the answer to this question will determine whether Shambhala is the right partner for this work. I would rather have clarity than waste your time or mine.

Thank you for considering this inquiry. I look forward to hearing whether you would like to review the full manuscript.

Respectfully,

   → Move to SHAMBHALA_SUBMISSION_PACKAGE.txt
   → Submit within 1 week (show you're responsive)

2. "The vernacular styling doesn't fit our current scope, but here's a publisher
   who might be interested..."
   → They may recommend another publisher
   → Take their recommendation seriously

3. "We'd like to discuss further. Please schedule a call..."
   → This is very positive
   → You're in conversation with their team

4. No response after 4 weeks
   → Send a brief follow-up: "I wanted to follow up on my query from [date]..."
   → Wait 2 more weeks
   → If still nothing, move to next publisher

================================================================================
IF THEY SAY YES
================================================================================

You will receive something like: "Thank you for your query. We're interested in
reviewing the manuscript. Please send [list of materials]."

At that point:
1. Gather all submission materials
2. Create SHAMBHALA_SUBMISSION_PACKAGE.txt (customized for their requirements)
3. Submit within 1 week of their request
4. Note submission date
5. Wait 12-15 weeks for their response

================================================================================
IF THEY SAY NO

If they decline or don't respond after 6 weeks, move to:

Each will have different positioning needs, and we'll customize for each.
