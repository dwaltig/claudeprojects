The Buddhist Blues Spiritual Platform - Complete Vision
This document outlines the complete vision for the "Buddhist Blues Spiritual Platform," a multi-faceted project dedicated to sharing wisdom and contemplative practices through various media.
1. Published Volumes (Done, Ready)
The foundation of the platform consists of three core published volumes, translated into contemporary blues vernacular. All three volumes are professionally polished and publication-ready.
* Volume 1: The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra (shorter, foundational)
* Volume 2: The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma (190,000 words)
* Volume 3: Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra (complete)
These three texts form the complete canonical foundation of Mahayana Buddhism, now available in blues language for the first time.
2. Audio Versions (In Progress)
To make the published works more accessible, audio versions of the three volumes are currently in production. This initiative aims to reach a broader audience, including those who prefer auditory learning or are visually impaired. These versions are set to feature Maya Angelou's voice.
3. Illustrated Children's Books (Planned)
A series of illustrated children's books is planned to adapt the core themes and parables from the platform's teachings for a younger audience. The goal is to introduce concepts of wisdom and compassion in an engaging, age-appropriate format.
4. Dhammapada Translation (Planned)
A new translation of the Dhammapada is planned. This project will aim to render the classic text in a fresh, modern, and accessible (perhaps "blues")-inflected verse, aligning it with the platform's unique voice and perspective.
5. Contemplative Practice App (In Development)
A mobile application is currently in development. This app will serve as a digital hub for the platform, offering users tools for contemplative practice. Features will likely include:
* Guided meditations (possibly featuring "Buddhist Blues" music)
* Daily readings or verses
* A journal for reflection
* Community features to connect with other practitioners
6. Pitch to Publishers (Book-Focused)
"I am a Buddhist musician offering a complete trilogy of Mahayana Buddhist sacred texts translated into contemporary blues vernacular. All three volumes are professionally polished and publication-ready:
* Volume 1: The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra (shorter, foundational)
* Volume 2: The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma (190,000 words)
* Volume 3: Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra (complete)
These three texts form the complete canonical foundation of Mahayana Buddhism, now available in blues language for the first time. This represents a decade of work as both a musician and Buddhist practitioner, shared with 2,500+ active listeners across streaming platforms.
I am seeking a publisher who recognizes this as a significant cultural and spiritual contribution to contemporary Buddhism."
7. Comprehensive Platform Pitch
"I am building a comprehensive Buddhist spiritual practice platform centered on blues vernacular translations of the Mahayana canon. I am currently offering three volumes—The Lotus Sutra, The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, and Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra—all professionally translated and ready for publication.
This represents the foundation of a larger vision: audio recordings featuring Maya Angelou's voice, illustrated children's books adapting these teachings, daily contemplative practice apps, and future translations including the Dhammapada from original Pali.
I have built an audience of 2,500+ listeners across streaming platforms, primarily through sharing this work as music and teaching. I am seeking publishing partners who understand the long-term vision and can support the initial volumes while building toward a comprehensive spiritual platform."
8. Pitch Angle: Lead with Volume 2, Show the Vision
"This is the first volume in a comprehensive spiritual platform I am building. Two additional volumes are ready for publication, with audio versions featuring Maya Angelou's voice currently in production, and future projects including illustrated children's books and a contemplative practice app."
