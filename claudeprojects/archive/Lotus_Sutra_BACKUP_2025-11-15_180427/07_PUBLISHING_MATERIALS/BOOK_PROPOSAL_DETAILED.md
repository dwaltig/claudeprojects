## 2. WHAT THIS BOOK IS

### The Source Text
The Lotus Sutra (Saddharma-puṇḍarīka-sūtra) is one of Mahayana Buddhism's most influential and revolutionary texts. Written in Sanskrit and transmitted through various Asian cultures, it argues that enlightenment is not limited to monks or the intellectually advanced, but is available to all beings—women, animals, demons, children, all equally capable of Buddhahood.

The translation source is Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese version (406 CE), which became the standard text throughout East Asia. Kumārajīva was known for making difficult Buddhist concepts accessible without sacrificing accuracy—the same goal of this translation.

### The Translation Approach
Rather than another scholarly translation for academics, this is a **living, breathing translation** that brings the Dharma into the spiritual language of African American blues and gospel tradition.

**Key translation decisions:**
1. **Blues Vernacular** - Uses African American spiritual language, blues poetry, call-and-response patterns, gospel rhythm
2. **Accessibility** - Makes Buddhist concepts clear without jargon, while maintaining doctrinal accuracy
3. **Gender-Inclusive** - Strategic language choices that center women's power and affirm universal Buddha-nature
4. **Performance-Ready** - Designed for oral delivery, honoring the sutra's history as orally transmitted teaching
5. **Comprehensively Supported** - Includes glossary, discussion questions, performance guide, character guide

### Why This Translation Now?

**Growing Audiences:**
- Readers seeking Buddhism beyond academic/formal/white-centered contexts
- Those exploring accessible spirituality that maintains doctrinal depth
- Practitioners interested in gender-inclusive Dharma teaching
- Those seeking African American spiritual traditions as wisdom sources
- Performers and oral tradition communities

**Cultural Moment:**
- Post-pandemic spiritual seeking emphasizing accessibility
- Growing demand for intersectional and gender-inclusive spirituality
- Recognition of African American spiritual traditions as major wisdom sources
- Interest in translation as creative/cultural work, not just scholarly transfer

**Unique Position:**
- **Only** blues/vernacular translation of the Lotus Sutra
- **Only** translation centering African American spiritual tradition
- **Only** edition with comprehensive gender-inclusive apparatus
- **Only** version with integrated performance and study guides
