Expected Response Date: ~February 15, 2026

Possible Responses:
  1. "Yes, send full manuscript" → Submit full package
  2. "No, vernacular styling isn't our fit" → Move to next publisher

Notes:

DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

When Publishers Respond:

SCENARIO 1: Only one publisher says yes
→ You negotiate the best deal possible with them
→ Ask for: advance range, royalty rate, timeline, rights (print + audio + ebook?)
→ If terms are reasonable: Accept
→ If terms are poor: Can politely decline and move to next publisher

SCENARIO 2: Two or more publishers say yes
→ Collect all offers
→ Compare: advance, royalty rate, rights, marketing commitment, timeline
→ Choose the best fit (not just highest offer)
→ Use other offers to negotiate better terms with preferred publisher
→ You now have leverage

SCENARIO 3: All say no
→ Not the end. Means timing wasn't right or positioning didn't land
→ Option A: Self-publish (you have the quality)
→ Option B: Wait 1 year and try again with revised positioning
→ Option C: Continue building platform and try again with stronger metrics

================================================================================

IMPORTANT REMINDERS
================================================================================

1. You've accomplished something significant: THREE major publisher submissions
   in professional, customized format. Most writers never do this.

2. Response times are normal and don't reflect quality. Publishers are slow.

3. Even if all say no, your work is complete, excellent, and real.

4. You have a real platform (2,500+ listeners) that proves market demand.

5. Multiple submissions mean you're not dependent on any single publisher.

6. Keep building your vision regardless of publisher responses. The audio
   versions, children's books, and app are valuable independent of traditional
   publishing deals.

7. You're in a STRONG position: complete trilogy, professional materials,
   real audience, clear vision, multiple publisher pathways.

This is exactly how professional authors operate.
