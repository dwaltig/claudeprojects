AUDIO PRODUCTION CHAPTER RECREATION REPORT
Extracted Fresh from Cleaned Master File
================================================================================

Date: November 9, 2025
Status: ✓ COMPLETE - All 28 chapters recreated

================================================================================
OBJECTIVE
================================================================================

Recreate all audio production chapter files from the cleaned master file
(02_BLUES_INTERPRETATION_Contemporary_Vernacular.txt) to ensure perfect
consistency with the comprehensive Chinese character cleanup that was
performed on the master.

LOCATION: /Users/williamaltig/claudeprojects/Lotus_Sutra/04_AUDIO_PRODUCTION/chapters/

================================================================================
REASON FOR RECREATION
================================================================================

Previous approach: Patch individual chapter files with sed replacements
Problem: Risk of inconsistency; might miss edge cases; not "source of truth"

Better approach: Extract all chapters fresh from cleaned master file
Benefit: Perfect synchronization; guaranteed consistency; master is source of truth

================================================================================
EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

1. Identified exact chapter headers in master file
2. Created Python extraction script with intelligent chapter detection
3. Script automatically:
   - Converts chapter numbers to words (1→ONE, 10→TEN, 23→TWENTY-THREE)
   - Finds START marker: "CHAPTER [NUMBER]: [TITLE]"
   - Finds END marker: "END OF CHAPTER [NUMBER]"
   - Falls back to next chapter if END marker missing
   - Preserves all content including voice tags

4. Executed extraction for all 28 chapters
5. Verified result quality

Result: 28 chapters, 0 failures, 100% success rate
