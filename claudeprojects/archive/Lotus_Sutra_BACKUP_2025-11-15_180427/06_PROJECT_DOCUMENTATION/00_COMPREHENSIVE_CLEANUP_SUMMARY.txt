CLEANUP PHASE: THE FOUR ISSUES

ISSUE #1: Chapter 10 - "All-种-wisdom"
  Location: Line 6331 in master file
  Before: "All-种-wisdom, that's the highest plane,"
  After:  "All-wisdom, that's the highest plane,"
  Cause: Incomplete translation (种=type/kind left in English text)
  Verification: Aligned with Scholarly English ("wisdom of all modes")
  Impact: Clearer verse flow; removed confusing mixed language

ISSUE #2: Chapter 15 - "志樂 loving quiet places"
  Location: Line 8600 in master file
  Before: "志樂 loving quiet places,"
  After:  "loving quiet places,"
  Cause: Redundant Chinese character (duplicate of English)
  Impact: Removed visual clutter; pure English vernacular

ISSUE #3: Early Verse Section - Garbled line "威威德德力力具具足足，，"
  Location: Line 5878 in master file
  Before: Corrupted line with duplicated/encoded characters
  After:  Line removed entirely
  Cause: Encoding corruption in verse section
  Impact: Removed broken text; adjacent lines maintain meaning

ISSUE #4: Chapter 25 - "險 险险險country"
  Location: Line 13015 in master file
  Before: "Carrying precious goods through險 险险險country,"
  After:  "Carrying precious goods through dangerous country,"
  Cause: Corrupted character variants (traditional/simplified mix)
  Impact: Clear English replacement
