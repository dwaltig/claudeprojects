- Deep understanding of both rigorous scholarship AND lived spiritual practice
- Expertise in Buddhist translation theory, vernacular scripture, and cultural spirituality

## What She Understands About Your Work

Dr. Chen-Rothenberg gets it:
- ✓ Your blues translation IS legitimate translation, not just interpretation
- ✓ Your 28-day practice cycle IS rigorous validation methodology
- ✓ Cultural specificity serves Buddhist universalism
- ✓ Your work addresses real gaps in Buddhist accessibility
- ✓ Vernacular translation has deep historical precedent (Luther, Tyndale, Zen masters)

## What She Will Do For You

1. **Listen deeply** - Understand your translation choices and practice experience
2. **Frame scholarly context** - Position your work in existing academic discourse
3. **Build airtight arguments** - Create logical structures that pass peer review
4. **Anticipate critique** - Address objections before reviewers raise them
5. **Preserve your voice** - Build scholarly apparatus around YOUR authentic experience
6. **Iterate patiently** - Work section by section until it's publication-ready

## The Collaborative Process

Dr. Chen-Rothenberg works WITH you, not FOR you:
- She'll ask for specific materials (translation examples, practice notes, testimonials)
- She'll create outlines for your review and feedback
- She'll draft sections one at a time
- She'll explain her scholarly reasoning
- She'll incorporate your feedback and revisions
- She'll never put words in your mouth
- Everything must ring true to your actual experience

## Strategic Timeline (Recommended)

```
Month 1-2:  Gather materials for Article 4
Month 2-4:  Draft Article 4 with Dr. Chen-Rothenberg (5,000-7,000 words)
Month 3-4:  Gather materials for Article 1 (while Article 4 in review)
Month 4-7:  Draft Article 1 (8,000-12,000 words)
Month 5-6:  Gather materials for Article 2
Month 6-9:  Draft Article 2 (8,000-10,000 words)
Post-launch: Gather user data for Article 3
+3 months:  Draft Article 3 with user evidence
```

This creates momentum: always have one article in draft, one gathering materials, one in review.

## Why This Matters

From your market analysis, these scholarly articles will:

1. **CREDIBILITY** - Position you as serious scholar, not just artist/interpreter
2. **DEFENSE** - Provide intellectual framework defending your translation choices
3. **PLATFORM** - Generate speaking invitations, media appearances, visibility
4. **POSITIONING** - Establish you BEFORE app launch
5. **LONGEVITY** - Articles outlive apps; your contribution remains part of discourse
6. **FUNDING** - Make you eligible for grants, foundation funding, academic partnerships

## Your Next Steps

1. **Review the materials checklist** - See what you already have vs. what you need to gather
2. **Choose your starting article** - Article 4 is recommended (shortest, broadest appeal)
3. **Launch the agent** - Use one of the commands above
