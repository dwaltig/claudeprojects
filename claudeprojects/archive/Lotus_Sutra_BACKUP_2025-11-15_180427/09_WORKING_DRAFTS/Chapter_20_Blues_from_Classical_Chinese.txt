CHAPTER 20: THE BODHISATTVA WHO NEVER LOOKED DOWN
(常不輕菩薩品第二十)

A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese
The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra


PART ONE: THE BUDDHA'S WORD TO GREAT POWER

Now the Buddha, he turned to that Bodhisattva Great Power - you know that Great Power, that Mahāsattva - and the Buddha said:

"Listen here now, you got to know this thing: When a monk or a nun, when a brother or a sister who holds fast to this Lotus teaching, when somebody come at them with a evil mouth, cursing them out, talking bad about them, slandering their name - oh, that somebody gonna reap a terrible harvest, like I done told you before. But the one who holds this teaching? They gonna gain merit, like I said - they gonna get them eyes cleaned up, ears purified, nose, tongue, body, mind all made clear and clean.

"Now Great Power, I'm gonna tell you about the ancient days. I'm talking way back, past counting, past measuring, past thinking about - we talking inconceivable, immeasurable ages ago, ages beyond ages. Back then there was a Buddha, and his name was King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory, the Tathagata, the Worthy One, the One of Perfect Knowledge, Perfect in Understanding and Walking, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed Teacher, Tamer of Strong Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.

"That age was called the Age-Without-Decline. That country was called the Land of Great Achievement.

"That Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory, he taught the Dharma in that world to the gods and humans and the fighting demons. For them that was seeking to be disciples, he taught the Four Noble Truths - you know, about birth and old age and sickness and death, and how to cross over to final nirvana. For them seeking to be solitary realizers, he taught the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising. For them Bodhisattvas seeking that supreme perfect enlightenment - that anuttara-samyak-sambodhi - he taught the Six Ways of Going to the Other Shore, the Six Perfections, so they could reach the Buddha's wisdom complete.

"Now Great Power, that Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory, he lived for four hundred thousand million billion nayutas of Ganges River sands of ages. And the True Dharma stood in that world for ages like the dust particles in one Jambudvipa world. And the Imitation Dharma stood for ages like the dust particles in all four continents put together.

"After that Buddha had done good for all living beings, he passed into extinction. And after both the True Dharma and the Imitation Dharma had done passed away, in that same country another Buddha appeared, and his name was King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory too - the Tathagata, Worthy One, One of Perfect Knowledge, Perfect in Understanding and Walking, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed Teacher, Tamer of Strong Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.

"And like this, one after another, there came twenty thousand million Buddhas, all with that same name."


PART TWO: THE STORY OF NEVER LOOKED DOWN

"Now after that first Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory had passed into extinction, after the True Dharma had done gone, in the time of the Imitation Dharma, there was monks full up with arrogance and pride, and they had great power in that world.

"And in that time there was one Bodhisattva monk, and his name was Never Looked Down.

"Now Great Power, you might be wondering: Why they call him Never Looked Down? Well, I'm gonna tell you. This monk, every single person he seen - whether it was a monk or a nun, whether it was a brother or a sister - he would bow down low to every one of them, bow down deep and praise them, and he would say these words:

"'I respect you deeply. I wouldn't dare look down on you. Why? Because all of you are walking the Bodhisattva way. Every one of you is gonna become a Buddha.'

"Now this monk, he didn't spend his time studying scriptures and chanting texts. All he did was bow down and praise folks. Even when he seen the four kinds of people way off in the distance, he would go out of his way to get to them, bow down deep, praise them, and say:

"'I wouldn't dare look down on you. All of you are gonna become Buddhas.'

"But among them four kinds of people, there was some who had angry hearts, hearts that wasn't clean. They would curse him out with evil mouths, saying: 'This ignorant monk! Where he come from? Going around saying he don't look down on us, giving us prophecies that we gonna become Buddhas! We don't need no false prophecies like that! We don't want nothing to do with your empty predictions!'

"This went on for many years. He was constantly being cursed at and abused. But he never got angry. He just kept saying: 'You gonna become a Buddha.'

"And when he would say these words, sometimes folks would take up sticks and clubs, tiles and stones, and throw them at him, beat on him. He would run away and stand at a distance. But even then, he would lift up his voice high and call out loud:

"'I wouldn't dare look down on you! All of you are gonna become Buddhas!'

"Because he kept on saying these words all the time, them arrogant monks and nuns and brothers and sisters, they gave him the name Never Looked Down."


PART THREE: DEATH AND RESURRECTION THROUGH THE WORD

"Now when this monk was about to die, right there in the sky, in the empty air, he heard all twenty thousand myriads of millions of verses of the Lotus Sutra that Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory had taught before. He was able to receive and hold every verse. Right then and there, he got them purified eye-roots like I described before - his ears purified, nose, tongue, body, and mind-roots all purified.

"After he got them six roots cleaned up like that, his life was extended - extended by two hundred million billion nayutas of years. And he went everywhere teaching this Lotus Sutra to the people.

"Now them four kinds of arrogant folks - them monks and nuns and brothers and sisters who had looked down on him, who had given him that name Never Looked Down - when they seen that he had obtained great supernatural powers, great eloquence in teaching, great power of good stillness, when they heard what he was saying, every one of them came to believe, came to submit, came to follow him.

"And this Bodhisattva went on to convert thousands of myriads of millions of living beings, causing them to dwell in that supreme perfect enlightenment, that anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.

"After his life ended, he met two thousand million Buddhas, all named Sun-Moon-Lamp-Light. In their Dharma, he taught this Lotus Sutra. Because of this cause and condition, he met another two thousand million Buddhas, all named Cloud-Sovereign-Lamp-King. In all these Buddhas' Dharma, he received, held, recited, and taught this sutra to the four kinds of people. And because of this, he got them constantly purified eyes, purified ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind-roots. When he taught the Dharma among them four kinds of people, his heart had no fear at all."


PART FOUR: THE REVELATION - THAT WAS ME

"Great Power, this Bodhisattva Never Looked Down, he made offerings to so many Buddhas like this - respecting them, honoring them, praising them, planting all kinds of good roots. And after that, he met thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas. And in all them Buddhas' Dharma, he taught this sutra. His merit was accomplished, and he became a Buddha.

"Now Great Power, what do you think? That Bodhisattva Never Looked Down back in them days - you think he was somebody else? That was me. That was my own self.

"If I hadn't received, held, recited, and taught this sutra to others in them past lives, I wouldn't have been able to quickly attain this supreme perfect enlightenment, this anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Because I received, held, recited, and taught this sutra to people in the presence of them former Buddhas, I was able to quickly attain this supreme perfect enlightenment.

"Now Great Power, them four kinds of people back then - them monks and nuns and brothers and sisters who despised me with angry hearts, who looked down on me - because of that, for two hundred million ages they never met a Buddha, never heard the Dharma, never seen the Sangha. For a thousand ages they suffered great torment in the Avīci Hell, the Hell of No Interruption.

"But when that punishment was done, they met up with that Bodhisattva Never Looked Down again, and he taught them toward that supreme perfect enlightenment.

"Now Great Power, what do you think? Them four kinds of people who constantly looked down on that Bodhisattva back then - you think they was somebody else? Right here in this assembly now, there's five hundred Bodhisattvas like Bhadrapāla and others, five hundred monks like Lion-Moon and others, five hundred lay brothers like Thought-of-Buddha and others - all of them who will never turn back from supreme perfect enlightenment - that's who they are.

"Great Power, you got to know: This Lotus Sutra brings great benefit to all them Bodhisattvas and Mahāsattvas. It can cause them to reach that supreme perfect enlightenment. That's why, after the Tathagata has passed into extinction, all them Bodhisattvas and Mahāsattvas should constantly receive, hold, recite, explain, and copy out this sutra."


PART FIVE: THE BUDDHA SINGS IT IN VERSE

Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say this teaching one more time, spoke in verse:


In the ancient days there was a Buddha,
Name of King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory,
His spirit-wisdom was beyond all measure,
He guided everything that lives -
Gods and humans, dragons and spirits,
All of them made offerings to him.

After that Buddha passed into extinction,
When the Dharma was about to end,
There was one Bodhisattva
Whose name was Never Looked Down.

Now at that time them four kinds of people,
They was holding on tight to doctrines,
Clinging to their understanding of the law.

Never Looked Down Bodhisattva,
He went right up to where they was,
And he spoke these words to them:
"I wouldn't dare look down on you -
All of you are walking the way,
Every one of you gonna become a Buddha."

When the people heard this,
They looked down on him, they cursed him out,
They talked bad about him, reviled his name.

But Never Looked Down Bodhisattva,
He was able to bear it, able to endure.

When his punishment was finished,
When his life was about to end,
He heard this sutra,
And his six roots was purified.

Because of his supernatural powers,
His life was extended and increased.
He taught this sutra again
To all them people far and wide.

All them people who was clinging to doctrines,
Every one of them received teaching
From this Bodhisattva,
Was brought to accomplishment,
Was caused to dwell in the Buddha-way.

When Never Looked Down's life ended,
He met countless Buddhas.
Because he taught this sutra,
He gained immeasurable blessings,
Gradually perfected his merit,
And quickly accomplished the Buddha-way.

That Never Looked Down back then -
That was my own self.

Them four kinds of people at that time,
The ones who was clinging to doctrines,
Who heard Never Looked Down say
"You gonna become a Buddha" -
Because of that cause and condition,
They met countless Buddhas.

These Bodhisattvas in this assembly,
Five hundred of them,
And also them four kinds -
Monks and nuns, believing laymen and laywomen,
The ones now standing before me
Listening to the Dharma - that's who they are.

In my former lives,
I urged all these people
To listen and receive this sutra,
This foremost teaching among teachings.

I opened it up and showed them,
I taught them the way,
I caused them to dwell in nirvana.

Life after life they received and held
A sutra like this one.

For billions and billions of myriads of ages,
So many you can't even think about it,
Only then do you get to hear
This Lotus Sutra.

For billions and billions of myriads of ages,
So many you can't even think about it,
The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones,
Only once in a while teach this sutra.

Therefore, you practitioners,
After the Buddha has passed into extinction,
When you hear a sutra like this,
Don't let doubt arise in your hearts.

You should with single mind
Teach this sutra far and wide.

Life after life you'll meet Buddhas,
And quickly accomplish the Buddha-way.

TRANSLATOR'S NOTES: ON THE BLUES READING OF NEVER LOOKED DOWN

I. THE BLUES STRUCTURE OF DIGNITY UNDER PERSECUTION

This chapter is pure blues architecture. The Never Looked Down Bodhisattva is the archetypal blues hero - maintaining dignity, faith, and prophetic voice in the face of relentless persecution. The repetitive structure mirrors both the repetition in blues music and the call-and-response tradition:

**The Call**: "I wouldn't dare look down on you. You gonna become a Buddha."
**The Response**: Curses, stones, sticks, mockery.
**The Refrain**: He keeps on saying it anyway. Even from a distance, voice lifted high.

This is the structure of spirituals sung in slavery, of freedom songs sung into police dogs and fire hoses, of gospel truth proclaimed in a world that beats you down. The blues knows how to keep singing when the world wants you silent.

II. LINGUISTIC CHOICES: VERNACULAR AS THEOLOGICAL STATEMENT

**"Never Looked Down" vs. "Never Disparaging"**

I translated 常不輕 (Chang Bu Qing) as "Never Looked Down" rather than the conventional "Never Disparaging" or "Never Despising." This choice does several things:

1. It uses vernacular English that carries the full weight of social hierarchy and oppression - "looking down on somebody" is how systemic degradation is described in African American English
2. It captures the active, ongoing nature of the Chinese 不輕 (bu qing) - "not looking down" is something you DO, a constant practice of seeing people's Buddha-nature
3. It resonates with the blues/gospel tradition of "lifting up" the downtrodden - the opposite of "looking down" is "lifting up," and this Bodhisattva is in the business of lifting up everyone he meets

**"You gonna become a Buddha" - The Prophetic Future Tense**

The repeated proclamation 汝等皆當作佛 (ru deng jie dang zuo fo - "you all will definitely become Buddhas") becomes "You gonna become a Buddha" in blues register. This isn't poor grammar - it's prophetic speech.

The African American prophetic tradition uses "gonna" to declare certain futures against present evidence. "We gonna overcome" sung in jail cells. "You gonna reap what you sow" preached from pulpits. The use of "gonna" here does theological work - it's not speculation, it's declaration. It's faith speaking future transformation into hostile present conditions.

**"Bow down low" - Physical and Spiritual Prostration**

I added "low" to "bow down" (禮拜 - li bai - "prostrate in worship") because in blues/gospel tradition, the depth of the bow matters. "Bow down low" appears in spirituals and gospel songs as the ultimate act of reverence and submission - not to human power, but to divine nature. When Never Looked Down "bows down low" to arrogant monks who will beat him, he's enacting a radical theology: seeing the Buddha-nature beneath the hostile surface and worshiping it even when it's hidden.

This parallels the practice of "making a way out of no way" in Black religious thought - acting on faith in what cannot yet be seen.

**"Lift up his voice high" - Prophetic Proclamation**

When the text says 猶高聲唱言 (you gao sheng chang yan - "still with high voice proclaimed"), I rendered it as "lift up his voice high and call out loud." This is the language of Black preaching, of gospel singing, of prophetic witness. "Lifting up" your voice isn't just volume - it's spiritual elevation, it's making your proclamation heard by heaven even when earth won't listen.

III. THEOLOGICAL RESONANCES WITH AFRICAN AMERICAN RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS

**The Suffering Servant Who Prophesies to His Persecutors**

Never Looked Down is a suffering servant figure who speaks truth to hostile power. This resonates deeply with African American readings of Isaiah 53, with the figure of Jesus before his accusers, with countless stories of enslaved people maintaining their humanity and prophesying freedom to their enslavers.

The key theological move is: **he sees their Buddha-nature when they cannot see it themselves**. This is what sustained enslaved people - the conviction that their oppressors were spiritually blind, that they themselves could see a truth their masters could not see.

When Never Looked Down says "You gonna become a Buddha" to people beating him with sticks, he's doing what the spirituals did - declaring a future transformation that the present violently denies.

**"Even from a distance" - The Long View of Redemption**

When Never Looked Down runs away from the stones but still calls out from a distance (避走遠住，猶高聲唱言 - "fled to a distance, still with high voice proclaimed"), this captures something essential about the blues perspective on suffering: you can remove yourself from immediate danger while still maintaining your prophetic witness.

This isn't cowardice - it's wisdom. The blues tradition knows when to "fly away" and when to stand and fight. But even in flight, the song continues. Even from a safe distance, the proclamation still rings out.

This is survival strategy and spiritual practice combined. It's what let freedom songs be sung even when singers had to hide. It's the long view that says: I may have to run today, but my words will still reach you, and my prophecy will still come true.

**The Resurrection Through the Word**

The moment when Never Looked Down is dying and suddenly hears all the verses of the Lotus Sutra in the sky (於虛空中，具聞威音王佛、先所說法華經二十千萬億偈，悉能受持) - this is pure gospel. This is the word coming alive at the moment of death. This is resurrection power.

In African American Christian tradition, "the word" has power - spoken, heard, received, it transforms. When Never Looked Down hears the sutra at his death moment and his six roots are purified, his life extended, his power multiplied - this is being "born again," this is resurrection morning, this is the spirit falling on you and making you new.

The parallel to blues/gospel is exact: the song itself has power to transform, to heal, to extend life. When you receive the song deep in your spirit, you become something new.

**The Transformation of Enemies into Disciples**

The revelation that his persecutors suffered in hell but then met him again, and he taught them, and now they're Bodhisattvas in the present assembly (今此會中、跋陀婆羅等五百菩薩) - this is the ultimate blues vision of justice.

It's not revenge. It's not their destruction. It's their transformation. They had to go through hell (literally - Avīci Hell for a thousand ages), but when they came out, he was there waiting to teach them.

This is the deep blues ethic: you don't wish destruction on your oppressor. You prophesy their transformation. You declare that even they, especially they, gonna become Buddha. And when they finally hear it, after all the suffering, after all the resistance, they become your disciples.

This is James Baldwin's "The Fire Next Time": "If we do not now dare everything, the fulfillment of that prophecy, re-created from the Bible in song by a slave, is upon us: God gave Noah the rainbow sign, No more water, the fire next time!"

The prophecy is both warning and promise. You gonna become Buddha - but if you reject it now, you got to go through fire first. Either way, the prophecy stands.

IV. THE STRUCTURE OF CALL AND RESPONSE

I structured the translation to emphasize the call-and-response pattern that's implicit in the Chinese text:

**His call**: "I wouldn't dare look down on you. You gonna become a Buddha."
**Their response**: Curses, stones, sticks.
**His refrain**: "You gonna become a Buddha." (unchanged, undeterred)

This pattern repeats "for many years" (經歷多年) - the Chinese captures duration, persistence. The blues captures the same through repetition, through the refrain that comes back no matter what.

In the verse section, I let this pattern become even more explicit:

Never Looked Down Bodhisattva,
He went right up to where they was,
And he spoke these words to them...

When the people heard this,
They looked down on him, they cursed him out...

But Never Looked Down Bodhisattva,
He was able to bear it, able to endure.

This is how gospel testimonies are structured. This is how freedom songs work. The pattern itself carries meaning - the repetition says "we won't stop," the refrain says "this truth stands."

V. GRAMMAR AS THEOLOGY: "WAS" VS. "WERE"

I deliberately used vernacular African American English grammar throughout, including constructions like:
- "Where he come from?" (instead of "did he come")
- "them four kinds of people" (instead of "those four kinds")
- "He was able to bear it" (maintaining standard past tense where it serves rhythm)
- "they was clinging" (using "was" with plural subjects where vernacular demands it)

This is not incorrect English. This is a fully systematic dialect with its own grammatical rules, used by millions of native speakers, carrying rich theological and cultural freight.

Using this grammar is making a claim: this wisdom tradition (Buddhism) can speak in this wisdom tradition (African American vernacular). The Dharma can be preached in the language that preached freedom. The Lotus Sutra can be sung in the voice that sang spirituals.

To "correct" this grammar would be to reject the theological work it's doing. It would be to say that certain wisdom must stay in certain linguistic registers. But this translation insists: the Buddha-Dharma speaks in every tongue, including this one.

VI. THE POWER OF "EVEN THEN, EVEN THERE"

Throughout the translation, I emphasized the words "even" and "still":

- "Even when he seen the four kinds of people way off in the distance..."
- "Even then, he would lift up his voice high..."
- "Even from a distance..."
- "He just kept saying..." (kept = ongoing, persistent, against resistance)

This is blues structure. The blues is built on "even though" and "but still" and "anyway."

Even though you done me wrong, still I love you.
Even though the world is hard, still I'm gonna make it through.
Even though you beat me down, still I'm gonna lift up my voice.

The Chinese text has this through the repetition of 常 (chang - constantly, always), 猶 (you - still, nevertheless), and 不 (bu - not, negation maintained). I rendered this persistence through the blues architecture of "even/still/anyway."

VII. "THAT WAS ME" - THE REVELATION MOMENT

When the Buddha reveals his identity (則我身是 - "that was my very self"), I translated it simply: "That was me. That was my own self."

This is testimony language. This is how you tell your story in Black churches. "I was lost, but now I'm found" - the personal testimony is direct, unadorned, powerful. "That was me" hits harder than "I was that very person" or other formal constructions.

The Buddha is testifying. He's saying: I'm telling you this story because I walked this walk. I know what it costs to prophesy to hostile folks. I know what it means to get stones thrown at you for speaking truth. I know because that was me.

This is how wisdom is transmitted in the blues/gospel tradition - through testimony, through "let me tell you what I been through," through personal witness that becomes universal truth.

VIII. THE RADICAL RESPECT THAT SEES BUDDHA-NATURE IN ENEMIES

The core teaching of this chapter - that you bow down to people who are actively beating you, that you proclaim their Buddha-nature when they're denying your humanity - this is perhaps the most blues thing in the entire Lotus Sutra.

The blues tradition knows what it means to maintain your dignity when society denies your humanity. It knows what it means to see the image of God in people who treat you as less than human. It knows what it means to prophesy freedom to people who profit from your bondage.

"I wouldn't dare look down on you" - this phrase, repeated to hostile monks with sticks and stones, is the ultimate blues stance. It's the refusal to let their violence define your vision. It's the insistence on seeing what they cannot yet see in themselves.

This is what Fannie Lou Hamer meant when she said, "Nobody's free until everybody's free." It's what Martin Luther King Jr. meant when he said the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice. It's what the spirituals meant when they sang, "Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty we're free at last" - the "we" includes even the oppressor, who is also finally freed from the karma of oppression.

Never Looked Down prophesies the liberation of his oppressors. That's the ultimate blues wisdom - the recognition that the one with the stick is also trapped, is also suffering, will also need to be liberated. And when you can see that clearly enough to bow down to their Buddha-nature even while they're beating you - that's when you're free. That's when your eyes are purified. That's when you gain the power to extend life, to teach multitudes, to transform enemies into disciples.

IX. "GONNA" AS ONTOLOGICAL COMMITMENT

The word "gonna" appears throughout this translation, and it deserves special attention as a theological term.

"You gonna become a Buddha" - this is not:
- "You might become a Buddha" (speculation)
- "You could become a Buddha" (possibility)
- "You should become a Buddha" (moral imperative)
- "You will become a Buddha" (formal prediction)

"Gonna" is certainty expressed in vernacular. It's the future tense that stakes everything on its truth. When Never Looked Down says "You gonna become a Buddha," he's not making a conditional prediction. He's declaring an ontological truth that exists independent of current appearances.

This is how "gonna" functions in the African American prophetic tradition:
- "We gonna overcome" - sung in the face of dogs and fire hoses
- "Truth gonna rise" - preached in the face of lies
- "You gonna reap what you sow" - declared in the face of injustice that seems to prosper

"Gonna" is prophetic faith made linguistic. It's the future that's so certain it's already being spoken into the present. It's the refusal to let current conditions determine future possibilities.

When Never Looked Down keeps saying "You gonna become a Buddha" while stones are flying at his head, he's doing what the blues and gospel traditions have always done - declaring a truth that transcends and transforms present suffering.

X. CONCLUSION: THE BLUES LOTUS

This translation attempts to let the Lotus Sutra speak in the voice of a tradition that knows deeply about suffering, persistence, prophecy, and transformation. The blues and gospel traditions have their own vocabulary for enlightenment, their own understanding of how the word has power, their own practices of maintaining dignity under oppression.

Never Looked Down is a blues hero. His story is a blues story. And when translated into blues register, new dimensions of the Dharma become audible - dimensions about power and prophecy, about dignity and endurance, about seeing the Buddha-nature in your enemy and declaring it out loud until it becomes true.

The blues tradition says: you can take everything from me, but you can't take my song. Never Looked Down says: you can throw stones at me, but you can't stop me from bowing down to your Buddha-nature.

That's the same teaching, sung in different keys.

This translation is offered in the faith that the Dharma is big enough to hold every voice, that the Lotus opens in every language, that wisdom speaks in every tongue - including this one, the tongue that sang freedom in chains, that prophesied justice in Jim Crow, that proclaimed "We shall overcome" when overcoming seemed impossible.

May all beings hear the teaching in the voice that reaches their hearts.
May all beings see the Buddha-nature in themselves and others.
May all beings become Buddhas, just like Never Looked Down said.

You gonna become a Buddha. Every one of you.
I wouldn't dare look down.

Chapter 20: 常不輕菩薩品 (Chang Bu Qing Pusa Pin)
The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra (妙法蓮華經 Miaofa Lianhua Jing)

Translator's dedication: For all those who kept prophesying freedom when freedom seemed impossible. For all those who bowed down to the Buddha-nature in people who couldn't see it yet. For all those who lifted up their voices from a distance and declared the truth anyway. You was Never Looked Down. That was you.
