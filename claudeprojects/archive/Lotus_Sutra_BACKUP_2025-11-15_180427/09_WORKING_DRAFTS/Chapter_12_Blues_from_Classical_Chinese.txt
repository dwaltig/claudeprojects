Chapter Twelve: When Your Enemy Was Your Teacher
(Devadatta)

[THE BUDDHA TELLS HIS STORY: WHEN HE WAS A KING WHO BECAME A SERVANT]

Right then the Buddha speaks to all the bodhisattvas and the four assemblies—all the heavenly and human beings gathered there. He says:

"Listen now. Way back in the past, further back than you can count, beyond measureless kalpas, I was searching for this Lotus Sutra teaching. Searching and searching, and I never got tired, never gave up, never said 'I can't do this no more.'

"For many kalpas—age after age—I was born as a king. A king! Had everything a man could want. But I made a vow, made a promise in my heart: I'm gonna seek the supreme enlightenment, that highest awakening. And my heart never turned back, never said 'Maybe tomorrow,' never said 'This is good enough.'

"I wanted to fulfill the six perfections—generosity, discipline, patience, effort, meditation, wisdom—all six of them complete. So I practiced giving, practiced it hard. Gave away everything. Didn't hold back nothing. Elephants—gave them away. Horses—gave them away. The seven precious treasures—gave them away. My kingdom—gave it away. My cities—gave them away. My wife, my children—gave them away. My servants, my attendants—gave them away. Even gave away my head, my eyes, my marrow and my brain, my flesh, my hands, my feet. Didn't care about my body, didn't care about my life. Just gave.

"At that time, people lived long lives, lived for measureless years. But for the sake of the Dharma—for the sake of the truth—I gave up my throne, turned over the government to my son, and I beat a drum and sent out a proclamation to the four directions, calling out: 'Who can teach me the great vehicle? Who's got the real teaching? Whoever can speak the great vehicle for me—the Mahayana—I'll serve you my whole life. I'll be your servant. I'll work for you. I'll run when you say run.'

"And then this ascetic came. This hermit. He came to the palace and said to the king: 'I've got the great vehicle. I've got a teaching called the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra. But you got to listen to me. If you don't go against me, if you do what I say, I'll teach it to you.'

"When the king heard what the ascetic said, he was so happy he jumped for joy! Jumped up! Said 'Yes!' Right away he followed that ascetic, attended to him, gave him everything he needed. I went and gathered fruit for him. I drew water from the well for him. I chopped firewood for him. I prepared his food for him. I even used my own body as his bed, as his seat, so he could sit and rest. Laid down flat so he could sit on my back.

"And my body never got tired. My mind never got tired. I served him like that for a thousand years. One thousand years! All for the sake of the Dharma. Working hard, serving, making sure he never lacked for nothing."

[THE BUDDHA SINGS IT IN VERSE]

Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say this again, speaks in verse:

I remember the old days, long past time,
When I was seeking the great Dharma in my prime.
Though I was a king of the world, sitting on a throne,
I didn't want the five desires—didn't want what I owned.

I rang the bell, sent word to the four directions wide:
"Who's got the great Dharma? Come on, step inside.
Whoever can teach me, explain it to my face,
I'll be your servant, take the lowest place."

Then came an ascetic, old hermit man,
Came to the great king, said "I've got a plan.
I've got a subtle, wonderful teaching, rare to find,
The kind of Dharma that blows the worldly mind.

If you can practice it, if you can walk this road,
I'll teach it to you, lighten your load."
When the king heard the ascetic's word,
His heart filled up with joy—best thing he ever heard!

Right away he followed that hermit man,
Gave him everything, did all he can.
Gathered firewood, picked fruit from the vine,
Gave it to him respectfully, right on time.

My body kept the wonderful Dharma close at hand,
Body and mind never tired, never said "I can't stand."
I did it for all living beings, every single one,
Sought the great Dharma for everyone under the sun.

Didn't do it for myself or the five desires' pleasure,
Did it as the king of a great country, seeking treasure.
Sought and got this Dharma, didn't quit the course,
And that's why I became a buddha, found the source.
Now I'm telling you this story—here's the force.

[THE REVELATION: YOUR ENEMY WAS YOUR TEACHER]

The Buddha tells all the monks:

"That king back then—that was me. I was that king.

"And the ascetic, that hermit man—that was Devadatta. That's who he is now.

"Because Devadatta was a good spiritual friend to me, because he taught me, because he pushed me, I was able to perfect the six perfections. I got compassion perfected. I got loving-kindness perfected. I got sympathetic joy perfected. I got equanimity perfected. I got the thirty-two marks. I got the eighty minor characteristics. I got this purple-golden color. I got the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, the four methods of attraction, the eighteen unique qualities. I got supernatural penetrations and the power of the Way.

"I became perfectly, completely enlightened. I teach beings far and wide.

"All because Devadatta was a good spiritual friend."

[DEVADATTA'S PROPHECY: FROM ENEMY TO BUDDHA]

The Buddha tells the four assemblies:

"Devadatta—after incalculable kalpas have passed, he's gonna become a buddha. You hear me? He's gonna be called Heaven-King Tathagata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.

"His world will be called Heaven-Way.

"When Heaven-King Buddha is dwelling in the world, he'll be there for twenty intermediate kalpas, teaching beings the wonderful Dharma. As many beings as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River—that many will attain arhat-fruit. Countless beings will awaken the mind of the pratyekabuddha, the solitary realizer. As many beings as grains of sand in the Ganges will awaken the supreme enlightenment mind, will attain the patience of non-arising, will reach non-regression.

"After Heaven-King Buddha enters nirvana, the Correct Dharma will remain in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas.

"His whole-body relics will be in a stupa made of the seven precious treasures—a tower sixty yojanas high, forty yojanas wide on every side. All the devas and human beings will make offerings to it with mixed flowers, powdered incense, burning incense, perfume paste, clothing, necklaces, banners, flags, jeweled canopies, music, and singing. They'll bow down and honor that wonderful seven-jeweled tower.

"Countless beings will attain arhat-fruit. Countless beings will awaken to the pratyekabuddha way. Inconceivable numbers of beings will bring forth the enlightenment mind and reach non-regression."

[THE BLESSING FOR HEARING THIS CHAPTER]

The Buddha tells all the monks:

"In a future age, if there are good men or good women who hear this Devadatta Chapter of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra, and they believe it with pure hearts, respect it, don't doubt it—they won't fall into hell, won't fall into the realm of hungry ghosts, won't fall into the animal realm.

"They'll be born right there in front of buddhas in the ten directions. Wherever they're born, they'll always be hearing this sutra.

"If they're born among humans or devas, they'll receive supremely wonderful happiness.

"If they're born in the presence of a buddha, they'll be born by transformation from a lotus flower."

[MANJUSHRI RISES FROM THE OCEAN]

Right then, Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva—the one who came with Many Treasures World-Honored One from below—he says to Many Treasures Buddha:

"We should return to our homeland now."

But Shakyamuni Buddha tells Wisdom-Accumulation:

"Good son, wait a little while, just a little bit. There's a bodhisattva here named Manjushri—Wonderful Virtue. You should meet him. You should talk with him about the wonderful Dharma. Then you can return to your homeland."

And right at that moment, Manjushri is sitting on a thousand-petaled lotus flower, big as a chariot wheel. And the bodhisattvas who came with him are also sitting on jeweled lotus flowers. They rise up naturally from the great ocean, from the palace of Sāgara the Dragon King. They come up, suspended in empty space. They go to Vulture Peak Mountain. They step down from their lotus flowers and go to where the Buddha is. They bow their heads to the ground, honoring the feet of both World-Honored Ones—both buddhas sitting there. When they finish paying respects, they go to where Wisdom-Accumulation is sitting. They exchange greetings, ask how each other is doing. Then they sit down to one side.

[HOW MANY DID YOU TEACH?]

Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva asks Manjushri:

"You went to the dragon palace. How many beings did you teach down there? How many did you convert?"

Manjushri says:

"The number is immeasurable. Can't count them. Can't calculate them. Can't speak it with the mouth. Can't measure it with the mind. Just wait a little while. You'll have your proof. You'll see for yourself."

Before he even finishes speaking, countless bodhisattvas sitting on jeweled lotus flowers come rising up from the ocean. They come to Vulture Peak Mountain and stay there, suspended in empty space.

All these bodhisattvas were taught and transformed by Manjushri. They've all accomplished the bodhisattva practices. They're all discussing the six perfections together.

The ones who used to be shravakas, hearers—they're up there in empty space, but they're teaching the shravaka practices. But now they're all practicing the emptiness teaching of the great vehicle.

Manjushri says to Wisdom-Accumulation:

"The teaching and transforming I did in the ocean—it went like this. That's what happened."

Then Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva speaks in verse to praise him:

You have great wisdom, virtue, courage, strength—
You've taught and transformed countless beings, great length.
Now this great assembly and I have all seen
The real characteristics expounded, what they mean.

You've revealed the one vehicle Dharma, opened it clear,
You've guided all living beings, brought them near.
You help them quickly achieve the enlightenment way—
That's what you've been doing, night and day.

[THE EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DRAGON PRINCESS]

Manjushri says:

"When I was in the ocean, I only kept teaching the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra. Nothing else. Just this."

Wisdom-Accumulation asks Manjushri:

"This sutra is so deep, so subtle, so wonderful. It's the treasure of all sutras. It's rare in the world. Is there any living being who practiced this sutra diligently, put real effort into it, and quickly became a buddha? Tell me—did that happen?"

Manjushri says:

"There's the daughter of Sāgara the Dragon King. She just turned eight years old. Eight! But she's got sharp wisdom, keen intelligence. She understands all the roots and karmic actions of living beings. She's got dharani. She can receive and hold all the deep secret treasures taught by the buddhas—every word, she holds it.

"She's entered deep into meditation. She thoroughly understands all dharmas. In the space of an instant—one moment—she brought forth the enlightenment mind. She reached non-regression. Her eloquence has no obstruction, no barrier.

"She thinks of living beings with compassion, like they're her own children. Her merit and virtue are complete. When she thinks something in her mind, when she speaks it with her mouth, it's subtle, wonderful, vast, and great. She's compassionate, humane, yielding, gentle. Her will and spirit are harmonious and refined.

"She can reach enlightenment. She can arrive at bodhi."

[WISDOM-ACCUMULATION'S OBJECTION: THIS CAN'T BE TRUE]

Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva says:

"I've seen Shakyamuni Tathagata. For immeasurable kalpas he practiced difficult and bitter practices. He accumulated merit, piled up virtue, seeking the bodhisattva way. He never stopped, not even for a moment. I look at this great thousand-world system—every part of it, down to a space as small as a mustard seed—there's not one spot that's not a place where the Bodhisattva gave up his body and life for the sake of living beings. Only after all that did he achieve the enlightenment way.

"I don't believe this girl, in just a brief instant, could achieve perfect enlightenment. Can't believe it."

[SHE APPEARS RIGHT THEN AND THERE]

Before he even finishes speaking, the dragon king's daughter suddenly appears right there in front of them. She bows, touching her head to the ground in respect, then stands to one side. She speaks in verse to praise the Buddha:

You deeply understand the marks of sin and merit,
You illuminate the ten directions—all can hear it.
Your subtle, wonderful, pure dharma body, so sublime,
Has the thirty-two marks, perfect in every sign.

The eighty minor characteristics adorn the dharma body bright,
Honored by devas and humans, worshipped day and night.
Dragons and spirits all bow down with respect—
Every kind of living being honors you, every sect.

I've also heard you've achieved the enlightenment way,
Only a buddha can bear witness to this, I say.
I'm revealing the great vehicle teaching, opening it wide,
To rescue suffering beings on every side.

[SHARIPUTRA SAYS: IMPOSSIBLE! YOU'RE A WOMAN!]

Right then, Shariputra speaks to the dragon girl and says:

"You say you're about to quickly attain supreme enlightenment? But that's hard to believe. Can't be trusted. Why not?

"A woman's body is filthy, impure. It's not a vessel for the Dharma. How could you attain supreme enlightenment?

"The buddha-way is so vast, so far away! You have to practice through immeasurable kalpas, endure bitterness, pile up practices, perfect all the perfections. Only then do you succeed.

"Plus, a woman's body has five obstacles. What are they?

"First, she can't become a Brahma Heaven King.
"Second, she can't become Indra.
"Third, she can't become Mara, the demon king.
"Fourth, she can't become a wheel-turning sage king.
"Fifth, she can't become a buddha.

"So how could a woman's body quickly achieve buddhahood? Can't happen."

[THE JEWEL OFFERING: WATCH HOW FAST THIS IS]

Right then the dragon girl had a precious jewel, worth as much as a great thousand-world system—worth three thousand great thousand worlds. She held it up and presented it to the Buddha.

The Buddha received it immediately.

The dragon girl said to Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva and to the Venerable Shariputra:

"I presented a precious jewel, and the World-Honored One accepted it. Was that quick or not?"

They answered: "Very quick!"

The girl said:

"Use your spiritual power. Watch me become a buddha. It's gonna be even faster than that."

[THE INSTANT TRANSFORMATION]

Right at that moment, everyone in the assembly saw the dragon girl suddenly—in an instant—transform into a male. She perfected the bodhisattva practices. Immediately she went south to the Spotless World. She sat down on a jeweled lotus flower and achieved perfect, complete enlightenment. She had the thirty-two marks. She had the eighty minor characteristics. She taught the wonderful Dharma for all living beings throughout the ten directions.

At that time, in this Saha world—all the bodhisattvas, shravakas, the eight classes of devas and dragons, humans and non-humans—they all saw from far away that dragon girl becoming a buddha, teaching the Dharma to all the devas and humans gathered at that time.

Their hearts filled up with great joy. They all bowed in reverence from a distance.

Countless living beings heard the Dharma, understood it, awakened to it. They attained non-regression.

Countless living beings received prophecies of their future enlightenment.

The Spotless World shook in six ways.

Three thousand living beings in this Saha world reached the ground of non-regression. Three thousand living beings brought forth the enlightenment mind and received prophecies.

Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva, the Venerable Shariputra, and the whole assembly—they all silently believed and accepted this.

TRANSLATOR'S NOTE:

This is Chapter 12 of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra, translated from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese (406 CE) into blues/gospel vernacular English.

This chapter carries one of the most revolutionary messages in the entire sutra: that enlightenment is immediate and available to all, regardless of social barriers. The Buddha reveals that Devadatta—his cousin who tried to kill him, who split the sangha, who is in hell for his crimes—was actually his greatest teacher. Through opposition and resistance, Devadatta pushed the Buddha toward complete awakening.

Then comes the dragon princess—an eight-year-old girl, non-human, doubly excluded by the "five obstacles" doctrine—who demonstrates instant enlightenment right there in front of everyone who said it was impossible.

Key metaphors in this translation:

**"Your Enemy Was Your Teacher"** - The chapter title captures the radical teaching that life's hardest trials and greatest opponents can be our deepest educators. This resonates with the blues tradition's understanding that suffering teaches, that the hard road makes you wise.

**The King Becoming a Servant** - I rendered the Buddha's past-life story of royal power surrendered for truth as a blues narrative of status reversed: "I was a king / Had everything a man could want." This mirrors the gospel theme of the last being first, the high brought low.

**"Beat a drum and sent out a proclamation"** - Kept the visceral action of the king literally calling out for teaching, like a town crier, like a preacher calling for testimony.

**"Laid down flat so he could sit on my back"** - Made concrete and physical what the Chinese describes: using one's own body as furniture for the sake of learning truth.

**"Watch how fast this is"** - The dragon princess's challenge becomes vernacular direct speech, the kind of thing someone would actually say before demonstrating impossible grace: "Use your spiritual power. Watch me become a buddha. It's gonna be even faster than that."

**Instant transformation** - The sudden shift from female to male to enlightened buddha happens "right at that moment," "in an instant," "suddenly"—language of the spontaneous grace moment central to gospel testimony, when everything changes in the blink of an eye.

The verse sections maintain rhythm and internal rhyme ("in my prime," "throne/owned," "wide/inside," "man/plan") to create oral memorability and musical flow, appropriate to the blues tradition's method of carrying wisdom.

This chapter is about barriers broken, impossibilities made possible, enemies revealed as friends, and the instantaneous nature of awakening—themes that resonate deeply with the African American spiritual tradition's understanding of liberation, reversal, and sudden grace.
