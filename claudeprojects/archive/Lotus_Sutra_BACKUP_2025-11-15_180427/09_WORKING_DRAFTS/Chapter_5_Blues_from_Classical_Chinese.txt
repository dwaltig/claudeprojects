Chapter Five: The Parable of the Medicinal Herbs
A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese

---

PART ONE: THE BUDDHA PRAISES MAHĀKĀŚYAPA

Now when the Buddha heard what Mahākāśyapa and them other great disciples had to say, he smiled and said:

"That's right, that's right, Kāśyapa. You done spoke the truth about the Tathagata - you told it plain. But let me tell you something: the Tathagata got powers and virtues you ain't even started to count yet. You could talk for a billion kalpas - lifetimes stacked on lifetimes - and still wouldn't get to the end of what the Buddha can do.

"Listen here, Kāśyapa: The Tathagata is the king of all dharmas - king of all truth, you hear me? And when the Buddha speaks, ain't nothing false come out his mouth. Every teaching he gives, he gives it with wisdom and skillful means, and every teaching leads straight to the ground of all-knowledge. The Tathagata sees where every dharma is heading, knows where every truth is going. He knows what's deep in every living being's heart, knows what they're doing, thinking, walking toward. Nothing blocks his sight. He sees clear through to the bottom of all things, and he shows all beings the path to perfect wisdom."


PART TWO: THE PARABLE OF THE ONE RAIN

"Now Kāśyapa, let me tell you a story. Let me paint you a picture:

"Imagine the whole world - this whole three-thousand-fold universe with all its mountains and valleys, its streams and flatlands, every inch of dirt and rock. And growing up from that ground you got all kinds of plants - you got bushes and forests, you got medicinal herbs and wildflowers, every kind and color you can name. All different, you understand? Different names, different natures, different ways of being.

"Now here come a great cloud - a mighty rain cloud - spreading across the whole sky, covering this entire three-thousand-fold world. And that cloud, it opens up and lets the rain fall. One rain, falling everywhere at once. The rain falls equal on every living thing.

"And all them bushes and forests, all them medicinal herbs - they drinking that rain according to what they are:

"The little herbs with little roots, little stems, little branches, little leaves - they take what they can take.

"The medium herbs with medium roots, medium stems, medium branches, medium leaves - they take what they need.

"The big herbs with big roots, big stems, big branches, big leaves - they drink deep.

"And the trees - small trees and great trees, high and low - every one of them receives according to its nature.

"One cloud. One rain. But each plant takes what it can hold. Each grows according to its own kind - each puts out its flowers and fruit according to what it is.

"You see? They all growing from the same earth, all drinking from the same rain, but each plant different from the next. The rain don't pick and choose. The rain just falls."


PART THREE: THE APPLICATION - THE BUDDHA IS LIKE THE RAIN

"Now Kāśyapa, understand this: The Tathagata is just like that. When the Buddha appears in this world, he's like that great cloud rising up. His voice - his great voice - spreads everywhere, reaching the gods and humans and asuras, covering the whole world like that cloud covers the three-thousand-fold universe.

"And the Buddha stands before the multitude and declares:

"'I am the Tathagata - the One Who Comes Thus. I am the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed One, the Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.

"'Those who ain't crossed over yet - I'll get them across. Those who ain't understood yet - I'll make it clear. Those who ain't found peace yet - I'll give them rest. Those who ain't reached nirvāṇa yet - I'll lead them there.

"'I know this present world and the world to come. I know them as they truly are. I'm the all-knowing one, the all-seeing one. I know the path, I opened the path, I teach the path.

"'So all you gods and humans and asuras - come on here. Come and listen to the Dharma.'

"And when the Buddha calls like that, countless millions of living beings come to hear the teaching.

"Now the Tathagata looks out at all them beings and sees who got sharp faculties and who got dull ones, who's diligent and who's lazy. And according to what each one can bear, he teaches the Dharma - gives it to them in countless different ways, makes each one glad, helps each one get some benefit.

"And these beings, when they hear this teaching, they find peace in this present life. And when they die, they born in good places. They experience joy through practicing the path. They get to hear the Dharma again. And hearing it, they break through all the obstacles. According to their strength - according to what power they got - they gradually enter the Way.

"Just like that great cloud raining down on all the bushes and forests and medicinal herbs, and each plant - according to its kind - receives the moisture and grows.


PART FOUR: THE ONE FLAVOR OF LIBERATION

"Listen: When the Tathagata teaches the Dharma, it's one mark, one flavor. What flavor is that? The flavor of liberation - the mark of freedom, the mark of letting go, the mark of extinction. It all leads to one place: the ground of all-knowing wisdom.

"Now the beings who hear the Tathagata's teaching - who uphold it, read it, recite it, practice it just like it's taught - they don't even know themselves what merit they're getting. Why not? Because only the Tathagata knows. Only the Buddha sees clear.

"The Buddha knows each being's mark and nature. He knows what they're thinking about, what they're pondering, what they're practicing. How they think, how they ponder, how they practice. What dharma they're thinking about, what dharma they're pondering, what dharma they're practicing. What dharma they're using to attain what dharma.

"These beings living in all different stations - only the Tathagata sees them as they really are, sees them clear with no obstruction.

"Just like them bushes and forests and medicinal herbs - they don't know their own nature, don't know if they're high, middle, or low. But the Tathagata knows.

"The Buddha knows this is the one-mark, one-flavor Dharma - the mark of liberation, the mark of freedom, the mark of letting go, the ultimate mark of nirvāṇa, the always-still-and-quiet mark that ends in emptiness.

"And knowing this, the Buddha watches what beings want and need, and he protects them. That's why he don't just come right out and teach the all-knowing wisdom straight away. He waits. He watches. He knows the time.

"Now you, Kāśyapa, and the rest of you - it's rare what you done. You understood that the Tathagata teaches according to what's appropriate. You believed it. You accepted it. Why is that rare? Because when the buddhas - the World-Honored Ones - teach according to what's appropriate, that teaching is hard to grasp, hard to understand."


THE VERSES: THE PARABLE TOLD AGAIN IN SONG

Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say this teaching again, spoke it in verse:


The Dharma King who breaks through existence
Appears in this world,
Teaching in all kinds of ways
According to what beings desire.

The Tathagata - honored and revered,
His wisdom deep and far-reaching -
He kept this essential teaching quiet for a long time,
Wasn't in no hurry to speak it out.

Those with wisdom, when they hear it,
They can believe and understand.
Those without wisdom doubt and regret,
And they lose it forever.

That's why, Kāśyapa,
The Buddha teaches according to people's power,
Using all kinds of causes and conditions
To help them get to right seeing.

Now Kāśyapa, understand:
It's like a great cloud
Rising up in the world,
Spreading over everything.

That wisdom-cloud full of moisture,
Lightning flashing bright,
Thunder rolling in the distance,
Making everybody glad.

The sun's light gets covered over,
The ground gets cool,
The cloud hangs low and thick,
Looking like you could reach up and grab it.

And that rain falls equal everywhere -
North, south, east, west -
Pouring down without measure,
Soaking the whole earth.

In the mountain valleys and dangerous ravines,
In the hidden and secret places,
All the grasses and medicinal herbs grow,
Big trees and little trees,

The hundred grains and crops,
Sugarcane and grape vines -
The rain moistens them all,
None go without.

The dry ground gets watered everywhere,
The herbs and trees flourish together.
That cloud pours out
One flavor of water.

But the grasses and trees and forests -
Each takes its portion of moisture.
All the trees -
High ones, middle ones, low ones -

According to their size,
Each grows as it can.
Roots, stems, branches, leaves,
Flowers, fruits, colors, and light -

All made fresh by that one rain.
According to their body, their nature,
Their portion, their size,
The moisture is one

But each flourishes in its own way.
The Buddha is like this too,
Appearing in this world
Like that great cloud covering everything.

When he comes into the world,
He teaches beings
And explains the truth
Of all things.

The Great Holy World-Honored One
Among all the gods and humans,
In the whole assembly,
Declares and says:

"I am the Tathagata,
Most honored among two-legged beings.
I appear in the world
Like a great cloud

Giving moisture to all
The dried-up living beings,
Making them all leave suffering behind
And find peace and joy and happiness -

The happiness of this world
And the happiness of nirvāṇa.

"You gods and humans,
Listen with one mind!
Come here, all of you,
To see the Unsurpassed Honored One.

"I am the World-Honored One -
Ain't nobody can compare.
To give peace to living beings,
That's why I appear in the world.

"I teach the assembly
The pure Dharma like sweet dew.
That Dharma is one flavor:
Liberation and nirvāṇa.

"With one wonderful sound
I explain this meaning,
Always making great causes and conditions
For the Great Vehicle.

"I look at everything
And see it all equal -
No this and that,
No love and hate.

"I got no greed or attachment,
No limits or obstructions.
I always teach everybody
With the same equal teaching.

"Whether it's one person
Or a crowd of many,
It's all the same to me.
I'm always teaching the Dharma -

"Never doing nothing else.
Coming, going, sitting, standing,
I never get tired.
I fill up the world

"Like rain soaking everything.
High-class and low-class,
Those who keep the precepts and those who break them,
Those with perfect dignity and those without,

"Right views and wrong views,
Sharp faculties and dull faculties -
I rain the Dharma rain on all of them equally,
Never getting tired or lazy.

"All living beings
Who hear my teaching
Receive it according to their power
And dwell in various stations.

"Some dwelling among humans and gods,
Wheel-turning sage kings,
Kings like Śakra and Brahmā -
These are the small medicinal herbs.

"Those who know the undefiled Dharma,
Who can attain nirvāṇa,
Who raise up the six spiritual powers
And attain the three clear knowledges,

"Who dwell alone in mountain forests,
Always practicing meditation and stillness,
Who attain the realization of the Pratyekabuddha -
These are the medium medicinal herbs.

"Those who seek the World-Honored One's station,
Saying 'I will become Buddha,'
Who practice with diligence and concentration -
These are the superior medicinal herbs.

"And the Buddha's children
Who give their whole mind to the Buddha's path,
Always practicing kindness and compassion,
Knowing they themselves will become buddhas,

"Certain without any doubt -
These are called small trees.
Those who abide in spiritual powers,
Who turn the wheel that don't turn back,

"Who save countless hundreds of thousands
Of millions of living beings -
Bodhisattvas like this
Are called great trees.

"The Buddha's equal teaching
Is like that one-flavor rain,
But according to beings' natures,
What they receive is different -

"Just like them grasses and trees,
Each takes in different amounts.
The Buddha uses this parable
As skillful means to reveal and show,

"Using all kinds of words
To teach the one Dharma.
In relation to the Buddha's wisdom,
It's like one drop from the ocean.

"I rain the Dharma rain,
Filling up the whole world.
This one-flavor Dharma -
People practice it according to their power,

"Just like them forests,
Medicinal herbs and trees,
According to their size,
Gradually growing more and more lush.

"The buddhas' Dharma
Is always this one flavor,
Making all the worlds
Reach complete fulfillment.

"Through gradual practice,
All attain the fruit of the path.
The śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas
Dwelling in mountain forests,

"Living in their final bodies,
Hearing the Dharma and attaining the fruit -
These are called medicinal herbs,
Each getting its increase.

"If there are bodhisattvas
Whose wisdom is firm and solid,
Who understand the three realms completely
And seek the supreme vehicle -

"These are called small trees,
Getting their increase.
Then there are those who dwell in meditation,
Who attain spiritual powers,

"Who hear about the emptiness of all dharmas
And their hearts are filled with great joy,
Who emit countless lights
And save many living beings -

"These are called great trees,
Getting their increase.
Like this, Kāśyapa,
The Dharma the Buddha teaches

"Is like that great cloud
With its one-flavor rain
Moistening human flowers,
Each bearing its fruit.

"Kāśyapa, you should know:
Using all kinds of causes and conditions,
All kinds of parables,
I reveal and show the Buddha's path.

"This is my skillful means.
All buddhas are like this too.
Now for you all
I'm telling the most real thing:

"All you in the śrāvaka assembly -
You ain't reached extinction yet.
What you're practicing right now,
That's the bodhisattva path.

"If you gradually study and learn,
You all will become buddhas."

TRANSLATOR'S NOTES:

This translation renders Chapter 5 (藥草喻品) into blues vernacular, maintaining the core teaching while making it accessible through everyday language and imagery familiar to the African American oral tradition.

**Key Metaphors:**

THE RAIN = The Buddha's teaching, falling equally on everyone
THE PLANTS = Living beings with different capacities (small herbs, medium herbs, large herbs, small trees, great trees)
ONE FLAVOR = The single truth of liberation taught in many ways
THE GROWTH = Each being's progress according to their nature and capacity

**The Five Types of Plants:**

1. **Small medicinal herbs** (小藥草) = Humans, gods, worldly kings - those seeking worldly happiness
2. **Medium medicinal herbs** (中藥草) = Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas seeking personal liberation
3. **Superior medicinal herbs** (上藥草) = Beginning bodhisattvas aspiring to buddhahood
4. **Small trees** (小樹) = Established bodhisattvas certain of their future buddhahood
5. **Great trees** (大樹) = Advanced bodhisattvas with spiritual powers saving countless beings

**Core Teaching:**

This parable addresses the paradox at the heart of the Lotus Sutra: How can there be "one vehicle" when beings seem to attain different results? The answer: The teaching is one (like one rain), but beings receive it according to their capacity (like different plants). The rain doesn't discriminate - the plants take what they can hold. Similarly, the Buddha teaches the one Dharma of liberation, but beings understand and practice at different levels.

The blues vernacular makes this democratic vision concrete: like rain falling on rich and poor alike, like grace that doesn't pick favorites, the Buddha's teaching is available to everyone. What you receive depends on what you can hold, what you're ready for - but the offering is universal and impartial.

The final revelation (lines 1697-1699) is crucial: Even the śrāvakas who think they've reached final nirvāṇa are actually on the bodhisattva path - they just don't know it yet. They're still growing. The rain is still falling. The journey continues.

**Why Blues Language?**

The blues tradition understands:
- Universal suffering and universal grace
- The democracy of hardship and hope
- One truth received differently by different people
- The patience of gradual growth
- The impartiality of what falls from heaven (rain, grace, teaching)

This parable, in the blues telling, becomes a song about how wisdom comes to everyone but each person takes what they can hold - and that's not failure, that's nature. The rain keeps falling. You keep growing. And one day, that little herb might become a mighty tree.
