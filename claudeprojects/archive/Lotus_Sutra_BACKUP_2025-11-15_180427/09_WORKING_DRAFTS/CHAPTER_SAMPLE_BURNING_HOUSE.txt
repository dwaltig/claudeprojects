CHAPTER TWO: THE LOVING TRICKS
Blues Translation from Classical Chinese by Kumārajīva


PART ONE: THE BUDDHA SPEAKS OF DEEP WISDOM

Now at that time, you see, the World-Honored One—he rose up from his meditation, rose up calm and peaceful-like, and he turned to Śāriputra and said:

"Listen here, Śāriputra. The wisdom of the Buddhas—it goes down deep, deeper than any well you ever tried to draw from. It's measureless, you hear me? Can't nobody measure how deep it goes. The door to that wisdom, now—it's hard to understand, hard to get through. All them disciples and solitary-walkers, all them learned folks who think they got it figured—they can't know this thing.

"And why's that? I'm gonna tell you why. The Buddha, he walked alongside a hundred thousand million billion Buddhas, ain't no way to count them all. He practiced every single path those Buddhas taught, every last one. Brave and fierce, he walked them roads. His name got known everywhere, you understand? He accomplished things so deep, things never done before. And when he teaches, he speaks according to what folks need, but what he's really getting at—that's hard to understand.

"Śāriputra, ever since I became a Buddha, I been using all kinds of causes, all kinds of stories, all kinds of comparisons, pouring out teachings like water. Countless loving tricks, that's what I been using, leading people, guiding them away from all their clinging and holding on. And why can I do this? Because the Tathāgata, he's perfected all them skillful means, all that perfect knowing and seeing.

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata's knowing and seeing—it's vast and deep and far-reaching. It's without measure, without any walls or boundaries. He got the powers, he got the fearlessness, he got the meditations and the liberations and the deep states—he's gone into them without any bottom to hit. He's accomplished everything that ain't never been accomplished before.

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata, he can break things down every which way, explain the teachings with skill, and his words—they soft, they gentle, they please every heart.

"Śāriputra, let me put it to you straight: all them measureless, boundless, never-been-done things—the Buddha's accomplished them all."

Then the Buddha said: "Stop, Śāriputra. Don't need to say no more. And why's that? What the Buddha's accomplished—it's the rarest, hardest-to-understand thing there is. Only a Buddha together with a Buddha can exhaust the true reality of all things. That means: the suchness of their appearance, the suchness of their nature, the suchness of their substance, the suchness of their power, the suchness of their function, the suchness of their causes, the suchness of their conditions, the suchness of their effects, the suchness of their results, and the suchness of their beginning and end being ultimately equal."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wanting to speak this meaning again, he sang it out in verse:


The Hero of the World—can't measure him,
All them heavenly beings and worldly folk,
Every kind of living creature there is—
Ain't nobody can know the Buddha's truth.

The Buddha's powers and his fearlessness,
His liberations and his deep meditations,
And all them other Buddha-things he got—
Ain't nobody can measure what he knows.

From countless Buddhas he learned his way,
Walked every single road there was to walk,
The dharma deep and subtle, hard to see,
So difficult to understand and know.

For measureless millions upon millions of ages,
He walked all them roads till he walked them through,
Reached the place of awakening, got the fruit—
I done seen it all, I know it all.

A fruit as great as this one here,
All its different natures, meanings, marks—
Only me and all them Buddhas in ten directions,
Only we can know this thing.

This dharma—can't be shown by pointing,
Words fall silent when you try to speak it,
All them other kinds of living beings—
Ain't nobody among them understands,

Except for the bodhisattvas,
Them whose faith-power stands strong and firm.
The Buddha's disciples, you understand,
Who done served and honored countless Buddhas,

Who done exhausted all their outflows,
Who standing in their final body now—
Even folks like this here,
They ain't got the strength to bear this teaching.

Even if you filled the whole world up
With people smart as Śāriputra,
And they put their heads together trying to measure—
They couldn't measure the Buddha's wisdom.

Even if you filled up all ten directions,
Filled them full of folks like Śāriputra,
And all the other disciples too,
Filled up every Buddha-land there is,

Put their heads together trying to measure—
Still couldn't know this thing at all.
Them solitary-walkers with their sharp intelligence,
Without outflows, in their final body,

They fill up all ten directions too,
Numerous as bamboo in a bamboo forest,
And they all of one mind, you hear me?
For billions and billions of countless ages,

They wanting to think about the Buddha's real wisdom—
Couldn't know even the smallest little bit of it.
Them newly inspired bodhisattvas,
Who served and honored countless Buddhas,

Who understand all kinds of meanings,
Who can preach the dharma skillfully,
Numerous as rice plants and hemp and bamboo and reeds,
Filling up all the lands in ten directions,

With one mind using their wonderful wisdom,
For ages numerous as Ganges River sands,
All of them thinking about it together—
Still couldn't know the Buddha's wisdom.

Them non-backsliding bodhisattvas,
Numerous as Ganges River sands,
With one mind seeking together—
Still couldn't know this thing neither.

I'm telling you again, Śāriputra:
The dharma without outflow, inconceivable,
So deep and subtle, so wonderful—
I done fully obtained it now.

Only I know its true reality,
And all them Buddhas in ten directions too.
Śāriputra, you ought to know this:
The words of the Buddhas don't differ none.

Concerning the dharma that the Buddha speaks,
You got to generate great faith-power.
After the World-Honored One taught a long time,
He finally got to speak the real truth.

I'm telling all you disciples,
And them seeking the solitary-walker vehicle—
I freed you from the bonds of suffering,
Let you reach nirvāṇa, that's what I did.

But the Buddha used his skillful power,
Showed you three different vehicles of teaching.
Living beings get attached all over the place—
I led them so they could get themselves free.


PART TWO: THE ASSEMBLY'S DOUBT AND ŚĀRIPUTRA'S REQUEST

At that time, in the great assembly, there was disciples—them with no more outflows, them arhats—Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya and the rest, twelve hundred of them. And there was others too, monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, who done set their mind on the disciple vehicle or the solitary-walker vehicle. Every one of them thought to themselves:

"Right now, why's the World-Honored One going on so earnestly, praising and exalting skillful means like this? He says the dharma the Buddha obtained is so deep and hard to understand. What he speaks about got a meaning that's difficult to know. All them disciples and solitary-walkers can't reach it. The Buddha explained one liberation doctrine—we obtained that dharma too, reached nirvāṇa with it. But now we don't know where this teaching is heading."

At that time, Śāriputra, he knew the four groups in the assembly was doubting, and he himself didn't understand it neither. So he addressed the Buddha, saying:

"World-Honored One, for what cause, for what reason are you so earnestly praising the Buddhas' foremost skillful means, this deep, subtle, difficult-to-understand dharma? From way back till now, I ain't never heard you speak like this before. Right now, all four groups got doubts. I only wish the World-Honored One would explain this matter. World-Honored One, why are you so earnestly praising this deep, subtle, difficult-to-understand dharma?"

Then Śāriputra, wanting to speak this meaning again, he said it in verse:


Sun of Wisdom, Great Holy Honored One,
After such a long time you speaking this dharma now.
You say you obtained these kind of things—
Powers, fearlessness, meditations,

Concentration, liberation, all the rest,
Inconceivable dharmas like these.
The dharma you got at the place of awakening—
Ain't nobody can raise a question about it.

My mind's so hard to fathom out,
And ain't nobody can ask about it neither.
Without nobody asking, you just speak on your own,
Praising the road you walked yourself.

Your wisdom so subtle and wonderful,
The very thing all Buddhas obtained.
Them arhats without outflow,
And them seeking nirvāṇa too—

Now they all done fell into a net of doubt,
Wondering why the Buddha speaking this.
Them seeking to be solitary-walkers,
Monks and nuns alike,

Heavenly beings, dragons, spirits, gods,
And gandharvas and such—
They looking at each other, full of wondering,
Gazing up at the Honored One of Two Feet.

What is this matter all about?
We hoping the Buddha will explain it clear.
Among all them disciple folks,
The Buddha says I'm number one.

But right now, concerning my own wisdom,
I'm doubting, confused, can't understand—
Is this the ultimate dharma here,
Or is it just the road we walk?

We who was born from the Buddha's mouth,
We standing with palms pressed together, gazing up and waiting,
Hoping you'll send forth your subtle, wonderful voice,
Speak to us at this time just like it really is.

Them heavenly beings, dragons, spirits, and gods,
Numerous as Ganges River sands,
Them bodhisattvas seeking to be Buddhas,
Eighty thousand in their great number,

And from millions and billions of lands,
Wheel-turning holy kings done arrived,
Palms pressed together with reverent minds—
They wanting to hear about the complete road.


PART THREE: THE BUDDHA'S THREE REFUSALS

At that time, the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Stop, stop. Don't need to say no more. If I speak about this matter, all them beings in all the worlds—the heavenly folk and the human folk—they all gonna be shocked and full of doubt."

Śāriputra addressed the Buddha again, saying: "World-Honored One, I only wish you would speak about it, only wish you would speak! And why's that? In this assembly here, there's countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of innumerable living beings who done seen Buddhas before. Their faculties are sharp and fierce, their wisdom bright and clear. When they hear what the Buddha speaks, they gonna be able to respect it and believe it."

At that time, Śāriputra, wanting to speak this meaning again, he said it in verse:


Dharma King, Most High Honored One,
Just speak it out, don't you worry none.
In this assembly of measureless folks,
There's some who can respect and believe.

The Buddha again stopped Śāriputra: "If I speak about this matter, all them beings in all the worlds—heavenly folk, human folk, asuras—they all gonna be shocked and full of doubt. And them arrogant monks, they gonna fall into the great pit."

At that time, the World-Honored One spoke again in verse, saying:


Stop, stop, don't need to speak about it.
My dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive.
Them arrogant ones full of themselves—
If they hear it, they surely won't respect or believe.

At that time, Śāriputra addressed the Buddha again: "World-Honored One, I only wish you would speak about it, only wish you would speak! Right now in this assembly here, folks like me and more—hundreds of thousands of millions of billions—world after world we been receiving the Buddha's transforming teaching. Folks like this, they surely can respect and believe. They gonna have long-night peace and safety, gonna gain much benefit."

At that time, Śāriputra, wanting to speak this meaning again, he said it in verse:


Most High Honored One of Two Feet,
I wish you'd speak the foremost dharma.
I'm the Buddha's eldest son—
I only beg you to explain it clear and distinct.

This assembly of measureless folks,
They able to respect and believe this dharma.
The Buddha already, world after world,
Done taught and transformed folks like these.

They all with one mind, palms pressed together,
Wanting to listen and receive the Buddha's words.
We twelve hundred here,
And others seeking to be Buddhas—

We wish, for the sake of this whole assembly,
You'd just explain it clear and distinct.
When these folks hear this dharma,
They gonna be born with great rejoicing.


PART FOUR: FIVE THOUSAND LEAVE THE ASSEMBLY

At that time, the World-Honored One told Śāriputra: "You done earnestly asked three times now. How can I not speak? Now you listen carefully, think about it well, remember it good. I'm gonna break it down for you clear and distinct."

When he spoke these words, right there in the assembly there was monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen—five thousand of them—they got up from their seats, bowed to the Buddha, and walked on out. And why was that? This bunch here, their roots of wrongdoing was deep and heavy, and they was full of arrogance. They thought they'd obtained what they hadn't obtained, thought they'd realized what they hadn't realized. They had faults like these, and that's why they didn't stay. The World-Honored One just stayed silent, didn't try to stop them none.

At that time, the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Now this assembly of mine, it ain't got no more dead branches and dead leaves. It's got only the genuine, truthful, real ones. Śāriputra, them arrogant folks leaving—that's a good thing. Now you listen well. I'm gonna speak it for you."

Śāriputra said: "Yes, indeed, World-Honored One. I'm joyful, wanting to hear."


PART FIVE: THE ONE GREAT MATTER—THE ONE VEHICLE

The Buddha told Śāriputra:

"A wonderful dharma like this—the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, they only speak it from time to time. Just like the udumbara flower—it only appears once in a great while. Śāriputra, you and the rest ought to believe what the Buddha speaks. His words ain't false or empty.

"Śāriputra, when the Buddhas speak the dharma according to what's fitting, the meaning's hard to understand. And why's that? I use countless skillful means—all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions—to explain the dharmas. This dharma here, it ain't something thinking and discriminating can understand. Only the Buddhas can know it.

"And why's that? The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, they only appear in the world for one great matter, one great cause and condition. Śāriputra, what do I mean when I say the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, only appear in the world for one great matter, one great cause and condition?

"The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world because they want to open up the Buddha's knowing and seeing for living beings, make it pure—that's why they appear. They want to show living beings the Buddha's knowing and seeing—that's why they appear. They want to awaken living beings to the Buddha's knowing and seeing—that's why they appear. They want to cause living beings to enter into the path of the Buddha's knowing and seeing—that's why they appear.

"Śāriputra, this is why the Buddhas appear in the world for one great matter, one great cause and condition."

The Buddha told Śāriputra: "The Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, they only teach and transform bodhisattvas. Everything they do, it's always for this one matter. They only use the Buddha's knowing and seeing to show and awaken living beings.

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata, he only teaches dharma to living beings using the One Buddha Vehicle. There ain't no other vehicles—not two, not three.

"Śāriputra, the dharma of all the Buddhas in all ten directions—it's like this too."


PART SIX: THE THREE TIMES—PAST, FUTURE, PRESENT

"Śāriputra, them Buddhas of the past, they used countless, numberless skillful means—all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions—to teach dharma for living beings. All them dharmas was for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All them living beings who heard the dharma from the Buddhas—in the end, they all obtained the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, them Buddhas of the future, when they gonna appear in the world, they also gonna use countless, numberless skillful means—all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions—to teach dharma for living beings. All them dharmas gonna be for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All them living beings who hear the dharma from the Buddhas—in the end, they all gonna obtain the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, right now, in the countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddha-lands throughout the ten directions, them Buddhas, them World-Honored Ones, they benefiting and bringing peace to living beings in so many ways. These Buddhas too, they using countless, numberless skillful means—all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions—to teach dharma for living beings. All them dharmas is for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All them living beings who hear the dharma from the Buddhas—in the end, they all gonna obtain the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, these Buddhas, they only teach and transform bodhisattvas. They want to show living beings the Buddha's knowing and seeing. They want to awaken living beings to the Buddha's knowing and seeing. They want to cause living beings to enter the Buddha's knowing and seeing.

"Śāriputra, I'm the same way right now too. I know living beings got all kinds of desires. Deep in their minds, they attached to things. Following their original natures, using all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions, the power of skillful means—I speak the dharma for them.

"Śāriputra, all this—it's all for the sake of obtaining the One Buddha Vehicle and the wisdom of all modes."


PART SEVEN: ONLY ONE VEHICLE—THE BUDDHA VEHICLE

"Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions, there ain't even two vehicles, much less three.

"Śāriputra, when the Buddhas appear in a world of five kinds of defilement—the defilement of the age, the defilement of afflictions, the defilement of living beings, the defilement of views, the defilement of lifespan—when it's like that, Śāriputra, when the age is all disturbed and chaotic, living beings heavy with filth, stingy and jealous, accomplishing roots of unwholesomeness, the Buddhas use the power of skillful means. Within the One Buddha Vehicle, they make distinctions and speak of three.

"Śāriputra, if my disciples call themselves arhats or solitary-walkers, but they don't hear, don't know that the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, only teach and transform bodhisattvas—these ain't disciples of the Buddha. They ain't arhats. They ain't solitary-walkers.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra, them monks and nuns who say they already obtained arhatship, say they in their final body, say they reached ultimate nirvāṇa—and then they don't keep seeking anuttara-samyak-sambodhi no more—you ought to know that folks like this, they all arrogant people.

"And why's that? If there's a monk who truly obtained arhatship, and he don't believe this dharma—that situation don't exist. Except after the Buddha's extinction, when there ain't no Buddha present in the world. And why's that? After the Buddha's extinction, sutras like this—folks who can accept and uphold them, read and recite them, understand their meaning—them kind of people is hard to find. If they meet another Buddha later on, concerning this dharma, they gonna obtain complete understanding.

"Śāriputra, all of you ought to single-mindedly believe, understand, accept and uphold the Buddha's words. The words of the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas—they ain't false. There ain't no other vehicle. There's only the One Buddha Vehicle."


PART EIGHT: VERSES ON THE FIVE THOUSAND AND THE ONE VEHICLE

At that time, the World-Honored One, wanting to speak this meaning again, he said it in verse:


Monks and nuns
Full up with arrogance,
Laymen puffed up with pride,
Laywomen who don't believe—

Four kinds of folks like these,
Five thousand in their number.
They don't see their own faults,
They got shortcomings in keeping precepts,

Protecting and cherishing their own flaws.
These small-minded ones done left,
The chaff and the husks of the assembly—
Through the Buddha's awesome virtue they gone.

These folks got scarce merit and virtue,
They ain't capable of receiving this dharma.
This assembly now ain't got no branches and leaves,
It's only got them genuine and real.

Śāriputra, listen well now:
The dharma that the Buddhas obtained—
Using measureless skillful power,
They speak it out for living beings.

The minds of living beings and what they thinking,
The various roads they walking,
All their different desire-natures,
Their good and bad karma from previous lives—

The Buddha knows all this completely.
Using causes and comparisons,
Expressions and the power of skillful means,
He makes everybody rejoice.

Sometimes he speaks sutras,
Gathas and past events,
Birth stories and unprecedented things.
He also speaks about causes and conditions,

Comparisons and geyas too,
And the upadesa sutras.
Them dull-rooted folks who love the small dharma,
Greedy and attached to birth and death,

Concerning all them countless Buddhas,
They don't walk the deep and wonderful road.
Disturbed and troubled by all kinds of suffering,
For them I speak about nirvāṇa.

I set up these skillful means
To lead them into the Buddha's wisdom.
I never said to any of you
That you gonna accomplish the Buddha-road.

The reason I never said it—
The time to say it hadn't arrived yet.
But now is exactly the right time
To decisively speak the Great Vehicle.

These nine divisions of my dharma,
I speak them according to what living beings need.
They leading into the Great Vehicle—that's the fundamental reason—
And that's why I speak this sutra.

There's Buddha-children with pure minds,
Gentle and also sharp-rooted,
Who at the place of countless Buddhas
Done walked the deep and wonderful road.

For these Buddha-children here,
I speak this Great Vehicle sutra.
I predict that folks like these,
In lives to come, gonna accomplish the Buddha-road.

Because with deep minds they remember the Buddha,
Practice and uphold the pure precepts.
When these folks hear they gonna become Buddhas,
Great joy fills up their whole body.

The Buddha knows the way their minds moving,
And so for them he speaks the Great Vehicle.
When disciples or bodhisattvas
Hear the dharma that I speak,

Even just a single verse—
They all gonna become Buddhas, no doubt about it.
In all them Buddha-lands of the ten directions,
There's only the dharma of one vehicle,

Not two and not three neither.
Except when the Buddha uses skillful means—
Just using temporary, provisional names and words
To lead and guide living beings,

Speaking about the Buddha's wisdom.
When Buddhas appear in the world,
It's only for this one true matter—
Them other two ain't real.

The Buddha will never use the Small Vehicle
To ferry living beings across.
The Buddha himself dwells in the Great Vehicle,
And according to the dharma he obtained—

Concentration and wisdom for his adornment—
With this he ferries living beings across.
Having himself realized the unsurpassed road,
The Great Vehicle dharma, equal for all—

If I was to use the Small Vehicle
To teach even one single person,
I'd be falling into stinginess and greed—
This matter would be impossible.

If a person has faith and takes refuge in the Buddha,
The Tathāgata don't deceive or cheat,
Don't have no greedy or jealous intention,
Cut off all evil among the dharmas.

Therefore, the Buddha in the ten directions—
He alone is without any fear.
I use these marks to adorn my body,
My light shines throughout the world.

Honored by measureless multitudes,
I speak the seal of true reality.
Śāriputra, you ought to know—
Originally I made this vow:

Wanting to cause all living beings
To be equal to me, no different.
Like the vow I made long ago,
Now it's already completely fulfilled.

I'm transforming all living beings,
Causing them all to enter the Buddha-road.
If I meet living beings
And teach them all about the Buddha-road—

Them without wisdom would get confused and lost,
Deluded, they wouldn't receive the teaching.
I know these living beings here,
They never cultivated wholesome roots before.

They firmly attached to the five desires,
Through ignorance and craving they born troubled.
Through all their desire causes and conditions,
They fall down into the three evil paths,

Revolving through the six destinies,
Fully receiving every kind of suffering and poison.
The tiny form when they conceived,
World after world it keeps on growing.

People with thin virtue and little merit,
Oppressed and forced by all kinds of suffering,
They enter into a dense forest of wrong views—
Either existence or non-existence and such like.

Depending on these various views,
Complete with sixty-two of them,
Deeply attached to false and empty dharmas,
Firmly grasping them, can't let them go.

Arrogant, bragging on themselves,
Crooked and flattering, their minds not real.
For thousands of millions of billions of ages
They don't even hear the Buddha's name,

Don't hear the proper dharma neither—
Folks like this is hard to ferry across.
That's why, Śāriputra,
I set up skillful means for them,

Speaking about all them roads that end suffering,
Showing them nirvāṇa.
Even though I speak nirvāṇa,
This also ain't true extinction.

All the dharmas from the very beginning,
They always had the mark of still extinction.
When Buddha-children finish walking the road,
In lives to come they gonna become Buddhas.

I got this skillful power,
I open up and show the dharma of three vehicles.
All them World-Honored Ones,
They all speak the road of one vehicle.

Now this whole great assembly here,
All ought to get rid of their doubt and wondering.
The Buddhas' words don't differ none—
There's only one, not two vehicles.

In the past, countless ages back,
Measureless extinct Buddhas,
Hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of kinds,
Their number beyond all measuring—

World-Honored Ones like these,
Using various causes and comparisons,
Countless powers of skillful means,
They taught and explained the marks of the dharmas.

All these World-Honored Ones,
They all spoke the dharma of one vehicle,
Transformed measureless living beings,
Caused them to enter the Buddha-road.

Also, them Great Holy Lords,
Knowing the entire world—
Heavenly beings, human beings, every kind of living creature—
The deep desires of their minds—

They used different skillful means
To help reveal the foremost meaning.
If there was living creatures
Who met them Buddhas of the past,

Whether they heard dharma or gave gifts,
Or upheld precepts, practiced patience,
Vigor, meditation, wisdom, and such—
Cultivating merit and wisdom in various ways—

Folks like these,
They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.
After the Buddhas became extinct,
If people had good, gentle hearts,

Living beings like these,
They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.
After the Buddhas became extinct,
Those who made offerings to the relics—

Raised up millions and billions of kinds of stupas,
Made from gold and silver and crystal,
Mother-of-pearl and agate,
Rose quartz and lapis lazuli pearls,

Purifying them with extensive adornments,
Decorating all them stupas.
Or some raised up stone temples,
Sandalwood and agarwood,

Honey-tree wood and other timber,
Brick and tile, clay and earth.
If in some wilderness place
They heaped up dirt to make a Buddha-shrine,

Or even children playing,
Piling up sand to make a Buddha-stupa—
Folks like these,
They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.

If people for the Buddha's sake
Established all kinds of images,
Carved and sculpted with every kind of mark—
They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.

Whether made from seven jewels,
Bronze or red and white copper,
White pewter, lead and tin,
Iron, wood, or even clay,

Or using glue and lacquer and cloth
To adorn and make Buddha-images—
Folks like these,
They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.

Painting and drawing Buddha-images,
Complete with a hundred merits adorning the marks,
Whether they did it themselves or had others do it—
They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.

Even children playing,
Using grass or wood or a brush,
Or maybe even fingernails
To scratch and draw a Buddha-image—

Folks like these,
Gradually accumulating merit and virtue,
Completely fulfilling great compassion-mind—
They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.

They only teaching and transforming bodhisattvas,
Ferrying across measureless multitudes.
If people at stupas and temples,
At jeweled images or painted images,

With flowers, incense, banners, canopies,
Made offerings with reverent minds—
If they had people make music,
Beating drums, blowing horns and conches,

Flutes, pipes, zithers and harps,
Lutes, cymbals and gongs,
All these wonderful sounds,
Playing them all as offerings—

Or with joyful minds
Singing and chanting the Buddha's virtue,
Even just one small sound—
They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.

If people with distracted minds,
Even just with a single flower,
Made an offering to a painted image—
Gradually they gonna see countless Buddhas.

Or some people bowed in respect,
Or maybe just pressed their palms together,
Or even just raised one hand,
Or maybe just lowered their head a little—

By making offerings to images like this,
Gradually they gonna see measureless Buddhas.
They gonna accomplish the unsurpassed road themselves,
Extensively ferry across numberless multitudes,

Enter nirvāṇa without remainder,
Like firewood exhausted, fire gone out.
If people with distracted minds
Enter into a stupa or temple,

One time call out 'Homage to the Buddha!'—
They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.
Concerning all them Buddhas of the past,
Whether while they was in the world or after they extinct—

If there's folks who heard this dharma,
They all done already accomplished the Buddha-road.
All them World-Honored Ones of the future,
Their number without any measure—

All these Tathāgatas
Gonna use skillful means to speak the dharma.
All the Tathāgatas,
Using measureless skillful means,

Gonna ferry living beings across,
Cause them to enter the Buddha's wisdom without outflow.
If there's folks who hear the dharma,
Not a single one won't become a Buddha.

The Buddhas' original vow and wish was:
'The Buddha-road that I'm walking—
I want to cause living beings universally
To obtain this same road too.'

The Buddhas of the future world,
Even though they gonna speak hundreds of thousands of billions,
Countless doors into the dharma,
Actually it's for the one vehicle.

The Buddhas, Honored Ones of Two Feet,
They know the dharma constantly has no nature—
Buddha-seed arises from conditions—
That's why they speak the one vehicle.

This dharma dwells in the dharma-position,
The worldly marks constantly abide.
Having known this at the place of awakening,
The Guide uses skillful means to speak.

The heavenly beings and humans who make offerings,
The present Buddhas of the ten directions,
Numerous as Ganges River sands,
Appearing in the world—

For the sake of bringing peace to living beings,
They also speak dharma like this.
Knowing the foremost still extinction,
Using the power of skillful means,

Although they showing various roads,
Actually it's for the Buddha Vehicle.
Knowing the practices of living beings,
What's thought deep in their minds,

Their karma practiced in the past,
Their desire-natures, vigor-power,
And whether their faculties sharp or dull—
Using various causes and conditions,

Comparisons and also expressions,
They speak with appropriate skillful means.
Now I'm the same way too—
For the sake of bringing peace to living beings,

Using various dharma-doors,
I'm proclaiming and showing the Buddha-road.
With my power of wisdom,
I know living beings' natures and desires.

Using skillful means, speaking all the dharmas,
I'm causing them all to gain joy.
Śāriputra, you ought to know—
With my Buddha-eye I'm looking,

Seeing living beings of the six paths,
Poor and without merit or wisdom,
Entering the dangerous road of birth and death,
Suffering continuing on without break,

Deeply attached to the five desires,
Like a yak loving its tail—
With greed and craving they damaging themselves,
Blind in the darkness, can't see nothing.

They don't seek the Buddha with his great might,
Don't seek the dharma that cuts off suffering neither.
Deep into all kinds of wrong views they go,
Trying to use suffering to get rid of suffering.

For the sake of living beings like these,
I arise with a great compassion-mind.
When I first sat at the place of awakening,
Gazing at the tree and also walking,

For three times seven days
I thought about matters like this:
'The wisdom I obtained—
It's subtle, wonderful, most foremost.

Living beings got dull faculties,
Attached to pleasure, blinded by ignorance.
Folks like these here—
How can they possibly be ferried across?'

At that time, all them Brahma kings
And all them Lord Shakras too,
The Four Heavenly Kings protecting the world,
And the Great Freedom Heaven god,

Along with other hosts of heavenly beings,
Retinues of hundreds of thousands of millions,
Respectfully with palms pressed together, bowing,
They begged me to turn the dharma-wheel.

I immediately thought to myself:
'If I only praise the Buddha Vehicle,
Living beings sunk down in suffering,
They won't be able to believe this dharma.

Because they break the dharma and don't believe,
They gonna fall into the three evil paths.
I'd rather not speak the dharma at all,
Just quickly enter into nirvāṇa.'

Then I remembered them Buddhas of the past,
The power of skillful means they practiced.
'The road I obtained right now,
I also ought to speak three vehicles.'

While I was thinking like this,
Buddhas from the ten directions all appeared.
With their Brahma voices they comforted and instructed me:
'Excellent! Śākyamuni!

Foremost of Guides,
You obtained this unsurpassed dharma.
Following all the Buddhas everywhere,
You gonna use the power of skillful means.

We too all obtained
The most wonderful, foremost dharma.
For the sake of all kinds of living creatures,
We make distinctions and speak three vehicles.

Folks with little wisdom who love the small dharma,
Who don't believe they can become Buddhas themselves—
That's why, using skillful means,
We make distinctions and speak about various fruits.

Even though we speak three vehicles,
It's only for teaching bodhisattvas.'
Śāriputra, you ought to know—
I heard them holy lion-roars,

Their deep, pure, subtle, wonderful sounds,
Joyfully calling 'Homage to the Buddha!'
Then I thought like this:
'I came out into this defiled, evil world.

Just like all them Buddhas spoke,
I also ought to follow and practice accordingly.'
After I thought about this matter,
I immediately went to Varanasi.

The marks of the dharmas—still extinction—
Can't be proclaimed in words.
Using the power of skillful means,
For five monks I spoke it.

This is called turning the dharma-wheel.
Then there was the sound of nirvāṇa,
And also 'arhat,'
And 'dharma' and 'sangha'—these distinguishing names.

From ages long ago till now,
I been praising the dharma of nirvāṇa—
The suffering of birth and death forever exhausted—
I always speak like this.

Śāriputra, you ought to know:
I see them Buddha-children,
Ones aspiring and seeking the Buddha-road,
Countless thousands of millions of billions.

All with reverent minds,
They come to where the Buddha is.
They done heard from all them Buddhas before
Dharma spoken with skillful means.

I immediately thought like this:
'The reason why the Tathāgata appears
Is for the sake of speaking the Buddha-wisdom.
Now is exactly the right time.'

Śāriputra, you ought to know:
Folks with dull roots and little wisdom,
Who attached to marks and full of arrogant pride—
They can't believe this dharma.

Now I'm joyful and without fear.
Among all the bodhisattvas here,
I'm straightforwardly casting off skillful means,
Only speaking the unsurpassed road.

When bodhisattvas hear this dharma,
All their nets of doubt already got removed.
Twelve hundred arhats—
They also, every one, gonna become Buddhas.

Like all them Buddhas of the three times,
The pattern and style of speaking dharma—
I'm doing the same thing now too,
Speaking the dharma without distinctions.

When Buddhas arise and appear in the world,
It's a far-off thing, hard to encounter.
Even when they do appear in the world,
Speaking this dharma is hard too.

Through measureless, countless ages,
Hearing this dharma is hard too.
And people able to listen to this dharma—
Folks like that is hard to find too.

Like the udumbara flower—
Everybody loves it and delights in it,
Heavenly beings and humans hold it rare—
It only appears from time to time.

When you hear the dharma, rejoice and praise it,
Even just speaking out one word—
That's already making an offering
To all the Buddhas of the three times.

A person like this is extremely rare,
Rarer than the udumbara flower.
All of you, don't have no doubts—
I'm the King of the Dharmas.

I'm announcing to the whole great assembly:
Only using the road of one vehicle,
I'm teaching and transforming bodhisattvas.
There ain't no disciples in the disciple-vehicle.

All of you, Śāriputra,
Disciples and bodhisattvas too—
You ought to know this wonderful dharma
Is the secret essential of all the Buddhas.

In this defiled, evil world of five kinds,
Folks only take pleasure in being attached to desires.
Living beings like these here—
They'll never seek the Buddha-road.

Evil people in the future world,
When they hear the Buddha speak one vehicle,
They gonna be confused, deluded, won't believe or accept it,
Gonna break the dharma and fall into evil paths.

But if there's folks with humility and purity,
Who aspire and seek the Buddha-road—
For folks like these,
I'm gonna extensively praise the road of one vehicle.

Śāriputra, you ought to know—
The dharma of all the Buddhas is like this:
Using ten thousand billions of skillful means,
According to what's fitting, they speak the dharma.

Them who don't study and learn it—
They ain't able to understand this clearly.
Since all of you already know
The Buddhas, teachers of the world,

Their appropriate skillful means and matters—
Don't have no more doubts and wondering.
Let your minds be born with great rejoicing—
Know that you yourselves gonna become Buddhas!

END OF CHAPTER TWO: THE LOVING TRICKS

TRANSLATION NOTES:

This blues vernacular translation transforms Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese into the rhythmic, direct language of the blues tradition. Key metaphorical choices:

- 方便 (skillful means) → "loving tricks" / "skillful means" - capturing both the strategic and compassionate aspects
- 諸佛智慧，甚深無量 → "deeper than any well you ever tried to draw from" - making abstract depth concrete
- 一大事因緣 → "one great matter, one great cause and condition" / "the one great reason" - preserving both formality and accessibility
- 五千人退席 → The five thousand leaving rendered as dramatic narrative moment
- Repetitive verse structure → Blues-style repetition with variation
- Technical terms (Tathāgata, Buddha, nirvāṇa) → Kept for their essential meaning, but surrounded by vernacular explanation

The translation maintains the complete narrative arc from the Classical Chinese, including:
- The Buddha's emergence from meditation and initial teaching
- Śāriputra's three requests and the Buddha's three refusals
- The departure of the five thousand arrogant ones
- The revelation of the One Vehicle teaching
- All extensive verse sections
- The teaching on the three times (past, present, future Buddhas)
- The varieties of offerings that lead to Buddhahood
- The Buddha's post-enlightenment hesitation and Brahma kings' request

The blues vernacular approach makes this profound Mahayana teaching accessible while preserving its depth—using everyday metaphors (wells, roads, doors, fires, seeds) and direct address ("you hear me?", "you understand?") to create immediacy and connection with the reader.


CHAPTER THREE: THE PARABLE
(Blues Translation from Classical Chinese)

***

ŚĀRIPUTRA'S JOY

Right then, Śāriputra—his heart just leaping up—he stood up, put his palms together, looked straight at the Buddha's face, and said:

"Lord, today I heard this teaching from you, and my heart's dancing like it ain't never danced before. I got something I never had. You know why? Because all this time I been hearing you teach, seeing you tell these bodhisattvas they gonna be buddhas, giving them their prophecies—and me and mine, we wasn't in on none of that. I felt cut to the heart, like I'd lost out on all that boundless wisdom you got.

"World-Honored One, I used to go off by myself—mountains, forests, under the trees—sitting or walking, and I'd think about it over and over: 'We all entered into the same dharma-nature, so how come the Buddha's saving us with this small-vehicle teaching?' But that was on me, Lord, not on you. Why? Because if we'd just waited to hear you explain the causes, the way to reach that supreme perfect enlightenment, we would've been saved by the great vehicle. But we didn't understand your skillful means, the way you teach different folks different ways. First time we heard the Dharma, we just grabbed hold, believed it, thought about it, and took it for proof.

"World-Honored One, all this time—day and night, day and night—I been blaming myself. But now I heard from you what I never heard before, a teaching I never even knew existed, and all my doubts and regrets just fell away. My body and mind feel easy now, like I finally got home safe. Today I know for real—I'm a true child of the Buddha, born from the Buddha's mouth, born from the Dharma's transformation, got my share of the Buddha's teaching."

***

ŚĀRIPUTRA'S VERSES

Then Śāriputra, wanting to say it again, spoke in verse:

I heard this teaching sound,
got what I never had,
my heart's filled up with joy,
the net of doubts all torn away.

From way back I received your teaching,
didn't lose the great vehicle path.
Buddha's voice is precious rare,
can take away all living beings' pain.

I already got my leakages dried up,
hearing this takes away my worry and grief.
When I was in the mountain valleys,
or underneath the forest trees,

Whether sitting down or walking 'round,
I was always thinking on this thing,
crying out, blaming my own self:
"How come I went and fooled myself?"

We're Buddha's children too,
entered the same no-leak teaching,
but we can't, in the future time,
proclaim this unsurpassed Way.

The golden color and thirty-two marks,
the ten powers and all liberations—
we're in the same Dharma together,
but I didn't get none of this.

The eighty kinds of beautiful signs,
the eighteen things that buddhas alone have—
all these kind of virtues and powers,
and I done lost every one.

When I was walking by myself,
I'd see the Buddha in the great assembly,
his name filling up all ten directions,
bringing benefit far and wide to living beings.

I'd think: "I lost this advantage,
I done deceived my own self."
Day and night, day and night,
I kept thinking on this thing,

Wanting to ask the World-Honored One:
Did I lose out or didn't I?
I kept seeing the World-Honored One
praising all them bodhisattvas.

So day and night, day and night,
I was turning this thing over in my mind.
Now I heard the Buddha's voice
teaching according to what folks need,

That no-leak teaching, hard to imagine,
leading everyone to the place of the Way.
I used to hold wrong views,
I was a teacher for them brahmin priests.

World-Honored One knew my heart,
pulled out the wrong and taught nirvāṇa.
I swept away all them wrong views,
bore witness to the empty teaching.

Right then my heart told me
I'd reached the place of extinction.
But now I finally see clear—
that wasn't real extinction at all.

When I get to be a buddha,
with the thirty-two marks complete,
heaven-folk and yaksha crowds,
dragons and spirits showing respect—

That's when you can truly say
it's permanently done, nothing left over.
Buddha, in this great assembly,
said I'm gonna be a buddha.

Hearing this kind of teaching sound,
all doubts and regrets swept clean.
First time I heard what the Buddha said,
my heart was shocked and full of doubt:

"Could this be a demon pretending to be Buddha,
trying to mess with my mind?"
But Buddha used all kinds of causes,
parables and skillful words,

His heart calm as the ocean,
and when I heard, the net of doubt got cut.
Buddha told about the past ages,
countless buddhas gone to extinction,

Dwelling safe in skillful means,
they all taught this same teaching.
Present and future buddhas too,
their number beyond all counting,

They also use skillful means
to proclaim this very teaching.
Just like our present World-Honored One—
from his birth up to leaving home,

Finding the Way and turning the Dharma wheel,
he also taught by skillful means.
World-Honored One teaches the real Way—
the evil one ain't got nothing like this.

So now I know for certain sure,
this ain't no demon playing buddha.
I fell into that net of doubt,
thought it was the devil's doing.

I heard Buddha's gentle voice,
deep and far and so refined,
setting forth the pure and clean teaching.
My heart filled up with joy,

All doubts and regrets gone for good,
dwelling safe in the real wisdom.
I'm definitely gonna be a buddha,
honored by heaven-folk and humans,

Turning the unsurpassed Dharma wheel,
teaching and transforming bodhisattvas.

***

THE BUDDHA SPEAKS TO ŚĀRIPUTRA

Right then the Buddha told Śāriputra:

"Now, in front of all these heaven-folk, humans, monks, brahmin priests, and the whole great assembly, I'm telling you—way back, at the place of twenty billion buddhas, for the sake of this unsurpassed Way, I was always teaching you. And you, through the long night, you followed me and learned. I used skillful means to guide you, made you be born into my Dharma.

"Śāriputra, back then I taught you to set your will on the buddha-way, but you done forgot all about it now and went around thinking you already reached extinction. Now I want to make you remember again that original vow and the way you walked, so I'm preaching this Mahayana scripture to the voice-hearer disciples. It's called the Lotus of the Wonderful Dharma, teaching for bodhisattvas, cherished and protected by all buddhas.

"Śāriputra, in the future age, after you pass through a boundless, limitless, unthinkable number of ages, after you make offerings to thousands and millions and billions of buddhas, after you uphold the true Dharma and complete all the bodhisattva practices—you gonna be a buddha. Your name gonna be Flower Light Tathāgata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened in Knowledge, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.

"Your country gonna be called Free from Dirt, and that land gonna be level and straight, pure and beautiful, peaceful and rich and happy, heaven-folk and humans flourishing everywhere. The ground gonna be made of lapis lazuli, with eight roads crossing, gold ropes marking out the sides. Along them roads, seven-jewel trees everywhere, always full of flowers and fruit. That Flower Light Tathāgata gonna teach living beings using the three vehicles too.

"Śāriputra, when that buddha appears, even though it won't be an evil age, because of his original vow he gonna teach the three-vehicle Dharma. His age gonna be called Great Jewel Adornment. Why it called Great Jewel Adornment? Because in that country, bodhisattvas are the great jewels. And them bodhisattvas—boundless, limitless, beyond thought, can't be counted by numbers or comparisons. Unless you got buddha-wisdom power, can't nobody know their number.

"When they want to walk somewhere, jewel flowers gonna hold up their feet. These bodhisattvas ain't new to this—they been planting virtue for a long, long time. At the place of hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of buddhas they been practicing pure conduct, always praised by all them buddhas. They been cultivating buddha-wisdom constantly, got great spiritual powers, know well all the gates of all teachings. They straight and honest, no fakeness in them, their will and mind firm and solid. Bodhisattas like this gonna fill up that whole country.

"Śāriputra, that Flower Light Buddha gonna live twelve small ages, not counting the time when he was a prince before he became buddha. The people in that country gonna live eight small ages. After twelve small ages, Flower Light Tathāgata gonna give the prophecy to a bodhisattva named Firm Fullness, telling him he gonna reach that supreme perfect enlightenment. He gonna tell all the monks: 'This Firm Fullness Bodhisattva gonna be the next buddha, his name gonna be Flower Feet Peaceful Walker, Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One.' And his buddha country gonna be just like this one.

"Śāriputra, after that Flower Light Buddha passes into extinction, the true Dharma gonna remain in the world for thirty-two small ages, and the imitation Dharma gonna last another thirty-two small ages."

***

THE BUDDHA'S VERSES ABOUT ŚĀRIPUTRA'S FUTURE

Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say it again, spoke in verse:

Śāriputra, in the age to come,
gonna be a buddha, one with universal wisdom,
his name gonna be Flower Light,
gonna save countless multitudes.

After making offerings to numberless buddhas,
completing all the bodhisattva practices,
the ten powers and all them virtues,
he gonna bear witness to the unsurpassed Way.

After countless ages pass,
the age called Great Jewel Adornment,
the world called Free from Dirt,
pure and clean, without no flaws.

Lapis lazuli for the ground,
gold ropes marking out the roads,
seven-jewel trees of mixed colors,
always having flowers and fruit.

The bodhisattvas of that country,
their will and mind always firm and solid,
spiritual powers and perfections
all completely fulfilled.

At the place of numberless buddhas
they learned well the bodhisattva Way.
Great beings such as these—
all transformed by Flower Light Buddha.

When that buddha was a prince,
gave up his kingdom and worldly glory,
in his very last body
left home and completed the buddha-way.

Flower Light Buddha gonna dwell in the world
twelve small ages,
and the people of that country
gonna live eight small ages.

After the buddha passes to extinction,
the true Dharma gonna remain in the world
thirty-two small ages,
saving multitudes far and wide.

When the true Dharma's all used up,
the imitation Dharma gonna last thirty-two,
his relics spreading everywhere,
heaven-folk and humans making offerings.

What Flower Light Buddha gonna do,
all these things gonna be like this.
That most honored among two-legged beings,
supreme, with nothing to compare—

That one's gonna be your own self.
You ought to rejoice and celebrate.

***

THE ASSEMBLY REJOICES

Right then the four groups—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen—and the dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, and all the rest of the great assembly, they saw Śāriputra receiving that prophecy of supreme perfect enlightenment right there in front of the Buddha. Their hearts got filled with joy, leaping up beyond measure. Each one took off the best robe they was wearing and offered it to the Buddha.

Shakra the king of gods, the Brahma king, and countless other divine beings, they also offered heavenly fine robes, heavenly mandara flowers, great mandara flowers, and such to the Buddha. Them heavenly robes they scattered, they hung there in the empty sky, turning around by themselves. All the heavenly music—hundreds of thousands of millions of kinds—played all at once up there in the sky, raining down heavenly flowers everywhere.

And they said: "Way back, at Benares, the Buddha first turned the Dharma wheel. Now he turning it again—the unsurpassed, the greatest Dharma wheel of all!"

***

THE HEAVEN-FOLK'S VERSES

Right then them divine beings, wanting to say it again, spoke in verse:

Long ago at Benares
you turned the wheel of the Four Noble Truths,
explaining all the teachings clearly,
the five aggregates and how they born and die.

Now you turning again the most wonderful,
unsurpassed great Dharma wheel.
This teaching deep and mysterious—
ain't many can believe it.

From way back till now
we heard the World-Honored One teaching many times,
but we never heard nothing like this,
this deep and wonderful supreme teaching.

World-Honored One preaching this teaching,
we all rejoicing right along.
Great wisdom Śāriputra
now receiving the honored prophecy—

We also just like that,
we definitely gonna be buddhas too,
throughout all the worlds,
most honored, nothing above us.

The buddha-way beyond all thought,
you teach it by skillful means as needed.
Whatever merit we got,
in this life or lives gone by,

And seeing the Buddha's virtue—
we turn it all toward the buddha-way.

***

ŚĀRIPUTRA ASKS ABOUT THE DISCIPLES

Right then Śāriputra said to the Buddha:

"World-Honored One, now I got no more doubts or regrets. Right here in front of the Buddha I received that prophecy of supreme perfect enlightenment. But these twelve hundred disciples whose hearts are free—they used to be in the learning stage. You was always teaching them, saying: 'My Dharma can free you from birth, old age, sickness, and death, finally reach nirvāṇa.'

"These folks, whether they still learning or done with learning, they also thought they'd gotten free from the 'I' view and the views about existence and non-existence and such—they thought they'd reached nirvāṇa. But now, right here in front of the World-Honored One, they hearing what they never heard before, and they all falling into doubt and confusion.

"Please, World-Honored One, for the sake of these four groups, tell us the causes and reasons, so they can let go of doubt and regret."

***

THE BUDDHA BEGINS THE PARABLE

Right then the Buddha told Śāriputra:

"Didn't I already tell you? All buddhas, all World-Honored Ones, they use all kinds of causes, parables, words, and skillful means to teach the Dharma, and it's all for the sake of that supreme perfect enlightenment. Everything they teach is for transforming bodhisattvas.

"But Śāriputra, now I'm gonna use another parable to make this meaning even clearer. Folks with wisdom, they can understand through parables.

***



THE PARABLE OF THE BURNING HOUSE BEGINS

"Śāriputra, say there's a country, a town, a village somewhere. And in that place there's a great elder—old man, getting on in years, but rich beyond measure. Got fields and houses, got servants and workers. His house is big, real big, but it only got one door.

"Whole lot of people living in that house—a hundred, two hundred, maybe up to five hundred people staying there. But listen now: that house is falling apart. The halls and rooms about to collapse, the pillars rotting at the roots, the beams and rafters leaning sideways, ready to fall. The foundation crumbling, everything breaking down.

"And all of a sudden, from every direction at once—WHOOSH!—fire breaks out, burning up the whole place.

"Now that elder, he got children—maybe ten, maybe twenty, maybe even thirty children—and they all inside that house. The elder sees this great fire rising up from all four sides. He gets scared, terrified, and he thinks to himself:

"'Even though I can get myself out through this burning door safe and sound, my children—they in there in that fire house, playing games, having fun, don't notice nothing, don't know nothing, ain't scared of nothing. Fire coming right at them, pain about to cut into them, but they don't hate it, don't even think about getting out.'

***

THE FATHER'S ANGUISH

"Śāriputra, that elder started thinking:

"'I got strength in my body and my hands. I could carry them out in my robe, or I could use a table or something, get them out that way.'

"Then he thought again: 'But this house only got one door, and it's narrow too. My children are young, ain't got no sense yet. They attached to where they playing at. They might fall down, get burned up by the fire. I got to tell them about the danger, tell them this house is burning, they need to get out quick, before the fire burns them up.'

"So he made up his mind like that, and he did just what he thought. He told all his children: 'Y'all got to get out, and get out now!'

"Even though that father loved them and spoke to them with kind words, trying to teach them—them children was so caught up in their games and fun, they wouldn't believe him, wouldn't listen. They wasn't scared, wasn't frightened, didn't have no mind to leave at all. They didn't even know what fire was, what a house was, what it meant to lose something. They just kept running around playing, looking at their father now and then.

***

THE FATHER'S SKILLFUL PLAN

"Right then that elder thought:

"'This house is already burning up in this great fire. If me and my children don't get out right now, we gonna get burned up for sure. I better use some skillful means to get my children out of this danger.'

"Now that father knew what his children liked, what each one of them wanted—all kinds of precious playthings and unusual objects they'd be crazy about. So he called out to them:

"'Y'all! The kind of playthings you like, rare things, hard to find—if you don't take them now, you gonna regret it later! All kinds of toys—sheep carts, deer carts, ox carts—they right outside the door now! You can play with them! Get out of this fire house right now, quick! Whatever you want, I'm gonna give it to you!'

***

THE CHILDREN ESCAPE

"Right then, when them children heard their father talking about these precious playthings, just what they wanted, each one of them got bold and excited. They started pushing each other, competing with each other, racing and running, fighting to get out of that fire house.

"That elder, he saw his children get out safe, all of them sitting there in the open space at the crossroads, on the ground, nothing blocking them, nothing threatening them. His heart calmed down, he was happy, he was rejoicing.

"Then each of the children came to their father and said: 'Daddy, them toys you promised us—the sheep cart, the deer cart, the ox cart—please give them to us now!'

***

THE ONE GREAT CART

"Śāriputra, right then that elder gave each one of his children the same thing—one great cart. These carts was high and wide, decorated with all kinds of jewels, surrounded by railings, with bells hanging on all four sides. On top of that, they had canopies spread out, also adorned with all kinds of rare and precious jewels. Jeweled ropes crisscrossed everywhere, flower garlands hanging down, layers of soft cushions inside, and fine pillows set out.

"They was pulled by white oxen—skin bright and clean, beautiful bodies, real strong and powerful, walking smooth and steady, fast as the wind. And there was many servants attending to each cart, guarding them.

"Why did he do this? Because that great elder was rich beyond measure. All kinds of storehouses, all of them overflowing. And he thought:

"'My wealth has no limit. I shouldn't give my children these small, inferior carts. These children, they all my children, I love them all the same, no favorites. I got these seven-jewel great carts, more than I can count. I ought to give them out equal-hearted, one to each, no different, no distinction. Why? Because even if I gave these things to fill up a whole country, I still wouldn't run out. How much more for my own children!'

"Right then, each of the children got to ride in one of these great carts. They got something they never had before, something way beyond what they hoped for.

***

THE BUDDHA ASKS ŚĀRIPUTRA

"Śāriputra, what you think? Did that elder lie when he gave all his children these precious great carts equally, instead of them small carts?"

Śāriputra said: "No, World-Honored One. That elder just wanted his children to get free from the fire disaster, to keep their bodies alive—that ain't no lie. Why? Because by keeping their lives and bodies, they already got a precious toy. And even more than that, he used skillful means to pull them out of that burning house!

"World-Honored One, even if that elder didn't give them even the smallest cart, it still wouldn't be a lie. Why? Because that elder already decided in his mind: 'I'm gonna use skillful means to get my children out.' For that reason alone, it ain't no lie. How much more so when that elder knew his own wealth was beyond measure, and he wanted to benefit his children, so he gave them all the great cart equally!"

***

THE BUDDHA APPLIES THE PARABLE

The Buddha told Śāriputra:

"Good, good! Just like you said. Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is just like this too—he's the father of the whole world. As for all fear, decline, trouble, worry, suffering, the darkness of ignorance—he done exhausted all that forever, nothing left, and he's completely fulfilled with boundless knowledge and vision, power and fearlessness. He got great spiritual power and wisdom power, he's complete in skillful means and the perfection of wisdom, great compassion and great mercy. He never gets tired or lazy, always seeking good things, benefiting everybody.

"And he's born into this triple world, this old, falling-apart fire house, to save living beings from birth, old age, sickness, death, worry, grief, suffering, trouble, ignorance, darkness, and the three poisons' fire. He teaching them so they can reach that supreme perfect enlightenment.

"He sees all living beings getting burned and boiled by birth, old age, sickness, death, worry, grief, suffering, and trouble. And also because of the five desires and the desire for wealth and profit, they suffering all kinds of pain. And also because they greedy and attached, always chasing after things, they suffering in the present. And later they gonna suffer in hell, as animals, as hungry ghosts. Even if they born in heaven or among humans—the suffering of poverty and hardship, the suffering of separation from loved ones, the suffering of being with those you hate—all these kinds of suffering.

"But living beings are drowning in all this, playing around happy, not noticing, not knowing, not scared, not frightened. They don't even get sick of it, don't seek to get free. In this triple-world fire house they just running around east and west, and even though they meeting great suffering, they don't see it as a problem.

"Śāriputra, when the Buddha sees this, he thinks:

"'I'm the father of these living beings. I should pull them out of suffering and difficulty, give them the joy of that boundless, unlimited buddha-wisdom, let them find their happiness there.'

***

WHY THE BUDDHA USES SKILLFUL MEANS

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata thought again:

"'If I just use my spiritual power and wisdom power, put aside skillful means, and just praise the Tathāgata's knowledge and vision, his power and fearlessness, to all these living beings—they can't get saved that way. Why? Because these living beings ain't escaped from birth, old age, sickness, death, worry, grief, suffering, and trouble yet. They getting burned up in this triple-world fire house. How they gonna understand the Buddha's wisdom?'

"Śāriputra, just like that elder—even though he had strength in his body and hands, he didn't use it. He just used careful skillful means to save his children from that fire-house disaster. Then afterwards he gave each one a precious great cart.

"The Tathāgata is just like this too. Even though he got power and fearlessness, he don't use that. He just uses wisdom and skillful means to pull living beings out of the triple-world fire house. He teaches the three vehicles—the voice-hearer vehicle, the solitary-realizer vehicle, and the buddha vehicle.

"And he says to them: 'Y'all shouldn't enjoy staying in this triple-world fire house! Don't be greedy for these cheap and nasty forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. If you get greedy and attached and you start loving them, you gonna get burned. Get out of the triple world quick! You can attain the three vehicles—voice-hearer, solitary-realizer, and buddha vehicle. I'm guaranteeing this for you now—it ain't gonna be empty words. Y'all just need to work hard with diligence!'

"The Tathāgata uses this skillful means to encourage living beings forward. And then he says again:

"'Y'all should know—these three-vehicle teachings are all praised by the sages. They free and independent, no bondage, nothing you have to depend on or seek for. Riding these three vehicles, using the no-leak roots, powers, factors of enlightenment, the way, meditative concentrations, liberations, samādhis, and so forth—you can enjoy yourselves with these, and you'll get boundless peace, calm, and joy.'

***

THE THREE VEHICLES EXPLAINED

"Śāriputra, if there's living beings who got wisdom-nature inside them, they hear the Dharma from the Buddha World-Honored One, they believe and receive it, they work hard with diligence, they want to get out of the triple world quick and seek nirvāṇa for themselves—this is called the voice-hearer vehicle. Like them children seeking the sheep cart to get out of the fire house.

"If there's living beings who hear the Dharma from the Buddha World-Honored One, they believe and receive it, they work hard with diligence, they seeking natural wisdom, they love solitary goodness and quietness, they deeply know the causes and conditions of all teachings—this is called the solitary-realizer vehicle. Like them children seeking the deer cart to get out of the fire house.

"If there's living beings who hear the Dharma from the Buddha World-Honored One, they believe and receive it, they work hard diligently, they seeking all-knowledge, buddha-knowledge, natural knowledge, no-teacher knowledge, the Tathāgata's knowledge and vision, power and fearlessness, they feeling compassion for and wanting to bring peace and joy to boundless multitudes of living beings, benefiting heaven-folk and humans, saving and freeing everybody—this is called the great vehicle. Because bodhisattvas seek this vehicle, they called mahasattvas—'great beings.' Like them children seeking the ox cart to get out of the fire house.

***

ALL RECEIVE THE ONE VEHICLE

"Śāriputra, just like that elder—when he saw his children get out of the fire house safe, reaching that fearless place, he thought about his boundless wealth, and he gave the great cart equally to all his children.

"The Tathāgata is just like this too. He's the father of all living beings. If he sees boundless billions and thousands of living beings use the Buddha's teaching gate to get out of the triple world's suffering, its fearful and dangerous roads, and attain the joy of nirvāṇa—right then the Tathāgata thinks:

"'I got boundless, unlimited wisdom, power, fearlessness, and all the other buddha-dharma treasures. All these living beings are my children. I should give them all the great vehicle equally. I shouldn't let anyone get extinction by themselves alone. I should cause them all to reach extinction by the Tathāgata's extinction.'

"All these living beings who escape the triple world, he gives them all the buddhas' meditative concentrations, liberations, and other things to enjoy. They all one form, one kind, praised by the sages, able to produce pure, wonderful, supreme joy.

"Śāriputra, just like that elder—first he used three carts to entice his children, but then he only gave them the great cart, adorned with precious things, the safest and best. Still, that elder got no fault of lying.

"The Tathāgata is just like this too—no lying in him. First he teaches the three vehicles to guide living beings, but then he only uses the great vehicle to save and free them. Why? Because the Tathāgata has boundless wisdom, power, fearlessness, and a storehouse of all teachings. He able to give all living beings the great-vehicle Dharma. But not all of them able to receive it fully.

"Śāriputra, for this reason you should know: the buddhas, by the power of skillful means, within the one buddha-vehicle, they distinguish and teach three."

***

THE BUDDHA'S VERSE PARABLE

The Buddha, wanting to say this meaning again, spoke in verse:

Parable: there was an elder,
had one great house,
that house was old,
and falling apart besides.

The halls and rooms tottering and dangerous,
the pillar-roots broken and rotten,
the beams and rafters leaning sideways,
the foundations crumbling and destroyed.

The walls cracking and splitting,
the plaster peeling off,
the roof-thatch falling down scattered,
the rafters coming loose and dropping.

Fences bending crooked all around,
filth and nastiness everywhere.
Five hundred people
living in that place.

Kites, owls, hawks, and vultures,
crows, magpies, doves, and pigeons,
vipers, poisonous snakes and scorpions,
centipedes and millipedes,

Geckos and crawling things,
weasels, badgers, and mice,
all kinds of evil creatures
running crisscross everywhere.

Places stinking with shit and piss,
unclean things overflowing,
dung beetles and other bugs
gathering on top of it all.

Foxes, wolves, and jackals
chewing and trampling around,
gnawing on dead bodies,
bones and flesh scattered all over.

And because of that, packs of dogs
competing to come snatch and grab,
hungry, skinny, desperate, and scared,
everywhere looking for food.

Fighting and snarling and biting,
growling and howling and barking—
that house a terrifying place,
changed into something like this.

Everywhere there was
demons and evil spirits,
yakshas and wicked ghosts
eating human flesh.

Poisonous creatures of all kinds,
all kinds of evil birds and beasts,
hatching eggs and giving birth,
each one hiding and protecting their own.

Yakshas competing to come
fighting to snatch them and eat them.
After eating their fill,
their wicked hearts getting even fiercer.

The sound of their fighting
terrible and frightening.
Kumbhanda demons
squatting on the dirt mounds,

Sometimes rising off the ground
one foot, two feet,
wandering back and forth,
playing around wild and free.

Grabbing dogs by both legs,
beating them till they lose their voice,
putting their feet on the dogs' necks,
scaring the dogs for their own fun.

And there was other ghosts too,
their bodies tall and big,
naked, black, and skinny,
always living right there,

Making terrible evil sounds,
yelling out, crying for food.
And there was other ghosts
with throats like needles.

And there was other ghosts
with heads like ox heads,
some eating human flesh,
some also eating dogs,

Their hair all tangled up,
cruel and dangerous and mean,
pressed by hunger and thirst,
yelling and screaming and running around.

Yakshas and hungry ghosts
and all kinds of evil birds and beasts,
desperately hungry, looking in all directions,
peeping through the windows.

All these kinds of troubles,
fear beyond measure.
This old, falling-apart house
belonged to one person.

That person went out not long ago,
just a little while,
and then behind him in that house
suddenly a fire broke out.

All four sides at once,
the flames blazing together.
The beams, rafters, pillars, and posts
exploding and cracking with sounds,

Breaking and falling down,
the walls collapsing.
All them ghosts and spirits
raising their voices in great screams.

The hawks, vultures, all the birds,
the kumbhanda demons and the rest,
running around frantic and scared,
not able to get themselves out.

Evil beasts and poisonous bugs
hiding and running into holes.
Pishacha demons
also living right there—

Because of their thin merit and virtue,
pressed by the fire,
they hurting each other,
drinking blood and eating flesh.

The jackals and such
already dead before,
and all the big evil beasts
competing to come eat them.

Stinking smoke and flames
filling up and choking all four sides.
Centipedes and millipedes,
poisonous snakes and all that kind,

Burned by the fire,
fighting to run out of their holes.
Kumbhanda demons
following right behind to catch and eat them.

And all them hungry ghosts,
heads burning with fire,
oppressed by hunger, thirst, and heat,
running around confused and frantic.

That house was like this—
terribly frightening.
Poison, harm, fire, disaster,
many troubles, not just one.

Right then the master of that house
standing outside the gate,
he heard somebody say:
"All your children—

They was playing around before,
and they came into this house.
They young and don't know nothing,
happy and enjoying and attached to playing."

When the elder heard that,
shocked, he ran into the fire house,
planning to rescue and save them,
keep them from getting burned and harmed.

He warned all his children,
told them about all the troubles:
evil ghosts, poisonous bugs,
the disaster-fire spreading everywhere,

All kinds of suffering one after another,
continuing without stopping.
Poisonous snakes and vipers,
and all them yakshas,

Kumbhanda demons,
jackals, foxes, and dogs,
hawks, vultures, kites, and owls,
centipedes and all the rest,

Pressed by hunger and thirst,
terrible and frightening.
"This is a place of suffering and trouble—
how much worse now with this great fire!"

But them children didn't know no better.
Even though they heard their father teaching,
they still kept on being attached and playful,
wouldn't stop their games.

Right then that elder
thought to himself:
"My children are like this,
adding to my grief and worry.

Right now this house
ain't got one thing to enjoy in it,
but all these children
are soaked in their games,

Won't accept my teaching,
gonna be harmed by this fire."
Right away he started thinking,
setting up skillful means.

He told all his children:
"I got all kinds
of precious toys,
wonderful jeweled fine carts—

Sheep carts and deer carts
and great ox carts,
right now outside the door.
Y'all come on out!

I made these carts for you,
whatever you like,
you can use them to play around with."

When the children heard him describe
all these kinds of carts,
right away they started competing,
racing and running out,

Getting to the open ground,
away from all that suffering and trouble.
When the elder saw his children
get out of the fire house,

All sitting at the crossroads,
he sat on a lion seat
and said to himself with celebration:
"Now I'm truly happy!

These children of mine,
they was so hard to raise up.
Foolish, small, didn't know nothing,
and they went into that dangerous house—

So many poisonous bugs,
demons frightening and terrible.
That fierce blazing great fire
rising up on all four sides—

But these children
was attached to their games.
Now I done rescued them,
made them escape the disaster.

That's why, all you people,
now I'm truly happy."

Right then, all the children,
knowing their father was sitting there safe,

All went to where their father was
and said to their father:
"Please give us
the three kinds of jeweled carts,

Just like you promised before.
When us children came out,
you said you'd give three carts,
whatever we wanted.

Now is the right time—
please give them to us."

The elder was greatly rich,
his storehouses many,
gold, silver, lapis lazuli,
mother-of-pearl, agate.
With all kinds of precious things
he built great carts,

Adorned and decorated beautifully,
surrounded by railings all around,
bells hanging on all four sides,
gold ropes crisscrossed.

Nets of real pearls
spread and set up on top,
golden flowers and garlands
hanging down everywhere,

All colors decorating it,
wrapping all around.
Soft silk fabrics
for cushions and seats.

Fine cloth of the highest quality,
worth thousands of billions,
bright white and pure and clean,
spread on top.

There was great white oxen,
fat, strong, and powerful,
beautiful in form and body,
pulling the jeweled carts.

Many attendant servants
guarding and serving them.
With these wonderful carts
he gave equally to all his children.

The children at that time
were filled with joy and happiness.
Riding these jeweled carts,
traveling in all four directions,

Playing around, happy and joyful,
free and without hindrance.

THE BUDDHA EXPLAINS TO ŚĀRIPUTRA

I'm telling you, Śāriputra,
I'm just like this too—
among all the sages, the most honored,
the father of the world.

All living beings
are my children.
They deeply attached to worldly pleasures,
they ain't got no wise heart.

The triple world ain't safe—
it's just like a fire house.
Suffering filling it up,
terrible and frightening.

Always there's birth, old age,
sickness, death, and worry—
fires like these
blazing fierce and never stopping.

The Tathāgata already left
the triple-world fire house,
dwelling quiet and leisurely,
peaceful in the forest wilds.

Now this triple world—
all of it is mine.
The living beings in it
all are my children.

But right now this place
is full of troubles and difficulties.
Only I, one person,
can be their rescue and protection.

Even though I teach and instruct them,
they won't believe and receive it.
They deeply soaked
in desires and attachments.

So using skillful means
I teach the three vehicles,
causing all living beings
to know the triple world's suffering.

I reveal and demonstrate and teach
the path out of the world.
If these children
their hearts get determined,

Complete the three clear knowledges
and the six spiritual powers,
some attaining solitary-realization,
some becoming non-retreating bodhisattvas—

You, Śāriputra,
I, for the sake of living beings,
using this parable,
teach the one buddha-vehicle.

If y'all can
believe and receive these words,
all of you will
accomplish and attain the buddha-way.

This vehicle is subtle and wonderful,
pure and supreme.
Throughout all the worlds
there's nothing above it.

What the Buddha delights in—
all living beings
ought to praise it,
make offerings to it, bow to it.

Boundless billions and thousands
of powers and liberations,
meditative concentration and wisdom,
and all the other buddha-dharmas—

Attaining a vehicle like this,
it lets all the children
day and night through the ages
always get to play around,

Together with all the bodhisattvas
and the voice-hearer assembly,
riding this jeweled vehicle,
going straight to the place of the Way.

For this reason,
even if you search the ten directions,
there ain't no other vehicle—
except the Buddha's skillful means.

I'm telling you, Śāriputra,
all y'all people
are all my children,
and I am the father.

For age after age after age
y'all been burned by all kinds of suffering.
I done pulled and rescued all of you,
made you get out of the triple world.

Even though I said before
that y'all reached extinction,
you only exhausted birth and death—
you didn't really reach extinction.

What you should do now
is only buddha-wisdom.
If there's bodhisattvas
in this assembly here

Who can single-heartedly listen
to the buddhas' real teaching—
even though the buddhas, the World-Honored Ones,
use skillful means,

The living beings they transform
are all really bodhisattvas.

***

THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS AS SKILLFUL MEANS

If there's people with small wisdom,
deeply attached to love and desire,
for folks like these
I teach about the truth of suffering.

Living beings' hearts rejoice,
they get what they never had.
The Buddha's teaching on the truth of suffering—
real and true, no different.

If there's living beings
who don't know the root of suffering,
deeply attached to suffering's cause,
can't let go even for a moment—

For folks like these
I teach the Way by skillful means.
The cause of all suffering—
greed and desire is the root.

If you extinguish greed and desire,
it's got nothing to depend on.
Extinguishing all suffering—
that's called the third truth.

For the sake of the extinction truth
you practice the Way.
Getting free from all suffering's bonds—
that's called attaining liberation.

But these people, where exactly
did they attain liberation?
They only got free from false ideas—
that's called liberation.

But they ain't really attained
complete liberation yet.
The Buddha says these people
ain't really reached extinction,

Because these folks ain't attained
the unsurpassed Way yet.
It ain't my intention
to let them reach extinction.

I'm the Dharma King,
sovereign over the Dharma.
I appear in the world
to bring peace and calm to living beings.

You, Śāriputra,
this Dharma seal of mine—
because I want to benefit
the world, I teach it.

Wherever you traveling around,
don't carelessly transmit it.
If there's people who hear it
and rejoice and accept it reverently,

You should know these people
won't backslide no more.
If there's people who believe and receive
this sutra teaching,

These people already, in the past,
seen buddhas gone by,
shown respect and made offerings,
and also heard this teaching.

If there's people who can
believe what you teaching,
then they seeing me,
and they also seeing you

And the community of monks
and all the bodhisattvas.
This Lotus Sutra
is taught for folks with deep wisdom.

Shallow understanding folks hear it,
they get confused and lost, don't get it.
All the voice-hearers
and the solitary-realizers—

For this sutra
their power ain't up to it.
Even you, Śāriputra,
for this sutra

You got in by faith,
how much more the other voice-hearers.
The other voice-hearers—
it's because they trust the Buddha's words

That they go along with this sutra,
not because of their own wisdom-portion.

***

WARNING ABOUT WHO SHOULD HEAR THIS TEACHING

And also, Śāriputra,
to people who prideful and lazy,
who hold views about a self—
don't teach this sutra.

Common foolish people,
shallow in understanding,
deeply attached to the five desires—
hearing it, they can't understand it.
Don't teach it to them neither.

If people don't believe,
slander this sutra,
then they cutting off
all the buddha-seeds in the world.

Or if they frown,
full of doubt and confusion—
you should listen now,
I'll tell you these people's karmic result.

Whether the Buddha's in the world
or after he gone to extinction,
if there's someone who slanders
a sutra like this,

Or if they see someone reading, reciting,
writing, or holding this sutra,
and they look down on them, hate them, are jealous,
hold grudges in their hearts—

The karmic result these people get,
you listen now:
When these people die,
they gonna enter Avici Hell,

Stay there a whole age.
When the age ends, they born again.
Like this, turning over and over,
for numberless ages.

When they come out of hell,
they gonna fall into the animal realm—
maybe as dogs or jackals,
their bodies skinny and scraggly,

Dark, with sores and scabs,
kicked around by people.
And also they gonna be
despised and hated by folks,

Always suffering from hunger and thirst,
their bones and flesh dried up and withered.
While alive they beaten and hurt,
when they dead they covered with rocks and tiles.

Because they cut off the buddha-seed,
they receive this karmic result.
If they become camels,
or born among donkeys,

Their bodies always carrying heavy loads,
beaten with sticks and whips.
They only thinking about water and grass,
don't know nothing else.

Because they slandered this sutra,
they receive punishment like this.
Some become jackals
coming into the villages,

Their bodies covered with sores and scabs,
missing an eye besides.
They get beat and hit
by all the children,

Suffering all kinds of pain,
sometimes beaten to death.
After dying there,
they receive a python's body,

Their form long and huge,
five hundred miles long,
deaf, stupid, without legs,
slithering along on their belly.

All kinds of small bugs
biting and eating them.
Day and night suffering,
no rest, no pause.

Because they slandered this sutra
they receive punishment like this.
If they get to become human,
all their senses dark and dull—

Short, ugly, crippled, lame,
blind, deaf, hunchbacked.
Whatever they try to say,
people don't believe them.

Their breath always stinking,
possessed by ghosts and demons.
Poor and low-class,
used and bossed around by people,

Sickly and skinny and weak,
nobody to depend on.
Even if they get close to people,
people pay them no mind.

If they manage to gain something,
they immediately forget and lose it.
If they study medicine
and follow the prescriptions to treat sickness,

They only make the other person's sickness worse,
or even cause them to die.
If they get sick themselves,
nobody there to heal them.

Even if they take good medicine,
it only makes it worse.
If other people rebel,
rob, steal, and plunder,

Sins like these
they get blamed for by mistake.

Sinful people like this
never get to see the Buddha,
the king of all the sages,
teaching the Dharma and transforming beings.

Sinful people like this
always born in difficult situations,
crazy, deaf, mind all confused,
never hearing the Dharma.

For numberless ages,
many as the sands of the Ganges,
whenever they born they deaf and mute,
their senses incomplete.

They always dwelling in the hells
like strolling through a pleasure garden.
In other evil paths
like in their own house.

Camels, donkeys, pigs, and dogs—
that's where they walking around.
Because they slandered this sutra
they receive punishment like this.

If they get to become human,
deaf, blind, mute,
poor, with every kind of decline—
that's what they wear as their decoration.

Swelling, dry-sickness,
scabs, sores, and tumors—
diseases like these
are like their clothes.

Their body always stinking,
dirty and filthy and unclean.
Deeply attached to the view of self,
their anger increasing more and more.

Sexual desire blazing fierce—
they don't even care if it's animals.
Because they slandered this sutra
they receive punishment like this.

I'm telling you, Śāriputra,
if I was to tell all the punishments
of people who slander this sutra,
I couldn't finish even in a whole age.

For this reason
I'm telling you now:
Among people without wisdom,
don't teach this sutra.

***

WHO SHOULD RECEIVE THIS TEACHING

But if there's people with sharp faculties,
wisdom clear and bright,
much learning, strong memory,
seeking the buddha-way—

People like these,
you can teach it to them.
If there's people who already saw
billions and hundreds of thousands of buddhas,

Planted all kinds of good roots,
their deep mind firm and solid—
people like these,
you can teach it to them.

If there's people diligent,
always cultivating compassion,
not sparing their body or life—
you can teach it to them.

If there's people respectful,
without any other-mind,
separated from all common fools,
dwelling alone in mountains and marshes—

People like these,
you can teach it to them.
And also, Śāriputra,
if you see somebody

Who left bad friends behind,
got close to good companions—
people like these,
you can teach it to them.

If you see a buddha's child
holding the precepts pure and clean,
bright and clear like a precious pearl,
seeking the Mahayana sutras—

People like these,
you can teach it to them.
If there's people without anger,
honest, straightforward, and gentle,

Always feeling compassion for everyone,
respectful toward all buddhas—
people like these,
you can teach it to them.

And there's also buddha's children
in the great assembly
who, with a pure and clean heart,
using all kinds of causes,

Parables and words,
teach the Dharma without hindrance—
people like these,
you can teach it to them.

If there's monks
seeking for complete wisdom,
searching in all four directions for the Dharma,
palms together, receiving it reverently,

Only delighting in receiving and holding
Mahayana sutras,
not even receiving
a single verse of other sutras—

People like these,
you can teach it to them.
Like a person single-mindedly
seeking the Buddha's relics,

Seeking sutras like that,
and when they get them, receiving them reverently—
that person ain't gonna
seek after other sutras no more,

And they never even thought about
the scriptures of outside paths—
people like these,
you can teach it to them.

I'm telling you, Śāriputra,
if I was to describe the characteristics
of people seeking the buddha-way,
I couldn't finish even in a whole age.

People such as these,
they able to believe and understand.
You should teach them
the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra.

END OF CHAPTER THREE: THE PARABLE


════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EDITOR'S NOTE ON THIS SAMPLE:

CHAPTER TWO: "THE LOVING TRICKS"
This chapter establishes the Buddha's core teaching about Skillful Means (Upaya)—
the idea that the Buddha teaches different things to different people according
to their capacity to understand. The traditional metaphor is a burning house.

CHAPTER THREE: "THE PARABLE"
This is the famous Burning House parable itself. A wealthy person has a house
on fire with children playing inside. The house is about to collapse, but the
children won't leave to play with toys. The rich person offers them three
types of carts (representing three spiritual vehicles) to entice them out. But
in the end, everyone gets the same magnificent cart (representing the one true
vehicle to enlightenment).

THEOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
This parable teaches the Lotus Sutra's revolutionary message: there is one 
ultimate enlightenment available to all beings. The Buddha teaches different
paths according to people's understanding, but all paths lead to the same goal.
Women, animals, demons, everyone—all have Buddha-nature and can achieve
enlightenment.

TRANSLATION NOTES:
Notice how the blues language conveys spiritual urgency ("burning house") while
maintaining technical Buddhist precision. The repetition in verse (after prose
teaching) is traditional to sutra transmission—it's not redundancy but deepening.

The gender-inclusive language ("brothers and sisters") appears naturally in
verses where it makes the universal teaching truly universal.
