STATUS: CONSISTENT (All 28 chapters follow this pattern)


================================================================================
SECTION 2: SUBTITLE PATTERNS (After Primary Header)
================================================================================

PATTERN 1: Attribution/Source Line (Various formats)
Some chapters include a line indicating source or translation origin.

Examples of subtitle line 2:

Chapter 1 (Line 292):     "A Blues Translation from the Classical Chinese"
Chapter 2 (Line 982):     "Blues Translation from Classical Chinese by Kumārajīva"
Chapter 3 (Line 1933):    "(Blues Translation from Classical Chinese)"
Chapter 5 (Line 4068):    "A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese"
Chapter 7 (Line 4841):    "A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese"

STATUS: INCONSISTENT
  - Chapter 1: Descriptive subtitle
  - Chapter 2: Includes translator name (Kumārajīva)
  - Chapter 3: Has parentheses around attribution
  - Chapter 4: MISSING (no subtitle line)
  - Chapter 5: Full attribution with source text
  - Chapter 6: MISSING (no subtitle line)
  - Chapter 7: Full attribution with source text
  - Chapters 8+: MISSING (no attribution subtitles)

RECOMMENDATION: Standardize to either:
  Option A: Remove all attribution lines (most consistent with final chapters)
  Option B: Add "A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese" after each chapter header
  Option C: Use consistent format (no parentheses, consistent phrasing)


PATTERN 2: Descriptive Subtitle in Parentheses or without
Some chapters add descriptive subtitles.

Examples:
  Line 3235: (The Burning House)                             [Chapter 3]
  Line 3473: The Parable of the Prodigal Son - A Blues Story of Coming Home  [Chapter 4]
  Line 4471: (When the Teacher Calls Out Who You're Gonna Be) [Chapter 6]

STATUS: INCONSISTENT
  - Chapters with descriptive subtitles: 3, 4, 6
  - Chapters without: 1, 2, 5, 7, and all others (8-28)
  - Formatting varies: parentheses vs. no parentheses, dashes, etc.

RECOMMENDATION: Either standardize with/without descriptive subtitles, or ensure consistency of format where used.


================================================================================
SECTION 3: SEPARATOR LINES (Before/After Headers)
================================================================================

PATTERN: Three-hyphen separator line
Format: "---" (exactly three hyphens)

Location patterns:
  - Chapter 1: Line 294 (after header, before content start)
  - Chapter 2: Not present near opening
  - Chapter 3: Line 1935 (has "***" instead - see inconsistency)
  - Chapter 4: No separator before header; line 4042 (after closing, before notes)
  - Chapter 5: Line 4070 (after subtitle, before content)
  - Chapter 7: Line 4844 (after subtitle, before content)
  - Chapters 8+: No separators near opening headers

Separator variation:
  - "---" (three hyphens) - most common
  - "***" (three asterisks) - used in Chapter 3 at line 1935, and scattered throughout Chapter 3's verse sections

STATUS: INCONSISTENT
  - Chapters 1, 5, 7: Have separator after opening header
  - Chapter 3: Uses "***" instead of "---" at line 1935
  - Chapters 2, 4, 6, 8+: Inconsistent or missing separators
  - No clear pattern for separator placement

RECOMMENDATION: Standardize separator usage:
  Option A: Use "---" consistently after every chapter header
  Option B: Remove all separators for consistency
  Option C: Define clear rule (separator after header AND subtitle, or neither)


================================================================================
SECTION 4: CHAPTER ENDING PATTERNS
================================================================================

PATTERN 1: "END OF CHAPTER" Line (All chapters)
Format: "END OF CHAPTER [NUMBER]: [TITLE]"

Variations exist in title inclusion:

Full Title Included (line shows chapter name):
  Line  957: END OF CHAPTER ONE: THE OPENING
  Line 1905: END OF CHAPTER TWO: THE LOVING TRICKS
  Line 4039: END OF CHAPTER FOUR: FAITH AND UNDERSTANDING
  Line 5663: END OF CHAPTER SEVEN: THE PHANTOM CITY BLUES
  Line 9284: END OF CHAPTER SIXTEEN: HOW LONG THE TATHAGATA'S BEEN ALIVE
  Line 9769: END OF CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: COUNTING UP THE GRACE
  Line 12499: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE: MEDICINE KING BODHISATTVA - THE STORY OF HOW HE GAVE IT ALL
  Line 14270: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN: THE BEAUTIFUL KING AND HIS GOOD FRIENDS
  Line 14467: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT: UNIVERSAL WORTHY COMES TO ENCOURAGE YOU

Title Omitted (just chapter number):
  Line 3230: END OF CHAPTER THREE
  Line 4424: END OF CHAPTER FIVE
  Line 4812: END OF CHAPTER SIX: THE NAMING  [INCONSISTENT - has title]
  Line 6021: END OF CHAPTER EIGHT
  Line 6213: END OF CHAPTER NINE
  Line 6555: END OF CHAPTER TEN
  Line 6997: END OF CHAPTER ELEVEN
  Line 7305: END OF CHAPTER TWELVE
  Line 7620: END OF CHAPTER THIRTEEN
  Line 8273: END OF CHAPTER FOURTEEN
  Line 8803: END OF CHAPTER FIFTEEN
  Line 10207: END OF CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
  Line 10959: END OF CHAPTER NINETEEN
  Line 11173: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY
  Line 11559: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
  Line 11914: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
  Line 12910: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
  Line 13463: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
  Line 13903: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX

STATUS: INCONSISTENT
  - Approximately 9 chapters include the full title after "END OF CHAPTER [NUMBER]:"
  - Approximately 18 chapters omit the title
  - One example (Chapter 6 at line 4812) includes title when most nearby chapters don't

RECOMMENDATION: Standardize to one format:
  Option A: Include full chapter title for all (consistent with Chapter 1, 2 pattern): 
    "END OF CHAPTER X: [FULL TITLE]"
  Option B: Omit title for all (more concise):
    "END OF CHAPTER X"


================================================================================
SECTION 5: TRANSLATION NOTES HEADER
================================================================================

PATTERN: "TRANSLATION NOTES:" header appearing after each chapter

Location:
  - Consistently appears 2-3 lines after "END OF CHAPTER" marker
  - Always formatted as: "TRANSLATION NOTES:" (all caps, colon)
  - Always standalone on its own line

STATUS: CONSISTENT
  All 28 chapters have TRANSLATION NOTES: header following the chapter conclusion

Note: Some line counts show apparent overlap due to line numbering ambiguities.
The actual line positions are:
  Line  959: TRANSLATION NOTES: [Chapter 1]
  Line 1908: TRANSLATION NOTES: [Chapter 2]
  Line 3232: TRANSLATION NOTES: [Chapter 3]
  Line 4044: TRANSLATION NOTES: [Chapter 4]
  Line 4427: TRANSLATION NOTES: [Chapter 5]
  Line 4817: TRANSLATION NOTES: [Chapter 6]
  Line 5668: TRANSLATION NOTES: [Chapter 7]
  [And so on through Chapter 28]


================================================================================
SECTION 6: LOWERCASE CHAPTER HEADERS (Anomaly in Chapters 3-6)
================================================================================

UNUSUAL PATTERN: Some chapters have BOTH uppercase header AND lowercase header

Occurrences:
  Chapter 3:
    Line 1932: CHAPTER THREE: THE PARABLE (uppercase - primary header)
    Line 3234: Chapter 3: (lowercase - appears AFTER translation notes begin)
    Line 3235: (The Burning House) (subtitle for lowercase version)

  Chapter 4:
    Line 3471: CHAPTER FOUR: FAITH AND UNDERSTANDING (uppercase - primary header)
    Line 4046: Chapter 4: (lowercase - appears AFTER translation notes begin)

  Chapter 5:
    Line 4067: CHAPTER FIVE: THE PARABLE OF THE MEDICINAL HERBS (uppercase)
    Line 4429: Chapter 5 (lowercase - appears AFTER translation notes begin)

  Chapter 6:
    Line 4470: CHAPTER SIX: THE NAMING (uppercase)
    Line 4819: Chapter 6 (lowercase - appears AFTER translation notes begin)

  Chapters 25-26 (Separate Issue):
    Line 13069: CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE: THE ONE WHO HEARS THE WORLD CRYING (uppercase)
    Line 14048: Chapter 25 (Avalokiteshvara): Compassion RESPONDS to suffering. (lowercase - in a different section)
    Line 14049: Chapter 26 (Dharani): Protection PREVENTS suffering.

STATUS: HIGHLY INCONSISTENT
  - These lowercase headers appear to be part of TRANSLATION NOTES section, not chapter headers
  - They may be intended as reference headings for the notes section
  - They appear out of order (Chapter 3 closing is at line 3230, but lowercase header at 3234)
  - Chapters 25-26 have a different format altogether with parenthetical identifiers

RECOMMENDATION: Clarify purpose and standardization:
  Option A: Remove all lowercase "Chapter X:" headers
  Option B: If they serve a purpose, document their intent clearly
  Option C: Move them to consistent positions within the TRANSLATION NOTES section
  Option D: For Chapters 25-26, align formatting with Chapters 3-6 approach

Pattern Analysis:
  - Chapters WITH title (9 total): 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 16, 17, 23, 27, 28 = inconsistent
  - Chapters WITHOUT title (18 total): 3, 5, 8-15, 18-22, 24-26


================================================================================
IDENTIFIED INCONSISTENCIES WITH SPECIFIC LINE NUMBERS
================================================================================

INCONSISTENCY #1: Subtitle Attribution Lines (Chapters 1-7)
  Issue: Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 have attribution subtitles; Chapters 4, 6 don't
  Fixed in: Chapter 4 line 3472 onwards; Chapter 6 onwards
  Action needed:
    - Remove or standardize all attribution subtitles (Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5, 7)
    - OR add attribution to Chapters 4, 6, and all others

INCONSISTENCY #2: Separator Lines (Various)
  Issue: "---" or "***" appear inconsistently
  Specific issues:
    Line 1935: Chapter 3 uses "***" (three asterisks) instead of "---"
    Lines 1935-2312: Chapter 3 has multiple "***" separators in verse sections
    Line 4070: Chapter 5 has "---" separator after subtitle
    Line 4844: Chapter 7 has "---" separator after subtitle
    Other chapters: Lack consistent separator patterns
  
INCONSISTENCY #3: Duplicate/Lowercase Chapter Headers (Chapters 3-6)
  Issue: Chapters have BOTH uppercase and lowercase headers
  Specific line numbers:
    Line 3230: END OF CHAPTER THREE
    Line 3232: TRANSLATION NOTES:
    Line 3234: Chapter 3:  [<-- This appears AFTER chapter ends and notes begin]
    Line 3235: (The Burning House)
    
    Line 4039: END OF CHAPTER FOUR
    Line 4042: (separator)
    Line 4044: TRANSLATION NOTES:
    Line 4046: Chapter 4:  [<-- AFTER TRANSLATION NOTES header]
  
  This pattern repeats for Chapters 5-6, and uniquely for Chapters 25-26

INCONSISTENCY #4: Chapter Closing Format (Title Inclusion)
  Issue: Some "END OF CHAPTER X" lines include title, others don't
  9 chapters have title (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 16, 17, 23, 27, 28)
  18 chapters omit title (3, 5, 8-15, 18-22, 24-26)
  Pattern: Random/inconsistent; no clear rule observed

INCONSISTENCY #5: Chapter 25-26 Special Format
  Lines 14048-14049: Different format than other chapters
    Line 14048: Chapter 25 (Avalokiteshvara): Compassion RESPONDS to suffering.
    Line 14049: Chapter 26 (Dharani): Protection PREVENTS suffering.
  These appear to be descriptive comparison lines, not standard headers
  Location: Unusual placement at line 14048-14049 (mixed with narrative text)
  Additional anomaly: Line 13909-13911 contain discussion of Chapters 25-26 in narrative form

INCONSISTENCY #6: Missing Chapter 28 TRANSLATION NOTES
  Line 14467: END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT: UNIVERSAL WORTHY COMES TO ENCOURAGE YOU
  No TRANSLATION NOTES: header appears to follow (file ends or notes in different location)


================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STANDARDIZATION
================================================================================

PRIORITY 1: CHAPTER OPENING HEADER (Already Consistent)
  Current: All 28 chapters follow "CHAPTER [NUMBER]: [TITLE]"
  Recommendation: MAINTAIN - This is working well
  Action: No changes needed

PRIORITY 2: SUBTITLE/ATTRIBUTION LINES (Inconsistent - Chapters 1-7)
  Current: Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 have; Chapters 4, 6, 8-28 don't
  Recommendation: REMOVE ALL for consistency
  Rationale: Final 22 chapters have none; simpler, cleaner look
  Lines to remove:
    Line 292: "A Blues Translation from the Classical Chinese"
    Line 982: "Blues Translation from Classical Chinese by Kumārajīva"
    Line 1933: "(Blues Translation from Classical Chinese)"
    Line 4068: "A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese"
    Line 4841: "A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese"
  Alternative: Add identical attribution to all chapters if attribution is important
    Suggested format: "A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese"

PRIORITY 3: SEPARATOR LINES (Inconsistent - Multiple chapters)
  Current: "---" appears after some headers; "***" in Chapter 3
  Recommendation: REMOVE ALL or standardize placement
  Option A (Recommended): Remove all separator lines for clean look
    Lines to remove: 294, 1935, 4070, 4844, and others
  Option B: Add "---" after every chapter header
    Would require adding ~24 separator lines
  Specific fixes:
    Line 1935: Change "***" to "---" OR remove
    Lines scattered through Chapter 3 verse: Keep or remove based on overall strategy

PRIORITY 4: LOWERCASE CHAPTER HEADERS (Anomalous - Chapters 3-6, 25-26)
  Current: Appears AFTER TRANSLATION NOTES header
  Status: Unclear purpose; appears to be artifact or formatting error
  Recommendation: REMOVE all lowercase headers
  Specific lines to remove:
    Line 3234-3235: Chapter 3 lowercase header with subtitle
    Line 4046: Chapter 4 lowercase header
    Line 4429: Chapter 5 lowercase header
    Line 4819: Chapter 6 lowercase header
    Line 14048-14049: Chapter 25-26 special format (also review context)
  Alternative: If these serve a purpose, clarify and standardize location/format

PRIORITY 5: CHAPTER CLOSING FORMAT (Title Inclusion - Inconsistent)
  Current: 9 chapters have title; 18 don't
  Recommendation: STANDARDIZE to one format
  Option A (Recommended): Include title for ALL chapters
    Pattern: "END OF CHAPTER [NUMBER]: [TITLE]"
    Would match Chapter 1, 2 pattern (consistent with opening header)
    Requires adding titles to 18 chapters (3, 5, 8-15, 18-22, 24-26)
  
  Option B: Remove title from ALL chapters
    Pattern: "END OF CHAPTER [NUMBER]"
    More concise; would require removing titles from 9 chapters
    Loses parallel structure with opening header
  
  Specific lines needing standardization:
    ADD TITLE (if Option A):
      Line 3230: "END OF CHAPTER THREE: THE PARABLE"
      Line 4424: "END OF CHAPTER FIVE: THE PARABLE OF THE MEDICINAL HERBS"
      Line 6021: "END OF CHAPTER EIGHT: WHEN THE FIVE HUNDRED FINALLY HEARD..."
      [And 15 more...]
    
    OR REMOVE TITLE (if Option B):
      Line 957: "END OF CHAPTER ONE"
      Line 1905: "END OF CHAPTER TWO"
      Line 4039: "END OF CHAPTER FOUR"
      [And 6 more...]

PRIORITY 6: TRANSLATION NOTES HEADER (Already Consistent)
  Current: All chapters have "TRANSLATION NOTES:" header
  Recommendation: MAINTAIN - This is working well
  Action: No changes needed

PRIORITY 7: CHAPTER 28 - VERIFY TRANSLATION NOTES LOCATION
  Current: Last chapter may be missing TRANSLATION NOTES
  Line 14467: "END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT: UNIVERSAL WORTHY COMES TO ENCOURAGE YOU"
  Action: Check if TRANSLATION NOTES follows; add if missing


================================================================================
RECOMMENDED STANDARD FORMAT (Consolidated)
================================================================================

3. SEPARATOR LINES:
   - OPTION A (Recommended): OMIT all "---" separators
   - OPTION B (Alternative): Add "---" consistently before content start

4. CHAPTER CLOSING:
   - Format: "END OF CHAPTER [NUMBER]: [TITLE]"
   - Include chapter title (parallel to opening header)
   - Match title exactly with opening header

5. TRANSLATION NOTES:
   - Format: "TRANSLATION NOTES:" (all caps, colon, standalone line)
   - Placement: Always 2 blank lines after END OF CHAPTER marker

6. LOWERCASE HEADERS:
   - OMIT entirely (remove lines 3234, 4046, 4429, 4819, 14048-14049)


================================================================================
ACTION PLAN FOR FIXING INCONSISTENCIES
================================================================================

PHASE 1: Remove Anomalous Elements (Simplify)
  1. Remove all attribution subtitles:
     - Line 292: DELETE
     - Line 982: DELETE  
     - Line 1933: DELETE
     - Line 4068: DELETE
     - Line 4841: DELETE
  
  2. Remove all lowercase chapter headers:
     - Line 3234-3235: DELETE "Chapter 3:" and "(The Burning House)"
     - Line 4046: DELETE "Chapter 4:"
     - Line 4429: DELETE "Chapter 5"
     - Line 4819: DELETE "Chapter 6"
     - Line 14048-14049: DELETE or clarify context

  3. Replace "***" with "---" or remove (Chapter 3):
     - Line 1935: CHANGE "***" to "---" OR DELETE
     - Lines 1947-2314: Review other "***" instances in Chapter 3 verses

  4. Remove inconsistent separator lines:
     - Lines 294, 4070, 4844: DELETE (or add to all chapters)

PHASE 2: Standardize Chapter Closings (Ensure Consistency)
  Option A (Recommended): Add titles to all "END OF CHAPTER" lines
    Edit lines: 3230, 4424, 6021, 6213, 6555, 6997, 7305, 7620, 8273, 8803,
               10207, 10959, 11173, 11559, 11914, 12910, 13463, 13903
    
    Examples of changes:
      Old: "END OF CHAPTER THREE"
      New: "END OF CHAPTER THREE: THE PARABLE"
      
      Old: "END OF CHAPTER EIGHT"
      New: "END OF CHAPTER EIGHT: WHEN THE FIVE HUNDRED FINALLY HEARD THEIR NAMES CALLED"

  Option B (Alternative): Remove titles from all "END OF CHAPTER" lines
    Edit lines: 957, 1905, 4039, 4812, 5663, 9284, 9769, 12499, 14270, 14467

PHASE 3: Verify Chapter 28
  Confirm Chapter 28 has complete TRANSLATION NOTES section
  Line 14467: Verify next lines include proper TRANSLATION NOTES

PHASE 4: Final Review
  After making changes, run grep to verify:
  - All 28 chapters have matching opening/closing titles
  - No duplicate lowercase headers remain
  - All attribution subtitles are uniform (or removed)
  - All separator lines follow one standard pattern


================================================================================
DETAILED LINE-BY-LINE FIXES REQUIRED
================================================================================

[See Phase 1-3 above for specific line numbers and actions]

TOTAL LINES TO MODIFY: ~45-50 lines
  - Remove: ~12 lines (subtitles, lowercase headers)
  - Modify: ~18 lines (add missing titles to closings OR remove existing titles)
  - Standardize: ~5 lines (separator formatting)
  - Verify: 1 chapter (Chapter 28 TRANSLATION NOTES)
