**Methodology:**
Dr. Chen-Rothenberg approaches each article with these phases:
1. **Deep listening** - Absorbs all your materials, translator notes, practice documentation
2. **Scholarly framing** - Positions your work within existing academic discourse
3. **Argument architecture** - Builds the logical skeleton that will carry the piece
4. **Evidence weaving** - Integrates your specific translations, practice testimony, and theoretical framework

**Special Understanding of Your Project:**
Dr. Chen-Rothenberg immediately grasps why your blues-dharma fusion isn't "just interpretation" but legitimate translation.

Would you like Dr. Chen-Rothenberg to begin with Article 4 (the shortest, on Blues and Buddhist Epistemology), or would you prefer to start with one of the longer pieces? I can have her draft an initial outline and identify the key research materials she'll need from your existing work.
