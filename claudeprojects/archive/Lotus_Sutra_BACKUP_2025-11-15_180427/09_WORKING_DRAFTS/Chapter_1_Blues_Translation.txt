CHAPTER ONE: THE GATHERING
(How the Whole Thing Got Started)

Listen now, I'm gonna tell you what I heard with my own ears. One time—and you know when that time was—the Teacher was staying up on Vulture Peak Mountain, just outside the city walls of Rājagṛha, the King's House city. And Lord have mercy, he wasn't alone. No sir, he had twelve thousand monks gathered round him, and these weren't just any kind of folks stumbling down the road. These were the ones who'd made it through, you hear me? The ones who'd wrung out all that poison from their hearts, who'd quit wrestling with their troubles, who'd found what they needed to find and cut loose from everything that was holding them back. Their minds? Free as birds on the morning wind.

Now let me name some names, 'cause these folks are worth knowing: There was Ājñātakauṇḍinya—first one to understand what the Teacher was saying way back when. There was Mahākāśyapa and his brothers Uruvilvākāśyapa, Gayākāśyapa, and Nadīkāśyapa. There was Śāriputra, sharp as a tack, and Mahāmaudgalyāyana, who could move through this world and the next like wind through wheat. There was Mahākātyāyana, Aniruddha, Kapphiṇa, Gavāṃpati, Revata, Pilindavatsa, Bakkula, Mahākauṣṭhila, both the Nandas—Nanda and Sundarananda—and Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra who could preach up a storm. There was Subhūti who knew emptiness like the back of his hand, and Ānanda who remembered every word the Teacher ever spoke, and Rāhula, the Teacher's own son. These were the heavyweights, the ones everybody'd heard about.

But that ain't all, no sir. There were two thousand more—some still learning the ropes, some already past learning. There was Mahāprajāpatī, the Teacher's aunt who raised him up, and she had six thousand nuns with her. And there was Yaśodharā, the mother of Rāhula, the Teacher's former wife, and she had her own people too.

And then—now you better hold onto your hat—there were eighty thousand Bodhisattvas. Now a Bodhisattva, that's somebody who ain't just walking the road for themselves. They're walking it for everybody, you understand? And these eighty thousand, they weren't turning back for nothing. They were set on that supreme awakening like a river flowing to the sea, and nothing gonna stop a river from reaching home.

These folks had the power of memory that could hold the whole ocean of truth. They could speak smooth as honey about the deepest things, and they'd turned the wheel of teaching that ain't never gonna roll backwards. They'd stood in the presence of more Buddhas than you could count if you counted for a thousand years, and in front of every one of them they'd planted seeds of goodness. Every Buddha that ever was had something good to say about them. They'd cultivated compassion the way a farmer cultivates his field—with patience, with attention, with love. They'd walked right into the Buddha's wisdom like walking into your own house. They'd penetrated the great knowing-understanding, and they'd crossed over to the far shore where suffering can't reach. Their names rang out through more worlds than you can imagine, and they could set free hundreds of thousands of people just by being who they were.

Let me name some of these folks too: There was Mañjuśrī, sweet as glory and sharp as a sword. There was Avalokiteśvara, who looks down on this suffering world with eyes of mercy. There was Great Strength, who carries mighty power, and Always Striving, who never quits trying, and Never Puts Down the Burden, who won't rest till the work is done. There was Jewel-in-Hand with treasures in his palms, and Medicine King who knows how to heal what hurts, and Gift Hero, brave as a lion. There was Jewel Moon and Moon Light—shining in the darkness—and Full Moon, complete and whole. There was Great Strider and Endless Strider—the ones who take great steps and never-ending steps. There was Strider Through Three Worlds who walks through hell, earth, and heaven, and Good Protector who watches over all, and Maitreya who's coming to teach us later on. There was Jewel Mine, treasury of gems, and Good Caravan Leader who guides folks home. Eighty thousand Bodhisattvas like these, all sitting there together.

Now listen to who else was there, 'cause this gathering was like nothing you ever seen. Śakra, the king of the gods, he was there with twenty thousand of his divine sons. There was Pure Moon, clear as moonlight, and Beautiful Voice with his sweet sound, and Jewel Canopy with his umbrella of protection, and the Four Great Kings who guard the four directions, and they had ten thousand celestial sons with them. There was the Lord God and the Great Lord God with thirty thousand more. The Great Brahmā who lords over this whole suffering world, he was there with Topknot Great Brahma and Light Excellence Great Brahma, and they brought twelve thousand celestial sons.

And the dragons came—eight dragon kings with their people, hundreds of thousands of them: Nanda and Upananda, Sāgara from the ocean deeps, Vāsukin and Takṣaka, Anavatapta from the lake that knows no heat, Manasvin and Utpalaka. Each one brought several hundred thousand followers.

And the Kiṃnaras came—the music-makers, four kings of them: the Kiṃnara King Dharma, Kiṃnara King Good Dharma, Kiṃnara King Great Dharma, and Kiṃnara King Dharma Upholder. Each one with several hundred thousand people.

And the Gandharvas came—the celestial musicians, four kings: Delightful and Delightful Voice, Sweet and Sweet Voice—all beautiful names for beautiful singers, each with several hundred thousand in their retinue.

And the Asuras came—the jealous ones, the fighters, four kings of them: Balin and Rough Shoulder, Vemacitra and Rāhu the eclipse-maker. Each one with several hundred thousand followers.

And the Garuḍas came—the great golden birds, four kings: Great Radiance burning bright, Great Body huge as a mountain, Great Fullness complete in every way, and Delightful One beautiful to see. Each one with several hundred thousand in their company.

And King Ajātaśatru was there too—son of Queen Vaidehī, the king who'd done his own father wrong but found his way back to the path. He came with several hundred thousand people.

Every single one of them bowed down low at the Teacher's feet—put their heads right down to the dust where his feet had been—and then they went and sat down to one side.

Now here's where it gets good. The Teacher was sitting there surrounded by that whole assembly—monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, all gathered round him. They'd been honoring him, respecting him, making offerings, praising him, and he'd been teaching them a Great Vehicle sutra called the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings. This was teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by all the Buddhas—the kind of teaching that's been kept and protected through all time.

When he finished preaching that sutra, the Teacher sat down in the full lotus posture—you know, cross-legged with both feet up—and he entered into a samādhi, a deep meditation called the Abode of Immeasurable Meanings. His body went still. His mind went still. Not a tremor, not a flicker.

And then, Lord have mercy, the heavens opened up and flowers started raining down. Mandārava flowers, great mandārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, great mañjūṣaka flowers—just falling and falling, scattering all over the Teacher and that whole assembly. And the entire Buddha-world? It shook. It trembled six different ways. The ground beneath them was moving like the earth itself was rejoicing.

Now everybody there—the monks, the nuns, the lay folks, the gods, the dragons, the spirits, the musicians, the fighters, the birds, the music-makers, the great serpents, humans and non-humans, lesser kings and great wheel-turning kings—everybody in that whole assembly experienced something they ain't never experienced before. Joy rose up in their hearts. They put their palms together in respect. And they fixed their eyes on the Teacher and didn't look away.

Then the Teacher, right there in his meditation, sent a beam of light out from between his eyebrows—from that little white curl of hair right there in the center of his forehead. And that light? It illuminated eighteen thousand worlds to the east. Didn't miss a single one. That light went down to the lowest hells where suffering burns hottest, and it went up to the highest heaven where the greatest gods dwell. And from where they were sitting, they could see the beings in all six realms of existence in all those lands—every single one of them visible, clear as day.

They could see the Buddhas living in those lands right now, teaching and walking and being. They could hear the sutras those Buddhas were preaching, the Dharma they were expounding. They could see the monks and nuns and laymen and laywomen who'd cultivated the practice and found the Way. They could see the Bodhisattvas walking their path through all kinds of circumstances, all kinds of faith and understanding, appearing in all kinds of forms. They could see Buddhas entering their final nirvāṇa—their last passing from this world. And after those Buddhas passed, they could see stūpas made of seven kinds of precious materials being built to hold their relics, their śarīra—the sacred remains.

Now the Bodhisattva Maitreya—the one who's gonna be the next Buddha when his time comes—he looked at all this and thought to himself: "Why is the Teacher showing us this? What's the cause and condition for this auspicious sign? The Teacher's entered into samādhi, into deep meditation, and these inconceivable, rare things are happening. Who can I ask about this? Who can answer?"

Then he thought some more and said to himself: "Now Mañjuśrī, that prince of the Dharma, he's been around. He's attended on and made offerings to countless Buddhas in the past. Surely he must've seen this kind of rare sign before. I'm gonna ask him."

And at that same time, the monks and nuns and lay folks and all the gods and dragons and spirits—they were all thinking the same thing: "This Buddha-light, this spiritual power—who should we ask about it?"

So the Bodhisattva Maitreya, wanting to clear up his own doubt and seeing what was on everybody's mind, he turned to Mañjuśrī and said: "What's the cause and condition for this auspicious spiritual sign? Why is the Teacher sending out this great light that's illuminating eighteen thousand lands to the east, showing us all the adornments of those Buddha-lands in perfect detail?"

Then the Bodhisattva Maitreya, wanting to say it again in verse—you know, the way you say important things in song so they stick in the memory—he spoke like this:

"Mañjuśrī, my brother, my friend,
Why does our Guide and Teacher send
This light out from between his brows,
Shining bright as morning's vows?

"Flowers raining from the sky,
Mandārava floating by,
Mañjūṣaka falling down,
Sandalwood breezes all around,
Making every heart glad—
This is the best we ever had.

"What caused the earth to get adorned?
Why did this whole world get reborn,
Shaking in six different ways?
What's the meaning of these days?

"Look at us—the whole assembly,
Everybody here presently,
All rejoicing, filled with joy,
Bodies and minds like girls and boys
Experiencing something new,
Something we ain't never knew.

"That light between his eyebrows there,
Shining through the eastern air—
Eighteen thousand lands I see,
All turned golden, clear to me.

"From the deepest hell of pain
Up to where the highest reign,
In all those worlds scattered far,
I can see just where they are—
Beings in the six paths walking,
Suffering and struggling and talking.

"I can see where birth and death keep leading,
Where their karma—good and bad—keeps feeding
Into beautiful results or ugly,
Everything from lovely to homely—
All of it visible, all of it clear,
Everything is showing here.

"And I see the Buddhas too,
Those sage lords—I'm telling you,
Lions roaring without fear,
Preaching sutras for all to hear,
Teaching so subtle and supreme,
More wonderful than any dream.

"Their voices pure and clean,
Sending out the gentlest tone I ever seen,
Teaching Bodhisattvas by the thousand,
Countless myriads—more than can be reckoned.

"Those Brahman voices deep and fine,
Making people's ears just shine
With the pleasure of that sound—
In each world, Dharma going round,
The correct teaching being spread.

"Through all kinds of stories said,
With parables past counting,
Teaching that keeps mounting
Till it lights up Buddha-Dharma bright,
Waking beings to the light.

"If people meet with suffering's weight,
Tired of sickness, old age, and fate,
Weary of dying, weary of birth,
For them they preach nirvāṇa's worth—
The ending of all suffering's load,
The finish of that hard, hard road.

"If people got some merit stored,
Made offerings to Buddha-lord,
And they aspire to the supreme way,
For them pratyekabuddhas hold sway—
Teaching the solitary path,
The understanding after math
Of seeing how cause and effect link,
Teaching them how to think.

"If there's Buddha-sons around
Cultivating on holy ground,
Practicing in various ways,
Seeking wisdom all their days,
For them they preach the pure, clean path,
The Bodhisattva way and aftermath.

"Mañjuśrī! Sitting here,
I see and hear both far and near—
These things and thousands of billions more,
So many I can't keep the score.

"They're so numerous, I'll speak brief:
I see in those lands beyond belief
Bodhisattvas like Ganges' sands,
Seeking Buddha-Way in all those lands,
Working through all kinds of cause and condition.

"Some practicing the giving tradition—
Gold and silver, coral bright,
Pearls and māṇi jewels shining white,
Giant clam shells, agate stone,
Diamonds and treasures they own,
Servants and carriages fine,
Jeweled palanquins in a line,
Sedan chairs decorated sweet—
Joyfully giving, making the gift complete,
Dedicating it toward the Buddha-Way,
Hoping to attain that vehicle one day—
The supreme one in all three realms,
Praised by Buddhas at their helms.

"Or there's Bodhisattvas giving away
Teams of jeweled carriages on display,
With railings and canopies made just right,
All adorned and shining bright.

"I also see Bodhisattvas there
Giving their body's flesh without care—
Hands and feet they give away,
Even wives and children—can you say?—
All to seek that supreme path.

"I also see Bodhisattvas in the aftermath
Joyfully giving heads and eyes and all,
Their bodies given at wisdom's call,
Seeking Buddha-wisdom's treasure.

"Mañjuśrī! Beyond all measure
I see kings of various lands
Going where the Buddha stands,
Asking about the supreme road,
Then abandoning their royal abode—
Delightful lands and palace halls,
Consorts and comfort within those walls—
Shaving their hair and beards clean,
Putting on the Dharma robe's sheen,
Donning the teaching's cloth.

"Or I see Bodhisattvas, nothing loth,
Becoming monks who dwell alone,
In quietude they make their home,
Delighting in reciting sutras day and night.

"I also see Bodhisattvas burning bright,
Vigorously advancing with energy strong,
Entering deep into mountains long,
Contemplating Buddha-Way's meaning.

"I also see those who are leaning
Away from desire, renouncing it all,
Always dwelling where emptiness calls,
Deeply cultivating dhyāna's concentration,
Attaining the five spiritual powers' station.

"I also see Bodhisattvas at peace,
Meditating, palms joined, released,
With thousands upon myriads of verses flowing,
Praising the Dharma Kings, their praises growing.

"I again see Bodhisattvas there
Whose wisdom runs deep, whose resolve is rare,
Able to question all the Buddhas,
Hearing and holding every sutra,
Remembering and upholding every bit.

"I also see Buddha-sons who sit
Perfected in concentration and wisdom both,
Who through immeasurable parables—nothing loth—
Expound the Dharma for the crowd,
Teaching joyfully, preaching loud,
Transforming all the Bodhisattvas round,
Defeating Māra's hosts with Dharma's sound,
Beating the Dharma drum's beat.

"I also see Bodhisattvas sweet
In silent tranquility, serene,
Though gods and dragons make a scene,
Honoring and respecting their way,
They take no joy in that display.

"I also see Bodhisattvas dwelling
In forest homes, light from them swelling,
Relieving the suffering of hell's fire,
Lifting beings higher and higher
Into the Buddha-Way's embrace.

"I also see Buddha-sons in that place
Who have never slept a wink,
Walking through forests, on the brink,
Diligently seeking Buddha's road.

"I also see those who bear the load
Of perfect precepts, flawless in their way,
Deportment pure as gems on display,
Pure as precious stones that shine,
Seeking Buddha-Way's design.

"I also see Buddha-sons who found
The power of patience, standing their ground—
When arrogant people came around
Cursing, reviling, beating them down,
They were able to endure it all,
Never stumbling, never to fall,
Seeking Buddha-Way through patience.

"I also see Bodhisattvas stationed
Far from frivolous laughter's call,
Away from foolish companions and all,
Drawing near to those who are wise,
Single-mindedly letting confusion die,
Gathering their thoughts in mountain forests deep
For myriads of thousands of years, they keep
Seeking the Buddha-Way without turning back.

"Or I see Bodhisattvas who don't lack
For anything to offer and give—
Choice foods and beverages while they live,
Hundreds of medicinal remedies fine,
Offered to Buddha and Saṃgha's shrine.

"Fine robes and garments of quality high,
Worth thousands of myriads—my oh my,
Or priceless robes beyond all measure,
Offered to Buddha and Saṃgha's treasure.

"Thousands of myriads of billions of kinds
Of sandalwood houses, treasure designs,
Marvelous beds and bedding made right,
Offered to Buddha and Saṃgha's light.

"Clean gardens and forests where
Flowers and fruits flourish everywhere,
Flowing springs and bathing pools so clear,
Offered to Buddha and Saṃgha here.

"Giving like this of various things,
Wondrous offerings the heart brings,
With joy and without getting tired,
Seeking that supreme way they desired.

"Or there's Bodhisattvas preaching away
The Dharma of tranquil extinction's day,
Teaching and instructing in various manners
Countless multitudes under Dharma's banners.

"Or I see Bodhisattvas contemplating deep
The nature of all dharmas—they keep
Seeing there ain't no duality there,
All things empty like the air,
Like space itself, nothing to hold.

"I also see Buddha-sons, truth be told,
Whose minds don't cling to anything at all,
Who through this wondrous wisdom's call
Seek that supreme Way without attachment.

"Mañjuśrī! In this exactment
I also see Bodhisattvas who,
After Buddha's final nirvāṇa's due,
Make offerings to his śarīra—
Those sacred relics held so dear.

"I also see Buddha-sons constructing high
Stūpas and shrines that reach the sky,
Numerous as Ganges' sands spread out,
Adorning all those lands about.

"Jeweled stūpas lofty, wondrous, tall—
Five thousand yojanas they stand in all,
Their length and breadth exactly same,
Two thousand yojanas—what a frame!

"Each stūpa and each shrine they raise
Has a thousand banners on display,
With pearl-woven canopies and curtains hung,
And precious bells harmoniously rung,
Chiming in the breeze so sweet.

"Gods and dragons, spirits meet,
Humans and non-humans from every place,
With incense, flowers, music's grace,
Constantly making offerings there,
Constantly showing that they care.

"Mañjuśrī! My brother, my friend!
These Buddha-sons without end,
To make offerings to śarīra's worth,
They adorn stūpas all across the earth,
Causing those lands naturally
To become extraordinarily
Wondrous and beautiful to see,
Like heavenly jeweled trees set free,
Opening their flowers wide.

"The Buddha emitted one light—can't hide!
And I and this whole assembly here
See those lands both far and near,
All their various wondrous things,
Everything that vision brings.

"The Buddhas' spiritual powers run deep,
Their wisdom's rare—we can't help but weep
With joy to see one pure light sent
Illuminating immeasurable lands where it went.

"We, seeing all of this tonight,
Attain what we ain't never attained—no right
To such a vision ever before.
Son of Buddha, Mañjuśrī—we implore,
We pray you'll resolve this assembly's doubt.

"The fourfold assembly's looking about,
Gazing at you and gazing at me,
Wondering why—what could it be?—
Why has the World-Honored One, our Teacher,
Emitted this light, this wondrous feature?

"Son of Buddha, answer now,
Resolve our doubts, teach us how
To understand this sign of grace.
What benefit comes to this place?
What purpose does this light display?

"The Dharma that the Buddha found that day
When he sat at enlightenment's tree—
Does he wish to expound it? We wanna see.
Or is he about to bestow predictions
About who'll reach awakening's restrictions?

"The manifestation of those Buddha-lands,
Adorned with precious things so grand,
And the sight of those Buddhas teaching there—
This ain't no small matter, I declare!

"Mañjuśrí, you should know—
The fourfold assembly, high and low,
Dragons and spirits of every kind,
Gaze upon you with wondering mind,
Waiting for you to explain,
Waiting for your words like rain."

Now listen here, 'cause this is where Mañjuśrī starts talking. He turned to that Bodhisattva Maitreya and all those great beings, all those good people gathered there, and he said: "According to what I've been thinking, the Teacher—the World-Honored One—is getting ready to expound the great Dharma, to rain down the great Dharma rain like a thunderstorm of truth, to blow the great Dharma conch like Gabriel's horn calling all souls, to beat the great Dharma drum so everybody can hear the rhythm, to make clear the meaning of the great Dharma.

"Good people! In the presence of Buddhas in the past, I've witnessed this auspicious sign before. After emitting this light, they immediately expounded the great Dharma—the big teaching, the real thing. So you should know that now, when our Teacher manifests this light, it's the same way. He wants to cause all living beings to hear and know the Dharma that's difficult for all the world to believe—the kind of teaching that goes against the grain of how people normally think. That's why he's manifesting this auspicious sign.

"Good people! In the past—and I'm talking about immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable, uncountable kalpas ago, more time than you can imagine—there was a Buddha named Candrasūryapradīpa—Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha. Now that name means he was a light in the darkness like the moon and sun and a lamp all together. He was a Tathāgata—a Thus-Come-One—an Arhat who'd conquered all enemies, a Samyak-saṃbuddha—a Completely and Perfectly Awakened One. He was Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna—perfect in knowledge and conduct—a Sugata—one who'd gone well—a Lokavid—a knower of the world—Anuttara—unsurpassed, ain't nobody higher—Puruṣa-damya-sārathi—a tamer of people like a charioteer taming horses—Śāstā-deva-manuṣyānām—teacher of gods and humans—a Buddha, a Bhagavat—a World-Honored One, blessed and revered.

"He expounded the correct Dharma. And let me tell you, that Dharma was good in the beginning—sweet when you first taste it. It was good in the middle—sweet as you chew on it. And it was good in the end—sweet when you swallow it down and digest it. The meaning was profound as the ocean and the wording was skillful as a master craftsman. It was pure, unmixed with anything false, complete and whole, perfecting the characteristics of the pure holy life.

"For those seeking to be śrāvakas—those who wanted to be hearers, disciples—he expounded the Dharma appropriate to the Four Noble Truths. You know them truths: Life is suffering. Suffering comes from craving. There's a way to end suffering. And the path is the way. He ferried them across birth, old age, sickness, and death—all that suffering—and brought them ultimately to nirvāṇa, to the peace of extinction.

"For those seeking to be pratyekabuddhas—solitary realizers, ones who wake up by watching the way things are—he expounded the Dharma appropriate to the twelve links of dependent origination. You know, how this leads to that, and that leads to the other, and the other leads back to this in a circle of suffering.

"And for the Bodhisattvas—those seeking to wake up not just for themselves but for everybody—he expounded the Dharma appropriate to the six pāramitās, the six perfections: giving, ethical conduct, patience, energy, meditation, and wisdom. He taught them so they could attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi—that supreme perfect awakening—and perfect the wisdom that knows all modes, all the ways things are.

"Now get this: Next there was another Buddha, also named Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha. And next there was another Buddha, also named Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha. And this went on like a refrain in a song—twenty thousand Buddhas, all sharing the same single name, Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha, and all sharing the same surname, Bharadvāja.

"Maitreya, you should know that from the first Buddha to the last Buddha, all of them shared the same name, Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha, and they were all perfected in the ten epithets—all those titles I just named. The Dharma they expounded was good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end—sweet all the way through.

"Now that very last Buddha, before he left the household life to seek awakening, he had eight royal sons—eight princes. The first was named Good Mind. The second was named Good Dharma Mind. The third was named Boundless Mind. The fourth was named Jewel Mind. The fifth was named Excellent Mind. The sixth was named Doubt-Destroyer. The seventh was named Fearless Mind. And the eighth was named Dharma Mind.

"These eight princes were majestic and self-possessed—they carried themselves with dignity. Each one ruled over four continents—they were powerful kings. When these princes heard that their father had left home and attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi—that supreme perfect awakening—they all renounced their royal positions. Can you imagine? They gave up their thrones, their power, their wealth. They likewise left home, generated the intention for the Great Vehicle, and constantly cultivated the pure holy life. And all of them became Dharma teachers, having planted roots of goodness in the presence of thousands of myriads of Buddhas.

"Now at that time, the Buddha Moon-Sun-Lamp expounded a Mahāyāna sutra—a Great Vehicle teaching—entitled the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings. This was a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas—kept and protected through all time. Having concluded the exposition of this sutra, immediately before that great assembly he sat in full lotus posture and entered the samādhi of the abode of immeasurable meanings. His body went still. His mind went still. Not a tremor, not a flicker.

"And then—just like now—heavenly mandārava flowers, great mandārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, and great mañjūṣaka flowers rained down, scattering upon that Buddha and that great assembly. The entire Buddha-world quaked and trembled in six ways—just like now.

"And all in that assembly—monks and nuns and lay folks and gods and dragons and spirits and musicians and fighters and birds and serpents, humans and non-humans, lesser kings and wheel-turning sage kings—everybody experienced what they'd never experienced before. They rejoiced. They put their palms together. They single-mindedly gazed upon that Buddha—just like now.

"At that time, the Tathāgata emitted a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows, illuminating eighteen thousand Buddha-lands to the east, omitting none—just like those Buddha-lands are now seen, just like what we're seeing right now.

"Maitreya, you should know that at that time there were two billion Bodhisattvas in the assembly who delighted in hearing the Dharma. These Bodhisattvas, seeing this light universally illuminating the Buddha-lands, experienced what they'd never experienced before and wished to know the cause and condition of this light—just like we do right now.

"At that time there was a Bodhisattva named Varaprabha—Excellent Light—who had eight hundred disciples. Then the Buddha Moon-Sun-Lamp arose from samādhi, and because of the Bodhisattva Excellent Light, he expounded the Mahāyāna sutra entitled the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas.

"And get this—for sixty lesser kalpas he did not rise from his seat. Sixty kalpas! Now a kalpa is an inconceivably long time—imagine the time it would take for a piece of silk to wear away a mountain of solid rock if you brushed it across that mountain once every hundred years. That's a kalpa. And he sat there for sixty of those lesser kalpas teaching.

"And those people listening in the assembly? They also sat in one place for sixty lesser kalpas, their bodies and minds unmoving, listening to what that Buddha expounded. And each one of them regarded it as if only a mealtime had passed—like they'd just sat down for breakfast and got up when it was done. At that time, among the whole multitude, not a single person—whether in body or in mind—experienced weariness or exhaustion. That's the power of the Dharma, you hear me? That's what truth does when it really gets hold of you.

"After the Buddha Moon-Sun-Lamp had expounded this sutra for sixty lesser kalpas, he then made this proclamation before the assembly of Brahmas and Māras—the high gods and the tempters—śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas—the renunciants and the priests—gods, humans, and asuras—the jealous ones. He said: 'The Tathāgata shall enter parinirvāṇa without residue at midnight this very day.' He told them he was leaving, you understand? That his time had come.

"At that time there was a Bodhisattva named Yaśaskāma—Fame-Seeker. Now don't let that name fool you—sometimes we got to work through our faults to get to our virtues. The Buddha Moon-Sun-Lamp then conferred upon him a prediction, telling the monks: 'This Bodhisattva Fame-Seeker shall next become a Buddha named Vimalakāya—Pure Body Buddha—Tathagata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha.'

"After the Buddha bestowed this prediction—after he told what was gonna be—at midnight he entered parinirvāṇa without residue. He passed away completely, with nothing left over, like a candle burning out when the wax is all gone.

"After that Buddha's final nirvāṇa, the Bodhisattva Excellent Light upheld the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma. And for a full eighty lesser kalpas he expounded it for people. He kept that teaching alive, you hear me? He didn't let it die.

"Now those eight sons of the Buddha Moon-Sun-Lamp—those eight princes who'd given up their thrones—they all took Excellent Light as their teacher. Excellent Light taught them and transformed them, causing them to become firmly established in anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi—in that supreme perfect awakening. These princes, having made offerings to immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas, all accomplished the Buddha-Way. They all made it home.

"The last one to become Buddha was named Dīpaṃkara—Lamp-Lighter Buddha, the one who lights the way in darkness.

"Now among those eight hundred disciples, there was one person named Fame-Seeker who was greedy for gain and offerings. He was always looking for what he could get, you understand? Though he repeatedly recited numerous sutras, he did not penetrate them—the words went in his ears but didn't reach his heart. And he forgot much of what he learned. That's why his name was Fame-Seeker. He wanted the reputation of being learned without doing the hard work of understanding.

"Yet this person also, through having planted various roots of goodness—through having done good things along the way—encountered immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas, making offerings with reverence, honor, and praise. See, even when we're stumbling, even when we're chasing the wrong things, if we keep doing some good, we're still moving toward the light.

"Now Maitreya, you should know this—the Bodhisattva Excellent Light at that time, could he have been anyone else?"

And then Mañjuśrī dropped the hammer, said the words that make the whole thing clear:

"He was none other than myself. I was there. I was Excellent Light. I saw all this before.

"And the Bodhisattva Fame-Seeker, the one who was greedy and forgetful, the one who wanted reputation more than understanding—he was none other than you, Maitreya. You were there too.

"Now, witnessing this auspicious sign today is no different from before. The pattern's the same, you see? History's repeating itself in the way truth always repeats—coming round again like the verses of a song. Therefore I consider that today the Tathāgata—our Teacher, the World-Honored One—shall expound the Mahāyāna sutra entitled the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured by the Buddhas. He's gonna preach the big teaching, the one that's been kept and protected through all time."

Now at that time Mañjuśrī—wanting to say all this again before that great assembly, wanting to put it in verse so it would stick in the memory, so it would sing in the heart—he spoke like this:

"I recall ages past,
Times that were meant to last,
Immeasurable countless kalpas ago—
More time than anybody could know—
There was a Buddha, honored among people,
High as any mountain or steeple,
Named Moon-Sun-Lamp Buddha,
Couldn't be deeper, couldn't be truer.

"The World-Honored One expounded Dharma true,
Ferrying across beings not just a few—
Immeasurable beings, countless in measure,
Billions of Bodhisattvas, a treasure,
Causing them to enter Buddha-wisdom's door,
Opening their eyes to what they never saw before.

"Before that Buddha left the household life,
Before he gave up pleasure and strife,
Eight princes were born to him,
Eight royal sons on fortune's rim.
Seeing the Great Sage leave home,
They also followed, didn't want to roam
In palaces anymore—
They followed in cultivating the pure life's shore.

"At that time the Buddha expounded the Great Vehicle way,
A sutra named Immeasurable Meanings on that day.
Before the great assembly gathered round,
He extensively explained it, that profound sound,
He clarified it, made it clear.

"After the Buddha expounded this sutra here,
Immediately upon the Dharma seat where he sat,
He entered lotus samādhi—imagine that!—
Named the Abode of Immeasurable Meanings,
Deep meditation, the deepest of leanings
Into stillness, into peace.

"Heaven rained mandārava flowers without cease,
Heavenly drums spontaneously sounded their beat,
Gods and dragons, ghosts and spirits so sweet
Made offerings to the Honored One among humans there,
Scattering flowers through the air.

"All those Buddha-lands far and wide
At once greatly quaked on every side,
Trembled like the earth was dancing.
The Buddha emitted light, advancing
From between his brows so bright,
Manifesting various rare phenomena in sight.

"This light illuminated to the east,
Eighteen thousand Buddha-lands at least,
Revealing all living beings' places
Of birth-death karmic retribution's traces—
Where they'd been, where they were going,
The fruits of all their doing and their sowing.

"I saw those Buddha-lands adorned
With various precious things since they were born,
The color of lapis lazuli and crystal clear—
This was due to the Buddha's illuminating light here,
His light making everything shine.

"And I saw gods and humans in a line,
Dragons, spirits, yakṣas there,
Gandharvas and kiṃnaras everywhere,
Each making offerings to their Buddha,
Each one honoring, each one doing their duty.

"I also saw those Tathāgatas,
Those Thus-Come-Ones, those avatars,
Naturally accomplishing the Buddha-Way,
Their body color like golden mountains on display,
Supremely dignified and most wondrous to see—
Like pure lapis lazuli, perfectly free,
Containing a true golden image within,
Beauty without, beauty within—no sin.

"The World-Honored Ones, in great assemblies wide,
Expounded the profound Dharma's meaning with pride—
Not pride of ego, but pride of truth,
The confidence of wisdom, the strength of proof.

"In each of those Buddha-lands I could see
Śrāvakas beyond counting—couldn't be
Numbered or measured, so many there.
Due to the Buddha's illuminating light in the air,
That entire great assembly was visible,
Each person present, indivisible.

"Or there were monks I could see
In mountain forests, dwelling free,
Energetically upholding pure precepts day and night,
Guarding them like bright pearls shining white,
Keeping them like a mother keeps her child,
Protecting them from anything wild.

"I also saw Bodhisattvas in that place
Practicing giving, patience, and grace,
Their number like Ganges' sands so wide—
This was due to the Buddha's illuminating light as guide.

"I also saw Bodhisattvas there
Deeply entering various dhyāna concentrations with care,
Bodies and minds serene and unmoving as stone,
Thus seeking the supreme Way, all alone
In their meditation, all together in their aim.

"I also saw Bodhisattvas proclaim—
They knew the Dharma's mark of tranquil extinction,
Each in their own lands without restriction
Expounding Dharma, seeking the Buddha-Way,
Teaching the truth day after day.

"At that time the fourfold assembly all around,
Seeing the Buddha Moon-Sun-Lamp's profound
Manifestation of great spiritual powers,
All rejoiced in their hearts for hours,
Each asking one another with delight,
'What is the cause of this? Why this sight?'

"The Honored One revered by gods and humans below
Had just arisen from samādhi's flow,
And he praised the Bodhisattva Excellent Light then,
Saying to all those gathered women and men:
'You are the eye of the world, you see,
Trusted and taken refuge in, you're the key.
All take shelter in your wisdom's grace,
You're able to uphold the Dharma treasury's space.

"'The Dharma I have expounded through the years—
Only you can bear true witness without fears
To what I've taught, to what I've said.
Only you can keep it living when I'm dead.'

"The World-Honored One, having offered this praise,
Causing Excellent Light to rejoice all his days,
Expounded this Lotus Sutra then—
For a full sixty lesser kalpas, amen—
Without rising from his seat, without taking a break.

"The supreme wondrous Dharma he did make
Was completely upheld and received
By that Dharma Teacher Excellent Light who believed,
Who held every word in his heart.

"After the Buddha expounded the Lotus—every part—
Causing the assembly to rejoice with gladness,
Lifting their joy, dispelling their sadness,
On that very day, before the night fell,
He proclaimed to the assembly—and this is what he'd tell
To the assembly of gods and humans gathered there:

"'The true characteristics of all dharmas—I declare
Their meaning has already been expounded for you.
I've said what I came to say, taught what I came to do.
I now at midnight, when this day is through,
Shall enter into nirvāṇa—my time's due.

"'You must single-mindedly advance with vigor and might,
Separating from indolence, from laziness, from fright.
Keep walking the path, don't stop on the way.
Buddhas are extremely difficult to encounter, I say—
Once in billions of kalpas does a Buddha appear,
So don't waste this chance while I'm here.'

"The World-Honored One's disciples round about,
Hearing the Buddha would enter nirvāṇa without doubt,
Each harbored grief and distress in their heart:
'How quickly the Buddha will depart!
How quickly he'll be extinguished like a flame!'

"The Sage Lord, King of Dharma, without blame,
Comforted the immeasurable multitudes who cried:
'When the time of my final nirvāṇa's tide
Comes washing in, you should not worry or fear.
This Bodhisattva Fame-Seeker here
Has penetrated in his mind the true mark without outflows—
He's seen the truth, he knows what he knows.

"'He shall next become Buddha in time,
Named Pure Body Buddha, sublime,
Also ferrying across immeasurable multitudes far and wide,
Leading them to the other side.'

"That night the Buddha was extinguished,
His light went out, his teaching distinguished
From his living presence—he passed away
Like firewood exhausted and fire that won't stay
When there's nothing left to burn.

"His śarīra—those sacred relics—were divided in turn,
Distributed among the people there,
And immeasurable stūpas were built everywhere
To hold those precious remains,
To mark where his body's essence contains
Still the memory of what he was.

"Monks and nuns—and this is because
They loved him—their number like Ganges' sands,
Redoubled their energetic vigor in all lands,
Seeking the supreme Way with all their might,
Walking the path day and night.

"That Dharma Teacher Excellent Light, you see,
Upheld the Buddha's Dharma treasury—
For eighty lesser kalpas long
He extensively proclaimed the Lotus Sutra's song,
Keeping that teaching alive and bright,
Passing it on like a lamp in the night.

"Those eight princes who'd walked away
From their thrones—they came to stay
With Excellent Light, were taught and transformed.
Their minds with supreme truth were warmed.
Firm in the supreme Way they became—
They would see innumerable Buddhas, acclaim
And honor every one.

"Having made offerings when all was said and done
To all those Buddhas, following and practicing the great Way,
They successively accomplished Buddhahood one day,
Conferring predictions in turn on each other,
Each one teaching like an older brother.

"The last among those heavenly honored ones,
The final one of all those princely sons,
Was named the Buddha Lamp-Lighter,
Guide of all seers, truth's fighter,
Who liberated immeasurable multitudes from their fears,
Setting countless beings free from tears.

"That Dharma Teacher Excellent Light, you see,
At that time had one disciple in his care
Whose mind constantly harbored—I declare—
Indolence, laziness, sloth,
Greedily attached to fame and gain, nothing loth
To seek what he shouldn't seek.

"Seeking fame and gain without being meek,
Never satisfied, never getting enough,
Frequently visiting noble households and such,
Looking for honor, looking for praise.
He abandoned what he had memorized in those days,
Forgot it, couldn't penetrate what he'd learned,
The words in his memory were burned
Away by his distraction and his greed.

"Because of this cause and condition indeed,
He was called Fame-Seeker by name.
Yet he also practiced various good deeds—ain't that a shame
How we can be mixed up, good and bad together?
And he was able to see innumerable Buddhas, whether
He deserved it or not—grace upon grace.

"Making offerings to all Buddhas in every place,
Following and practicing the great Way despite his faults,
Perfecting the six pāramitās through truth's vaults,
He now sees the Lion of the Śākyas here—
Our Teacher, our Buddha, crystal clear.

"Afterward he shall become a Buddha too,
Whose name shall be Maitreya—that's you!
Widely ferrying across living beings,
Bringing them to awakening's meanings,
Their number beyond measure, beyond count.

"After that Buddha's final nirvāṇa's amount
Of time has come and gone,
The indolent one I'm speaking on—
That's you, Maitreya, don't you see?
You were Fame-Seeker, you were he.

"That Dharma Teacher Excellent Light so bright,
That shining beacon in the night,
Is now my very self—I was there.
I taught you, I showed you care.

"I witnessed the Buddha Lamp-Lighter long ago—
The original light-sign was just so,
Just like what we're seeing now.
From this I know—and I'll tell you how—
The present Buddha, our Teacher here,
Wishes to expound the Lotus Sutra, I fear—
Not fear of the truth, but holy awe
At what's about to be, what we're about to draw
From the well of wisdom deep.

"The present sign is like the original—we reap
What's been sown before.
This is the skillful means of all Buddhas' store,
The way they've always taught.

"Now the Buddha emits this light—it's not for naught.
He does it to help reveal, to make us see
The meaning of true characteristics, to set us free,
To show us how things really are.

"All people should now know, both near and far:
Join your palms single-mindedly and wait—
The Buddha shall rain down the Dharma rain, it's fate,
Satisfying all who seek the Way,
Quenching their thirst on this very day.

"Those seeking the Three Vehicles on their journey—
Whether śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, or Bodhisattva—attorney
For their own case, their own path—
If they harbor doubts or regrets in the aftermath
Of what they've heard, if they don't understand,
The Buddha shall dispel and sever them, expand
Their minds, open their eyes,
Causing all their doubts to be exhausted, to die,
Without remainder, without a trace,
Until they see truth face to face."

And that's how Chapter One ends, with Mañjuśrī saying: Get ready. The Teacher's about to preach. This light you're seeing, these signs you're witnessing—they mean the real teaching's coming, the one that's been treasured by all the Buddhas through all time. The Lotus Sutra's about to be expounded. So put your palms together, fix your mind, and listen with everything you got. 'Cause what's coming is gonna satisfy every thirsty soul, answer every honest doubt, and show you the truth that sets you free.

That's the way I heard it. That's the way it was.

- Famous Bodhisattvas: Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Maitreya
- Major Buddha names when referenced repeatedly: Dīpaṃkara
- Geographic names: Rājagṛha (with "King's House city" added for context)

- Fame-Seeker (Yaśaskāma) - reveals character flaw, essential to the story
- Pure Body Buddha (Vimalakāya) - describes purity, meaningful quality
- Lamp-Lighter Buddha (Dīpaṃkara) - when first introduced with full context

**Eight Princes - ALL TRANSLATED (clearly descriptive qualities):**

**Key principle applied:** If the name is famous in Buddhist tradition, it stays in Sanskrit. If the name is descriptive and less known, and the English helps readers understand the quality or role being conveyed, it's translated. This makes the text more accessible WHERE IT HELPS, without losing the authentic feel of the tradition.

The blues sensibility is maintained through rhythm, repetition, direct address, metaphor, and the oral tradition of verse, while the sacred meaning and narrative structure remain fully intact.
