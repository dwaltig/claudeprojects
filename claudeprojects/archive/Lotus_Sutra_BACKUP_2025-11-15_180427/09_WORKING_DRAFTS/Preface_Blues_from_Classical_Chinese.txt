HOW THIS TEACHING MADE IT TO US
A Preface on the Long Journey of the Lotus Sutra

Told by Dao Xuan, monk of Mount Zhongnan, Tang Dynasty


Now let me tell you how this teaching got here.

This Lotus Sutra - this teaching of the Wonderful Dharma - it's the reason why the Buddhas even bother coming down here in the first place. It's the heart of the matter, the real deal, the thing they came to say. This teaching was kept safe over there in India - that great land where wisdom grows - kept there for more than a thousand years before anybody ever thought to bring it east.

Three hundred some years ago, it crossed the mountains and came to China. And I'm gonna tell you how that happened, 'cause it's a story worth knowing.

First time anybody tried to put this sutra into Chinese, it was back in the Western Jin Dynasty, during Emperor Hui's Yongkang years. There was this teacher - they called him a Bodhisattva - name of Dharmarakṣa, come from Dunhuang way out west where the desert meets the mountains. He was living by the Azure Gate in Chang'an - that's the old capital, you know - and he sat down with these ancient Sanskrit texts and did his best to turn 'em into Chinese. Called his version "The Sutra of the Correct Dharma Lotus." That was the first.

Then come the Eastern Jin Dynasty, Emperor An's Longan years, over in the Later Qin kingdom during what they called the Hongshi era. There was this monk from Kucha - that's way out there on the Silk Road - name of Kumārajīva. Now Kumārajīva, he was something special. He took that same sutra and translated it fresh, and he called it "The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma." That's the one you got in your hands right now. That's the one we been reading all these years.

Later on, in the Sui Dynasty during the Renshou years, there was a third teacher - Jñānagupta from Northern India, living at the Great Xingshan Monastery. He made another translation, called it "The Wonderful Dharma" too.

So now we got three versions, three different ways of saying the same thing. They overlap here and there, they put things different ways, but they all trying to get at that same truth. And you know what? The one folks took to heart, the one that really caught on, was Kumārajīva's version - that Qin dynasty translation. That's the one we been studying, the one we been living with. (There's other pieces floating around too - chapters here, verses there - but we ain't talking about those today. That's for the history books.)


Now let me tell you why this teaching matters.

When the Holy Mountain showed its signs, when the sacred peaks started manifesting wonders, it took the Great Sage himself to open up that teaching, to crack it wide for people to see. And even then, even when he started teaching, it could only reach the folks who had the connection from way back - folks who'd known him before, in other lives, other times. That's just how karma works.

So first, at the Deer Park, when the Buddha started teaching, he had to divide things up. Some folks were ready for the small vehicle, some were ready for the great. Some needed the simple teachings to start with, some could handle the deep stuff right away. That's why there's different levels to this thing.

Then later, at the Golden River when he was about to leave this world, he had to make it clear again: some teachings are partial, some teachings are complete. Some give you a piece of the truth, some give you the whole picture. And here's the thing - it ain't about one assembly being better than another. The teaching meets people where they're at. It comes at the right time, in the right way, for the right folks.

You remember when five thousand people got up and walked out of the assembly? Folks think they was just arrogant, just full of themselves. But maybe they was supposed to leave. Maybe they needed to go deal with that pride before they could hear what was coming next. That's what I'm saying - everything happens for a reason.

And those five hundred who got their prophecies, who got told they gonna be Buddhas one day? They was all part of the secret teaching, the hidden work that's been going on all along.


That's why the Buddha put on that light show at the beginning - emitting that ray from between his eyebrows, lighting up all them worlds to the east. He was opening up the teaching, giving folks a reason to ask questions. He came out of that meditation and started talking about Buddha-wisdom, that big understanding that sees it all.

He told 'em about the burning house - how you gotta get out before the flames take you down, how you need that Great Vehicle to carry you to safety.

He told 'em about that phantom city - how sometimes you need a place to rest on the long journey, even if it ain't the final destination. How those old connections, those friendships from way back, they don't just disappear. They keep you moving forward.

He told 'em about the jewel sewn in the robe - how you been carrying the treasure all along, even when you was drunk and didn't know it. How your true nature been right there the whole time, just waiting for you to remember.

He told 'em about boring for water - how there's a hundred ways to get to that underground stream, how you can't give up just 'cause the dirt looks dry. You gotta keep digging, keep searching, 'cause the water's down there somewhere.

All these words, all these stories - they clear as day when you look at 'em, but they pointing to something far off, something you gotta travel toward. And if it wasn't for the Great Compassion - that Buddha's heart that can't stand to see folks drowning in their confusion, sinking in their suffering - none of this teaching would've come forth. If it wasn't for that ultimate compassionate heart, wanting to save folks who done lost their way, who done forgot who they really are - we wouldn't have none of this.


Now I'm gonna tell you something that'll make you sit up and pay attention.

From the Han Dynasty all the way through to right now, here in the Tang Dynasty, that's more than six hundred years. In all that time, they done translated over four thousand scrolls of Buddhist scriptures - four thousand! - brought 'em all the way from India, turned 'em all into Chinese. Libraries full of wisdom, stacks and stacks of teachings.

But you know which one folks hold onto most? You know which one they read and chant and study more than any other? This one. This Lotus Sutra right here.

Why you think that is?

Maybe it's 'cause this teaching speaks to something in folks, touches some old memory from way back. They say we was all there at the teaching of Buddha Wisdom Victory, eons and eons ago. Maybe this sutra waking up something that's been sleeping all this time.

Maybe everybody who hears this teaching and feels that deep respect, that reverence rising up in their heart - maybe they all got merit left over from King Awesome Sound of the World, from when he was teaching the Dharma long ago. Maybe they earning interest on an investment they don't even remember making.

That's why I wrote this preface right here at the start of the sutra. I'm hoping - and I'm praying - that we can get our six senses cleaned up, purified, so we can look up and see that wonderful gathering with the Compassionate Honored One. I'm hoping we can perfect them four virtues quick, so we can head on toward that Pure Land, that place where everything's clear and bright.

The praise for this teaching, it don't run out. It goes on and on, like a river that don't stop flowing. And I'm writing it down here so it can keep going, so it can be passed on to all the people who coming after us, all the generations yet to be born.

May they receive it. May they understand it. May they live it.

That's all I got to say.

TRANSLATOR'S NOTES ON THIS BLUES VERSION:

This preface by Dao Xuan (written in the Tang Dynasty, over 200 years after Kumārajīva's translation) is a beautiful meditation on transmission - how wisdom travels across time, across cultures, across languages. I've tried to preserve:

1. **The historical narrative** - The three major translations (Dharmarakṣa 286 CE, Kumārajīva 406 CE, Jñānagupta 601 CE) and why Kumārajīva's became the standard

2. **The theological reflection** - Why the Buddha taught in stages (small and great vehicles), why different assemblies received different teachings, why everything unfolds according to karmic connection

3. **The key parables** - Burning house, phantom city, jewel in the robe, boring for water - these are central metaphors from the Lotus Sutra that Dao Xuan references to show the sutra's teaching methods

4. **The mystery of transmission** - Why this particular sutra became the most beloved of all Buddhist texts in China, connecting it to ancient Buddha connections (Buddha Wisdom Victory from Chapter 7, King Awesome Sound from Chapter 23-24)

5. **The personal devotion** - Dao Xuan's hope that writing this preface creates merit for himself and others, helping all beings purify their senses and reach enlightenment

The blues vernacular here tries to capture the voice of an elder teacher telling you a story that matters - history, philosophy, and heart all wrapped up together. The "you know?" and "I'm telling you" moments create that sense of direct transmission, teacher to student, that's always been at the heart of how Buddhism travels from one person to another.
