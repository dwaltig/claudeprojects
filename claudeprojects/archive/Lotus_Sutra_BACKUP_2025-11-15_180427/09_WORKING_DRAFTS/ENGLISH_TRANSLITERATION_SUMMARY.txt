EXAMPLE BEFORE & AFTER

BEFORE (with Sanskrit diacritics):
────────────────────────────────────
[Orus]
There was Śāriputra, sharp as a razor, and Mahā-Maudgalyāyana, who could work
wonders. There was Mahā-Kātyāyana, who could preach, and Aniruddha, who could
see what others couldn't.

AFTER (English transliteration):
────────────────────────────────────
[Orus]
There was Sariputra, sharp as a razor, and Maha-Maudgalyayana, who could work
wonders. There was Maha-Katyayana, who could preach, and Aniruddha, who could
see what others couldn't.

NOTE: Voice tag and all English text remain identical. Only Sanskrit diacritics
have been removed and replaced with standard English letters.
