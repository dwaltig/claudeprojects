## DEDICATION

This work is dedicated to:

All beings seeking liberation from suffering—
In Buddhist paths and in paths yet unimagined.

that has always known how to sing truth through suffering,
to find joy despite the burning house,
and to prophesy freedom to the powerless.

To Kumārajīva (343–413 CE),
whose pioneering translation of the Lotus Sutra into living Chinese
made this lineage of democratic accessibility possible.

To all dharma teachers, past and future,
who understand that the highest teaching must reach the ordinary heart.

May all beings hear the teaching in the voice that reaches their hearts.

## TRANSLATOR'S NOTE: THE DHARMA AND THE BLUES

This translation takes Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese text of the Lotus Sutra and pours it through the blues—that great river of African American spiritual and musical expression that has always known how to carry deep wisdom in everyday language.

Some might ask: Why?

The answer is that these two great traditions, born worlds apart, share a spiritual DNA.

Both emerge from the raw, unflinching recognition of suffering. The blues is born from slavery, oppression, and the "hard road" of human trouble. Buddhism is born from the recognition of *dukkha*—the truth that this conditioned world is a "burning house." Both traditions refuse to look away.

And yet, both insist on joy despite the suffering. The blues can laugh through tears. The gospel tradition shouts for joy in the face of despair. The Lotus Sutra promises that even in the burning house, a "great cart" of inconceivable beauty is waiting for us.

### The Translation Approach

This translation is an attempt to honor that shared DNA. The blues has always carried sacred truth in the language of the people. It's a tradition that understands:

- The "loving tricks" of a compassionate father (*upāya*, or skillful means)
- The "poverty consciousness" of the prodigal son who forgot his inheritance
- The "hidden dignity" of the jewel sewn in the pauper's robe
- The "mathematics of grace" where one moment of faith outweighs eons of works
- The "prophetic faith" of "Never Looked Down," who keeps declaring "You gonna be a Buddha" even as the stones are flying

This is not a formal, academic translation. This is a translation for the heart. I kept the famous names—Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Śāriputra—and the original 28-chapter structure. But I've let abstract terms become lived experience:

- "Arhat" becomes a brother who's "made it through to the other side"
- "Nirvāṇa" becomes "that final peace beyond peace"
- "Dhāraṇī" becomes "a power to hold onto the truth no matter how hard the wind blows"

### The Verses

The verses, especially, are rendered to be felt, to be sung. They use the repetition, the rhythm, and the direct address ("Listen now," "you hear me?") of the blues sermon. Because that's what this sutra is. It's a revelation, a promise, and a call. It's the testimony that the world is on fire, and still we sing.

My hope is that this voice allows the Dharma to be heard in a new way, in the key that sang freedom in chains and prophesied justice in the dark. May all beings hear the teaching in the voice that reaches their hearts.

### Gender in This Translation

You'll notice the text maintains male characters where they're specific—the Buddha, Śāriputra, Mañjuśrī, and the other historical disciples. This is deliberate. Because this sutra's power doesn't come from pretending women were always fully centered in a male-dominated world. It comes from showing women breaking into that narrative, claiming their place, and in doing so, shattering the categories entirely.

When that dragon girl becomes a Buddha, it matters because the story up to that point has been mostly men. When Mahāprajāpatī demands recognition, it carries weight because the Buddha had to think about it. I've kept that narrative reality.

But in the universal teachings, in the addresses to all practitioners, in the parables that apply to every living being—there I've made sure the language includes everybody. The dharma doesn't have gender restrictions, so the language addressing "all beings" shouldn't either.

This is a translation that lets the Sutra's own revolution speak: first you think this is a man's world, then you discover it's not, and that discovery *is* the teaching.

## SCHOLARLY INTRODUCTION

The *Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma* (*Saddharma-puṇḍarīka-sūtra*), transmitted to the world through Kumārajīva's groundbreaking Classical Chinese translation in 406 CE, stands as one of Buddhism's most transformative and widely influential texts. Originally compiled in Sanskrit, likely during the 1st–2nd century CE, the *Lotus Sutra* emerged as a pivotal innovation in Buddhist philosophy—one that fundamentally challenged prevailing interpretations of enlightenment and democratized the promise of Buddhahood across all living beings without exception.

### The Sutra's Revolutionary Claims

The text's central revolutionary claim contradicted centuries of Buddhist interpretation: the highest spiritual attainment (Buddhahood itself) was not reserved for a select few dedicated monks or metaphysically exceptional beings, but was the ultimate destiny of every sentient creature. This radical universalism reframed the relationship between the historical Buddha and all beings, positioning him not as a distant teacher but as a compassionate father figure employing infinite skillful means (*upāya*) to guide his children toward their inherent Buddha-nature.

In East Asian Buddhist traditions, the *Lotus Sutra* achieved preeminence. It became the foundational text of Tendai Buddhism in Japan, the basis of Nichiren's sect, and a beloved scripture throughout China, Korea, and Vietnam. Its 28 chapters span cosmological narratives, doctrinal expositions, magnificent parables, and practical guides for cultivation—creating a multivalent text that has sustained centuries of interpretation and devotion.

### Translation Methodology

This blues translation represents a deliberate methodological choice: to render Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese version into the vernacular idiom of African American blues and gospel tradition. This approach honors two traditions simultaneously.

First, it recognizes Kumārajīva's own pioneering work—a Central Asian Buddhist translator who himself chose to render Sanskrit philosophy into the living language of 5th-century Chinese speakers rather than preserving untranslatable Sanskrit terminology.

Second, it acknowledges the profound theological and musical resonances between Buddhist understanding of suffering and redemption and the African American spiritual tradition born from slavery, oppression, and the persistent prophetic affirmation of human dignity and divine promise.

### Preservation and Accessibility

The translation preserves the text's essential structure (all 28 chapters) and maintains Sanskrit names with proper diacritical marks to honor the original tradition. However, it prioritizes accessibility and embodied comprehension over literal word-for-word rendition. Theological concepts become lived metaphors:

- Emptiness becomes "nothing to hold onto"
- Enlightenment becomes "waking up to who you really are"
- Nirvāṇa becomes "that final peace beyond peace"

The result is a text meant to be heard and felt—one that invites the reader into the cadences and wisdom-traditions of the blues sermon while maintaining fidelity to the *Sutra's* profound Buddhist philosophy.

### Contents of This Edition

This annotated scholarly edition includes:

- All 28 chapters of the original translation

- Comprehensive Sanskrit/Chinese term indices (250+ entries)

## READER'S INTRODUCTION: THE PARABLE AND THE PROMISE

Listen now, this is what you're holding in your hands: the *Sutra of the Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Dharma*, one of the most beloved and revolutionary texts in the world. In Asia, they call it the "King of Sutras." This is the teaching that turned everything upside down.

For centuries, many believed the highest spiritual goal was to become an Arhat—a perfect saint who escapes the cycle of suffering and enters the final peace of *nirvāṇa*. It was a hard road, and it was final.

Then, the Buddha reveals the truth at the heart of this sutra. He says that this final peace, this *nirvāṇa*, wasn't the final destination after all. It was just a "phantom city," a rest stop he created out of compassion for travelers who were too tired to keep walking.

The true destination, he says, is something bigger. It's the "one great matter" he came to reveal: **Every single living being—no exceptions—will become a Buddha.**

### The Sutra's Promise

This is the sutra's great promise. The old disciples who thought they were finished, the women who were told they couldn't, the evil-doers like Devadatta, the non-humans like the 8-year-old dragon girl—all of them, and all of us, are destined for perfect, complete enlightenment.

And let me tell you something else you need to know. This sutra's been written down by men, and mostly men talking. But pay attention when the women show up—because when they do, everything changes.

Mahāprajāpatī, the aunt who raised the Buddha when his mama died, she walks up and asks the Buddha straight out: *"Can we practice? Can we be free too?"* And the Buddha's got to stop and reckon with her. Then later, eight thousand nuns come through and get their prophecies of Buddhahood. And then—this is the thing that's gonna shake you—a dragon girl, eight years old, becomes a Buddha right there in front of everybody. Just like that. No waiting, no "you gotta come back as a man next time." The dharma don't work that way.

### The Blues and the Dharma

The blues knows this truth. Sister Rosetta Tharpe didn't wait for permission. Mahalia Jackson carried the Spirit. The mothers and grandmothers held the church together. When women move in the dharma, when women practice, when women teach—that's when you know it's real. That's the sign that this teaching ain't just for the chosen few. It's for everybody.

The dragon girl's enlightenment ain't incidental. It's the proof. It's the promise written in the flesh of a child who shouldn't be able to do it—but does.

### The Power of Parable

To explain this, the Buddha uses parables—stories that resonate with a truth deeper than philosophy. He tells of:

- A father lying to save his children from a burning house (Chapter 3)
- A rich man who finds his long-lost prodigal son and slowly gives him back his inheritance (Chapter 4)
- A man who wanders in poverty, not knowing there's a priceless jewel sewn into his robe (Chapter 8)

These are stories of "loving tricks" (*upāya*, or skillful means). They teach that the Buddha is an eternal father who, out of boundless compassion, meets us where we are, speaks our language, and uses whatever parables it takes to guide us home.

This "Blues Translation" takes that principle to heart. The blues and gospel traditions are, at their core, traditions of parable and promise. They know the burning house. They know the prodigal son. They know what it means to be a "motherless child, a long way from home" who is still promised a "home in gloryland."

### How to Approach This Text

This text was meant to be heard, to be recited, to be felt. As a musician, I invite you to read it that way. Don't get hung up on the strange names or the cosmic numbers. Listen for the music. Listen for the rhythm in the verses. Listen for the voice of the preacher, the storyteller, the father, the friend.

This isn't just a book. It's a song. It's a promise. It's the good news that no matter who you are, or where you've been, or what you've done, you are already an heir to everything.

**You just need to wake up, remember who you are, and claim your inheritance.**

## THE 28 CHAPTERS OF THE LOTUS SUTRA

### CHAPTER SUMMARIES: A GUIDE TO THE 28 CHAPTERS

**1. THE OPENING** (*Introduction*; Chinese: 序品)

The entire assembly gathers on Vulture Peak Mountain to hear the Buddha teach. Described are the twelve thousand monks, eighty thousand bodhisattvas, heavenly beings, dragons, and all manner of divine creatures. The Buddha enters profound meditation, and light radiates from his body. Mañjuśrī the Wisdom-Carrier explains to Maitreya that the Buddha is about to reveal a great teaching.

*Central theme: The universality of the gathering and the extraordinary preparation for what is about to be revealed.*

---

**2. THE LOVING TRICKS** (*Expedient Means*; Chinese: 方便品)

The Buddha begins by explaining that all Buddhas use "skillful means"—adapted teachings suited to different people's capacities. The three "vehicles" (teachings for listeners, solitary realizers, and bodhisattvas) are all actually one vehicle in disguise. The metaphor of the burning house opens: a father uses three carts (a sheep, a deer, a white ox) to entice his children out of a burning house, then gives them all a magnificent white cart instead. This teaches that the Buddha uses whatever teachings will save beings, knowing one great vehicle awaits them all.

*Central theme: The doctrine of skillful means justifies the apparent contradictions in Buddhist teachings.*

---

**3. THE PARABLE** (*A Parable*; Chinese: 譬喻品)

Śāriputra hears the opening teaching and suddenly understands that all beings will become Buddhas. The Buddha expands the burning house parable into a cosmic story: the Buddha is the father, the world is on fire (with suffering), and all the different teachings are just different carts to get beings out. A man finds a jeweled garment hidden in his robe—he had possessed it all along without knowing. All beings possess Buddha-nature; they've just forgotten.

*Central theme: The jewel represents the inherent Buddha-nature that all beings already possess.*

---

**4. FAITH AND UNDERSTANDING** (*Belief and Understanding*; Chinese: 信解品)

Four great elders—Subhūti, Mahākāśyapa, Mahā-Kātyāyana, and Mahā-Maudgalyāyana—suddenly understand. They describe their journey: thinking they'd reached the final goal (*nirvāṇa*/Arhatship), they'd stopped seeking. Now they realize that was just a resting place, and the real destination is Buddhahood for all. The Buddha grants them prophecies. The prodigal son parable: a poor man, ashamed of his poverty, rejects his wealthy father. The father patiently waits, eventually gives him small work, gradually reveals his wealth, and finally makes him heir.

*Central theme: The slow path of redemption and how the Buddha patiently guides all beings toward their true inheritance.*

---

**5. THE PARABLE OF THE MEDICINAL HERBS** (Chinese: 藥草喻品)

The Buddha explains that just as different plants receive the same rain but grow to different sizes, all beings receive the same teaching but develop according to their capacity. Different medicines heal different diseases—the teaching is adapted to what each being needs. Mahākāśyapa and the assembly receive prophecies of their future Buddhahood.

*Central theme: The universal teaching works for all, but effects vary according to individual capacity and karma.*

---

**6. THE NAMING** (*Bestowal of Prophecies*; Chinese: 授記品)

The Buddha formally predicts the future Buddhahood of 2,000 Arhat disciples. Each receives a prophecy customized to their character and spiritual achievements. The prophecies describe their Buddha-lands, their teaching styles, their names in future ages.

*Central theme: Individual prophecies show that enlightenment is guaranteed for each being in their own time and way.*

---

**7. THE PHANTOM CITY BLUES** (*A Parable of the Phantom City*; Chinese: 化城喻品)

The Buddha and a great leader of bodhisattvas discuss an extended parable: a group of people journey toward treasure across a terrible, dangerous desert. A wise guide creates a phantom city as a resting place, allowing the exhausted travelers to recover. Once recovered, the guide says, "We can continue now"—the real treasure is much greater. This phantom city is *nirvāṇa* (the traditional goal), but the real treasure is Buddhahood.

*Central theme: Even the highest traditional attainments are way-stations on the path to supreme enlightenment.*

---

**8. WHEN THE FIVE HUNDRED FINALLY HEARD THEIR NAMES CALLED** (Chinese: 五百弟子受記品)

Five hundred disciples who had previously believed they'd achieved final liberation suddenly understand they too will become Buddhas. The Buddha describes their past lives and predicts their future Buddhahood.

*Central theme: Even those who thought they'd finished their journey are promised supreme enlightenment.*

---

**9. WHEN THE FAITHFUL GET THEIR DUE** (*Prophecies for Learners and Adepts*; Chinese: 授記品)

Ānanda and Rāhula, the Buddha's cousin and son, receive prophecies. Eight thousand nuns also receive the promise of Buddhahood. The Buddha addresses the anxiety that had arisen when he promised universal enlightenment: "Don't worry—your individual path is honored."

*Central theme: Even those closest to the Buddha and those thought to be less spiritually capable all receive prophecies of Buddhahood.*

---

**10. HONOR THE WORD-CARRIERS** (*Dharma Teachers*; Chinese: 法師品)

The Buddha exalts those who teach, recite, write, and respect this *Lotus Sutra*. They become like the Buddha himself—worthy of support and honor. Five hundred bodhisattvas vow to spread the teaching.

*Central theme: Those who carry this message into the world become Buddhas.*

---

**11. WHEN THE JEWELED TOWER ROSE UP** (*The Jeweled Stupa*; Chinese: 見寶塔品)

A jeweled stupa (tower) emerges from the earth, containing the body of a Buddha from the distant past. The ancient Buddha's voice comes from the stupa, praising the *Lotus Sutra*. This demonstrates that the teaching is supported by all Buddhas throughout time and space.

*Central theme: The teaching is eternal and trans-temporal—confirmed by Buddhas across all worlds.*

---

**12. WHEN YOUR ENEMY WAS YOUR TEACHER** (*Devadatta*; Chinese: 提婆達多品)

The Buddha reveals that Devadatta, his treacherous cousin who tried to split the sangha and kill him, will ultimately become a Buddha. Even evil-doers receive prophecies of Buddhahood. A precocious eight-year-old dragon-girl instantly becomes a Buddha through the power of this teaching.

*Central theme: The most unlikely beings—enemies, non-humans—all achieve Buddhahood through understanding this sutra.*

---

**13. WHEN THE ROAD GETS ROUGH, YOU GOTTA KEEP WALKING** (*Exhortation to Maintain*; Chinese: 勸持品)

The Buddha exhorts all bodhisattvas to uphold, read, recite, teach, and protect the *Lotus Sutra*. He promises supernatural powers and protections to those who maintain this teaching against persecutions.

*Central theme: Commitment to the dharma brings protection and spiritual power despite external challenges.*

---

**14. HOW TO KEEP YOUR SOUL CLEAN WHEN THE WORLD'S GONE WRONG** (*The Peaceful Practices*; Chinese: 安樂行品)

The Buddha describes four "peaceful practices" for protecting oneself while teaching in a corrupt age: peaceful body, peaceful speech, peaceful mind, and peaceful vows. These allow dharma teachers to maintain their integrity despite hostile conditions.

*Central theme: Spiritual practice isn't about withdrawing but about wise engagement with the world.*

---

**15. WHEN THE UNDERGROUND ARMY ROSE UP** (*Springing Up from the Earth*; Chinese: 從地湧出品)

Countless bodhisattvas suddenly emerge from beneath the earth—they've been practicing in hidden Buddha-lands, preparing for this teaching. The Buddha describes bodhisattvas who will teach the *Lotus Sutra* in the future.

*Central theme: Bodhisattva practice extends throughout time and space; help comes from unexpected sources.*

---

**16. HOW LONG THE TATHĀGATA'S BEEN ALIVE** (*The Buddha's Eternity*; Chinese: 如來壽量品)

The Buddha reveals his true nature: he hasn't simply lived one lifetime (the "historical" Buddha). He's been enlightened for immeasurable eons. His appearance of birth and death is skillful means—he manifests, teaches, and appears to pass away to create urgency in beings. This is the sutra's most radical revelation: the Buddha is eternal and cosmic, not merely a historical figure.

*Central theme: The Buddha's teaching is supported by his eternal, transcendent nature across all time.*

---

**17. COUNTING UP THE GRACE** (*Distinguishing Merits*; Chinese: 分別功德品)

The sutra explains the mathematics of grace: believing in this teaching for one instant generates more merit than practicing traditional teachings for billions of lifetimes. The "mathematics of grace" is the scandal and liberation of the *Lotus Sutra*.

*Central theme: One moment of faith in the promise of universal Buddhahood outweighs eons of self-powered effort.*

---

**18. THE JOY THAT MULTIPLIES** (*The Merit of Rejoicing*; Chinese: 隨喜功德品)

Those who hear the *Lotus Sutra* and rejoice in others' practice receive immense merit. The sutra describes beings who just feel happy when they hear others are practicing—that happiness itself is transformative.

*Central theme: Joy and sympathetic celebration of dharma becomes itself a spiritual path.*

---

**19. WHEN YOUR SENSES WAKE UP** (*The Merit of the Dharma Teacher*; Chinese: 法師功德品)

The Buddha describes the supernatural powers that develop in those who teach the *Lotus Sutra*: perfect eyes that see infinitely far, perfect ears that hear infinitely far, perfect taste, touch, and mind. These aren't powers sought but natural developments of enlightened teaching.

*Central theme: Teaching the dharma transforms one's entire being into a sensor of infinite reality.*

---

**20. THE BODHISATTVA WHO NEVER LOOKED DOWN** (*Never Looked Down Bodhisattva*; Chinese: 常不輕菩薩品)

A past Buddha's lifetime: the bodhisattva "Never Looked Down" encounters people with anger and disrespect but bows to all of them, saying, "I see Buddha-nature in you—you will all become Buddhas." They beat him, curse him, throw rocks. But he keeps bowing, keeps prophesying. This is the ultimate teaching: see Buddha-nature in everyone, no matter how they treat you.

*Central theme: Radical affirmation of Buddha-potential in all beings, even enemies.*

---

**21. WHEN THE LORD SHOWED HIS HAND** (*The Buddha's Supernatural Powers*; Chinese: 如來神力品)

The Buddha employs his supernatural powers to confirm and seal the sutra teachings. Multiple Buddhas from other worlds appear, confirming that the *Lotus Sutra* is taught in all Buddha-lands.

*Central theme: The teaching is universal across all worlds and all Buddhas.*

---

**22. THE PASSING ON** (*Entrustment*; Chinese: 囑累品)

The Buddha formally entrusts the *Lotus Sutra* to bodhisattvas for transmission after his death. He gives detailed instructions on how to protect and spread the teaching.

*Central theme: The responsibility for continuing the dharma passes to all bodhisattvas.*

---

**23. MEDICINE KING BODHISATTVA** (*The Original Deeds*; Chinese: 藥王菩薩本事品)

The Buddha tells of Medicine King's past lives of devotion: saturating his body with fragrant oils and setting himself on fire for 1,200 years as an offering to an ancient Buddha. Later burning both his arms for 72,000 years. He represents ultimate sacrifice and commitment to the dharma.

*Central theme: Bodhisattva practice includes willingness to give everything for the dharma.*

---

**24. WONDERFUL SOUND BODHISATTVA** (Chinese: 妙音菩薩品)

Wonderful Sound, a bodhisattva from another world, travels to this world to hear the *Lotus Sutra* and support those who practice it. She manifests in any form needed to help beings: monk, nun, king, merchant, etc.

*Central theme: Bodhisattva compassion manifests through infinite adaptability and responsiveness.*

---

**25. THE ONE WHO HEARS THE WORLD CRYING** (*Avalokiteśvara*; Chinese: 觀世音菩薩普門品)

The most beloved chapter in East Asian Buddhism. Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, manifests in 33 different forms to save beings in peril. She responds to every cry of suffering, appearing as a Buddha, a king, a merchant, a mother—whatever form is needed.

*Central theme: Compassion responsive to need; salvation through understanding.*

---

**26. THE PROTECTION SONGS** (*Dhāraṇī*; Chinese: 陀羅尼品)

Protective incantations and mantras from various bodhisattvas and gods promise to protect those who teach the *Lotus Sutra*. Protective formulas and sacred sounds create a spiritual safety net.

*Central theme: Practice of the dharma generates protective forces in the universe.*

---

**27. THE BEAUTIFUL KING AND HIS GOOD FRIENDS** (Chinese: 妙莊嚴王本事品)

A past-life story: A king clings to false teachings while his two sons, enlightened bodhisattvas, use miraculous powers and compassionate wisdom to awaken him. His family's journey to the Buddha becomes an eternal teaching about spiritual friendship and how grace works through the people closest to us.

*Central theme: Spiritual friends are the great cause and condition for awakening; enlightened beings keep showing up in whatever form will reach us because love won't let us stay lost.*

---

**28. UNIVERSAL WORTHY COMES TO ENCOURAGE YOU** (*Bodhisattva Samantabhadra*; Chinese: 普賢菩薩勸發品)

The final chapter: Universal Worthy (Samantabhadra) bodhisattva comes on a white elephant to seal the teaching with a final promise. Those who accept this sutra will be protected, guided, and ultimately achieve Buddhahood. The teaching is sealed with Universal Worthy's vow that all beings will become Buddhas.

*Central theme: The sutra's ultimate promise—sealed by the greatest bodhisattvas—that all beings without exception will become Buddhas.*

### ESSENTIAL BUDDHIST CONCEPTS IN THE LOTUS SUTRA

**The Three Vehicles**
The Buddha teaches three different paths suited to different beings' capacities: the path of śrāvakas (hearers/disciples), the path of pratyekabuddhas (solitary realizers), and the path of bodhisattvas. The *Lotus Sutra* reveals that these three are actually one vehicle in disguise—all beings are ultimately traveling the same path to Buddhahood.

**Skillful Means (*Upāya*)**
The *Lotus Sutra's* central doctrine explaining why the Buddha teaches different things to different people. The Buddha is like a father using whatever means necessary (different carts, different teachings, different promises) to save his children. All these teachings are true within their context, but Buddhahood is the ultimate destination.

**The One Great Matter**
The Buddha's fundamental purpose in appearing in the world: to reveal to all beings their Buddha-nature and their inevitable destiny for enlightenment. This is what the *Lotus Sutra* calls the "one great matter for which the Buddha appeared."

**Buddha-Nature**
The teaching that all sentient beings possess the inherent capacity to become Buddhas. This is not reserved for monks, the righteous, or any particular group—all beings, without exception, possess Buddha-nature.

**Prophecies of Buddhahood**
Throughout the *Lotus Sutra*, the Buddha grants prophecies (*vyākaraṇa*) to his disciples, predicting their future Buddhahood. These prophecies include details about their future Buddha-lands, their teaching names, and the numbers of beings they will liberate.

**The Lotus as Metaphor**
The lotus flower, rooted in mud but producing a pure, beautiful bloom, represents the spiritual path. Beings are like lotus flowers: even those suffering in the mud of suffering can bloom into Buddhahood.

### ABOUT THE TRANSLATOR

**William Altig** is a musician, spiritual practitioner, and scholar based in Houston, Texas. He has spent over a decade studying Buddhist philosophy and African American spiritual traditions, seeking to understand the profound resonances between these two great wisdom lineages.

His interests include:
- Buddhist philosophy and practice, particularly the Mahāyāna tradition
- Blues, gospel, and African American spiritual music
- Translation theory and practice
- The intersection of spirituality and music
- Gender-inclusive approaches to sacred texts

This blues translation of the *Lotus Sutra* represents his attempt to honor both Buddhist and African American traditions by allowing them to speak to and through each other. He believes that the highest teachings must be able to reach the ordinary heart, and that sacred traditions are most alive when they speak in the language and idiom of living communities.
