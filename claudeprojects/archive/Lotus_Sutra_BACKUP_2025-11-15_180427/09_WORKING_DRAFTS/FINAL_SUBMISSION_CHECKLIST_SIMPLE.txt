texts.

Altig's work uniquely combines a scholarly understanding of Buddhist philosophy
with a profound expertise in American vernacular spiritual traditions,
particularly blues and gospel music. This synthesis has culminated in the Lotus
Sutra Trilogy in Blues, a groundbreaking translation of three core Mahayana
texts into contemporary blues language, which he has also set to music as a
'Buddhist Blues Opera.'

With a significant online following of over 2,500 listeners and a catalog of
more than 3,000 songs, Altig has cultivated a vibrant community at the
