Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Beautiful King and His Good Friends
(A Story About Love That Won't Let You Stay Lost)

---

Listen now, the Buddha stood before that great crowd and he told them straight:

"Way back, so far back you can't count it—more lifetimes ago than there are grains of sand in all the rivers that ever run—there was a Buddha named Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom, the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened One. His land was called Light-Bright-Adorned, and that age, that time, they called it the Age of Joy-Seeing.

"Now in that Buddha's teaching, there was a king. They called him Beautiful King. And his queen, she went by the name Pure Virtue. They had two boys—one named Pure Storehouse, the other called Pure Eye. And listen here, these two boys, they weren't no ordinary children. No sir. They had great spiritual power. They had merit and wisdom built up deep. They'd been walking that Bodhisattva road for a long, long time, you understand? They knew all about giving and virtue and patience and effort and meditation and wisdom. They knew about skillful means. They understood compassion and joy and equanimity—all thirty-seven paths that help you along the way, they had those down cold. They could enter all kinds of deep meditation states—the Pure Samadhi, the Sun-Star-Dwelling Samadhi, the Pure Light Samadhi, the Pure Color Samadhi, the Pure Illuminating Samadhi, the Long-Adorning Samadhi, the Great-Mighty-Virtue-Treasury Samadhi. All these deep stillnesses, they knew them through and through.

"Now that Buddha, Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom, he wanted to guide that Beautiful King onto the right path. He had compassion for all living beings, you see. So he preached this Lotus Sutra, this very teaching right here.

"And when he did, those two boys—Pure Storehouse and Pure Eye—they went to their mama. They put their palms together, fingers all joined up respectful-like, and they said: 'Mama, we wish you would go see that Buddha, Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom. We want to go with you, serve him, honor him, bow down before him. You know why? Because this Buddha, he's teaching this Lotus Sutra right now to all the heavenly beings and all the human folks. We need to hear it. We got to receive it.'

"Their mama, she looked at them boys and said: 'Your daddy, he believes in outside teachings. He's deep into that Brahmin religion, got it in his bones. Y'all need to go talk to your father, see if he'll come along with us.'

"Pure Storehouse and Pure Eye, they put their hands together again and said to their mama: 'Mama, we are sons of the Dharma King. But we been born into this house of wrong views.'

"Their mother said: 'You boys need to think about your father. You need to show him some supernatural signs, some wonders. If he can see something that shakes him, his heart might get clear. His mind might get pure. Then maybe he'll let us go to where that Buddha is.'

---

"So those two sons, thinking about their daddy, they rose up into the air. They went up high—seven palm-tree heights into the sky. And then they started showing all kinds of miraculous transformations. Up there in space, they walked and they stood and they sat and they lay down. Water poured out the top of their bodies while fire blazed from their feet. Then water poured from their feet while fire blazed from their heads. One minute they got huge, filling up the whole sky. Next minute they got tiny as a mustard seed. Then huge again. Then small. They disappeared in the air and suddenly showed up on the ground. They walked into earth like it was water. They walked on water like it was solid ground. They showed all manner of supernatural wonders like this, trying to make their father's heart clean, trying to make his mind believe.

"When that father-king saw what his sons could do, his heart filled up with joy—great joy he'd never felt before. He put his palms together toward his boys and said: 'Who is your teacher? Whose disciples are you?'

"The two sons answered: 'Great King, that Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom—right now he's sitting under the seven-jeweled enlightenment tree on the Dharma seat, and he's teaching this Lotus Sutra to all the gods and humans gathered there. He is our teacher. We are his students.'

"The father said to his sons: 'I want to see your teacher too. Let's all go together.'

"So those two boys came down from the sky and went to their mother. They put their palms together and said: 'Mama, Daddy's heart is open now. He's ready to awaken to supreme perfect enlightenment. We've done the Buddha's work for our father. Now please, Mama, let us leave home and practice the way under that Buddha.'

---

Then those two boys, wanting to say it again, spoke to their mother in verse:

Mama, please let us go,
Let us leave this home, become monks on the road,
Buddhas are hard to find, Mama, harder than you know,
We gonna follow this Buddha wherever he goes.

Like that udumbara flower—you might wait forever,
Meeting a Buddha is rarer than rare, now or never,
Getting free from suffering, that's hard too,
Mama, please let us go, let us walk this path through.

---

"Their mother said right away: 'I'll let you leave home. You know why? Because Buddhas are hard to meet, that's why.'

"Then the two boys spoke to both their parents: 'Good! Good, Father! Good, Mother! Please, let's go right now to see Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom Buddha. Let's get close to him, serve him, honor him. You know why we're saying this? Because a Buddha is hard to meet—rare as the udumbara flower that blooms once in forever. Rare as a one-eyed turtle swimming in the ocean who happens to stick his head up through the hole in a floating log. But we got deep blessings from past lives, and we been born in a time when Buddha-teaching is alive. So Father, Mother, you got to let us leave home. Why? Because Buddhas are hard to meet, and the time when they're here don't come around often.'

---

"Now at that time, Beautiful King had eighty-four thousand women in his palace, and every single one of them was ready to receive and hold this Lotus Sutra. Pure Eye Bodhisattva had long been deep in the Lotus Samadhi. Pure Storehouse Bodhisattva had, for countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of lifetimes, been deep in the Samadhi of Leaving All Evil Destinies—he wanted to help all beings escape suffering, you see. And the king's wife, Pure Virtue, she had the Samadhi Where All Buddhas Gather. She could know the secret treasuries of all the Buddhas.

"So those two sons used skillful means. They taught their father well. They made his heart believe. They made him love the Buddha's way.

"Then Beautiful King, along with all his ministers and attendants, and Pure Virtue the queen, along with all the palace women, and the king's two sons, along with forty-two thousand people—all of them together, at the same time, went to where the Buddha was. When they got there, they bowed their heads to his feet, walked around him three times to the right, then stood to one side.

---

"That Buddha preached the Dharma to the king. He showed him, taught him, benefited him, gladdened him. The king's heart filled up with joy.

"Then Beautiful King and his wife took off the pearl necklaces from around their necks—worth a hundred thousand in value—and scattered them over the Buddha. Up there in space, those necklaces turned into a four-pillared jeweled pavilion. Inside that pavilion was a great jeweled bed covered with hundreds of thousands of millions of heavenly cloths. On top of that bed sat a Buddha in full lotus position, shining great light.

"Beautiful King thought to himself: 'The Buddha's body—it's so rare, so dignified, so special. It's accomplished the most subtle and wonderful form there is.'

"Then Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom Buddha said to the four assemblies: 'Y'all see this Beautiful King standing here before me with his palms together? This king is gonna practice as a monk in my teaching. He's gonna work hard, gonna help the Buddha way. And he's gonna become a Buddha called Sal-Tree King. His land will be called Great Light, and that age will be called Great High King. That Sal-Tree King Buddha will have countless Bodhisattvas and countless disciples. His land will be level and straight. His merit will be like this.'

"Right then and there, the king handed his kingdom over to his younger brother. Then he and his wife and his two sons and all his relatives left home in the Buddha's teaching to practice the way.

"After the king left home, for eighty-four thousand years he kept at it, steady and hard, practicing this Wonderful Lotus Sutra. After that time passed, he gained the Samadhi of All Pure Merit Adornment. He rose up into space, seven palm-tree heights high, and said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, these two sons of mine have done the Buddha's work. Through supernatural transformations, they turned my wrong-headed mind around. They helped me settle down safe in the Buddha's teaching. They helped me see the World-Honored One. These two sons are my good spiritual friends. They wanted to wake up the good roots I'd planted in past lives. They wanted to benefit me. So they came and were born into my house.'

---

"Then Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Ancient-King-Flower-Wisdom Buddha said to Beautiful King: 'That's right. That's exactly right. Just like you said. When good men and good women plant good roots, life after life they meet good spiritual friends. And those good spiritual friends do the Buddha's work—they show, they teach, they benefit, they gladden, they help folks enter supreme perfect enlightenment. Great King, you need to know: good spiritual friends are the great cause, the great condition. They guide you, they help you see a Buddha, they help you awaken the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment.

"'Great King, you see these two sons of yours? These two sons have already served and honored sixty-five hundred thousand million billion nayuta Ganges-sands of Buddhas. They've been close to all those Buddhas, respectful to all those Buddhas. In all those Buddha-places, they've received and held this Lotus Sutra. They have compassion for beings trapped in wrong views. They want to help people dwell in right seeing.'

"Beautiful King came down from space and said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the Tathagata is so rare. Because of your merit and wisdom, the flesh-bump on top of your head shines bright. Your eyes are long and wide and deep blue. The mark between your eyebrows is white like the bright moon. Your teeth are white and even and always shining. Your lips are red and beautiful like the bimba fruit.'

"Then Beautiful King praised the Buddha's countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of virtues like this. Standing before the Tathagata, with his palms joined together as one, he said again: 'World-Honored One, this has never happened before. The Tathagata's teaching is complete, accomplished with inconceivable subtle and wonderful merit. The precepts and training you give—they're safe, they're peaceful, they're good. From this day forward, I will not follow my own mind's desires. I will not give birth to wrong views, arrogance, anger, or any evil thoughts.'

"When he finished saying this, he bowed to the Buddha and left.

---

The Buddha told the great assembly:

"What do y'all think? Was Beautiful King some other person? No. He is now Flower Virtue Bodhisattva right here. And Pure Virtue, his wife—she is now the Bodhisattva Light-Shining-Adornment-Mark who's here before this Buddha. Out of compassion for Beautiful King and all his relatives, she was born into that world then.

"And those two sons? They are now Medicine King Bodhisattva and Medicine Superior Bodhisattva. These two Bodhisattvas—Medicine King and Medicine Superior—have accomplished great merit like this. They have planted roots of virtue under countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas. They have accomplished inconceivable good merits.

"If anyone knows the names of these two Bodhisattvas, all the gods and humans in all the worlds should bow down to them in respect."

When the Buddha finished speaking this chapter about the past deeds of Beautiful King, eighty-four thousand people brushed off the dust, left the dirt behind, and gained the pure Dharma eye in all teachings.

TRANSLATOR'S NOTES ON THE BLUES TRANSLATION OF CHAPTER 27

**On Spiritual Friends as a Blues/Gospel Concept**

In blues and gospel tradition, there's a deep understanding that grace comes through people—through the one who won't let you stay drunk, through the grandmother who prays for you, through the friend who shows up at 3 AM when you're at the end of your rope. This chapter's teaching that "good spiritual friends are the great cause" is pure blues theology. We don't wake up alone. We wake up because somebody loved us enough to not let us sleep through our lives.

The Buddha says it straight: these spiritual friends are THE great cause and condition. Not meditation technique, not philosophical understanding, not ascetic practice—but the person who shows up for you. In gospel terms, this is the friend closer than a brother, the one who won't forsake you. In blues terms, this is the one who finds you in the juke joint and says "Baby, it's time to go home."

**On Family Relationships as the Primary Teaching Method**

What makes this chapter so tender is that these aren't distant monks or wandering holy men who come to teach. These are your sons. Your wife. Your family. The teaching comes from the most intimate place possible—from the people who love you enough to be born into your house.

This is skillful means at its most profound: to reach someone trapped in wrong views, enlightened beings are willing to become their children, to grow up in their household, to work through the bonds of love and duty and family obligation. There's no preaching from a distance here. There's the patience of growing up in a misguided household, waiting for the right moment, and then using every means available—including supernatural displays—to wake up your father.

In blues/gospel terms, this is the theology that recognizes God works through your mama, through your children, through your spouse. The sacred isn't distant. It's right there at the breakfast table, in the people who won't let you stay lost. As the old gospel song says: "It was my mother's prayers that followed me, followed me all of my days."

**On Miraculous Displays as Consciousness-Shifters**

The supernatural demonstrations in this chapter—walking on air, fire and water flowing from the body, becoming huge and tiny, walking through earth like water—aren't about intimidation or proving superiority. They're about breaking the frame of what the king thinks is possible.

When you're trapped in materialist views, in conventional understanding, sometimes only something that shatters your sense of how reality works can wake you up. These miracles are like a glass of cold water thrown in the face of someone who's sleep-walking. They're not the teaching itself—they're the alarm clock.

In blues terms, this is like the moment when you realize the song you've been singing was actually about you the whole time. It's the consciousness-shift that happens when reality reveals itself to be more fluid, more spacious, more full of possibility than you imagined. The sons don't just talk about enlightenment—they demonstrate that the laws you think are fixed aren't as solid as you believe. They're showing their father: "The world you think you know? There's so much more."

**On the Persistence of Compassion Across Lifetimes**

The Buddha reveals that these two sons have already served "sixty-five hundred thousand million billion nayuta Ganges-sands of Buddhas." They've been at this for countless lifetimes. They don't HAVE to come back. They've already completed their work. But they return because they care about beings still trapped in suffering.

This is the blues understanding that love is persistent, that grace keeps showing up. You might push it away a hundred times, but it'll knock on your door the hundred-and-first time. In gospel terms, this is "His mercy endureth forever." In blues terms, this is the lover who keeps coming back even when you've broken their heart, because they know something true about you that you've forgotten about yourself.

The chapter shows us that Bodhisattvas are willing to be born as your family members, to grow up under your misguided teaching, to wait for the right moment, to do whatever it takes to help you wake up. That's not obligation—that's love that won't quit.

**On Recognizing Your Teachers as Recognizing Grace**

The most beautiful moment in this chapter is when the king, after his awakening, says: "These two sons are my good spiritual friends. They wanted to wake up the good roots I'd planted in past lives. They wanted to benefit me. So they came and were born into my house."

This is the moment of recognition—not just recognizing that his sons are Bodhisattvas, but recognizing that grace has been present in his life all along, working through the people closest to him. This is what it means to wake up: to suddenly see that the help you needed was already there, disguised as family, as students, as friends.

In blues/gospel spirituality, this is the testimony moment. This is when you look back and say: "Lord, you were with me all along and I didn't even know it. That was you working through my grandmother. That was you speaking through my friend. That was you loving me through my children." The recognition isn't just intellectual—it's the heart breaking open with gratitude for the ways you've been carried.

**On the Rarity of True Teaching and Awakening**

The chapter uses two powerful images for how rare it is to meet authentic teaching:

1. The udumbara flower—a legendary flower that blooms once every 3,000 years
2. A one-eyed turtle swimming in the vast ocean who happens to surface with his head through the hole in a floating log

These images communicate: This doesn't happen often. Don't waste it. When you meet the real thing, recognize it.

In blues terms, this is the understanding that you might get one shot. The train comes through this station once—if you don't get on, it might not come back around. In gospel terms, this is "seek ye the Lord while he may be found." There are windows of opportunity for awakening, moments when the conditions align. The teaching is always available in one sense, but the convergence of circumstances that allows you to actually hear it and respond—that's rare.

This rarity makes the chapter's teaching about Bodhisattvas returning life after life even more poignant. They keep creating these rare conditions, keep opening these windows, because they know how precious and precarious the opportunity for awakening is.

**On How This Chapter Teaches That Enlightened Beings Keep Showing Up For Us**

The ultimate teaching of this chapter is that we're not alone in our confusion. Enlightened beings—out of compassion—take birth as our family members, show up as our friends, appear in whatever form will reach us. They're willing to wait, willing to grow up in households of wrong views, willing to use whatever skillful means necessary—miracles, family bonds, gradual teaching, direct transmission—to help us wake up.

This is radical grace. This is the Mahayana teaching that Bodhisattvas don't abandon the world but keep returning to it, keep taking form in it, keep working within it. In blues/gospel language, this is "I'll never leave you nor forsake you." This is "I'll be your shelter in the time of storm." This is the friend who sticks closer than a brother.

The chapter ends with the revelation that these figures from the distant past are actually present now: Flower Virtue Bodhisattva, Medicine King Bodhisattva, Medicine Superior Bodhisattva. The help that was given countless eons ago is the same help being given now. The Bodhisattvas who were born as the king's sons are still here, still working, still showing up in whatever form is needed.

This is the blues truth: the help you need is already on the way. It might look like your children. It might look like your spouse. It might look like that friend who won't let you give up. But it's coming. Grace keeps showing up, lifetime after lifetime, in form after form, because love won't let you stay lost.
