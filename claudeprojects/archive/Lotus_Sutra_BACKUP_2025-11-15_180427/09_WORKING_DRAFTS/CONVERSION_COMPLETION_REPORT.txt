Buddha was staying up on Vulture Peak Mountain, right outside the city
called King's House (Rajagriha). And he wasn't alone, no sir."

"There was Ajnata-Kaundinya, the first one to understand what the Buddha
was laying down. There was Mahakasyapa, that stern old man who knew how
to live with nothing... There was Sariputra, sharp as a razor, and
Maha-Maudgalyayana, who could work wonders."

SAMPLE 3 - Bodhisattva Names (Line 295):
