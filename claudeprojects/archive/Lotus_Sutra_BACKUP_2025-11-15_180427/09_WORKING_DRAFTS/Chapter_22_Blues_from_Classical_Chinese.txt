CHAPTER 22: THE PASSING ON
(Entrustment - 囑累品第二十二)

A Blues/Gospel Translation from the Classical Chinese


THE LAYING ON OF HANDS

Now you got to see this right—
The Buddha, Shakyamuni himself,
He rise up from that teaching seat,
And he show forth great spiritual power.

He reach out with his right hand,
And he touch the heads
Of them countless Bodhisattvas,
Every blessed one,
And when his hand come down on them,
He speak these words:

"I been working at this
For more ages than you can count—
Hundred thousand million billion
Uncountable ages—
Working and struggling
To get this hard-to-get thing,
This supreme perfect enlightenment.

Now I'm putting it in your hands.
I'm entrusting it to you.
You got to take this teaching,
Spread it out with one mind,
Make it grow far and wide."


THE SECOND TIME

And he do it again—
Three times he touch them heads,
Three times he lay his hand down,
Three times he speak the word:

"I been working at this
For more ages than you can count—
Hundred thousand million billion
Uncountable ages—
Working and struggling
To get this hard-to-get thing,
This supreme perfect enlightenment.

Now I'm putting it in your hands.
I'm entrusting it to you.

You got to receive it,
Hold it,
Read it,
Recite it,
Spread it abroad,
Make sure all living beings
Everywhere hear it and know it.

Why I'm telling you this?
Because the Tathagata got great compassion—
He ain't stingy,
He ain't holding back,
He ain't afraid.

He give to living beings
The Buddha's wisdom,
The Tathagata's wisdom,
The natural wisdom that come by itself.

The Tathagata—
He the great gift-giver
To all living beings.


YOUR CALLING

Now you got to follow his example,
Learn the Tathagata's way,
Don't be holding back,
Don't be stingy with what you got.

In the world that's coming,
If there be good men and good women
Who believe in the Tathagata's wisdom,
You got to preach this Lotus Teaching to them,
Make sure they hear it and know it,
So they can get the Buddha's wisdom.

But if there be living beings
Who don't believe it,
Who can't receive it—
Then you show them some other deep teaching
That the Tathagata left,
Teach them,
Guide them,
Benefit them,
Make them glad.

You do this,
You be repaying
What all the Buddhas done for you.
You be answering grace with grace."


THE TRIPLE AFFIRMATION

Now when them Bodhisattvas
Heard the Buddha say all this,
Great joy fill them up,
Joy running all through their bodies.

They bow down even deeper,
They bend low,
They drop their heads,
They put their palms together,
And they lift up their voice as one:

"As the World-Honored One command,
We will do it all—
Every bit of it.
Yes, World-Honored One!
Don't you worry none."

And them Bodhisattvas,
That great assembly,
They do it three times—
Three times they lift up their voice as one:

"As the World-Honored One command,
We will do it all—
Every bit of it.
Yes, World-Honored One!
Don't you worry none."


THE SENDING HOME

Then Shakyamuni Buddha,
He tell all them Buddhas
Who come from the ten directions,
All them manifestation bodies:

"Go on back now,
Go to your own lands,
Go where you belong.

And the Stupa of Many Treasures—
Let it be as it was before."

And when he speak these words,
All them countless Buddhas
From the ten directions,
Sitting under them jewel trees
On them lion seats—

And the Many Treasures Buddha,

And Superior Conduct
And all them countless Bodhisattvas,

And Shariputra
And all them voice-hearers,
The fourfold assembly—

And all the worlds,
The heavens,
The humans,
The asuras,
All them beings—

They hear what the Buddha said,
And great joy fill them up,
Every blessed one.

TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

This chapter contains the most physically intimate moment in the entire Lotus Sutra. After twenty-one chapters of cosmic visions, parables, prophecies, and supernatural displays, we arrive at a simple human gesture: the Buddha rises from his seat and puts his hand on people's heads. Three times.

This is transmission through touch. Not through doctrine, not through vision, but through the laying on of hands—a gesture that runs deep in both Buddhist and Christian ritual practice. When the Buddha's hand comes down on those Bodhisattvas' heads, something passes. Not just information, but authorization. Not just teaching, but succession. Not just wisdom, but responsibility.


THE POWER OF THREE

The threefold repetition is crucial. In both Buddhist and gospel traditions, three is the number of confirmation. Peter denied Jesus three times; Jesus asked Peter "Do you love me?" three times. In Buddhist ritual, we take refuge in the Three Jewels three times. We prostrate three times. We circumambulate three times.

When the Buddha lays his hand on their heads three times and speaks the commission three times, he's doing more than emphasis. He's making it stick. He's sealing it in the body, in the memory, in the muscle. You don't forget what was said three times with a hand on your head.

And when the Bodhisattvas respond three times—"Yes, Lord! We will do it all! Don't you worry none!"—that's the gospel responsorial pattern. That's the congregation answering the preacher. That's call and response, where the answer is given back stronger each time, until it becomes a vow, a commitment, a binding oath.


MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE

The practical wisdom in this chapter is beautiful: "If they believe, teach them the Lotus. If they don't believe, teach them something else from the Buddha's deep teachings that they can receive."

This is the opposite of rigidity. This is the opposite of "my way or the highway." The Buddha's generosity is so complete that he doesn't need everyone to receive the highest teaching right now. He knows there are many doors, many paths, many ways to help beings. The Lotus Sutra is supreme, yes—but if someone can't hear it, don't beat them with it. Give them what they can receive. Meet them where they are.

This is the wisdom of a real teacher, not a dogmatist. This is someone who knows that the point is liberation, not orthodoxy.


GRACE ANSWERED WITH GRACE

"If you do this, you'll be repaying what all the Buddhas have done for you." This is the theology of grace and response. The Buddha isn't saying "You owe me." He's saying "Pass it on." The way you honor what you've received is by giving it away.

This is the blues ethic: somebody helped me when I was down, so when I get up, I help somebody else. This is the gospel ethic: "Freely you have received, freely give." The debt is paid forward, not backward. You can't repay the Buddha directly—he doesn't need it. You repay him by doing for others what he did for you.


THE GENTLE DISMISSAL

After all the cosmic drama—the Stupa rising from the earth, the Buddhas gathering from all worlds, the Bodhisattvas emerging from underground—the ending is quiet. "Go on home now. Go where you belong."

There's no drama in the dismissal. No thunder, no spectacle. Just the gentle sending away: "The assembly is over. You've received what you came for. Now go on back to your own place."

And that "great joy" at the end—that's not excitement, that's peace. That's the joy of knowing what you're supposed to do. That's the joy of having received a clear commission. That's the joy of being entrusted with something precious and knowing you can carry it.

The Stupa returns to its place. The Buddhas return to their worlds. The assembly departs in joy. Everything returns to where it belongs, but transformed. The teaching has been given. The responsibility has been accepted. The succession is complete.

This is how you end a gospel service: with a benediction, a sending forth, and joy.
