## Timeline Recommendation

1. **Month 1-2**: Gather materials for Article 4
2. **Month 2-4**: Draft Article 4 with Dr. Chen-Rothenberg (5,000-7,000 words)
3. **Month 3-4**: Gather materials for Article 1 while Article 4 is in review
4. **Month 4-7**: Draft Article 1 (8,000-12,000 words)
5. **Month 5-6**: Gather materials for Article 2
6. **Month 6-9**: Draft Article 2 (8,000-10,000 words)
7. **Post-app launch**: Gather user data for Article 3
8. **Post-launch +3 months**: Draft Article 3 with user evidence

This creates momentum: always have one article in draft, one gathering materials, and one in peer review.
