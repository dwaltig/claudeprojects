## Part 1: The First Interrogation (Mind Inside)

**PROSECUTION:** Ananda, you have stated that you wish to find the Truth. To find the Truth, we must first establish the facts of your current reality. You claim you "love" the Buddha with your mind and eyes. I am asking you a jurisdictional question: **Where exactly is this 'mind' located?**

**DEFENDANT (ANANDA):** World-Honored One, this is a simple matter. All living beings—from the highest gods to the lowest insects—know that the conscious mind resides **inside the body**. Just as the Lotus Eyes of the Buddha are located on your face, my consciousness is located within this physical frame. It is clearly internal.

**PROSECUTION:** Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence. I will now demonstrate why that statement is logically impossible.

**CROSS-EXAMINATION:**

**Point 1:** Ananda, look at this lecture hall. Look at the Jetavana Grove outside. Where are they located?

**Defendant:** The hall is here. The grove is outside the hall.

**Point 2:** Correct. Now, you are sitting *inside* this hall. What do you see first?

**Defendant:** I see the Buddha first. Then the assembly. Then, looking through the open doors, I see the garden outside.

**Point 3:** Exactly. You see the interior *before* you see the exterior. That is the function of being "inside."

**ARGUMENT:**

Now, apply this mechanic to your body.

If your mind is truly located **inside your body**—like a person sitting inside this hall—it must follow the same laws of perspective.
1.  The "inside" observer sees the interior first.
2.  Therefore, your mind should clearly perceive the interior of your own body.

**THE TEST:**
*   Do you see your heart beating?
*   Do you see your liver functioning?
*   Do you see your stomach digesting?
*   Do you see the roots of your nails growing?
*   Do you see your pulse turning?

**Defendant:** No. I do not.

**THE VERDICT:**
If you cannot see the interior, you cannot claim to be located there.
*   If you were inside, you would see the inside.
*   You do not see the inside.
*   **Ergo: You are not inside.**

## Part 2: The Second Interrogation (Mind Outside)

**DEFENDANT (ANANDA):** I accept the previous ruling. If I cannot see my internal organs, I clearly cannot be inside. So, I have reconsidered the evidence.
My mind is actually **outside my body**. Like a lamp placed *outside* the house. I can illuminate the exterior (the world), but the light doesn't reach the interior.

**PROSECUTION:** A creative defense. But it fails the connectivity test.

**CROSS-EXAMINATION:**

**Point 1:** Look at the monks in this assembly. The Buddha has eaten his meal. Does that mean *you* are full?

**Defendant:** No, World-Honored One. We are separate bodies. His meal does not satisfy my hunger.

**Point 2:** Exactly. Distinct bodies imply distinct experiences. Separation means disconnection.

**THE ARGUMENT:**

If your mind were truly **outside** your body—floating somewhere in the air, separate from your physical frame—then there would be a disconnect between the "Mind" and the "Body."
*   When the Mind knows something, the Body shouldn't feel it.
*   When the Body feels something, the Mind shouldn't know it.

**THE VERDICT:**
There is immediate synchronization. Eye sees, Mind knows.
*   If you were outside, there would be a lag, or a total disconnect.
*   But there is no disconnect. The integration is seamless.
*   **Ergo: You are not outside.**

## Part 3: The Third Interrogation (Hidden Behind Eyes)

**DEFENDANT (ANANDA):** I have a third solution.
I am indeed hidden *within* the sense organ. Like a man wearing glasses.
*   The man is the Mind.
*   The glasses are the Eyes.
The man (Mind) looks *through* the glass (Eyes) to see the world. He doesn't see the glass itself, he just sees through it.

**PROSECUTION:** The "Glasses Defense." Let us test the analogy.

**CROSS-EXAMINATION:**
When a man wears glasses and looks at the mountains, does he see the glasses?
**Defendant:** Yes. He clearly sees the rim, the lens.

**THE TRAP:**
Now apply this to your experience.
*   If your mind is "the man" and your eye is "the glass"...
*   When you look at the mountains, **do you see your own eyeball?**

**Defendant:** ...No.

**THE VERDICT:**
The analogy collapses.
*   If you *do not* see your eye (which is the reality), then you are not "a man looking through glass."
*   **Ergo: You are not hidden behind the eyes.**

## Part 4: The Fourth Location (Darkness is Inside)

**DEFENDANT (ANANDA):** When I close my eyes and see darkness, that is seeing the "Inside."

**PROSECUTION:** This hinges on your definition of "Seeing the Inside."
If the darkness is **facing** you, it is an object in your visual field. It is "in front" of you. Something "in front" of you cannot be "inside" you.

## Part 5: The Fifth Location (Mind Joins Objects)

**STUDENT (ANANDA):** The mind has no fixed location. It simply comes into existence wherever it meets an object. It joins with things.

**DR. CHEN (PHILOSOPHY):**
"Joining" requires two distinct entities with established natures. You cannot have a "joining" if the subject (Mind) has no definable origin or substance.
*   If it's shapeless, it can't join.
*   If it has shape, it has location (which we've already disproven).

---

## Part 6: The Sixth Location (The Middle)

**STUDENT (ANANDA):** The Mind is the link between the Eye and the Object. It is in the **Middle**.

**DR. CHEN:**
If the Mind is the "Middle" between the sentient Eye and the inanimate Object, it must relate to both. It would be half-aware and half-inert. It would be a monster—a hybrid confused entity. It would have no coherent nature.

---

## Part 7: The Seventh Location (Non-Attachment)

**STUDENT (ANANDA):** Maybe my mind is simply **Non-Attachment**. It is nowhere. That is where it is.

**DR. CHEN:**
Ananda, this is the "Apophatic Dodge."
*   Is this "Non-Attachment" non-existent (like a rabbit's horn)? Then you are dead.
*   Is it existent? Then it has a nature. If it has a nature, it has a location.
You cannot call "Existing Awareness" by the name "Non-Attachment" just to avoid the question.

**SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS:**
Ananda, you have tried seven locations. All have been refuted. The Mind cannot be pinned down to a coordinate in XYZ space. We need a fundamental paradigm shift.
