## BATCH 3: THE SECOND INTERROGATION (MIND OUTSIDE)
**Primary Voice:** Agent 08 - Sarah Martinez (Dialectical Prosecutor)
**Source Text:** The Second Location of Mind - "Outside the Body"

**(The Prosecutor paces the floor. She turns sharply to face Ananda.)**

**DEFENDANT (ANANDA):** I accept the previous ruling. If I cannot see my internal organs, I clearly cannot be inside. So, I have reconsidered the evidence.

Here is my new submission: My mind is actually **outside my body**.
Consider a lamp. If a lamp is inside the room, it lights the room. If I don't see my "room" (my internal organs), it's because I'm like a lamp placed *outside* the house. I can illuminate the exterior (the world), but the light doesn't reach the interior. This explains perfectly why I see my body and the world, but not my stomach.

**PROSECUTION:** A creative defense. But it fails the connectivity test.

**CROSS-EXAMINATION:**

**Point 1:** Look at the monks in this assembly. The Buddha has eaten his meal. Does that mean *you* are full?

**Defendant:** No, World-Honored One. We are separate bodies. His meal does not satisfy my hunger.

**Point 2:** Exactly. Distinct bodies imply distinct experiences. Separation means disconnection.

**THE ARGUMENT:**

If your mind were truly **outside** your body—floating somewhere in the air, separate from your physical frame—then there would be a disconnect between the "Mind" and the "Body."
*   When the Mind knows something, the Body shouldn't feel it.
*   When the Body feels something, the Mind shouldn't know it.

They would be like two strangers.

**THE TEST:**
(The Buddha raises his hand—a soft, cotton-like "tula" hand.)

**Prosecution:** Look at the Buddha's hand. Your eyes see it. Does your mind discriminate what it is?

**Defendant:** Yes. My eyes see it, and my mind knows it is a hand.

**THE VERDICT:**
There is immediate synchronization. Eye sees, Mind knows.
*   If you were outside, there would be a lag, or a total disconnect.
*   But there is no disconnect. The integration is seamless.
*   **Ergo: You are not outside.**

**RULING:** The hypothesis that "The knowing mind resides outside the body" is **DISMISSED**. If it were outside, it would not be inextricably linked to your physical sensation.

## BATCH 4: THE THIRD INTERROGATION (MIND BEHIND GLASS)
**Primary Voice:** Agent 08 - Sarah Martinez (Dialectical Prosecutor)
**Source Text:** The Third Location of Mind - "Hidden Behind the Eyes"

**DEFENDANT (ANANDA):** (Visibly sweating) I see. Inside is impossible because I don't see the organs. Outside is impossible because I feel my body.

I have a third solution.
I am indeed hidden *within* the sense organ. Like a man wearing glasses.
*   The man is the Mind.
*   The glasses are the Eyes.
The man (Mind) looks *through* the glass (Eyes) to see the world. He doesn't see the glass itself, he just sees through it. This explains why I don't see my insides (because I'm looking out) and why I'm connected (because I'm right there in the sensory root).

**PROSECUTION:** The "Glasses Defense." Let us test the analogy.

**CROSS-EXAMINATION:**

**Point 1:** You say the mind is like a man, and the eye is like a piece of glass (or crystal) covering his eyes.
**Point 2:** When a man wears glasses and looks at the mountains, does he see the mountains?

**Defendant:** Yes.

**Point 3:** Does he see the glasses?

**Defendant:** Yes. He clearly sees the rim, the lens. He is aware of the glass.

**THE TRAP:**

Now apply this to your experience.
*   If your mind is "the man" and your eye is "the glass"...
*   When you look at the mountains, **do you see your own eyeball?**

**Defendant:** ...No.

**THE VERDICT:**
The analogy collapses.
*   Case A: If you *do* see your eye (like the man sees the glass), then your eye is an object in the world, not your sensory organ. You would have two sets of eyes.
*   Case B: If you *do not* see your eye (which is the reality), then you are not "a man looking through glass." The relationship is fundamentally different.

**RULING:** The hypothesis that "The knowing mind is hidden in the roots like a man in glasses" is **DISMISSED**. The phenomenology does not match the analogy.

---

**Summary of Progress:**
*   **Location 1 (Inside):** Refuted (Can't see organs).
*   **Location 2 (Outside):** Refuted (Body and Mind are linked).
*   **Location 3 (Behind Eyes):** Refuted (Don't see the eye itself).

The Prosecution rests for this session. Ananda is running out of places to hide.
