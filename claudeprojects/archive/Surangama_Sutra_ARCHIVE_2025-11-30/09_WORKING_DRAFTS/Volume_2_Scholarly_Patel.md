## I. THE KING AND THE RIVER

**Subject:** King Prasenajit.
**Condition:** Aging. Senescence.
**Complaint:** "World Honored One, my body is decaying. I look in the mirror and I see the inevitable termination of this system."

The Buddha asked for a precise report on this decay. The King's observation was clinically accurate. He noted that entropy isn't a sudden event; it's a continuous, microscopic shift.

**King Prasenajit:** "It happens in secret (變化密移). Metabolic shift. Cellular decay. I didn't notice it happening day-to-day, but the seasons cycled, and here I am."

He broke down the data points:
*   **T-minus 40 years (Age 20):** Peak physiological performance.
*   **T-minus 10 years (Age 50):** Functionally strong, but declining.
*   **Current Status (Age 62):** Significant senescence. Grey hair, wrinkled epidermis, cognitive slowing.

The King's insight went deeper than annual checkups. He realized the *delta* (rate of change) wasn't just yearly.
**King:** "If I zoom in, this change isn't discrete. It's continuous. It's happening every month. Every day. No, deeper—every split second. *Ksana* by *ksana* (刹那)."

**Conclusion:** The physical structure is a "Variable." It is programmed for dissolution.

### The Invariable Constant

**Dr. Chen:** The King has successfully identified the **Variable** (The Body). Now, the Buddha guides him to identify the **Invariable** (The Nature).

**The Dialogue:**
**Buddha:** Great King, you see your face wrinkling. But let me ask you about your *perception*.
**Buddha:** You saw the Ganges River when you were three years old. Correct?
**King:** Yes. My mother took me to the temple. I saw the river.
**Buddha:** You saw it again at thirteen? At twenty? And now at sixty-two?
**King:** Yes. The river flows the same.

**The Crucial Question:**
**Buddha:** "Your body has wrinkled. Your face is different. But the **Seeing Nature** (見精)—the awareness that registered the river at age three versus the awareness registering it now—**has that awareness wrinkled?**"
**King:** "No, World Honored One. The awareness is exactly the same. It has not aged a day."

**THE LOGIC OF IMMORTALITY:**
1.  **Premise A:** That which changes (Face/Body) is subject to destruction.
2.  **Premise B:** That which does not change (Seeing Nature) is **not** subject to destruction.
3.  **Observation:** Your Body has changed. Your Seeing Nature has not.
4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, your Body will die, but your Seeing Nature **will not die.**

**Dr. Patel:** From a scientific perspective, the hardware (eyes, brain, body) degrades. But the *Operator* of the hardware—the fundamental observer—stands outside the timeline of entropy.

**King Prasenajit:** (Eyes widening) "So... I am not just this dying ash? There is a part of me that survives?"

**Buddha:** "You have been identifying with the Variable. Today, identify with the Constant."
