## Part 1: The Setup

This is how I heard it.

One time, the Lord was staying in that city of Shravasti, at the Jeta Grove—that garden given by the benefactor who takes care of the lonely. He wasn't alone, no. He had twelve hundred and fifty of the Great Monks with him. These weren't just anybody. These were the heavy hitters—Arhats, men who had put down their burdens. They had walked out of the burning house and didn't look back.

They knew the rules of the spirit, and they walked tall in any kingdom on earth. They followed the Lord like a wheel follows the ox, ready to carry the Truth when the Lord was gone.

And it wasn't just them. The Bodhisattvas were there too—countless of them, coming from the ten directions to clear up their doubts, looking at the Lord with eyes full of respect, hungry for that secret wisdom.

## Part 2: The Feast and the Loner

Now, King Prasenajit was holding a memorial feast for his father. He invited the Lord into the palace, laid out the finest table you ever saw—delicacies fit for heaven. The elders and the wealthy folks in the city, they were all doing the same, hosting the monks, waiting for the blessings to rain down.

But there was one man missing. Ananda.

He’d been out on a special errand, far away. He hadn't made it back in time to join the line. There was no senior monk to guide him, no teacher to watch his back. He was coming home alone.

And on that day, there was no meal waiting for him.

So Ananda took his bowl and walked into the city. He told himself, "I’m going to beg from the first door I see to the last. I won't look for a rich roof; I won't turn up my nose at a poor one. I’ll be like the rain—falling on the just and the unjust alike." He wanted to be fair. He wanted to save everybody.

He walked through that city gate, his robes straight, his eyes down. He was trying to be holy. He was trying to be strict.

## Part 3: The Trap

But the road is treacherous, brothers and sisters.

As he was making his rounds, begging for his bread, he walked right into a house of shadows. A house of pleasure.

And there she was. Matangi's daughter.

She didn't just use her eyes. She used the Old Magic—the Kapila charm, a spell from the Brahma Heaven. She wove it around him like a spiderweb. It pulled him in. It dragged him onto the mats. She touched him, and his vows began to crumble. His holy robes felt heavy. The precepts he held so dear were about to shatter like glass on a stone floor.

He was drowning, and he didn't know how to swim.

## Part 4: The Rescue

But the Lord... the Lord knows.

Back at the feast, the Lord knew exactly what was happening. He put down his bowl. He didn't wait.

Suddenly, from the crown of the Lord’s head, a light burst forth—a light like a hundred jewels, fearless and pure. And in that light, a thousand-petaled lotus opened up. And on that lotus sat a transformation body of the Buddha, speaking words of power. A mantra. A sound that cuts through the dark.

He sent Manjushri—the Prince of Wisdom—to carry that sound.

Manjushri took that mantra and flew. He went straight to that house of shadows. The spell broke. The webs dissolved. The Kapila magic turned to dust.

He grabbed Ananda. He grabbed Matangi's daughter too. And he brought them both back. Back to the safety of the Jeta Grove. Back to the Lord.

**(The saxophone fades. Silence.)**

Ananda saw the Buddha. And he broke. He fell to the ground, weeping like a child. He hated himself. He hated that for all his learning, for all his memorizing of the scriptures, he didn't have the strength. He had the words, but he didn't have the Power.

He begged the Lord: "Please. Show me. The Buddhas of the ten directions—how did they do it? How did they find that Samadhi? That stillness? That first step? Tell me."

## Part 5: The Thief and the Son

**(The Teacher speaks to Ananda, who is devastated.)**

**The Teacher:**
Ananda, listen closely.
You have been using the Climbing-Seeking Mind as the self.
You have **recognized a thief as your son**, losing your eternally true nature.
Because of this, you have been spinning on the wheel of Samsara, broke and busted, since the beginning of time.

When I asked "What sees this?", you said "My mind sees it."
That implies the mind is an object distinct from you.
If that "mind" can be pointed at, it is an object. But you ain't an object, Ananda. You're the Witness.
Don't let the Thief steal the house.
