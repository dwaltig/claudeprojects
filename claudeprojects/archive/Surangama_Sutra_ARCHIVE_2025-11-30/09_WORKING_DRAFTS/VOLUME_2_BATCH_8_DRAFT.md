**(The holographic display flickers to life, showing a complex neural network that slowly degrades over time. Dr. Maya Patel steps forward, adjusting her virtual reality interface.)**

**VOICE V: THE SCIENTIST (DR. MAYA PATEL)**
**Context:** The assembly is filled with those still trapped by dualistic views of existence and non-existence. King Prasenajit, a man of worldly power but spiritual doubt, provides the perfect case study for the impermanence of the physical form.

**(King Prasenajit rises, a figure of stately concern.)**

**King Prasenajit:**
"World-Honored One, I stand before you, yet I confess a lingering uncertainty. I have studied the doctrines of many teachers—those like Kātyāyana and the others—who assert that this physical body, upon its death, is utterly extinguished. They claim this annihilation *is* nirvana. Though I have been fortunate enough to encounter the Buddha, this doubt, like a fox's suspicion, still troubles my mind. How can I develop my understanding and verify, with absolute certainty, that this Mind—this essential awareness—truly arrives at a state where it does not perish, where it is not subject to arising and ceasing? This is a question, I believe, that troubles all in this great assembly who still experience defilements."

**Dr. Patel (Narrating):** The King presents a classic scientific inquiry: empirical observation leads to a hypothesis of annihilation. He seeks a method of verification for a non-perishing aspect of self.

**THE TEACHER (Ontological Register):**
"Great King, your body is present before us now. Tell me, is this physical body of yours akin to a diamond—eternally abiding and incorruptible—or is it subject to alteration and decay?"

**King Prasenajit:**
"World-Honored One, this body of mine will assuredly be utterly extinguished in the end."

**THE TEACHER (Dialectical Register):**
"Great King, you yourself have not yet perished. How then do you possess this certainty that you *will* perish?"

**King Prasenajit:**
"World-Honored One, though this impermanent and decaying body has not yet reached its final extinction, I observe it constantly. I see the present moment—it ceaselessly shifts and passes away, never pausing. It is as if a fire burns down to ash, gradually diminishing and vanishing. This unending process of decline makes it absolutely clear to me that this body is destined for complete obliteration."

**Dr. Patel (Interjecting):** The King is providing a phenomenological account of entropy. He observes the continuous, irreversible degradation of his biological system. This aligns perfectly with the Second Law of Thermodynamics applied to living systems: spontaneous processes always increase the total entropy of the universe. His body is a complex system, and complexity inevitably degrades.

**THE TEACHER (Ontological Register):**
"It is so, Great King. Your current age has come from decay and old age. But tell me, how does your countenance now compare to when you were a child?"

**King Prasenajit:**
"World-Honored One, when I was but a tender child, my skin was smooth and lustrous, filled with vitality. As I reached adulthood, my blood and vigor were at their peak, brimming with strength. But now, in my twilight years, pressed by senescence and infirmity, my form is withered, my complexion faded, my spirit dimmed and clouded. My hair is white, my face etched with wrinkles. My time is short. How can this decaying image possibly compare to the abundance and fullness of my vigorous youth?"

**THE TEACHER (Dialectical Register):**
"Great King, surely your appearance did not decay all at once, in a single instant?"

**King Prasenajit:**
"World-Honored One, the changes have been subtle, secret, and continuous. I truly did not perceive the exact moment of each shift. It was the constant passage of cold and heat, the relentless flow of seasons, that gradually brought me to this state. For example, when I was twenty, though considered young, my face already showed signs of age compared to when I was ten. By thirty, I had declined further than at twenty. Now, at sixty-two, when I look back at my form at fifty, I was still robust and clearly strong. World-Honored One, I perceive these gradual, secret transformations. Though this body is certainly heading for oblivion, these major transitions seem to occur roughly every decade."

**(Dr. Patel pauses the holographic display, highlighting a decade-long segment of the King's life.)**

**King Prasenajit (Continuing with profound insight):**
"But if I contemplate this more deeply, World-Honored One, does this change happen only in decades or even years? No, it changes by the year. Why only by the year? It also changes by the month. Why only by the month? It also changes by the day. And if I meditate profoundly on this, I realize it changes moment by moment, thought by thought, *ksana* by *ksana* (刹那), never pausing for an instant. Thus, I know, with absolute certainty, that this physical body of mine will ultimately perish completely."

**Dr. Patel (Analysis):** The King has just described the microscopic, quantum-level impermanence of all phenomena. His observation of "ksana-by-ksana" change, far beyond the macroscopic, decade-long shifts, demonstrates a deep, almost meditative, insight into the biological processes of decay. Every cell, every molecule, is in constant flux. The hardware is continuously being rewritten, but with increasing errors.

**THE TEACHER (Ontological Register):**
"Great King, you observe these ceaseless transformations and thus realize the ultimate destruction of your physical form. But at the very moment of that destruction—or even now, as you perceive this constant flux—do you know if there is *anything* within you that does not perish?"

**King Prasenajit (Clasping his hands, a look of profound uncertainty):**
"World-Honored One, I truly do not know."

**(Dr. James Chen steps into the spotlight, the blackboard now displaying a river. He points to the river.)**

**VOICE III: THE LECTURER (DR. JAMES CHEN)**
**Topic:** The Logic of the Invariable Constant vs. the Flow of Existence.

**Dr. Chen (Narrating):** The King's empirical data confirms the impermanence of the body. Now, the Buddha will pivot from the *observed* (the decaying body) to the *Observer* (the Seeing Nature), using a universally understood analogy.

**THE TEACHER (Ontological Register):**
"Then I shall show you this nature that does not perish. Great King, at what age did you first perceive the Ganges River?"

**King Prasenajit:**
"When I was three years old, World-Honored One, my kind mother carried me to visit the goddess Jīvā. We passed by that great river, and even then, at that tender age, I knew it was the Ganges River."

**THE TEACHER (Dialectical Register):**
"Great King, as you yourself recounted, at twenty your vitality had declined from ten, and so on, until your present age of sixty-two. Every moment, month, and year of your being has fundamentally changed. But tell me, when you saw this river at three years old, and then again at thirteen, how was the *water*?"

**King Prasenajit:**
"The water, World-Honored One, appeared exactly as it was at three years old, without any difference. Even now, at sixty-two, it is still without difference."

**Dr. Chen (Analysis):** This highlights that the river, though flowing, maintains a *perceived identity*. It's not the *same water*, but it is still *the Ganges River*. This sets up the deeper analogy.

**THE TEACHER (Ontological Register):**
"Now, Great King, you lament your white hair and wrinkled face. Your face is certainly more wrinkled than when you were a child. But at this very moment, as you observe this Ganges River, is there any difference in the *seeing* of the river compared to when you were a child? Is there a young seeing and an old seeing?"

**King Prasenajit (His eyes widening with dawning realization):**
"No, World-Honored One. There is no difference in the seeing."

**THE TEACHER (Declarative Register):**
"Great King, though your face is indeed wrinkled, this **Seeing Essence** (見精)—this fundamental awareness—has *never* wrinkled. That which wrinkles is subject to change. That which does not wrinkle is *not* subject to change. That which changes is subject to perishing. But that which does not change is originally without arising or perishing. How, then, can *you* be subjected to birth and death within that **unperishing nature**? Why do you still cling to the views of those like Makkhalī Gosāla and others, who claim this body is utterly annihilated after death?"

**(Dr. Chen writes on the blackboard: "VARIABLE = IMPERMANENCE (BODY)" and beneath it "INVARIABLE = PERMANENCE (SEEING)").**

**Dr. Chen (Summarizing):** The hardware (eyes, brain, body) degrades. It's the "variable" on my graph. But the *Operator* of that hardware—the fundamental **Seeing Essence**—stands outside the timeline of entropy. It is the "invariable."

**King Prasenajit (His face now radiating with joy and profound understanding):**
"So... I am not just this dying ash? There is a part of me that survives?"

**THE TEACHER (Compassionate Register):**
"You have been identifying with the Variable. Today, Great King, identify with the Constant."

**(The holographic display fades. The blackboard glows with the word "SEEING" in luminous script, untouched by the passage of time. The assembly murmurs with unprecedented joy and understanding.)**
