# THE SURANGAMA SUTRA
## Volume Two: The Unchanging Nature

**I. The King and the River**

The Teacher, seeing the assembly was filled with those who had not yet attained purity, knew there was a further lesson to impart. King Prasenajit rose and addressed the Lord.

"World-Honored One, I have not yet received the full instruction of the Buddhas. I have heard the words of teachers like Kātyāyana and the others, who say that this body, upon death, is utterly annihilated. This they call Nirvana. Even though I have been fortunate enough to meet the Buddha, I still harbor doubts. How can one demonstrate and realize that this Mind does not perish?"

"Great King," the Teacher responded, "your body exists now. Let me ask you: Is this physical body of yours like a diamond, ever-abiding and incorruptible, or is it subject to change and decay?"

"World-Honored One," the King replied, "this body of mine will surely perish in the end."

"Great King," the Teacher asked, "you have not yet perished, so how do you know you will perish?"

"World-Honored One," the King explained, "though this impermanent and decaying body has not yet perished, I observe it constantly changing. Every moment passes, never staying still. It is like fire turning to ash, gradually wasting away. This ceaseless decay makes me know for certain that this body will eventually be extinguished."

"It is so, Great King," the Teacher affirmed. "You are now aging. How does your countenance compare to when you were a child?"

"World-Honored One," the King recounted, "when I was a child, my skin was smooth and lustrous. As I grew, my blood and vitality were full. But now, in my declining years, pressed by age and infirmity, my form is withered, my spirit dimmed, my hair is white, my face wrinkled. My time is short. How can it compare to my vigorous youth?"

"Great King," the Teacher asked, "has your appearance decayed suddenly?"

"World-Honored One," the King said, "the changes have been subtle and secret. I truly did not perceive them. The passage of cold and heat, seasons changing, gradually brought me to this state. When I was twenty, though considered young, my face already showed signs of aging compared to when I was ten. At thirty, I had declined further than at twenty. Now, at sixty-two, I look back at myself at fifty, and I was clearly strong then. World-Honored One, these subtle shifts—though my body is still here—these transformations limit themselves to decades. But if I contemplate more deeply, does this change happen only in decades or years? No, it changes by the year, by the month, by the day. And if I meditate profoundly, it changes moment by moment, instant by instant, never pausing. Thus I know that my body will eventually perish."

"Great King," the Teacher said, "you see the changes, the ceaseless transformation, and thus you realize your body will perish. But at the moment of that perishing, do you know if there is anything within you that does not perish?"

King Prasenajit clasped his hands and replied, "World-Honored One, I truly do not know."

"Then I shall show you this nature that does not perish," the Teacher declared. "Great King, at what age did you first see the Ganges River?"

The King replied, "When I was three years old, my kind mother carried me to visit the goddess Jīvā, and passing by that river, I knew then that it was the Ganges River."

"Great King," the Teacher continued, "as you said, at twenty you had declined from ten, and so on, until sixty-two. Every moment, month, and year has changed. But when you saw this river at three years old, how was its water when you reached thirteen?"

The King replied, "It was exactly as it was at three years old, appearing without difference."

"And now, at sixty-two, is it any different?"

"No," the King said, "it is still without difference."

"Now, Great King," the Teacher said, "you lament your white hair and wrinkled face. Your face is certainly more wrinkled than when you were a child. But at this moment, when you observe the Ganges River, is there any difference in the *seeing* of the river compared to when you were a child? Is there a young seeing and an old seeing?"

"No, World-Honored One," the King replied.

"Great King," the Teacher said, "though your face is wrinkled, this **Seeing Essence** has never wrinkled. That which wrinkles is subject to change. That which does not wrinkle is not subject to change. That which changes is subject to perishing. That which does not change is originally without arising or perishing. How, then, can you be subjected to birth and death within that? Why do you still follow those like Makkhalī Gosāla and others, who claim this body is utterly annihilated after death?"

When the King heard these words, he believed and understood that after this body, there is another birth. He and the entire assembly rejoiced with unprecedented happiness.

**II. The Unwavering Seeing**

Ananda immediately rose from his seat, bowed to the Buddha, clasped his hands, and knelt. "World-Honored One, if this hearing and seeing truly do not perish, why then do you say that we have lost our true nature and act in delusion? I beg your compassion to cleanse me of my impurities."

The Teacher extended his golden arm, his wheel-marked hand pointing down. "Ananda, you see my Mudrā hand. Is it upright or inverted?"

Ananda replied, "In the eyes of the world, this is inverted. But I do not know what is truly upright or inverted."

The Teacher said, "If worldly people consider this inverted, then what do worldly people consider upright?"

Ananda replied, "When the Tathagata raises his arm, with his soft, cotton-like hand pointing upwards, that is called upright."

The Teacher then raised his arm and said, "If this inversion means that top and bottom are exchanged, and worldly people look at it once, then they will know that your body, compared to the pure Dharma-body of the Tathagata, is revealed to be inverted in nature. The Tathagata's body is called 'Right and Omniscient.' Your body is called 'Inverted in Nature.' Observe carefully: Where in your body or the Buddha's body is the name 'inverted' truly located?"

At that moment, Ananda and the entire assembly gazed blankly at the Buddha, their eyes unblinking, unable to comprehend where the inversion of their body and mind truly lay. The Buddha, moved by great compassion, spoke with a voice like the tide of the ocean, pervading the entire assembly.

**III. The Illusion of the Mind**

"Noble sons, I have always said that all phenomena arising from mind, and all phenomena that mind uses, are manifested by Mind alone. Your body and your mind are both manifestations within the wonderfully bright, true, pure, and exquisite Mind. Why then do you lose your originally wondrous, perfectly wondrous, bright Mind, with its precious, bright, subtle nature? You mistakenly recognize delusion as awakening. Obscurity becomes space, and within that obscure darkness, darkness coalesces into form. Form mixes with false thinking, and false thinking takes shape as a body. Gathering conditions shake internally and rush out externally, creating confusing and agitated appearances, which you take to be the nature of mind. One delusion becomes Mind, and this is firmly mistaken for being within the physical body. You do not know that this physical body, from the outside to the mountains, rivers, empty space, and great earth, are all objects within the wondrously bright, true Mind. It is like throwing away a clear, vast ocean, recognizing only a single floating bubble as the entire tide, exhausting the entire ocean in it. You are truly lost among the deluded. It is like my hand hanging down, there is no difference from the upright."

The Tathagata spoke of them as pitiable ones. Ananda, receiving the Buddha's profound and compassionate instruction, wept, clasped his hands, and addressed the Buddha.

"World-Honored One, though I have received such wondrous sound from the Buddha, and understood that the wondrously bright Mind is originally perfectly full and the ground of the mind, yet my understanding of the Buddha's current Dharma-sound, and my current way of looking at it with the conditioned mind, makes me still unsure if this mind I gain is truly the original ground of the mind. I beg the Buddha, out of compassion, to proclaim the perfect sound, uproot my doubts, and lead me to the supreme path."

**IV. The Finger Pointing at the Moon**

"Ananda," the Teacher said, "you are still listening to the Dharma with a conditioned mind. This Dharma, too, is conditioned, and not the true nature of Dharma. It is like a person pointing at the moon for another. That person should look at the moon because of the finger. If he, however, looks at the finger and takes it for the moon, would he not only lose the moon, but also lose the finger? Why? Because he takes the pointing finger to be the bright moon. Not only would he lose the finger, he would also fail to recognize bright from dark. Why? Because he takes the substance of the finger to be the bright nature of the moon, thus failing to understand the natures of bright and dark. You are also like this. If you take your discriminating understanding of my Dharma-sound to be your Mind, then this mind should possess a discriminating nature separate from the sound. It is like a guest staying at an inn; he stops temporarily and then leaves, never staying permanently. But the innkeeper never leaves, and is called the master of the inn. This is also like that. If it were truly your Mind, it would never leave. How can it be that apart from sound, it has no discriminating nature? In that case, not only is the discriminating mind derived from sound, but even when it discriminates my form, apart from form, it has no discriminating nature. And so on, until there is no discrimination at all, not form, not emptiness. Like the ascetics, you are deluded by an obscure theory. If apart from various conditions, there is no discriminating nature, then your mind-nature would return to various places. How could it be the master?"

Ananda said, "If my mind-nature returns to various places, then the wondrously bright Original Mind, which the Tathagata speaks of, how can it be without returning? I beg your compassion to proclaim this for me."

"Ananda," the Teacher said, "look at me now, at this bright, clear Original Seeing. This seeing, though not the wondrous, clear, bright Mind, is like a second moon, not a moon's reflection. You should listen carefully; I shall now show you that which has no returning."

**V. The Final Revelation**

"Ananda, this great lecture hall opens to the east. When the sun rises in the sky, there is brightness. In the middle of the night, when the moon is dark, and clouds and mist obscure, then there is dimness. Through the cracks of the doors and windows, there is passage. Between walls and structures, there is obstruction. In places of discrimination, there is connection with conditions. In the midst of stubborn emptiness, everywhere is the nature of emptiness. In phenomena of obscurity and agitation, there is turbid dust. When clear and tranquil, collecting impurities, then there is purity. Ananda, you look at all these changing phenomena. I shall now return each to its original cause. What is its original cause?"

"Ananda, these changes: Brightness returns to the sun. Why? Without the sun, there is no brightness. Brightness belongs to the sun, therefore it returns to the sun. Darkness returns to the dark moon. Passage returns to the doors and windows. Obstruction returns to the walls and structures. Connection with conditions returns to discrimination. Stubborn emptiness returns to emptiness. Obscurity and agitation return to dust. Purity returns to clarity. Thus, all things in the world do not go beyond these categories. Among these eight kinds of bright, clear seeing-nature, to whom do you wish to return it? Why? If you return it to brightness, then when there is no brightness, there would be no seeing of darkness. Although brightness and darkness, and all sorts of differences, the seeing is without difference. All that can return is naturally not you. That which does not return—if it is not you, then who is it? Thus, you should know that your Mind is originally wondrously bright and pure. You yourselves are deluded, losing your origin and undergoing cycles of rebirth, constantly drifting in birth and death. Therefore, the Tathagata calls you pitiable ones."

**VI. Identifying the Perceiver**

"Ananda, though you now recognize that this seeing-nature has no returning, how do you know it is your true nature?"

"Ananda, I ask you now: You have not yet attained pure liberation. Through the Buddha's divine power, you can see the first meditation heaven without obstruction. But Aniruddha sees the entire Jambudvīpa as clearly as an amalaka fruit in his palm. The Bodhisattvas see hundreds of thousands of worlds. The Buddhas of the ten directions exhaust the smallest dust motes in pure Buddha-lands, and there is nothing they do not perceive. Ordinary beings, however, can see no more than a few inches."

"Ananda, you and I observe the palaces where the Four Heavenly Kings reside. In between, we scan all beings that dwell on land, water, and in the sky. Though there is dimness and brightness, and various forms, none of them are anything but external conditions. You should differentiate between yourself and these phenomena. Now, I will select from your seeing: Who is your true self, and who are the phenomena?"

"Ananda, extend your seeing to its source. From the sun and moon palaces—that is a phenomenon, not you. To the seven golden mountains, observe them all. Though there are various lights, that is also a phenomenon, not you. Gradually observe further: the rising clouds, the flying birds, the moving wind, the rising dust, trees, mountains, rivers, grass, cattle, humans—all are phenomena, not you."

"Ananda, though these near and far phenomena have various differences, they are all seen by your pure Seeing Essence. Thus, though phenomena have differences, the seeing-nature is not different. This exquisite, wondrous brightness is truly your Seeing-Nature. If seeing were a phenomenon, then you could also see my seeing. If you could see my seeing, then that would be 'seeing me.' But if I am not seeing, why can you not see the place where I am not seeing? If you could see the place where I am not seeing, that would naturally not be the characteristic of 'not seeing.' If you cannot see the place where I am not seeing, then that is naturally not a phenomenon. How can it not be you?"

"Furthermore, Ananda, when you now see a phenomenon, you see the phenomenon, and the phenomenon also sees you? If the nature is confused, then you and I, and all the world, cannot be established. Ananda, when you see, that is you, not I. This seeing-nature pervades everywhere. If it is not you, then who is it? Thus, you doubt your true nature and seek reality from me."
