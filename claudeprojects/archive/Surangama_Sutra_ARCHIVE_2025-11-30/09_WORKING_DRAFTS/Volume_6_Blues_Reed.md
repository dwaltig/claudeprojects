## Part 1: Manjushri's Verdict (Why Sound Wins)

**Kai Reed's Blues Interpretation:**
> "Manjushri laid it out plain.
> 'Lord, you want Ananda to get home? Don't give him a map he can't read.
>
> His eyes? They stop at the wall.
> His nose? It only works when the wind blows.
> His mind? It's a monkey in a cage.
>
> But his ears...
> That boy can hear the thunder rolling ten miles away.
> He can hear the cricket chirping in the grass.
> He hears when he's awake. He hears when he's dreaming.
>
> Sound is the Open Door.
> Sound is the river that flows both ways.
> Tell him to jump in the river of Sound, Lord. That's the ride that takes you all the way.'"

## Part 2: The Four Rules of Purity (The Clean House)

*The Buddha says: 'You want to fly? You gotta cut the weights.'*

### 1. Lust (The Fire)
**Kai Reed's Blues Interpretation:**
> "You want to cook rice, Ananda? Then use rice.
> If you put sand in the pot and turn up the heat...
> You ain't gonna get dinner. You just gonna get **Hot Sand**.
>
> Lust is the sand. Enlightenment is the rice.
> You can meditate till you turn blue, but if you're burning with lust,
> You just cooking up a hot mess of desire.
> You gotta cool that fire down."

### 2. Killing (The Blood)
**Kai Reed's Blues Interpretation:**
> "You want to be free? Then let them be free.
> You want to live forever? Then stop eating death.
>
> Every time you eat a piece of flesh, you're eating fear. You're eating pain.
> You act like a ghost, haunting the slaughterhouse.
> And you expect the ghosts to leave you alone?
>
> Put down the knife, brother.
> You can't swim in the ocean of mercy if your belly is full of blood."

### 3. Stealing (The Greed)
**Kai Reed's Blues Interpretation:**
> "If you think you need *stuff* to be happy...
> You already lost.
>
> Stealing ain't just taking a wallet.
> It's saying 'I ain't enough.'
> It's saying 'The world owes me.'
>
> The Truth is free, Ananda.
> But you can't steal it. You gotta let it in."

### 4. Lying (The Mask)
**Kai Reed's Blues Interpretation:**
> "And the biggest trap of all?
> Pretending you're a King when you're a Pauper.
>
> 'I'm enlightened! I'm holy! Look at my halo!'
> Man, that halo is made of plastic.
>
> Don't sell the Truth. Don't fake the Funk.
> The moment you lie about your soul...
> You cut the cord. You're just drifting in the dark."

## Part 3: The Sanctuary (The Safe House)

*The Buddha tells Ananda how to build a safe place when the world gets too loud.*

**Kai Reed's Blues Interpretation:**
> "If the streets are too wild, Ananda...
> If the noise is too loud and the demons are knocking at your door...
>
> Build yourself a room.
> Make it clean. Make it white as snow.
> Hang mirrors on the walls so you can't hide from yourself.
> Light the incense. Sit in the center.
>
> And chant this song.
> It's a song that breaks chains.
> It's a song that builds a wall of fire around you.
>
> When you sing it, the demons run. The shadows flee.
> And finally... finally... you can hear the Silence."
