# Archive Versions - Surangama Sutra Blues Interpretation

## Purpose

This folder preserves **every significant version** of the Surangama Sutra Blues Interpretation. When we make major edits or revisions, we save the previous version here with a timestamp.

## Naming Convention

```
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_[description].txt
```

Example: `20251128_143052_MASTER_EDITION_before_passage_1_revision.txt`

## Why This Matters

As you edit and refine your work, you may realize later that a previous version had something valuable that was removed. This archive ensures **nothing is ever truly lost**.

## Git Protection

This folder is tracked by git, so even if a file is deleted from here by accident, it can be recovered from git history.

## When to Archive

- Before any major structural change
- Before deleting or significantly revising a passage
- Before changing the format of a document
- When you're unsure if an edit will work out

**Rule of thumb**: If you hesitate even slightly, make an archive copy first.
