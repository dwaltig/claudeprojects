## Opening Invocation

*(Slow, smoky saxophone intro)*

This is how I heard it.
One time.
Just one time.

The Lord was staying in the city.
The Jeta Grove.
That garden given by the man who took care of the lonely.

He wasn't alone.
Twelve hundred and fifty heavy hitters were with him.
Men who had walked out of the burning house.
Men who didn't look back.

But this story...
This story ain't about them.
This story is about the one who got left behind.

## Part 1: The Trap (Ananda's Fall)

*(Tempo picks up—walking bass line)*

King Prasenajit was throwing a party.
A memorial feast. The good stuff.
Invited the Lord. Invited the monks.
"Come on down," he said. "Bless my house."

But Ananda?
Ananda was out on the road.
Alone.
No teacher. No backup. No map.

He was walking through the city, bowl in his hand.
Trying to be holy.
Trying to be fair.
"I'll beg from the rich," he said. "I'll beg from the poor."
"I won't choose. I'll be like the rain."

*(Music stops abruptly)*

But the road is treacherous, brothers and sisters.
He walked right into the House of Shadows.
Matangi's daughter was there.
And she didn't just use her eyes.
She used the Old Magic. The Kapila Charm.

She spun a web.
She pulled him in.
She whispered promises that would make a saint sweat.

And Ananda?
The man with the perfect memory?
The man who knew every scripture by heart?
He crumbled.
He was about to break the one vow you can't take back.

## Part 2: The Rescue

*(Drums kick in—urgent, powerful)*

But the Lord...
The Lord knows.
You can't hide from the Light.

Back at the feast, the Lord put down his bowl.
He didn't eat.
He knew his boy was in trouble.

**BOOM.**
Light shot out from the top of his head.
A hundred jewels. A thousand petals.
And in that light, a Voice.
A Mantra.
A sound that cuts through the dark like a diamond blade.

He sent Manjushri—the Prince of Wisdom.
"Go get him," the Lord said.
"Bring him home."

Manjushri flew.
He smashed that spell.
He grabbed Ananda by the collar.
And he dragged him back to the Grove.

## Part 3: The Interrogation (Where is Your Mind?)

*(Music slows down. Courtroom tension. Sarah Martinez steps up to the mic.)*

Ananda was on the floor. Weeping.
"Lord, I knew the words. But I didn't have the power.
Tell me. How do I get the power?"

The Lord looked at him.
"Ananda, I'm gonna ask you a question.
And I want a straight answer.
You say you love the Truth.
You say you use your mind to seek the Truth.
**Where is this mind?**"

### Location 1: Inside?

Ananda said: "That's easy, Lord. It's inside my body. Just like you're inside this hall."

The Lord said: "Wrong.
If you're inside the hall, you see the hall first, then the garden.
If your mind is inside your body...
**Do you see your heart beating?**
**Do you see your liver working?**
**Do you see your stomach digesting?**"

Ananda said: "No."

"Then you ain't inside. If you can't see the furniture, you ain't in the house." [1]

### Location 2: Outside?

Ananda thought about it. "Okay. Then I'm outside. Like a lamp on the porch."

The Lord said: "Wrong again.
If you were outside...
When I eat, would you get full?
When I get cut, do you bleed?
If your mind is outside, why do you feel it when I pinch your arm?"

Ananda said: "I feel it right away."

"Then you ain't outside. The connection is too tight." [2]

### Location 3: Behind the Glass?

Ananda said: "I got it. I'm hiding behind my eyes. Like a man wearing glasses."

The Lord smiled. "Ananda, Ananda.
When a man wears glasses, does he see the glasses?"

"Sure he does."

"Well, when you look at the mountain... **do you see your own eyeballs?**"

"No."

"Then you ain't wearing glasses. The analogy don't fit." [3]

*(The band plays a confused, dissonant chord)*

### Location 4, 5, 6, 7...

Ananda tried everything.
"It's in the dark!" (No, darkness is just something you see.)
"It joins with things!" (No, it can't join if it has no shape.)
"It's in the middle!" (Where is the middle? Show me.)
"It's nowhere!" (Is it dead? No? Then it's somewhere.)

Seven times he tried.
Seven times he failed.
Seven times the Lord cut the ground out from under his feet.

Until Ananda had nowhere left to stand.

## Part 4: The Revelation (Guest and Host)

*(Music shifts—major key, warm, steady)*

Ananda was shaking. "Lord, if my mind ain't inside, and it ain't outside, and it ain't nowhere... then I don't have a mind! I'm just a piece of wood!"

The Lord said: "Hush now.
I didn't say you don't have a mind.
I said you're looking for the wrong thing."

"Imagine a hotel," the Lord said.
"Travelers come. Travelers go.
They sleep for a night, pack their bags, and leave.
We call them **Guests**.

But there's one man who doesn't leave.
He stays when the morning comes.
He stays when the night falls.
He owns the place.
We call him the **Host**." [4]

*(Kai leans into the mic, whispering)*

"Ananda...
Your thoughts? They are the guests.
Your anger? A guest.
Your fear? A guest.
Your lust for that girl? Just a guest.

They come. They go.
If they leave, they ain't you.

But the One who watches them come?
The One who watches them go?
The One who is listening to my voice right now?

He don't leave.
He don't move.
He don't check out.

**That is the Host.**
**That is your True Mind.**
**That is the Buddha in you.**"

## Benediction

*(Organ swell)*

So stop chasing the guests, brothers and sisters.
Stop running after every thought that knocks on your door.
Let them come.
Let them go.

You just sit back.
You stay put.
You be the Host.

Because the Host is already home.
The Host has always been home.

**Namo Guan Yin Pusa.**
**Namo Shakyamuni Buddha.**

Amen.

## Endnotes (Scholarly Connections)

**[1] Mind Inside**: For the rigorous logical refutation of the "Internalist" position (Cartesian dualism), see **Volume 1 Scholarly, Part 2, Location 1**. The argument relies on the "law of spatial perspective."

**[2] Mind Outside**: For the analysis of the "Externalist" or "Extended Mind" hypothesis and the "connectivity test," see **Volume 1 Scholarly, Part 2, Location 2**.

**[3] Behind the Glass**: This refutes the "Representationalist" view of perception. For the philosophical breakdown, see **Volume 1 Scholarly, Part 2, Location 3**.

**[4] Guest and Host**: This is the central metaphor for distinguishing the "Climbing-Seeking Mind" (Pānyuán xīn) from the "Primal Pure Essence." See **Volume 1 Scholarly, Part 3**.

**Note**: While this Blues interpretation uses the name **Guan Yin** for accessibility, the Scholarly version uses the Sanskrit **Avalokiteśvara**. Both refer to the same Bodhisattva of Compassion.
