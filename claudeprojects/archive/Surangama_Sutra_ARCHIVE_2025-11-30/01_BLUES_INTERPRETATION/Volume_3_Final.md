The Surangama Sutra: Volume 3 - The Anatomy of Reality

The Buddha said:

"Now Ananda, look at your own eyes. You think they're doing the seeing?
You stare until your eyes get tired, until the world gets blurry.
That blurriness? That's just strain. That ain't the Truth.

You think the light brings the sight? No.
When the sun goes down, do you stop seeing? No, you just see the dark.
If the seeing belonged to the light, you'd be blind at night.
If the seeing belonged to the dark, you'd be blind at noon.

And don't tell me it's in that ball of flesh you call an eye.
That's just meat, brother. Meat don't see.

So where is it? It ain't inside. It ain't outside.
It's a ghost, Ananda. A ghost haunting the machine.
The Eye is a lie we tell ourselves to explain the miracle."

"Plug your ears, Ananda. Plug 'em tight.
You hear that roaring? That rumbling deep in your head?
Where's that coming from?

It ain't the wind. It ain't the birds.
It's the sound of your own struggle.

You think hearing comes from the quiet? Then loud noise would kill it.
You think hearing comes from the noise? Then silence would kill it.

But you hear the silence just as loud as the drum.
That hearing... it don't come from the bone. It don't come from the air.
It's the silence listening to itself."

"You sniff the air, looking for something sweet.
Sniff long enough, all you feel is the cold stinging your nose.

You smell that sandalwood incense?
Does that smell live in the wood? Or does it live in your nose?
If it lived in your nose, you'd smell it even when the incense was gone.
If it lived in the wood, the wood would enjoy its own perfume.

No, this smelling business... it's a dance.
A dance with no dancers. Just the music of the scent passing through."

"Lick your own lip, Ananda. Go on.
Keep licking till your tongue gets tired.
If you're sick, everything tastes bitter.
If you're well, even water tastes sweet.

So is the bitterness in the water? Or is it in you?

If the tongue was made of bitter, it couldn't taste sweet.
If the tongue was made of sweet, it couldn't taste bitter.

This tongue of yours... it's a liar.
It tells you what you want to hear, not what's really there."

"Take a cold hand. Hold a hot hand.
One feels the warmth. The other feels the chill.

Which one is true, Ananda?
Is the world hot? Or is it cold?

It depends on where you're standing.
It depends on what you're carrying.
The feeling ain't in the hand. It ain't in the skin.
It's in the meeting. And meetings always end."

"You get tired, you sleep.
You wake up, you remember.
You get old, you forget.

You call that your 'Mind.' You cherish it. You polish it.
But tell me, Ananda...
When you're deep asleep, dreaming of nothing... where did that Mind go?

If it was real, it wouldn't leave you every night.
It's just a flicker, man. A candle in the wind.
Don't build your house on a flicker."

"The wall don't see. The air don't see. And you don't see. The seeing just happens."

"If the sound walked over to your ear like a mailman...
Then it would leave the drum empty.
But a thousand people can hear that drum at once.
The sound didn't travel, Ananda.
The world is singing, and you just tuned in."

"You think you're the Thinker. The Knower. The Feeler.
But check this out:
Take away the eye. Take away the light.
Where is your 'Seeing-Self' now?

Take away the ear. Take away the music.
Where is your 'Hearing-Self' now?

You ain't the boss, Ananda. You're just the meeting place.
You're the street corner where the organ meets the world.
Don't mistake the corner for the traffic."

"You look at the ground. Solid. Real. But chop it up fine enough, it's dust. Chop the dust, it's emptiness. The solid ground is made of empty space."

"Where does the fire come from? You hold a magnifying glass to the sun. Does the fire come from the sun? From the glass? From the dry grass? It comes from nowhere. It's sleeping in everything, waiting to wake up."

"The moon pulls the tide. The crystal gathers dew. Does the water come from the moon? No. It's the nature of the world to flow."

"My robe waves in the breeze. Did the robe make the wind? Did the space make the wind? No. Motion is just the universe breathing."

"And here's the big secret, Ananda.
You think your mind is locked inside your skull?
You think you're a tiny drop in the ocean?

No.
You ARE the ocean.
This knowing? This feeling?
It ain't yours. It belongs to the whole damn universe.
It's clear. It's bright. And it never, ever dies."

The Vow

"Oh, wonderful Lord! You immovable Rock!
You showed me the King of All Samadhis.
Rare. So rare.

I've been thinking upside-down for a billion years.
Lost in my head. Lost in my fears.
But You... You wiped it all away.
I didn't have to wait. I didn't have to bleed.
You gave me the Dharma Body, planted the seed.

Now I'm gonna become a King of Treasure too.
I'm gonna save them all, Lord. Everyone. Including you.
I offer this deep heart to every speck of dust.
It's the only way to pay you back. It's a must.

Witness me now, World Honored One.
I'm going in.
Into the Five Turbid Worlds. Into the thick of sin.

As long as one soul is suffering...
As long as one heart is in pain...
I won't take my rest. I won't leave the rain.
I'll stay right here. Until the work is done.

You can tear the void apart.
You can grind the stars to dust.
But this iron heart?
This vow I make to you?
It will never move.
It will never move."
