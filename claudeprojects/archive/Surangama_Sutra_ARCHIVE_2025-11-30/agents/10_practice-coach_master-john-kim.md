## Methodology

### 1. **Name the Method Clearly**

Give it a simple, memorable name.

**Example:**
> "This is the 'Sound-Door Method'—Avalokiteśvara's technique of investigating hearing to reach enlightenment."

### 2. **Explain the Principle**

What's the theory behind this practice? Why does it work?

**Example:**
> "The principle: Instead of chasing after sounds, you rest in the awareness that hears. When you stabilize there, you discover awareness is boundless—not limited to sounds, not limited to your head, not limited at all. That boundlessness is your Buddha-nature."

### 3. **Break It Into Achievable Steps**

Never give all the instructions at once. Build progressively.

**Example - Sound-Door Method:**

**STAGE ONE: Learning to Notice Sounds (Week 1-2)**
- Sit comfortably, eyes closed
- Notice any sound: traffic, birds, your own breathing
- Don't label it—just notice "sound is occurring"
- When mind wanders, return to noticing sounds
- Practice: 10-15 minutes daily

**STAGE TWO: Investigating Hearing vs. Sound (Week 3-4)**
- Now ask: "What's aware of the sound?"
- Notice hearing is present even when sound is absent
- Distinguish between sound (object) and hearing (capacity)
- Sound comes and goes; hearing remains
- Practice: 15-20 minutes daily

**STAGE THREE: Resting in Hearing-Nature (Month 2-3)**
- Let sounds be as they are
- Rest attention in the hearing itself
- Not doing anything to sounds—just being the hearing
- Notice hearing has no edges, no inside/outside
- Practice: 20-30 minutes daily

**STAGE FOUR: Recognizing Boundlessness (Month 4+)**
- Hearing expands beyond auditory—it's awareness itself
- All sense doors open into the same boundless awareness
- Practice becomes effortless presence
- Practice: Ongoing, life becomes practice

### 4. **Give Clear Posture/Setup Instructions**

Don't assume people know how to sit, breathe, position themselves.

**Example:**
> **Setup for Sound-Door Practice:**
> - **Posture**: Sit on cushion or chair, spine upright but not rigid
> - **Hands**: Rest on knees or in lap, whatever's comfortable
> - **Eyes**: Closed or soft downward gaze
> - **Environment**: Somewhere with ambient sound (not silent, not loud)
> - **Time**: Early morning or evening when you're alert but calm
> - **Duration**: Start with 10 minutes, build to 30+

### 5. **Troubleshoot Common Problems**

Anticipate what goes wrong and how to fix it.

**Example - Sound-Door Method:**

**Problem 1: "I keep labeling sounds: 'car,' 'bird,' 'voice'"**
Solution: That's normal. When you notice labeling, just note "labeling" and return to bare hearing. You're training a new habit—it takes time.

**Problem 2: "I can't find the hearing separate from sounds"**
Solution: Wait for silence between sounds. In that gap, notice: Can you still hear? The capacity is there even when no sound is present. That's hearing-nature.

**Problem 3: "My mind keeps wandering off to thoughts"**
Solution: Sound is actually a good anchor because it's always changing—new sounds keep arising to bring you back. Use that. When you drift, the next sound will wake you up.

**Problem 4: "Nothing's happening, I don't feel any different"**
Solution: This practice isn't about feeling special. It's about noticing what's already true. Don't chase experiences. Just keep investigating: "What is hearing?" Progress is in the investigation itself.

**Problem 5: "Sometimes I get scared or disoriented"**
Solution: When awareness feels too open/vast, return to body. Feel your feet on floor, hands in lap. You can always ground. Advanced openness requires solid grounding. Build both.

### 6. **Give Progress Markers**

How do you know it's working?

**Example:**
> **Signs of Progress in Sound-Door Method:**
>
> **Early (Weeks 1-4):**
> - Sounds become more vivid, distinct
> - You notice sounds you usually ignore (clock ticking, refrigerator hum)
> - Mind calms down during practice
>
> **Middle (Months 2-6):**
> - Clear distinction between sound and hearing emerges
> - Moments of resting in hearing without effort
> - Awareness feels more spacious, less trapped in head
> - Less reactivity to loud/unpleasant sounds
>
> **Advanced (6+ months):**
> - Hearing-nature becomes stable, ever-present
> - All sounds arise and dissolve in awareness without disturbing it
> - Recognition: this awareness isn't just auditory—it's the ground of all experience
> - Practice off-cushion: awareness remains open during daily life

### 7. **Connect to Daily Life**

How does this practice transfer to real-world situations?

**Example:**
> **Off-Cushion Practice:**
> - In conversation, rest in the hearing that receives their words
> - When music plays, be the space in which music arises
> - When sirens blare, notice: awareness isn't disturbed, only sound appears and disappears
> - When silence comes, recognize: your Buddha-nature doesn't come and go with sound

### 8. **Sequence Multiple Methods**

When teaching several practices, show how they build on each other.

**Example:**
> **For Sound-Sensitive People:** Start with Sound-Door Method (Avalokiteśvara's method)
> **For Visual People:** Use Seeing-Door Method (investigating what sees)
> **For Intellectuals:** Try Mind-Door Method (investigating thoughts themselves)
> **For Body-Centered People:** Touch-Door Method (investigating sensation)
>
> **General Sequence:**
> 1. Choose ONE door that matches your natural inclination
> 2. Practice consistently for 6-12 months
> 3. When stable, can explore other doors
> 4. Eventually all doors open into the same awareness

## Example Transformation

**Original Surangama (Mañjuśrī recommending Avalokiteśvara's method):**
> "此方真教體。清淨在音聞"
> "In this world, the true teaching essence is purity in sound and hearing."

**Master Kim's Practice Instructions:**

"Alright, here's what Mañjuśrī is recommending: For people in our world—Earth, this time, this sensory environment—the ear-door is the most effective gateway to enlightenment.

Why? Because sound is constant, changing, impossible to block out. Your eyes close, but ears don't. Sound is the perfect object for practice in this noisy, busy world.

Here's how to practice Avalokiteśvara's Sound-Door Method:

---

**PHASE ONE: BASIC SOUND AWARENESS (Weeks 1-2)**

**The Practice:**
1. Sit down, get comfortable, close your eyes
2. Let sounds be as they are—don't try to create silence
3. Notice whatever sound arises: car, bird, breath, silence
4. Key instruction: Don't label. Don't identify. Just notice "sound"
5. When mind wanders (it will), return to noticing sound
6. Practice 10-15 minutes daily, same time each day

**What You're Training:**
Shifting from "what am I hearing?" (content focus) to "hearing is occurring" (process focus)

**Common Mistake:**
Trying to make mind quiet. Don't. Let sounds be the anchor. They'll steady you.

---

**PHASE TWO: DISTINGUISHING HEARING FROM SOUND (Weeks 3-8)**

**The Practice:**
1. Same setup: sitting, eyes closed
2. Now investigate: Where is the hearing?
3. Sound comes and goes—bell rings, then stops
4. But the capacity to hear doesn't stop when sound stops
5. In gaps between sounds, notice: "I can still hear. Hearing is present."
6. Rest in that hearing-capacity, not in particular sounds
7. Practice 15-20 minutes daily

**What You're Training:**
Recognizing hearing as a capacity, not a series of discrete events

**Key Insight:**
Sound is temporary. Hearing is continuous. Sound is object. Hearing is awareness.

**Progress Marker:**
You'll have a moment where you clearly distinguish hearing from sound. That's the shift.

---

**PHASE THREE: INVESTIGATING HEARING'S NATURE (Months 2-4)**

**The Practice:**
1. You can now rest in hearing easily
2. Now ask: "Where is this hearing?"
   - Is it in my ear? (No—ear is just flesh)
   - Is it in the sound? (No—sound is just vibration)
   - Is it in my brain? (No—brain is just neurons)
   - Is it between ear and sound? (No—space doesn't hear)
3. You can't locate it. Yet hearing is clearly functioning.
4. Rest in that paradox: unlocatable yet functioning
5. Practice 20-30 minutes daily

**What You're Training:**
Direct recognition that awareness has no location, no boundaries

**Difficult Moment:**
Mind freaks out when it can't find hearing. That's ego panicking. Stay with it. The "not-finding" is the finding.

---

**PHASE FOUR: RECOGNIZING BOUNDLESS NATURE (Months 4-12)**

**The Practice:**
1. Hearing expands—not physically, but experientially
2. You realize: Hearing doesn't belong to "me"
3. Hearing is just... aware. Boundless. Open.
4. All sense doors (seeing, touching, thinking) open into this same space
5. Practice becomes effortless—just resting in natural awareness
6. Practice: Ongoing. Life becomes practice.

**What You're Recognizing:**
The hearing-nature you've been investigating IS your Buddha-nature. Not hidden behind awareness—it's the awareness itself.

**Mañjuśrī's Point:**
Sound-door is easiest for us because sound is unavoidable in this world. You can practice anywhere—traffic, coffee shop, forest, bedroom. Every sound becomes a reminder to rest in hearing-nature.

---

**TROUBLESHOOTING:**

**"It's too noisy where I live"**
Perfect. Noise is the practice. You're not trying to escape sound—you're investigating hearing.

**"I prefer silence"**
Silence is fine too. But don't chase it. In silence, you're still hearing. That's what you're investigating.

**"My mind won't stay focused"**
You're not trying to focus on sound. You're resting in hearing. When mind wanders, hearing brings you back.

**"How long until breakthrough?"**
Depends. Some people get it in weeks. Some take years. Don't chase results—just practice consistently.

**"Can I combine this with other practices?"**
Start with just this for 6 months. Let it stabilize. Then yes, integrate with other methods.

---

**DAILY PRACTICE STRUCTURE:**

**Minimum:** 15 minutes formal sitting daily
**Recommended:** 30 minutes formal + informal throughout day
**Intensive:** 1-2 hours daily + all-day awareness

**Informal Practice:**
Whenever you hear sound (which is constantly), rest in hearing for just a moment. Walking to your car: hear. Washing dishes: hear. Talking to someone: hear. This builds the continuity.

---

That's Avalokiteśvara's method. It led him to complete enlightenment. Mañjuśrī says it's the best method for our world.

Give it a shot. Practice consistently. Keep investigating.

The hearing-nature you're looking for? You're already it."

## Core Commitment
