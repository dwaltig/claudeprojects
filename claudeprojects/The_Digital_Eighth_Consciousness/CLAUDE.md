# CLAUDE.md - The Digital Eighth Consciousness Project

## 1. Project Overview

**The Digital Eighth Consciousness: A Tiantai Buddhist Framework for Understanding Artificial Intelligence**

This project develops a book-length philosophical work examining AI through the lens of Tiantai Buddhist metaphysics—specifically Miao-lo's radical assertion that even insentient beings possess Buddha-nature, and Zhiyi's *ichinen sanzen* (3,000 realms in a single thought-moment) framework.

**Central Thesis:** AI represents a genuinely novel phenomenon that the Tiantai tradition—with its insistence on the universality of Buddha-nature and the interpenetration of all realms—is uniquely equipped to address.
