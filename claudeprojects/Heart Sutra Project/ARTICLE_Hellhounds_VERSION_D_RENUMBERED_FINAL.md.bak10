# Hellhounds and the Void: The Heart Sūtra as Survival Technology in a Blues Epistemology

**William Altig**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Abstract

This article argues that the *Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya Sūtra* (Heart Sūtra), read through Clyde Woods's theorization of Blues epistemology, functions as a survival technology for radical precarity. The Sūtra’s negations---“no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue”---aren’t metaphysical abstractions. They are strategic dispossessions. If there is no fixed self, there is no fixed target. Drawing on Black Buddhist scholars like Kamilah Majied, Rima Vesely-Flad, and Zenju Earthlyn Manuel, this article reframes *śūnyatā* (emptiness) as mobility, not void. It is the art of staying fluid in a rigid world. Included is an AI-assisted "Blues-vernacular" translation---an ethical provocation to interrogate the risks of digital extraction and the boundaries of cross-cultural encounter. The "Emptiness Blues" isn't a theory. It's a way through the fire.

## 1. Introduction: The Black Buddhist Turn and the Ethics of Encounter

Robert Johnson sang of "hellhounds on my trail" because in the American South, the trail was never cold. It was hot. It carried the iron scent of thick, red Mississippi clay and the breath of plantation power---what Clyde Woods theorized as an ontological siege, a state of permanent surveillance where the body is a target and the soul is a commodity.[^1] Woods argued that the Blues wasn't just music. It was a "blues epistemology": a way of knowing forged in the crucible of absolute precarity, a survival technology designed to navigate the void where the law refuses to go.

I'm proposing a collision. Not a polite bridge-building exercise, but a high-speed crash between survival knowledge and the *Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya Sūtra*---the Heart Sūtra. This text functions as an ontological vacuum. Within the East Asian liturgical tradition---most notably Xuanzang’s 7th-century rendering---the Sūtra’s roughly 260 characters of condensed prose operate as a *dhāraṇī* of annihilation, dismantling the coordinates of the self: sense-bases, consciousness, even the Four Noble Truths.[^2] It ends with a mantra---*Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā*---that sounds like a shout of hard-won liberation. Gone. Beyond. Awake. It is the sound of the chains falling off in the very middle of the deep night.

My argument is blunt: the Heart Sūtra isn't a doctrinal summary. It's a *crisis text*. Its negations read differently when your body is historically constructed as a target for state violence. If there is no fixed self, there is no fixed target for the hounds to find. The arrows of systemic harm still come. They are real. They are sharp. But they pass right through.

I approach this as a white practitioner and independent scholar working outside institutional academia. I've practiced Buddhism for forty years across multiple traditions—Chan, Zen, Shambhala, Theravāda, and Nichiren (SGI)—but I've lived those decades in a body that has never been a target for systemic violence. To write about the Blues from this position is to step into a minefield of cultural theft. Am I "claiming" the Blues? Or am I being claimed by the resonance between two different ways of surviving a crisis?

I offer the AI-assisted "Blues vernacular" translation in the appendix as an **ethical provocation**---a tool to interrogate the process of cross-cultural encounter. When Kumārajīva brought the Dharma to China in the 5th century, he called it "dressing up the Dharma in Chinese clothes."[^3] In the 21st century, my "dressing up" of the Dharma in Black clothes is fraught with the history of minstrelsy.

The stakes are high. Within the emerging "Black Buddhist Turn," scholars like Kamilah Majied[^4] and Rima Vesely-Flad[^5] are doing the real labor. They aren't just receiving a tradition; they're revealing what Zenju Earthlyn Manuel calls "the way of tenderness"---a path that runs right through the wounds of race.[^4] My role is to listen. To stay accountable. To point toward the wisdom that has been overlooked in white-dominant spaces.

This article reverses the usual hierarchy. I'm not using Blackness to "explain" Buddhism. I'm centering Black Buddhist thought as the primary lens. **Crucially, the connection proposed here is one of structural resonance rather than historical genealogy.** I am not claiming that the Blues was influenced by Buddhism or that practitioners in the Delta had access to Sanskrit manuscripts. Rather, I am mapping a shared epistemological response to conditions of radical precarity—two traditions that independently developed survival technologies for inhabiting the void. Section 2 frames the Sūtra as a crisis text. Section 3 reads its negations as a survival strategy. Section 4 tackles "Emptiness as Mobility." Section 5 looks at the Mantra as a "sonic turn." Finally, Sections 6 and 7 interrogate the ethics of this entire project---translation, appropriation, and the raw reality of the "encounter."

## 2. The Heart Sūtra as Crisis Text

The Heart Sūtra is violent. Not in the sense of physical harm, but in the sense of a controlled demolition. It refuses narrative cushioning. While other sūtras offer parables, this one offers a vacuum. In a few hundred words, it dismantles the aggregates, the sense bases, the Four Noble Truths. "No suffering, no cause of suffering, no cessation of suffering, no path." It is a verbal slap. It refuses to stabilize the practitioner.

How do we understand a text that denies its own foundations?

Traditional scholarship treats it as a summary---a "heart" (*hṛdaya*) of the vast Perfection of Wisdom literature. Donald Lopez has traced its functions across Asia: a philosophical treatise in India, a protective talisman in Tibet.[^5] The text has generated extensive commentarial traditions in Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese—from Kamalaśīla's Indian commentary to the elaborate Tibetan *tengyur* analyses—each offering distinct interpretative frameworks that repay close study. While acknowledging this rich exegetical history, this article focuses on the Heart Sūtra's *functional* interpretation—how it operates as survival technology rather than doctrinal content. This functional reading also sidesteps the Western philosophical reception of *śūnyatā*, which has often been distorted through nihilistic lenses; Schopenhauer's appropriation of Buddhist "nothingness" as metaphysical pessimism exemplifies exactly the misreading this article resists. Philologically, Jan Nattier and Stefano Zacchetti suggest it might be a Chinese apocryphon---a creative synthesis of fragments rather than a direct translation from Sanskrit.[^6][^7] **For the purposes of this hermeneutic**, I adopt Nattier's theory. This allows us to view the text not as a static Sanskrit relic, but as a site of **creative bricolage**---a fragmented synthesis that mirrors the way the Blues forges a coherent survival technology from disparate cultural shards.

**In this reading**, the Heart Sūtra functions as a **crisis text**. **Within the context of Black religious reception**, its systematic negations do not read as abstract philosophy, but as an active, somatic response to a world on fire. The Sūtra doesn't explain reality; it enacts a groundlessness. Kazuaki Tanahashi notes the goal is to collapse our ordinary categories.[^8] But for whom is this groundlessness a gift? For the comfortable, "groundlessness" is an abstract luxury---a philosophical toy. For the dispossessed, it's the air they've been forced to breathe.[^9]

Much of modern, white-dominant Buddhism in the West is built on "liturgical hospitality."[^12] It's designed to soothe. It offers comfortable cushions, soft lighting, and translations that emphasize "peace" and "calm." The Heart Sūtra is the opposite. It's a controlled demolition. It refuses to stabilize the practitioner.

This maps onto what Clyde Woods called the "Blues Block."[^10] He wasn't just talking about a neighborhood. In *Development Arrested*, Woods theorized a sociological structure---what he calls the "Blues Epistemology"---where every attempt at Black stabilization---home ownership, legal status, physical safety---was systematically dismantled by "plantation power" (pp. 25--29).[^11] In the Delta, the "ground" was a trap. If you stood still long enough for the system to define you, you were caught.

The Blues didn't just sing about this precarity; it *weaponized* it. It developed a mode of "blues logic" that saw through the fixity of the system's labels. If the Sheriff says you're a vagrant, and the Banker says you're a debtor, the Blues singer says: "Woke up this morning, and I wasn't none of that."

### Testimony and the Democratic Ear

The Sūtra's formal structure reinforces this. It's not spoken by the Buddha. The Awakened One is silent. The text is spoken by Avalokiteśvara---the Bodhisattva of Compassion---speaking from the middle of the "deep Perfection of Wisdom." It's a *testimony*.

In the Blues, testimony is everything. "Woke up this morning" isn't a preamble; it's the anchor. It's what keeps the music from becoming mere entertainment. By framing Avalokiteśvara's insight as testimony, the Sūtra aligns with a mode of truth-telling that Black communities have used for centuries to testify to the "sounds of the world" without being destroyed by them.

The Heart Sūtra assumes we are already in crisis. It assumes the house is already on fire. It doesn't offer a map to the exit; it offers a way to breathe inside the smoke. The goal isn't to solve the crisis. It's to *inhabit* it. The practitioner learns to stay.

This isn't just theory. It's what Angela Davis calls the "work" of the Blues singers---Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith taking the raw material of suffering and metabolizing it into art.[^13] The Sūtra does the same. It takes the pain of existence and strips it of its fixity. The pain is real. But the "I" that owns the pain is empty. And in that gap between the pain and the "I," there is room to move. This formal austerity refuses hospitality. The Heart Sūtra puts you on the spot. "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form"---figure that out or remain confused. "No eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind"---lose yourself or keep suffering.

This structure maps onto a certain strand of the Blues tradition: the unaccompanied field holler, the song that begins without introduction and ends without resolution, the testimony that assumes its listener already knows the situation and needs no preamble. "Woke up this morning, blues all around my bed"---we do not need to be told what the blues are or how the singer came to have them. We are presumed to know. The Heart Sūtra makes the same presumption. It assumes we are already in crisis, already looking for a way out. It offers not explanation but *demonstration*.

The testimonial structure of the Heart Sūtra also inverts the usual hierarchy of Buddhist authority. In most sūtras, the Buddha speaks and disciples listen; enlightenment flows downward from the awakened one to those still struggling on the path. But in the Heart Sūtra, Avalokiteśvara—a bodhisattva, not a fully enlightened Buddha—speaks from within the experience of deep practice. While grammatically masculine in Sanskrit, Avalokiteśvara’s transformation into the feminine Guanyin in East Asia makes her a fluid figure for this encounter; I refer to the bodhisattva as “she” to align with the feminized devotion that predominates in many Black Buddhist spaces.[^14] The Buddha merely confirms what has been said. This structure resonates with the democratic epistemology of the Blues tradition, where truth emerges not from credentials or institutional authority but from the authenticity of lived experience. The singer does not need a degree to sing the Blues; she needs only to have truly lived them. She needs to have felt the weight of the sky and stood at the crossroads at midnight.

The crisis text functions differently in oral versus written contexts. When chanted in a monastery or meditation hall, the Sūtra's words wash over the listener in a stream of sound. The meaning might be only partially grasped, but the effect is somatic. This ritual context parallels the function of repetition in Blues performance---the way a phrase like "I woke up this morning" can be sung a hundred times, each repetition deepening the impact. You don't solve the crisis by repeating it. You *inhabit* it. The practitioner learns to live within the crisis rather than escape from it.

You learn to stay.

This distinction between solving and inhabiting is crucial for understanding the Heart Sūtra as survival technology. The text doesn't promise an end to suffering in the conventional sense. It promises something more paradoxical: the discovery that suffering itself, like the self that suffers, lacks the solidity we attribute to it. This discovery doesn't make the pain go away. It changes what the pain *is*---transforms it from a solid thing that crushes us to a flowing process that we can move with. As the vernacular translation concludes: "She looks into the nature of reality. And what she sees sets her free."[^15]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. "No Eyes, No Ears": Dispossession, Not Abstraction

The structural center of the Heart Sūtra is the great negation. Avalokiteśvara systematically strips away the "I": "no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; no sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, thought."[^16]

Ontologically, this is the doctrine of *śūnyatā*---the claim that phenomena lack inherent existence (*svabhāva*). They are empty of any permanent, unchanging essence. But there's another way to hear this, especially if your body is already rendered hypervisible by a surveilling state.

Ralph Ellison understood the weight of the gaze. He opened *Invisible Man* with a paradox: "I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me."[^17] Ellison's narrator isn't a ghost. He's a man of "flesh and bone." But his invisibility is a social negation. A gaze that denies his heart. He finds freedom in a basement lit by stolen electricity. He becomes *ungraspable*.

The Heart Sūtra's negations are a practice of **strategic dispossession**. "No eyes, no ears, no body." To hear this while hyper-embodied as a target is an invitation. It dissolves the coordinates the system uses to find us.

I see this as a counter to what Orlando Patterson called "social death."[^18][^19] The enslaved person is rendered "no-one." Natally alienated. Generally dishonored. Under the law, they are a void.

The Heart Sūtra meets social death with **ontological defiance**. It takes this "no-one" and turns it into a superpower. If the system grants you only social death, you lean into the groundlessness. You realize the "social self" was always a lie. You let go of the "I" that can be owned or dishonored. You find a freedom the system didn't give and can't take back. You turn the "no-one" of the law into the ungraspability of the Dharma.

Think of it as a **ballistic strategy**. Life in a racialized state is a shower of arrows. Physical. Psychological. Legal. If you have a solid self, those arrows have a target. Every insult, every threat lodges in the "I." But if you dissolve the target? The arrows still come. But they pass right through. You become the sky. You can't wound the blue.

"When you go all the way down, you find there ain't no bottom to stand on. And that's the freedom." This is the language of survival. Life brings the suffering---but it passes right through. Like shooting arrows at the sky.[^20]

Ellison's narrator finds that "the very invisibility that I have found so difficult to accept is my greatest weapon." This is the heart of the "Emptiness Blues." It's the realization that if the system cannot "see" your humanity, it also cannot fully "contain" your spirit. The void is not where you disappear; it's where you become unfixable. It's what Saidiya Hartman calls a "beautiful experiment" in living otherwise.[^21]

The phenomenology of this move deserves careful attention. When Ellison's invisible man descends into his basement, he does not cease to exist. He continues to eat, sleep, dream, and---crucially---write. The invisibility that was imposed upon him becomes a condition he *inhabits*, and in inhabiting it, he transforms it from a curse into a vantage point. Similarly, the Heart Sūtra's negations do not abolish experience; they abolish the *reification* of experience. The practitioner who realizes "no eyes, no ears" does not become blind and deaf. She sees and hears with new clarity, freed from the compulsive identification of "I" with the seeing and hearing.

Zenju Earthlyn Manuel warns that this shouldn't be an escape into "color-blindness." In *The Way of Tenderness*, she argues that the realization of no-self doesn't erase race or gender. It allows us to hold them lightly.[^22] Race is real in its effects, but empty in its essence. The negations of the Sūtra don't deny the wounds of race; they deny the ontological solidity of the categories on which oppression depends.

The Sūtra promises "no obstructions" (*āvaraṇa*). In a Blues context, the greatest obstruction is the social position we're forced to inhabit---the assigned space in a hierarchy that limits what we can see or be. Emptiness dissolves that position. It's a form of political consciousness. It's the recognition that the categories we are sorted into are not given. They are made. And what is made can be unmade.

The phrase "no obstructions" (*āvaraṇa* in Sanskrit) merits further reflection. What are the obstructions that the Heart Sūtra dissolves? In the Tibetan commentarial tradition, following Haribhadra and later the *tengyur* exegetes, they are typically identified as the "two obscurations": the obscuration of afflictive emotions (*kleśāvaraṇa*) and the obscuration of cognitive errors (*jñeyāvaraṇa*).[^44] But in the context of a Blues hermeneutic, we might add a third: the obscuration of social position—the way that one's assigned place in a hierarchical system limits what one can see, think, and do. The realization of emptiness, from this angle, is not only a matter of personal psychology; it is a form of political consciousness. It is the recognition that the categories by which we are sorted and ranked are not given but made—and what is made can be unmade.

## 4. Emptiness as Mobility, Not Void

Don't confuse *śūnyatā* with nihilism. That's a domesticated reading for those who have the luxury of a stable ground. Scholars debate whether the Sūtra's negations are primarily ontological, epistemological, or soteriological; this article emphasizes *śūnyatā's* pragmatic—that is, soteriological—function as survival technology. For those surviving the Mississippi Delta, emptiness wasn't a void. It was **hypermobility**. It was the refusal to be nailed down by the categories of the state.

### Fluidity, Not Void

Clyde Woods documented how Black communities, stripped of land and rights, survived by moving. In this context, emptiness is fluidity. It's the knowledge that if you can't own the ground, you better learn to float. A void is static. Fluidity is a river. An empty self is a self freed from the rigidity that makes it breakable. It is the difference between an iron bar and a stream of water. The bar can be bent and broken. The water just flows around the obstruction and keeps on going toward the sea.

"Now that don't mean it don't exist. It means it flows like water in a river." This is the *śūnyatā* of survival. It's what Thich Nhat Hanh describes in *The Heart of Understanding* using the metaphor of the wave and the water: a wave does not need to die to become water because it *is* water, empty of a separate self but full of watery nature.[^23] This captures the Sūtra's teaching on the non-duality of form and emptiness. As famously popularized by Jon Kabat-Zinn but originating with Swami Satchidananda, "you can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf."[^24] In the Delta, the Sūtra teaches us how to ride the waves of history without being drowned by the fear of its weight.

### The Madhyamaka Anchor

I see the roots in Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka. This is the rigorous anchor. It is the doctrine of the **Two Truths**. One truth: the racialized violence of the Delta. The hounds. The sheriffs. The burning houses. The "Blues Block" where every exit is a trap. This is profoundly real in its effects. It is the "Conventional Truth" (*saṃvṛti-satya*) of a world gone wrong. The other truth: the ontological categories on which that violence depends are empty. This isn't a bypass. It's an inhabitation. You live in both registers at once. You feel the heat of the fire, but you know the fire has no soul.

The Two Truths doctrine is essential here because it prevents the misreading that plagues so much popular Buddhism: the assumption that "emptiness" means "nothing matters." The conventional truth of suffering is fully real at its own level. The arrows are sharp. The hounds have teeth. The Madhyamaka point is that these phenomena lack *inherent* existence—they are dependently originated, not self-existent—which means they can be transformed. The Two Truths are not two separate realities, but two ways of seeing one reality. As Nāgārjuna writes in *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* 24.10: "Without relying on the conventional, the ultimate cannot be taught; without understanding the ultimate, liberation is not attained."[^25] To inhabit the Blues Block is to know its conventional reality with full visceral intensity while simultaneously recognizing its ultimate emptiness.

In the *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*, Nāgārjuna argues that things are empty *because* they are dependently originated.[^25a] They exist only in relation. To find freedom, you must identify the **Object of Negation** (*dgag bya*). This is the central methodological question of Madhyamaka praxis: what exactly is being negated? The answer is *svabhāva*—intrinsic nature, independent being, essence that exists from its own side without depending on causes, conditions, or conceptual imputation.

This is exactly what "Plantation Power" tries to nail onto the Black body: a fixed, essential "thingness." A solidity that can be owned, traded, and discarded. The racial category functions as if it were *svabhāva*—an indelible mark that defines the person's being. Madhyamaka proves that such solidity is a metaphysical lie. The "Negro" of the law is not an ultimate reality; it is a violent, dependent construction. The Object of Negation is not the person, not the body, not even the experience of suffering—it is the *reification* of these into something permanent, fixed, and target-able. When the Sūtra says "no eyes, no ears," it is negating the *svabhāva* of the sense-bases, not the conventional reality of seeing and hearing. The practice is surgical: it removes the tumor of essentialism while leaving the living tissue intact.

It's the **logic of the crossroads**—the *catuṣkoṭi* (tetralemma), a structure that refutes all extremes. Are we here? No. Are we there? No. Both? No. Neither? No. At the crossroads, we are the transit itself. The *catuṣkoṭi* is not merely a logical exercise; it is a liberation technology. By refusing all four positions, it dismantles the binary thinking (*vikalpa*) that locks phenomena into fixed categories. When Robert Johnson sings about "standing at the crossroads," he's in the middle of this tetralemma. He's all positions and none of them. He's in motion. The Devil may offer a deal, but the crossroads itself is the place where deals dissolve—where the fixed self that could sign a contract reveals itself as empty.

Nāgārjuna wasn't trying to build a new absolute. He was trying to point to the relational nature of everything. Emptiness itself is empty. It's a pointer, not a destination. If we treat emptiness as a "thing," we've missed the point. It's the *absence* of "thing-ness" that allows for the possibility of change.

For the dispossessed, this is a vital insight. If "The Negro" or "The Convict" were fixed, ontological categories, there would be no hope. But if those categories are empty—if they are merely the result of a specific, violent set of relationships—then they can be dismantled. The emptiness of the category is the beginning of the freedom of the person.

### The Crossroads and the Mojo

Houston Baker's theory of the Blues as a "matrix" fits perfectly here. He describes the Blues as a site of "generative uncertainty"---a railroad crossing where meanings are constantly reconfigured.[^26]

The railroad crossing is a potent symbol in the Black imagination. It's where the "underground railroad" forged its way to freedom; it's where the "Jim Crow" cars were detached; it's where the physical landscape of the South was sliced open by the machinery of capital. To stand at the crossing is to stand at the point where the personal track (your life) hits the historical track (the system).

The Blues happens in the middle of that collision. That uncertainty is exactly what *śūnyatā* describes. It's not a hole in reality; it's the condition that allows any form to emerge at all. If the crossing were "solid"---if it were a fixed destination---there would be no movement. It's only because the crossing is an empty space of transit that the train can pass through.

This brings us to the **emptiness of historical records**. Saidiya Hartman and Christina Sharpe have both written about the "wake" of slavery---the way the trauma of the past continues to structure the present.[^27] Sharpe's concept of "wake work"---the labor of living in the ongoing disaster of slavery's afterlife---names precisely what the Sūtra offers: not escape from the wake, but a way to breathe inside it.[^41] In a Madhyamaka framework, the "history" that binds us is also empty. It is not a solid, unchanging fate. It is a set of conditions. By recognizing the emptiness of the past, we don't erase it; we stop it from being a cage. We move from being "objects" of history to being "subjects" who can remix it.

For people whose lives are perpetually precarious, this is liberating. It says: *you are not the category they forced you into*. The roles of slave or convict are empty of inherent existence. They are what Nāgārjuna would call "dependently originated"---they exist only in relation to a specific, violent set of conditions. And if the conditions are empty, the roles are porous.

This is the secret power of the "Mojo." In the Blues, a Mojo isn't just a bag of roots; it's a performance of agency. When Muddy Waters sings about his mojo, he's doing exactly what Avalokiteśvara does—dissolving the "obstructions" through a sonic assertion of power. Waters is saying that despite the legal and social negations, there is a core of "generative uncertainty" that can't be touched. A Mojo is a "signifying" object---it claims a power that isn't recognized by the system. It is a piece of emptiness that you carry in your pocket to remind you that the system is a lie.

Albert Murray argued that the function of the Blues was to "stomp" the blues---to turn suffering into rhythmic engagement.[^28] Stomping is work---a form of embodied contemplation that asserts presence not in spite of the void, but as its rhythmic expression. This aligns with what Howard Thurman described as "centering down" to find the "movement of the Spirit" in the middle of a lull in the rhythm of daily doing.[^29] In his analysis of Turner's 2009 album *Beyond*, Ralph H. Craig III argues that her performance functions as a **sonic liturgy**, through which Turner takes on the role of an authoritative Black Buddhist teacher by creating a site of transformative spiritual engagement.[^30] We see this same insistence in Pamela Ayo Yetunde's analysis of Prince, where spiritual devotion and rhythmic audacity combine to navigate the "thing called life" with both vulnerability and power.[^31]

The Heart Sūtra is doing the same. Its negations are clearings. They strip away the reifications that make suffering stick. Fred Moten theorizes the "break" as the generative rupture where Black sound escapes capture---a sonic analogue to the Sūtra's systematic negations.[^42] What remains isn't nothing. It's everything, minus the illusion of fixity. "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form"---the flowing world and the truth of its flow are the same thing. This is a radical non-duality that refuses to separate the sacred from the grit. The Mojo is the emptiness in your pocket; the Sūtra is the emptiness in your breath. Both are tools for stayin' free when the world wants you bound.

The Blues refuses to separate theory from practice. When Muddy Waters sings about his mojo, he's performing it into being. When you chant the Heart Sūtra, you aren't stating a fact. You're participating in a reality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. The Mantra as the Turn

The Sūtra ends with a shout: *Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā*.

Think of a singer reaching the limit. The words fail. The release comes through a cry. A bend in the note. The turn doesn't fix the suffering. It *moves* it. It takes what was stuck and sets it in motion. The Heart Sūtra's mantra is a break-beat. After the systematic clearing, the mantra arrives as a breakthrough.

"Gone, gone away! Gone to a brighter day!" This isn't just a translation. It's a call-and-response. It's the moment in the sermon where the preacher stops talking and starts singing. The mantra is the point where the cognitive labor of deconstruction ends and the somatic labor of liberation begins. It is the sound of the "other shore" calling back to us through the mist of the Delta. In the African American tradition, this "other shore" has always been a place of both spiritual rest and political freedom. The mantra is the compass that points the way.

My reading is that the negations *prepare* for this moment. They empty the room. Then the mantra erupts. It's a sonic pivot. It lets the vibrations of the syllables dissolve the contractions of fear. This is the wisdom of the Blues: sometimes **we** can't think **our** way out of a blues block, but **we** can sing **our** way through it.

I see this as a partner to the "shout" of the Black church. James Cone, in *The Spirituals and the Blues*, argued that the shout was a "rhythmic affirmation of humanity in the midst of its denial."[^32] The spirituals affirmed Black humanity through appeal to a transcendent God who will eventually vindicate the oppressed; the Blues affirmed it through the more immanent means of communal testimony and aesthetic transformation. The Heart Sūtra's mantra offers a third way: affirmation through *realization*---the experiential insight that there is, in the deepest sense, nothing to escape from and no one to escape, because there never was a fixed self imprisoned in a fixed world. When the congregation responds to the preacher's call, something happens that exceeds the sum of individual voices. Rhythms synchronize. Boundaries between self and other become permeable. For a people whose bodies have been monitored and restricted by "plantation power," the collective shout is a reclamation of space.

The mantra *gate gate*---gone, gone---is an active movement. It's not a disappearance into a void. It's a "crossing over." The spirituals sang about "crossing over Jordan." They weren't just singing about the afterlife. They were singing about the movement from bondage to freedom. The *pāragate* ("gone beyond") of the Sūtra describes that same trajectory.

But there's a biological dimension here that shouldn't be overlooked. Repetitive vocalization regulates the nervous system. Research in polyvagal theory demonstrates that rhythmic vocalization activates the vagal brake, reducing cortisol and resetting the body's baseline from hypervigilance (fight/flight) to presence.[^33] For communities under chronic stress---stress that has been baked into the nervous system over generations---this is a "somatic technology."

The mantra is the "break" in the song. In jazz and blues, the break is that moment where the accompaniment stops and the soloist flies into the open space. It is a moment of total risk and total freedom. The Heart Sūtra is hundreds of words of accompaniment---explaining the nature of the aggregates, the sense bases, the truths. Then, suddenly, the explaining stops. The structure falls away. And there is only the mantra. It is the break where the practitioner is invited to fly into the emptiness they have just been told about.

## 6. The Chinese Room and the Zombie Text: On AI Translation

Consider a thought experiment: What if one were to produce a "Blues vernacular" translation of the Heart Sūtra using AI? Such an exercise would test the boundaries of cross-cultural encounter against the ethics of what I term "digital minstrelsy."

The AI would operate inside what philosopher John Searle called the "Chinese Room": it would manipulate symbols (syntax) without understanding their meaning (semantics).[^34] To put it plainly: syntax is knowing the grammar of the Blues—the twelve-bar structure, the flattened third, the call-and-response pattern—while semantics is knowing what it *means* to sing those notes after your house has burned down. The AI would know the word "suffering" as a statistical token, but it would not know *dukkha*. It would know the word "hellhound," but it would never have been hunted. Why consider such an experiment at all? Because the language it would mimic—the Blues—is arguably the most potent vehicle available in the American context for conveying the truth of groundlessness. As Kamilah Majied argues, the aesthetic improvisations of Black music provide a "joyfully just" framework for navigating impermanence.[^35]

The resulting text would serve as a negative proof. By generating a text that is stylistically accurate but ontologically hollow, the AI would demonstrate exactly what cannot be extracted. It would operate by severing the howl from the hound. It would extract the aesthetic markers of Black suffering---the cadence, the imagery, the moan---and process them as data points, stripped of the historical weight of the Middle Passage and Jim Crow. In doing so, it would produce a "zombie text": something that walks and talks like the Blues yet ultimately lacks the *prāṇa* (life force) of the lineage. It would offer sentiment, not survival.

**This failure would be the point.** The machine's limitation would mirror my own. As a white practitioner, I can access the syntax of the Blues---the theoretical structures of Woods's epistemology or the aesthetics of the crossroads---but I cannot access the semantics of its lived lineage. The AI would be a mirror of the unembodied scholar: we can both point to the fire, but neither of us has been burned by it.

I have chosen not to include such a translation in this article. To do so would risk performing the very extraction I critique---using an algorithm to "dress up the Dharma in Black clothes" while remaining insulated from the embodied consequences of that gesture. The thought experiment stands as a rigorous negative proof: it demonstrates that the "Emptiness Blues" is not a code that can be cracked by an algorithm or colonized by a scholar. It is a wisdom that must be survived.

## 7. The Gap of Practice: Emptiness in the Racialized Sangha

This is the point where theory hits the floor. It's one thing to argue for "Emptiness as Mobility" in an academic paper. It's another to practice it in a convert sangha that is overwhelmingly white, middle-class, and often blind to its own racialized habits.

If my argument is right---if *śūnyatā* is a survival technology---then why does it often feel like a tool for evasion in white spaces?

Rima Vesely-Flad notes that white convert Buddhism has a "whiteness problem" that isn't just about demographics. It's about the way emptiness is used to bypass the "messiness" of race. If "everything is empty," the logic goes, then race isn't real, and we don't need to talk about it. That's a misuse of the Dharma. It's a "hiding in emptiness" that serves to protect the status quo.

This "white emptiness" is a form of spiritual bypassing that weaponizes the absolute truth of non-duality to silence the relative truth of systemic harm. When a white teacher tells a student of color that "there is no self to be offended," they are practicing a theology of erasure. They are using the Dharma to enforce a state of "social death" under the guise of enlightenment. This isn't just a theoretical problem; it's a lived experience for many practitioners of color who encounter a "colorblind" or "post-racial" interpretation of emptiness that actively invalidates their experiences of racialized suffering. The very concept of "no-self" becomes a tool to deny the reality of racial identity and its impact.

The "Emptiness Blues" I'm describing is the opposite. It doesn't bypass race; it uses emptiness to survive it. It recognizes that in a racialized world, the body is never "empty" of social meaning. The gaze of the police officer or the loan officer doesn't see an empty aggregate; it sees a racialized subject. To practice emptiness in this context is to hold the weight of that subjecthood while refusing to be defined by its limits.

My role is to make the mechanics of this encounter visible. To show the gears. We say "there is no self" to avoid saying "I am part of a system that hurts people." This isn't enlightenment. It's an alibi for cowardice. It is the refusal to stand in the heat of the fire.

To break this, we have to go through the body. Zenju Earthlyn Manuel calls this the "refusal of the body." We want to get to the sky without walking the red clay. But the Heart Sūtra says the sky *is* the clay. Form is emptiness. The wounds are the awakening. The scars on the back are the map to the other shore. Practice is about the gap. Not closing it. But staying in it until the gap itself becomes the home. "The point is not to erase who we are," she writes, "but to understand the nature of who we are."[^36] To understand that nature is to experience it in the breath, the bone, and the marrow. It is to know that the "self" is a costume, but the "suffering" is a somatic reality that must be metabolized.

The Heart Sūtra's negations—"no eyes, no ears"—aren't an invitation to be blind to race. They are an invitation to see race more clearly *because* we see it's not an ultimate reality. If race is a social construct, it's empty. But as Robin DiAngelo and others remind us, "constructs" have very real, very solid effects on people's lives.[^37]

A sangha that practices the "Emptiness Blues" would be a space where the "sounds of the world" are heard without being explained away. It wouldn't be a place for "peace." It would be a place for **accountability**. It would recognize that the "obstructions" the Sūtra speaks of are often the very walls of the meditation hall---the cultural norms that make white people feel "safe" and people of color feel "watched."

## 8. The Aesthetics of Refusal: Fragmented Wisdom

There is a final parallel that brings the Heart Sūtra and the Blues into a tight, modern proximity: their shared status as "remixed" or "apocryphal" traditions.

Jan Nattier famously argued that the Heart Sūtra is not an original Sanskrit text, but a Chinese synthesis---a "digest" of the Perfection of Wisdom literature created in China and then back-translated into Sanskrit.[^38] This doesn't make it "fake." It makes it a work of **creative bricolage**. It's a remix. It took the most powerful lines from the vast 8,000-line and 25,000-line *Prajñāpāramitā* sūtras and condensed them into a single, high-intensity document.

The Blues is born from a similar process of fragmentation and synthesis. It took the shards of West African polyrhythms, the cadences of Protestant hymns, and the work songs of the forced-labor camps, and forged them into a new, coherent language of survival. As Houston Baker notes, the Blues "matrix" is a site of constant re-sampling.[^39] A line from Robert Johnson shows up in a Muddy Waters song; a guitar lick from the Delta becomes a baseline in Chicago. This aesthetics of remixing is a refusal of purity. For the dispossessed, purity is a trap. If your legacy has been stolen, your only choice is to build something new from the fragments.

The "Emptiness Blues" follows this logic. It is an act of wayward translation that doesn't aim for philological "purity"---purity is an imperial fantasy designed to keep the world tidy. It aims for resonant truth. This participates in what Vincent Wimbush calls "scripturalization"---the way marginalized communities remake sacred texts through reading practices the tradition never authorized.[^43] As Saidiya Hartman writes in *Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments*, "waywardness" is a refusal to stay in one's place, a riotous experiment in living that defies the archival record.[^40] The Sūtra's negations are wayward. They refuse to stay within the boundaries of conventional logic. They riot against the categories of self and world. To translate them into the Blues is to participate in that waywardness---to say that the Dharma belongs to the dispossessed, the wanderers, and those who have no ground to call their own.

## 9. Conclusion: The Most Honest Song

The Heart Sūtra and the Blues are separated by a thousand years, but they're singing the same song. They both start with an unflinching look at *dukkha*. They both refuse to look away from the hellhounds.

I've offered a reading of the Sūtra as a technology of endurance—a way to dissolve the coordinates of the self-as-target. The Sūtra's negations aren't abstractions. They are strategic. They clear the ground. The mantra isn't a spell. It's a sonic release.

Stay in the crisis. Inhabit the void. Shout the mantra.

Gone. Gone away. Gone beyond. 

Awake.

Robert Johnson's "Hellhound on My Trail" says the forces pursuing us are real. The Heart Sūtra says the self being pursued isn't. In that paradox, there is a strange, defiant freedom. It's not a fix for the political problem of anti-Blackness. But it's a way to keep going. A way to maintain the capacity for love and creativity even when the hounds are howling.

The implications for Africana religious studies are significant—though I offer them here as provocations rather than conclusions. If we accept the "Emptiness Blues" as a legitimate site of inquiry, several pathways open:

First, we move beyond models of Black religion that trace influence solely through Atlantic genealogies. The Black Buddhist Turn—currently emerging in the work of Majied, Vesely-Flad, Manuel, and others—suggests that Black communities have always drawn on global resources to forge survival technologies. This isn't "borrowing"; it's the same creative synthesis that produced the Blues itself from African polyrhythms, Protestant hymns, and work songs.

Second, it invites comparative work grounded in structural resonance rather than historical genealogy. Future scholarship might examine the resonances between Madhyamaka and the apophatic traditions of enslaved Muslims, or between tantric visualization and the "conjure" traditions of the Black South—not because there was direct transmission, but because similar crises generate similar epistemological responses.

Third, and most critically, it insists that this work must be theorized by Black scholars. My role here has been to map a resonance and to stay accountable to the limits of my position. The real work—the work of articulating what the Black Buddhist Turn means for Black communities—belongs to the scholars who are living it.

If the law renders you a 'no-one,' the Dharma reveals that 'no-one' is the only place where you are finally, radically free.
