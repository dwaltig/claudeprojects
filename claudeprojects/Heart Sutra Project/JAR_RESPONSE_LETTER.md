Dear Editors and Reviewers,

Thank you for the opportunity to revise this manuscript. I am grateful for both reviewers' careful engagement with my work. Their feedback has substantially strengthened the article, particularly in expanding engagement with Black Buddhist scholarship and deepening the scholarly apparatus around the Heart Sūtra's textual and philosophical traditions. Below I address each point raised.

## REVIEWER 1

**Comment:** "My primary critique is that the author does not broadly engage Black Buddhist writings that expand many of the essay's arguments... I suggest that the essay would be better served by including additional Black Buddhist writings that engage dharma teachings and Black music, including Kamilah Majied's essay in *Black & Buddhist* (in which she writes about Billie Holliday) as well as her new book *Joyfully Just* (in which she writes about Buddhism and Black music more broadly). I encourage the author to also consult Ralph Craig III's biography on Tina Turner (in which he discusses the importance of chanting) and Pamela Ayo Yetunde's new book on Prince."

**Response:** I thank Reviewer 1 for these essential recommendations, which have significantly enriched the article's engagement with Black Buddhist scholarship. I have now incorporated:

1. **Kamilah Majied's work** — Her essay on Billie Holiday in *Black and Buddhist* is now integrated into Section 4, alongside the discussion of Angela Davis. I cite Majied's argument that Holiday's art embodied "the unity of suffering and joy that Buddhist teaching describes." I have also added her book *Joyfully Just* (2024) to the footnotes and bibliography.

2. **Rima Vesely-Flad's *Black Buddhists and the Black Radical Tradition*** — I have added a new paragraph in Section 4 drawing on Vesely-Flad's interviews with over seventy Black Buddhist teachers, which documents how Black practitioners integrate Buddhist teachings in ways that align with radical Black thought.

3. **Ralph Craig III's biography of Tina Turner** — Added to the bibliography. Given that the article's focus is on the Heart Sūtra rather than Nichiren chanting practice, I have not integrated Craig's work into the body text but include it as a resource for readers interested in parallel trajectories of Black Buddhist practice.

4. **Pamela Ayo Yetunde's work on Prince** — As the book *Dearly Beloved* is forthcoming (Spring 2025), I have added Yetunde's co-edited volume *Black and Buddhist* to the bibliography. I will incorporate *Dearly Beloved* in future iterations when published.

These additions ground the article more firmly in the genealogy of Black Buddhist thought rather than treating the vernacular translation as an isolated phenomenon.

## REVIEWER 2

### Technical Corrections

**Comment (pg. 3):** "The Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya-sūtra (hereafter, Heart Sūtra) is not in ślokas. Śloka is verse; the text is in prose."

**Response:** Corrected. The revised text now reads: "In approximately 260 Chinese characters, this compressed prose text dismantles every category..." I thank the reviewer for catching this error.

---

**Comment (pg. 9):** "I am not sure where the author got this meaning of mahā-vyavadāna from. Mahā does indeed mean 'great.' Vyavadāna means, as a technical term in Buddhist texts, 'purification.'"

**Response:** Corrected. I have removed the erroneous Sanskrit terminology entirely. The revised text now reads: "At the structural center of the Heart Sūtra lies what might be called the great litany of negation." I appreciate the reviewer's philological precision.

---

**Comment (pg. 17):** "Avalokiteśvara is a male bodhisattva. In East Asia, the bodhisattva is transformed into the female bodhisattva Guanyin... Under no circumstances should one refer to Avalokiteśvara as female when dealing with the Sanskrit sources."

**Response:** I have added an extensive footnote (now [^36a]) that addresses this directly:

> "In the Sanskrit tradition, Avalokiteśvara is grammatically and iconographically male. However, the bodhisattva's transformation into the female Guanyin (觀音) in Chinese Buddhism—a transformation theologically grounded in the Lotus Sūtra's teaching that Avalokiteśvara can manifest in any form to save sentient beings—has made feminine pronouns customary in East Asian devotional contexts. The vernacular translation follows this latter tradition, consistent with its grounding in Kumārajīva's Chinese text rather than the Sanskrit. For this transformation, see Chün-fang Yü, *Kuan-yin: The Chinese Transformation of Avalokiteśvara* (Columbia University Press, 2001)."

This makes explicit the article's interpretive choice while acknowledging the philological complexities.

---

**Comment (pg. 14, note 18):** "If this is indeed the author's own translation... they should provide the Chinese and/or Sanskrit primary source in the endnote."

**Response:** Done. Note 13 now includes the full Chinese text from Kumārajīva's translation (T0251_.08.0848c04-13).

---

### Scholarly Apparatus

**Comment (pg. 6):** "This is woefully insufficient for introducing the reader to scholarly research on the Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya-sūtra... The author here jumps back and forth between considering the Chinese text and the Sanskrit text as if they are more or less versions of the same text."

**Response:** I have substantially expanded the engagement with López's scholarship in Section 2. The revised paragraph now reads:

> "Lopez's analysis reveals that the Heart Sūtra has been a remarkably versatile instrument—adapted to scholastic, contemplative, and devotional purposes depending on the needs of its audience. This functional diversity suggests that the text itself is, in Buddhist terms, a form of *upāya* (skillful means, or as one might say in vernacular, 'loving tricks')—its meaning arising in relation to the needs and capacities of its audience rather than residing statically in the words themselves. The present reading, which approaches the Sūtra through Blues epistemology, continues this tradition of adaptive interpretation."

I have also added a citation to Stefano Zacchetti's authoritative entry on "Prajñāpāramitā" in *Brill's Encyclopedia of Buddhism* (2015) in note [^13a].

---

**Comment (pg. 10):** "The standard Mahāyāna reading of this passage... Citation needed. What is the 'standard' Mahāyāna reading?"

**Response:** I have added specific citations. The revised text now reads: "The standard Mahāyāna reading of this passage, articulated in Indian and Tibetan commentaries from Vimalamitra (8th century) to the present, emphasizes its ontological claim..." with a new footnote citing Lopez's *Heart Sutra Explained* and Zacchetti's Brill Encyclopedia entry.

---

**Comment:** "I am troubled by there being no mention in this article of the Madhyamaka Buddhist philosophical school."

**Response:** I have added a new paragraph in Section 4 that provides Madhyamaka philosophical context:

> "The philosophical elaboration of *śūnyatā* owes its most systematic treatment to the Madhyamaka school founded by Nāgārjuna (c. 150-250 CE). In his *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*, Nāgārjuna equated emptiness with dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*): phenomena are empty precisely because they arise in dependence on causes and conditions, lacking any inherent, self-sufficient existence (*svabhāva*). Crucially, Nāgārjuna also argued that emptiness itself is empty—that *śūnyatā* is not a new absolute or ground but a pointer to the processual, relational nature of all things."

I have also added Jay Garfield's translation of the *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* to the bibliography.

---

**Comment:** "The article needs a more robust discussion of ontology. Especially given that scholars who study Buddhist philosophy equivocate on whether to understand śūnyatā in the Heart Sutra as making claims about ontology, epistemology, both, or neither."

**Response:** I have added the following to Section 4:

> "Buddhist philosophers have long debated whether *śūnyatā* is primarily an ontological claim (about what exists), an epistemological claim (about how we know), or a soteriological tool (for liberation) that transcends both categories. For the present argument, what matters is the *pragmatic* dimension: the experience of emptiness as release from fixity, which operates regardless of one's metaphysical commitments."

---

**Comment:** "Section 4 needs a much more robust discussion of how śūnyatā has been received in the West."

**Response:** I have expanded the opening of Section 4 to include reference to Western misreadings:

> "The Western reception of *śūnyatā* has been troubled from the start. From Schopenhauer onward, 'emptiness' has often been mistaken for nihilism or despair. The revised text traces this history and positions Blues epistemology as a corrective."

I have also added Roger-Pol Droit's *The Cult of Nothingness: The Philosophers and the Buddha* (2003) to the bibliography as a key source on this Western reception history.

---

**Comment (pg. 24):** "This is thinly veiled orientalism. The Heart Sūtra has not 'often' been 'ritual background noise' in East Asia, as the number of commentaries and scholarly tracts on it amply demonstrate."

**Response:** Point well taken. I have substantially revised this passage to read:

> "The Heart Sūtra, for all its profundity, risks becoming in Western convert communities a text chanted but not grappled with, a formula repeated without penetration. The rich commentarial traditions that have animated the text across Asia—from the Indian scholastic interpretations preserved in Tibetan translation to the innovative readings of Chan, Tiantai, and Zen masters—demonstrate that the Sūtra has consistently provoked sustained intellectual and spiritual engagement wherever it has taken root."

This revision acknowledges the depth of Asian engagement while focusing the critique on Western appropriation.

### Source Legitimacy

**Comment:** "The source text that the author bases themself on—William Altig's *The Heart Sutra Reborn*—is of dubious quality. The author needs to provide a very strong rationale for using this work by Altig who, as far as I can determine, has no formal credentials for being able to offer such an idiosyncratic reading of this sūtra."

**Response:** I have added a new paragraph in Section 6 that directly addresses questions of authority in vernacular translation. The revised argument does not claim credentials—I have none in the conventional academic sense. Rather, it grounds the translation in the Buddha's own teaching that the dharma should be preached in the language of the people, not preserved in sacred languages accessible only to elites. The Pali Vinaya records the Buddha explicitly rejecting a proposal to render his teachings in Sanskrit (the Brahmanical prestige language), insisting instead that monks teach in their own vernacular.

The vernacular translation follows this logic. Its aim was to use contemporary technology and the vernacular idiom of the Blues to create an accessible version of this popular sūtra—and specifically to counter the nihilistic misreadings that have plagued Western reception of *śūnyatā*. The question is not whether I have institutional sanction but whether the translation awakens insight. Does it move people toward liberation? These are the questions by which vernacular translation must ultimately be judged.

---

**Comment (pg. 26):** "When a Black translator renders a Sanskrit sūtra into the idiom of the Mississippi Delta... Does William Altig identify as Black?"

**Response:** I have revised this sentence to focus on the work rather than making claims about the translator's identity. The revised text reads:

> "When the Heart Sūtra is rendered into the vernacular idiom of the Mississippi Delta—an idiom forged in Black communities and carrying the weight of that history—something new is created."

This formulation directly names the Black origins of the Blues idiom while the positionality footnote (see below) addresses questions of cultural authority.

---

### Positionality Statement

In response to Reviewer 2's implicit question about my identity and authority to engage with Black religious thought, I have added a substantial positionality footnote [^2a] at the first mention of the vernacular translation. This footnote:

- Explicitly identifies me as a white American Buddhist practitioner
- Acknowledges my relationship to the Blues as "student and beneficiary... not an inheritor"
- Addresses the risks of cultural appropriation directly
- Frames the work as "an experimental, scholarly offering" intended to engage in dialogue with Black Buddhist scholarship
- Cites the Buddha's teaching on vernacular translation as the authorization for speaking dharma in any idiom

This approach follows best practices in Africana religious studies, where scholars are expected to be transparent about their social location when engaging with communities to which they do not belong.

---

## Conclusion

I believe these revisions address all substantive concerns while preserving the article's central argument: that the Heart Sūtra, read through Blues epistemology, functions as survival technology for communities under conditions of radical precarity. The expanded scholarly apparatus and engagement with Black Buddhist scholarship strengthens rather than dilutes this claim.

Thank you again for your thoughtful engagement with this work.

Sincerely,

William Altig
