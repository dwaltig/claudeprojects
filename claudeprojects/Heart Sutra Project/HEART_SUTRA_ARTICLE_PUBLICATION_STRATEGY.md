## Core Thesis (Validated)

> The Heart Sūtra is not a metaphysical summary of Mahāyāna doctrine but a **performative text designed to collapse false refuge**. When rendered through a Blues epistemology, its negations ("no eyes, no ears...") emerge not as nihilism but as **survival technology** developed under conditions of radical precarity.

## The "Survival Technology" Argument

### The Target/Arrow Metaphor
> "If you think you got a solid, permanent self, then every insult, every loss, every pain has a target to hit. But when you see through that illusion... The arrows still come... but they pass right through."

**Strategic Use:** This formulation introduces a spatial/ballistic dimension to *anātman* (no-self). The realization of emptiness removes the *target* — not the external oppression, but the internal trauma.

### Theoretical Innovation
| Classical Section | Sanskrit Concept | Blues Interpretation | Function as Survival Technology |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| Avalokiteśvara's Vision | Five Aggregates are empty | "Five big heaps where a soul used to be... Empty like a jar with no bottom" | De-reification of the racialized body |
| Address to Śāriputra | Form is Emptiness | "The cup needs the emptiness to be a cup" | Reframing "emptiness" as potential, not lack |
| The Negations | No eye, ear... | "No eyes to see... Tear it all down" | Rejection of the "white gaze"; demolition of identity-prison |
| The Attainment | Nirvāṇa | "No walls in the mind. No fear in the heart... That's Nirvana, baby" | Psychological sovereignty in a carceral state |
| The Mantra | Gate gate... | "Gone, gone, gone beyond... The Emptiness Blues is the song for you" | The "shout" of liberation; sonic crossing |
