INTRODUCTION

This is the Heart Sutra, the shortest and deepest teaching in Buddhism, retold in the rhythm and soul of the Blues. The Blues ain't just about sadness; it's about facing the hard truth of life—suffering, change, loss—and finding a freedom that can't be taken away. 

The Buddha taught that everything we hold onto—our bodies, our feelings, our very selves—is "empty." That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It means it flows like a river, changes like a cloud, and has no solid core. When you see that, you can't be broken.

So listen to the song of emptiness.

PASSAGE ONE: THE VISION

[PROSE RENDERING]

Let me tell you how it started. It wasn't in a big church or a fancy temple. It was just Avalokiteśvara—the One Who Hears the Cries of the World—sitting deep in the pocket of wisdom.

He wasn't just thinking. He was looking. Deep down. He was practicing that deep Prajna Paramita—that wisdom that goes beyond. And looking at the world, he saw something that changed everything.

He looked at his own self. He looked at the five things that make up a human being: the body, the feelings, the perceptions, the thoughts, and the consciousness. We think those things are solid. We think, "That's me. That's mine."

But Avalokiteśvara looked and saw: Empty. Every last one of them. Empty of any solid self. Empty of anything permanent.

And in that moment of seeing, all the suffering, all the fear, all the heaviness—it just lifted. Because if there's no solid target, the arrow of suffering can't stick.

[BLUES VERSE RENDERING]

(Slow, steady beat)

Avalokiteśvara sitting all alone,
Deep in wisdom on the glory throne.
Looked at the world with a spiritual eye,
Saw the truth of things beneath the sky.

He looked at the body, looked at the mind,
Searching for a self he could not find.
Five big heaps where a man used to be,
Saw them all empty, saw them all free.

(Chorus)
Yeah, the body is empty, like a passing cloud,
Feelings just a whisper, though they scream so loud.
Thoughts are like the wind, blowing through the trees,
When you see they're empty, you fall to your knees.

Suffering is gone, pain don't stand a chance,
When you join the rhythm of the freedom dance.
Avalokiteśvara saw it clear as day,
Emptiness washes all the tears away.

PASSAGE TWO: THE GREAT NEGATION

[PROSE RENDERING]

Now the teaching turns to Śāriputra. He was the smartest disciple, the one with all the book learning. And the Spirit speaks to him saying:

"Śāriputra, listen here. You got to let go of your categories.

"Form ain't different from emptiness. Emptiness ain't different from form. The cup is form, the space inside is emptiness, but you can't have one without the other. Form is just emptiness taking shape. Emptiness is just form dissolving.

"And it's the same for everything else. Feelings? Empty. Thoughts? Empty. Consciousness? Empty.

"So in this place of truth, Śāriputra, there ain't no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind.
No sights to see, no sounds to hear.
No ignorance to be trapped in, and no end to ignorance either.
No getting old and dying, and no end to getting old and dying.

"Even the suffering you're worried about? Empty.
The cause of it? Empty.
The end of it? Empty.
The path you're walking? Empty.

"There's no wisdom to get. There's no prize to win. There's nothing to attain. And because there's nothing to gain, the Bodhisattva is finally free. No walls in the mind. No fear in the heart. Just pure, unclouded freedom. That's Nirvana, baby."

[BLUES VERSE RENDERING]

(Up-tempo, driving rhythm)

Oh Śāriputra, hear what I say,
Form and emptiness are the same way.
Ain't no difference between the two,
What you see is empty, and empty is you.

No eyes to see, no ears to hear,
No nose to smell, no doubt to clear.
No tongue to taste the bitter or sweet,
No solid ground beneath your feet.

(Chorus)
Tear it all down, let the walls fall flat,
Tell me Śāriputra, what you think about that?
No wisdom to find, no prize to be won,
The work is over, the journey is done.

No suffering here, no cause to be found,
No end to the pain, no path on the ground.
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose,
That's the secret of the Emptiness Blues.

So the Bodhisattva walks with a stride so bold,
Breaking the chains that the mind can't hold.
No fear in the heart, no cloud in the sky,
Waving all your illusions goodbye.

PASSAGE THREE: THE MANTRA

[PROSE RENDERING]

So how do you hold onto this? You don't. You let it hold you.

All the Buddhas of the past, present, and future—they all woke up using this same deep wisdom. This Prajna Paramita.

So know this: This wisdom is the great spell. The great bright spell. The utmost spell. The spell that has no equal.
It wipes out all suffering. It's the real deal. No lies.

So we sing the mantra. The song of going beyond. The song of the other shore.

Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha.

Gone. Gone. Gone beyond. Gone all the way beyond. Awakening. Hail!

[BLUES VERSE RENDERING]

(Call and Response, soulful and loud)

So here is the magic, here is the spell,
To break you out of your personal hell.
The wisdom that shines like the morning sun,
Showing that the battle is already won.

Listen to the words that the Buddhas say,
To wash your troubles and your cares away.
It ain't a secret, it ain't no lie,
It's the wings you need if you want to fly.

(The Mantra)
Gate Gate — Gone, gone away!
Paragate — Gone to a brighter day!
Parasamgate — Gone all together!
Bodhi Svaha — Awake forever!

(Repeat)
Gate Gate — Leave it all behind!
Paragate — clear your worried mind!
Parasamgate — cross to the other shore!
Bodhi Svaha — don't cry no more!

Gone, gone, gone beyond,
To the place where we belong.
Awakening is here, the dream is through,
The Emptiness Blues is the song for you.
