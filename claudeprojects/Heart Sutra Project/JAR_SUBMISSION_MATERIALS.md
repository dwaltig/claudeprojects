## Abstract (Tailored for JAR)

This article argues that the *Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya Sūtra* (Heart Sūtra), when interpreted through an African-American Blues epistemology, functions as a text of survival technology developed under conditions of radical precarity. Drawing on Clyde Woods's theorization of the Blues as a system of critique, explanation, and survival, I propose that the Sūtra's systematic negations—"no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind"—operate not as metaphysical abstractions but as a strategic dissolution of the self-as-target.

The analysis centers on William Altig's "The Heart Sutra Reborn: An American Blues Interpretation" (2025) as a primary document of Africana religious production. This vernacular translation renders the ancient Sanskrit text into the idiom of the American South, deploying call-and-response structures, Blues cadences, and survival practices that resonate with the Black church and juke joint alike. I argue that this translation is not an appropriation of Buddhist thought but an act of Black religious agency that reclaims emptiness (*śūnyatā*) as mobility rather than void—the knowledge of how to remain fluid in a rigid world.

The article proceeds in five movements: (1) establishing the Heart Sūtra as a "crisis text" spoken within Avalokiteśvara's realization rather than as doctrinal instruction; (2) reading the negation litany as dispossession rather than abstraction, in dialogue with Ralph Ellison's phenomenology of invisibility; (3) reframing *śūnyatā* as survival strategy rather than nihilism; (4) interpreting the closing mantra (*gate gate pāragate*) as performative release akin to the Blues "shout"; and (5) addressing the ethics of vernacular translation as restoration of impact.

This study contributes to emerging conversations in Africana religious studies about Black engagement with Asian religions, the function of religion under conditions of precarity, and the category of "Africana religion" itself. It argues that when the "hellhounds are on the trail," the realization of emptiness is not a philosophical luxury but a requisite tool for survival.

## Cover Letter

[Date]

Dear Editors of the *Journal of Africana Religions*,

I am pleased to submit my article, **"The Hellhounds and the Void: The Heart Sūtra as Survival Technology in Black Religious Thought,"** for consideration in the *Journal of Africana Religions*.

This article proposes a novel interpretation of the Buddhist Heart Sūtra through the lens of African-American Blues epistemology. Drawing on Clyde Woods's theorization of the Blues as a system of survival knowledge, I argue that the Sūtra's famous negations—"no eyes, no ears, no body, no mind"—function not as metaphysical abstractions but as a strategic dissolution of the self-as-target under conditions of radical precarity. The analysis centers on a recent vernacular translation, "The Heart Sutra Reborn" (2025), which renders the Sanskrit text into the idiom of the American South, treating it as a primary document of Africana religious production.

This work contributes to the journal's mission of expanding the boundaries of what constitutes "Africana religion." It engages with the growing body of scholarship on Black Buddhism (Jan Willis, Charles Johnson, Zenju Earthlyn Manuel) while grounding its argument in the theoretical frameworks of Blues epistemology and critical race theory. The article addresses the functional utility of religion in Black life—not as doctrine but as survival technology.

I believe this article is well-suited for JAR given the journal's commitment to interdisciplinary approaches and its explicit interest in challenging received definitions of the field. The work has not been previously published and is not under consideration elsewhere.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

William Altig
Houston, Texas

## Strategic Notes for Submission

### Framing Emphasis
- **Center the Blues** as the interpretive lens; the Sūtra is the *object* of study
- Treat "The Heart Sutra Reborn" as a **primary source** of Africana religious literature
- Heavy citations from Africana theorists: Clyde Woods, James Cone, Charles Long, Houston Baker
- Buddhist citations are *supporting*, not *central*

### Anticipating Reviewer Concerns
| Potential Concern | Pre-emptive Response |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| "Why is a Buddhist text in JAR?" | Frame as Black religious agency appropriating non-Christian resources; cite Du Bois, Thurman engagement with Asia |
| "Is this 'authentic' Buddhism?" | Use Kumārajīva precedent; Buddhism has always adapted to new cultures |
| "Is this parody?" | Emphasize the scholarly apparatus, footnotes, and serious theological engagement in the source text |

### Bibliography Must Include
- **Woods, Clyde.** *Development Arrested: The Blues and Plantation Power in the Mississippi Delta*
- **Baker, Houston A.** *Blues, Ideology, and Afro-American Literature: A Vernacular Theory*
- **Cone, James.** *The Spirituals and the Blues*
- **Willis, Jan.** *Dreaming Me: Black, Baptist, and Buddhist*
- **Manuel, Zenju Earthlyn.** *The Way of Tenderness*
- **Lopez, Donald S.** *Elaborations on Emptiness: Uses of the Heart Sutra*
