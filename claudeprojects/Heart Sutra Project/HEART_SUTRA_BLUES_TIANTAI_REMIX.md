## The Setup: The Three Truths of the Blues

*(Spoken over a walking bass line—steady, unshakeable)*

Now, folks usually think the Blues is about being sad. Or they think "Emptiness" means you got nothing. But the Old Master Zhiyi? He sat down with a beat-up guitar and played us a different chord. He called it the **Three Truths**, but it ain't a list you memorize for a test. It's a feeling you get when the night is deep.

First, you hit the **Empty**. That's the Silence. It's when the money's gone, the body's aching, and you realize ain't none of this permanent. It's like the moment before you strike the string—pure potential, wide open space. But you can't live in the silence, can you? You got to play the song. That's the **Provisional**. It's the note ringing out. It's the joy, the pain, the tax man knocking. It ain't gonna last, but it sure feels real while it's vibrating.

And the secret? The secret is the **Middle**. That’s the Groove. You see, the Silence and the Note happen *at the same time*. You don't leave the world to find the truth; the truth is right here in the mess. It's that sweet spot where you ain't holding on, and you ain't pushing away. You just riding the wave. That's the Middle Way. That's the Groove.

So this ain't a song about running away. This is a song about waking up *right where you stand*.

## Verse 1: The Bodhisattva’s Jam

**Avalokiteśvara**, the High Priest of Compassion,
Was deep in the pocket of the Wisdom Beat.
He looked down at the **Five Heaps** of trouble—
(That’s your body, your feelings, your thinking, your habits, your consciousness)—
And he saw the joke.

He didn't see them as *solid walls*.
He saw them as *music*.
He saw they were **Empty of Self**, flowing like a river.
And just like that? The suffering didn't stick.
He walked right through the fire, and he didn't get burned.

---

## Verse 2: The Lesson for Sharp-Note (Śāriputra)

*(The tempo picks up—a driving shuffle)*

He turned to old **Śāriputra**—the smartest monk in the room, but a little too tight, a little too by-the-book. He said:

"Listen here, Sharp-Note! You trying to separate the holy from the street. You trying to find the silence by stopping the music. But it don't work like that.

**Form is Emptiness.** (The guitar string is just vibrating air).
**Emptiness is Form.** (But that air makes a real sound).

Don't you try to split 'em up!
The trouble *is* the liberation.
The noise *is* the peace.
Your messy life? That ain't an obstacle. That’s the instrument!

Feeling, thinking, intending, knowing—
It’s all just waves on the same ocean.
Wet is water, water is wet.
You can't have one without the other."

---

## Verse 3: The Nature of the Groove

"So listen close to the **Characteristics of this Groove**:

It don't **Start**, and it don't **Stop**. (The Eternal Rhythm).
It ain't **Dirty**, and it ain't **Clean**. (It’s just real).
It don't **Get Bigger**, it don't **Get Smaller**. (It’s always whole).

You think you getting better? That’s an illusion.
You think you falling behind? That’s an illusion.
You are *already* part of the Great Song. You just forgot the lyrics."

---

## Verse 4: Clearing the Stage (The Great Deconstruction)

*(The instruments drop out. Just a single foot stomp. Boom. Boom. Boom.)*

"So in this absolute freedom:
Forget your **Eyes, Ears, Nose, Tongue, Body, Mind**.
Forget the **Sights, Sounds, Smells, Tastes, Touches, Thoughts**.
Those are just the provisional players. They ain't the Bandleader.

Forget the **Twelve Links** of how you got into this mess.
Ignorance? Gone.
Old Age and Death? Just changing clothes.

And here’s the kicker, Sharp-Note:
Forget the **Four Noble Truths** too.
**No Suffering.** (Because who is there to suffer?)
**No Cause.** (It’s all just happening).
**No End.** (Because it never really started).
**No Path.** (Because you’re already home).

**No Wisdom to get.**
**nothing to Attain.**
Because you can't 'get' what you already *are*."

---

## Verse 5: The No-Fear Boogies

"Because the Bodhisattva ain't trying to 'get' anything,
His mind has **No Obstruction**.
Like a bird flying through the sky—no trace, no track.
**No Obstruction** implies **No Fear**.

What you gonna be afraid of?
Dying? That’s just the song changing key.
Losing? You never owned it anyway.

He leaves behind all them **Upside-Down Dreams**—
Thinking money is real, thinking fame is real, thinking the 'Self' is real.
And he steps into **Nirvana**.
Not a dead silence. But the **Alive Silence**.
The Ultimate Cool."

---

## Verse 6: The Universal Refrain

"All the Buddhas—Past, Present, and Future—
From the ancient days to right now downtown—
They all woke up to this same beat.
**Prajñāpāramitā**. The Perfection of Wisdom.
The Wisdom that knows:
**The Mud is the Lotus. The Lotus is the Mud.**
**The Sorrow is the Buddha. The Buddha is the Sorrow.**"

---

## The Outro: The Great Mantra

*(The band comes back in—full power, gospel choir rising)*

"So knowing this, you gotta sing the mantra.
This ain't just magic words.
This is the **Great Bright Spell**.
The **Unsurpassed Spell**.
The **Unequal-Equal Spell**.
It wipes away all the tears. It’s strictly **True**, no lie.

Sing it with your chest open!
Sing it for the empty sky!
Sing it for the broken heart!

**Gate Gate** (Gone, Gone!)
**Pāragate** (Gone Over!)
**Pārasaṃgate** (Gone All the Way Over!)
**Bodhi Svāhā!** (WAKE UP! AMEN!)"

### The Bluesman's Tiantai Footnote

> "Why this version? Because the old way said 'Life is suffering, get out.' But the **Tiantai Way** says 'Life is the display of the Eternal.' We don't play the Blues to complain. We play the Blues to transmute the suffering into Gold. The 'Gone Beyond' ain't a place you go *to*. It's a place you come *from*."
