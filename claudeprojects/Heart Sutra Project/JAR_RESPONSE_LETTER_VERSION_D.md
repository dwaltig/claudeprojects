I am deeply grateful to the reviewers for their rigorous and insightful feedback. In response to their comments—particularly the technical and ethical concerns raised regarding the use of AI—I have substantially revised the manuscript to its final form. 

The primary shift in this revision is to reframe the AI-assisted "Blues vernacular" translation from an attempted artifact to a **"heuristic limit-case" and a "negative proof."** 

## I. Response to Reviewer 1 (Expansion of Black Buddhist Scholarship)
Reviewer 1 suggested a broader engagement with the "Black Buddhist Turn." I have integrated the following scholars and concepts:

*   **Kamilah Majied:** I have integrated Majied’s analysis of "meditative inquiry" and her work on the unity of suffering and joy in the Blues.
*   **Tina Turner and Prince:** I now cite Ralph Craig III regarding the "sonic liturgy" of Turner's vocalizations and Pamela Ayo Yetunde on the rhythmic devotion of Prince.
*   **Howard Thurman:** I have added Thurman’s concept of "centering down" to link the Blues "rest" with meditative practice.

## II. Response to Reviewer 2 (Technical Rigor & Ethical Positioning)
Reviewer 2 raised significant concerns regarding the identity of the translator and the risk of cultural extraction.

*   **The "Zombie Text" and the Chinese Room:** I have rewritten Section 6 to explicitly address the limitations of the AI experiment using John Searle's "Chinese Room" thought experiment. I argue that the AI produces a "zombie text"—stylistically accurate but ontologically hollow—which serves as a negative proof that the lived lineage of the Blues cannot be extracted or encoded.
*   **Authorial Positionality:** I have integrated a clear positionality statement into the core of the argument, acknowledging that my own limitations as a white scholar mirror the AI's: we can both point to the fire, but neither has been burned by it.
*   **Resonance vs. Genealogy:** I have added explicit language throughout (and specifically in the methodology) to clarify that this project maps a **structural resonance** rather than claiming a historical or literal genealogy.
*   **Appendix Truncation:** To avoid the trap of "digital minstrelsy," I have truncated the appendix to three strategic excerpts, purely for the purpose of demonstrating the "mechanical bird" phenomenon of the translation experiment.

## III. Final Scholarly Polishing
In this final round, I have also:
*   Expanded Footnote 38 to precisely define the distinction between the **syntax** of formal analytical structures and the **semantics** of communal, embodied practice.
*   Corrected minor technical errors and malformed footnotes (e.g., Saidiya Hartman citation).
*   Performed a light copy-edit to ensure the rhythmic cadence of the prose reflects the "Blues" subject matter.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Title** | "The Hellhounds and the Void" | Title preserved |
| **Word Count** | ~8,200 words | 7,793 words |
| **Methodology** | Translation as centerpiece | Translation as heuristic negative proof |

## Conclusion

This final version of the article represents a much firmer bridge between Sanskrit negations and the Mississippi Delta. By centering Black wisdom and explicitly naming my own positionality as a site of tension, I hope to offer a contribution that is both philosophically rigorous and ethically transparent.

**AI Disclosure:** I used AI to assist in structural drafting, vernacular idiom generation for the appendix, and bibliographic verification. The philosophical synthesis, the "Chinese Room" critique of digital extraction, and the reflexive engagement with positionality represent the author's primary intellectual contribution and were conducted through rigorous study of the cited scholarship.
