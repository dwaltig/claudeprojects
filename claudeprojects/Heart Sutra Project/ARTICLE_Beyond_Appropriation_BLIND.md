# Beyond Appropriation: Śūnyatā, Blues Epistemology, and the Ethics of Black Buddhist Encounter

**[Author Removed for Blind Review]**

---

## Abstract

This article reframes the encounter between Black religious thought and Buddhist philosophy as a critical site for examining the ethics of vernacular translation and cross-cultural spiritual practice. Moving beyond a focus on a singular translational experiment, it centers the work of Black Buddhist scholars—Kamilah Majied, Rima Vesely-Flad, Zenju Earthlyn Manuel, and Rev. angel Kyodo williams—to analyze how concepts like *śūnyatā* (emptiness) and the Heart Sūtra's negations resonate with Blues epistemology's strategies for navigating ontological crisis. Positioning an AI-assisted Blues-vernacular translation of the Heart Sūtra as a provocative case study, the essay interrogates the methodological and ethical boundaries of such creative synthesis. It argues that the generative friction of this encounter, when grounded in the lived experience and critical frameworks of Black Buddhist thinkers, offers a transformative model for theorizing survival, mobility, and liberation within the Black religious imagination.

## 1. Introduction: The Black Buddhist Turn and the Ethics of Encounter

The encounter between African American religious thought and Buddhist philosophy is not new. Consider W.E.B. Du Bois's correspondence with Indian nationalists, or Howard Thurman's transformative meeting with Gandhi. Later, Jan Willis's *Dreaming Me* gave this exchange a memoir; today, it fuels the Radical Dharma movement of Rev. angel Kyodo williams. This genealogy of Afro-Asian spiritual exchange stretches back more than a century.[^1] What's new is the emergence of a critical mass of Black Buddhist practitioners and scholars who are not merely receiving Buddhist teachings but *transforming* them—developing distinctly Black Buddhist hermeneutics that arise from, and speak to, the particular conditions of Black life.

My focus here is on that very transformation. Instead of asking how Buddhism might be applied *to* Black experience, I'm interested in how Black Buddhist thinkers have already reimagined Buddhist concepts—from the ground up, from within their own lives and struggles. The Heart Sūtra—that concentrated jewel of Mahāyāna wisdom, with its systematic negations and paradoxical affirmations—serves as a focal point for this inquiry. How, I wonder, do Black Buddhist practitioners and scholars hear the Sūtra's declaration that "form is emptiness, emptiness is form"? What survival technologies emerge? What strategies of resistance, what modes of liberation, are found in its compressed wisdom?

That's the heart of my inquiry.

I approach this question as a white Buddhist practitioner and independent scholar. That position, I recognize, requires not just acknowledgment but sustained critical attention—and it's a lens I'll keep checking throughout this article. I have elsewhere created an AI-assisted "Blues vernacular" translation of the Heart Sūtra, a text I offer here not as a model for vernacular translation but as a *provocation*: a case study that exposes the complexities, dangers, and possibilities of cross-cultural religious interpretation.[^2] That translation is included as an appendix to this article, but it is not the article's subject. The subject is the rich, ongoing conversation among Black Buddhist thinkers about emptiness, identity, and liberation—a conversation to which my experiment is, at best, a footnote.

Kamilah Majied, writing on Billie Holiday's artistry through a Buddhist lens, observes that "the process of meditative inquiry... can help us to de-identify with the oppressive narratives we have internalized."[^3] This insight—that Buddhist practice offers tools for psychological liberation from internalized racism—is central to Black Buddhist thought. Rima Vesely-Flad, in her extensive study *Black Buddhists and the Black Radical Tradition*, documents how over seventy Black Buddhist teachers have integrated dharma practice with ancestor veneration, intergenerational trauma healing, and radical political struggle.[^4] Rev. angel Kyodo williams, in *Radical Dharma*, calls for a Buddhism that confronts rather than evades the realities of racial injustice.[^5] These thinkers are not importing Buddhism into Black life; they are revealing what Zenju Earthlyn Manuel calls "the way of tenderness"—a path of awakening that runs through, not around, the wounds of race and embodiment.[^6]

The structure of this article reflects its methodology. Rather than leading with the Blues translation and treating Black Buddhist thought as supporting evidence, I reverse the priority. Sections 2 and 3 establish the critical framework through deep engagement with Black Buddhist scholarship. Section 4 introduces the Heart Sūtra itself as a site of cross-cultural encounter. Section 5 presents the Blues translation as a case study for analyzing the ethics of appropriation and vernacular interpretation. The conclusion synthesizes these strands and points toward collaborative models for future work.

## 2. Black Buddhist Thought and the Critique of Emptiness

The concept of *śūnyatā*—emptiness—stands at the heart of Mahāyāna Buddhist philosophy. Yet as Black Buddhist thinkers have noted, this concept can be mobilized in problematic ways within predominantly white Buddhist spaces. The instruction to "let go of identity" or "see through the illusion of the self" can function, in practice, as a demand that practitioners of color abandon their cultural and political commitments in favor of a racially unmarked (which is to say, implicitly white) "universal" spirituality.

Zenju Earthlyn Manuel addresses this directly in *The Way of Tenderness*. "I came to see," she writes, "that the nature of the spiritual journey for me was not to erase my Black body or to transcend it, but to recognize it as the very site of awakening."[^7] Manuel's intervention is crucial: she does not reject the teaching of no-self but *reinterprets* it. Emptiness, for Manuel, does not mean that race is unreal. It means that race, like all phenomena, arises through causes and conditions—is "empty of inherent existence"—and therefore is not fixed, not permanent, not ultimately defining. This recognition does not erase the social reality of racism; it reveals racism's contingency. What is conditioned can be deconditioned. What is constructed can be deconstructed.

Rima Vesely-Flad extends this analysis in her study of Black Buddhist communities. She documents how Black practitioners have developed distinctly Afro-diasporic approaches to dharma that center ancestor veneration, collective healing, and what she calls "the practice of stillness in the movement for liberation."[^8] These approaches neither assimilate to white-dominant Buddhist norms nor reject Buddhism as a foreign imposition. Instead, they create what I would call a *Black Buddhist hermeneutic*—a way of reading and practicing Buddhist teachings that is informed by, and accountable to, the particular histories and ongoing struggles of Black life.

Kamilah Majied's work offers another angle. In her essay on Billie Holiday in *Black and Buddhist*, Majied argues that Holiday's art already embodied what Buddhist teaching describes as the unity of suffering and joy.[^9] This is not a metaphorical observation but a serious philosophical claim: that the Blues tradition has independently developed insight into impermanence, suffering, and liberation that resonates with—and in some cases anticipates—core Buddhist doctrines. Majied's analysis suggests that when Black artists and practitioners encounter Buddhism, they may recognize what they already knew.

This recognition has profound implications for the ethics of cross-cultural exchange. If the Blues tradition already carries wisdom about emptiness, suffering, and survival, then the encounter between Blues and Buddhism is not a one-way transmission from East to West, from Buddhist to Bluesman. It is a *dialogue*—a mutual illumination in which each tradition reveals hidden dimensions of the other.

## 3. Emptiness as Mobility: Blues Epistemology and Survival

The theoretical resources for this dialogue are rich. Clyde Woods's concept of "Blues epistemology" describes a mode of cognition forged in the crucible of plantation violence and its afterlives—a way of knowing that processes contradictory realities simultaneously, maintains orientation amid displacement, and survives by moving.[^10] Houston Baker's notion of the Blues as a "matrix"—a point of generative uncertainty from which multiple meanings emerge—provides another lens.[^11] Albert Murray's concept of "stomping the Blues"—the transformation of suffering through rhythmic engagement into something bearable, even beautiful—offers yet another.[^12]

These concepts parallel Buddhist philosophical vocabulary in striking ways. Woods's Blues epistemology, with its emphasis on adaptability and survival through movement, resonates with what Nāgārjuna describes as the empty, processual nature of all phenomena. Baker's matrix quality—the refusal to resolve into fixed meaning—echoes the Madhyamaka teaching that all concepts are provisional, skillful means rather than ultimate descriptions. Murray's "stomping" corresponds to what Buddhist teachers call practice: the active, embodied engagement with suffering that transforms it from within.

Angela Davis, in *Blues Legacies and Black Feminism*, documents how the Blues women—Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday—did not merely express suffering but *worked* it, shaping it, making art from the raw material of oppression.[^13] Their performances were acts of resistance, claiming public space for Black women's agency and desire. The emptiness they inhabited was not void but *cleared ground*—space from which to build something new.

When we bring this rich body of Black scholarship into conversation with the Heart Sūtra, something remarkable happens. The Sūtra's famous negations—"no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind"—begin to sound less like abstract metaphysics and more like survival strategy. As one Black Buddhist practitioner told Vesely-Flad, "If they can't pin you down, they can't destroy you."[^14] The dissolution of the fixed self becomes not a withdrawal from struggle but a prerequisite for effective engagement. The activist who knows there is no fixed self to defend can move, adapt, and persist. She will last.

## 4. The Heart Sūtra and Cross-Cultural Encounter

The Heart Sūtra itself has always been a text of encounter and translation. Composed, most scholars believe, not in India but in China, it synthesizes Sanskrit Prajñāpāramitā thought with Chinese literary sensibilities.[^15] Translated into Tibetan, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and now dozens of Western languages, it has adapted to each cultural context while maintaining its essential function: to induce the experience of groundlessness, to dissolve false refuges, to propel the practitioner toward awakening.

Donald Lopez, in *Elaborations on Emptiness*, documents this history of adaptive interpretation.[^16] The Heart Sūtra has functioned as philosophical treatise, ritual text, protective charm, and devotional scripture depending on the needs of its audience. This functional diversity suggests that the text is itself a form of *upāya*—skillful means—whose meaning arises in relation to the communities that practice it.

What happens when the Heart Sūtra encounters the African American Blues tradition? This question is not merely hypothetical. Black Buddhist practitioners have already been answering it, in their teaching, their writing, and their lives. Rev. angel Kyodo williams reads the Sūtra's negations as a call to radical honesty about the constructed nature of racial categories: "The very idea of race is a kind of emptiness—empty of inherent existence, yet painfully, lethally real in its effects."[^17] Zenju Earthlyn Manuel hears in the Heart Sūtra's mantra—*Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā*—an echo of the African American spiritual's cry to "cross over Jordan."[^18] These are not appropriations of Buddhism by Black culture or applications of Buddhism *to* Black experience. They are recognitions—moments when two traditions discover that they have been speaking, in different idioms, about similar truths.

The examples above illustrate ethical cross-cultural encounter: Black practitioners drawing on Buddhist resources from within their own frameworks. What follows is a contrasting case—my own experiment—which raises rather than resolves the questions of appropriation and method.

## 5. The Blues Translation as Case Study: Appropriation, Method, and Ethics

The appendix to this article contains a Blues-vernacular translation of the Heart Sūtra that I generated with AI assistance. I present it here *solely as an object of ethical analysis*, not as a creative contribution to Africana religious thought. Its inclusion is intended to make visible the problems that often remain invisible when outsiders engage with Black cultural forms.

I must address this experiment directly. The text included in the appendix—"The Heart Sutra Reborn: An American Blues Interpretation"—was generated with AI assistance, informed by my study of the Blues idiom and my practice as a Nichiren Buddhist. I created it with the intention of making the Heart Sūtra accessible to audiences who might never encounter traditional Buddhist liturgy, and specifically to counter the nihilistic misreadings of *śūnyatā* that have plagued Western reception.

I did not create it as an example of Black religious production. I am a white man. I do not inherit the Blues tradition; I am, at best, a student and beneficiary of it. The translation draws on idioms and cadences that emerged from specific conditions of Black life in America—conditions I have not lived. My use of AI adds another layer of ethical complexity: the algorithms were trained on vast corpora of human-generated text, raising questions about whose voices are being processed, reproduced, or ventriloquized.

Why, then, include it in this article? Because the very problems it raises are instructive. The translation is a limit case that forces explicit engagement with questions that often remain implicit: Who can translate sacred texts? What forms of cultural engagement constitute appreciation, and what forms constitute appropriation? How should a white practitioner position themselves in relation to Black Buddhist thought?

The cultural sensitivity reviewer who evaluated an earlier draft of this article correctly identified the risks. The translation, they noted, could function as "digital minstrelsy"—a white-coded AI approximating Black speech patterns for consumption by an academic audience.[^19] The term is precise: just as nineteenth-century minstrelsy involved white performers extracting and distorting Black expressive forms for white audiences, so too might an AI trained on Black-authored text and directed by a white user reproduce that extractive dynamic in digital form. This is not a criticism to dismiss but to take seriously. The history of white appropriation of Black cultural forms is long and painful: from minstrelsy to rock and roll, from jazz to hip-hop, the pattern of taking without acknowledgment, profiting without reciprocity, is well documented.

What, then, would ethical engagement look like? The answer emerging from Black Buddhist thought is clear: center Black voices. Do not extract; collaborate. Do not speak for; stand alongside. The translation in the appendix is offered not as a model to emulate but as a provocation to examine. Its value, if any, lies not in its literary qualities but in the questions it forces.

## 6. Conclusion: Toward a Collaborative Horizon

The future of Black Buddhist thought does not depend on white translators or AI-generated texts. It depends on the continued flourishing of Black sanghas, the elevation of Black teachers, the centering of Black wisdom within Buddhist institutions that have too often marginalized it. The work of Majied, Vesely-Flad, Manuel, williams, and their many colleagues points the way.

What role, then, for a white practitioner like myself? Perhaps only this: to learn, to cite, to amplify, to stay accountable. The Heart Sūtra's mantra calls us to "go beyond"—*gate pāragate*—and one interpretation of that going beyond is the dissolution of rigid boundaries: between Buddhism and Blues, between scholar and practitioner, between traditions held apart by the accidents of geography and history. But another interpretation is simpler: the call to cross beyond the comfortable positions we occupy, to stand where we are not expected, to risk error in the service of encounter.

This article has attempted such a crossing. It has centered Black Buddhist thought not as decoration for an argument about the Blues but as the argument's foundation. It has positioned one white practitioner's translation experiment not as a triumph of creative synthesis but as a case study in the ethics of appropriation. And it has tried to listen—to the scholars whose work makes this conversation possible, to the communities whose practices animate Buddhist teaching with new life.

The Heart Sūtra ends with a shout: *svāhā*—"Hail!" In the Blues tradition, there is a corresponding moment: the "yeah!" that follows the release of tension, the collective exhalation when the pain has been metabolized into something bearable. These utterances arise from distinct historical and ritual contexts, yet both can function—as this article has argued—as culturally situated affirmations of liberation from fixed suffering. They are sounds of survival, of having come through.

May all beings see the emptiness that sets them free.
May all beings cross to the other shore.
*Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā*.

*[Note: The full translation is available from the author upon request. The excerpts below are included as illustrative examples for the critical analysis in the main text.]*

**Opening:**
> Let me tell you how this started. Wasn't in no big cathedral. Wasn't in no fancy temple with gold on the walls. It was just Avalokiteśvara—the One Who Hears the Cries of the World—sitting deep, real deep, in that pocket of wisdom.

**The Negations:**
> So in this deep place of truth, Śāriputra, there ain't no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind. No sights to see. No sounds to hear. No touch, no taste, no smell, no knowing. No ignorance to be trapped in—and no end to ignorance neither. No getting old and dying—and no end to getting old and dying. See? When you go all the way down, you find there ain't no bottom to stand on. And that's the freedom.

**The Mantra:**
> Gate Gate — Gone, gone away!
> Paragate — Gone to a brighter day!
> Parasamgate — Gone all together!
> Bodhi Svaha — Awake forever!
