- The lotus has multiple layers of blue petals graduating from deep blue at base to lighter blue at tips, with subtle golden-yellow stamens at center
- Behind the lotus: a glowing golden heart shape, ethereal and translucent, formed from soft golden light
- The heart appears to embrace or cradle the lotus
- Soft golden light rays and small sparkles emanate outward from behind the heart-lotus combination
- Wisps of golden energy flowing upward like gentle smoke or mist
