## 1. Introduction

The *Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya Sūtra*, commonly known as the **Heart Sutra**, is the distilled essence (*hṛdaya*) of the vast Perfection of Wisdom literature. While the larger Prajñāpāramitā corpus (spanning 100,000 lines) exhaustively catalogs the emptiness of all phenomena, the Heart Sutra strikes directly at the core of the bodhisattva's realization.

In the context of the **Lotus Sutra Project**, we approach this text not merely as a negation of existence, but through the **Tiantai lens of the Threefold Truth**:
1.  **Emptiness (Śūnyatā):** The negation of inherent nature (*svabhāva*).
2.  **Provisionality (Prajñapti):** The conventional validity of phenomena.
3.  **The Middle (Madhyamā):** The simultaneous non-duality of Empty and Provisional.

This scholarly edition presents the Chinese source text (Taishō 251) alongside a precise English translation, Sanskrit comparative notes, and philosophical commentary connecting the wisdom of emptiness to the Lotus Sutra's "One Vehicle."

## 2. The Text

### I. The Awakening of Avalokiteśvara

> **觀自在菩薩。行深般若波羅蜜多時。照見五蘊皆空。度一切苦厄。**
>
> *Guānzìzài Púsà. Xíng shēn bōrě bōluómìduō shí. Zhàojiàn wǔyùn jiē kōng. Dù yīqiè kǔ è.*

**Translation:**
When **Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva** was practicing the deep **Prajñāpāramitā** (Perfection of Wisdom), he illuminated and saw that the **five aggregates**[^1] are all empty (*śūnya*), and [thereby] crossed over all suffering and difficulty.

**Sanskrit Parallel:**
*āryāvalokiteśvaro bodhisattvo gambhīrāṃ prajñāpāramitācaryāṃ caramāṇo vyavalokayati sma: pañca skandhās tāṃś ca svabhāvaśūnyān paśyati sma.*

[^1]: **Five Aggregates (Skt. *pañca-skandha*, Ch. 五蘊 *wǔ yùn*):** The constituent elements of sentient existence: (1) Form (*rūpa*), (2) Feeling (*vedanā*), (3) Perception (*saṃjñā*), (4) Mental Formations (*saṃskāra*), (5) Consciousness (*vijñāna*). The realization that these are "empty" is the breaking of the illusion of a permanent Self (*ātman*).

### II. Form is Emptiness (The Teaching to Śāriputra)

> **舍利子。色不異空。空不異色。色即是空。空即是色。受想行識。亦復如是。**
>
> *Shèlìzǐ. Sè bù yì kōng. Kōng bù yì sè. Sè jí shì kōng. Kōng jí shì sè. Shòu xiǎng xíng shì. Yì fù rúshì.*

**Translation:**
**Śāriputra**![^2] Form is not different from emptiness; emptiness is not different from form. **Form precisely is emptiness; emptiness precisely is form.** The same is true for feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness.

**Scholarly Commentary:**
This famous stanza articulates the non-duality of the **Two Truths**: 
*   "Form is not different from emptiness" denies the substantiality of the phenomenal world (Truth of Emptiness).
*   "Emptiness is not different from form" denies nihilism (Truth of Provisionality).
*   "Form *is* emptiness" reveals the **Middle Way**: one does not leave the world to find reality; reality is the nature of the world itself.

[^2]: **Śāriputra (Ch. 舍利子 *Shèlìzǐ*):** The wisest of the Buddha's disciple monks (*śrāvakas*). In the *Lotus Sutra*, Śāriputra is the first to receive the prediction of Buddhahood (Chapter 3), bridging the gap between the "Lesser Vehicle" and the "One Vehicle." Here, he represents the analytical wisdom that must be transcended by the Bodhisattva's non-dual insight.

### III. The Characteristics of Emptiness

> **舍利子。是諸法空相。不生不滅。不垢不淨。不增不減。**
>
> *Shèlìzǐ. Shì zhū fǎ kōng xiàng. Bù shēng bù miè. Bù gòu bù jìng. Bù zēng bù jiǎn.*

**Translation:**
Śāriputra! Characteristics of the emptiness of all dharmas [are]: **not arising, not ceasing; not defiled, not pure; not increasing, not decreasing.**

**Tiantai Note:**
This series of negations describes Ultimate Reality (*Dharmatā*). From the perspective of the **Lotus Sutra** (Chapter 16), this "not arising, not ceasing" is the hallmark of the **Eternal Buddha's lifespan**—a reality that transcends historical manifestation (birth) and extinction (paranirvāṇa).

### IV. The Great Negations (Deconstructing the Categories)

> **是故空中無色。無受想行識。無眼耳鼻舌身意。無色聲香味觸法。無眼界。乃至無意識界。**
>
> *Shì gù kōng zhòng wú sè. Wú shòu xiǎng xíng shì. Wú yǎn ěr bí shé shēn yì. Wú sè shēng xiāng wèi chù fǎ. Wú yǎn jiè. Nǎi zhì wú yìshí jiè.*

**Translation:**
Therefore, within emptiness there is **no form**, no feeling, perception, mental formations, or consciousness.
[There is] **no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind**.
[There is] **no form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or dharmas**.
[There is] **no eye-realm** (element of vision), up to **no consciousness-realm**.

> **無無明。亦無無明盡。乃至無老死。亦無老死盡。**
>
> *Wú wúmíng. Yì wú wúmíng jìn. Nǎi zhì wú lǎosǐ. Yì wú lǎosǐ jìn.*

**Translation:**
[There is] **no ignorance**, and also no extinction of ignorance; up to **no old age and death**, and also no extinction of old age and death. (Negating the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination).

> **無苦集滅道。無智亦無得。以無所得故。**
>
> *Wú kǔ jí miè dào. Wú zhì yì wú dé. Yǐ wú suǒ dé gù.*

**Translation:**
[There is] **no suffering, origination, cessation, or path** (Negating the Four Noble Truths).
[There is] **no wisdom, and also no attainment**.
Because there is **nothing to be attained**.

**Scholarly Commentary:**
This section systematically negates the doctrinal categories of Early Buddhism (Abhidharma):
1.  **Five Aggregates:** The constituents of the person.
2.  **Twelve Sense Bases (*āyatana*):** The sensory interaction.
3.  **Eighteen Realms (*dhātu*):** The cognitive process.
4.  **Twelve Links (*pratītyasamutpāda*):** The chain of causation (Pratyekabuddha path).
5.  **Four Noble Truths (*āryasatya*):** The path of liberation (Śrāvaka path).

By negating even "Wisdom" and "Attainment," the sutra prevents reification of Enlightenment itself. It clears the ground for the **Bodhisattva's realization**, which does not "grasp" Nirvana as an object.

### V. The Bodhisattva's Freedom

> **菩提薩埵。依般若波羅蜜多故。心無罣礙。無罣礙故。無有恐怖。遠離顛倒夢想。究竟涅槃。**
>
> *Pútísàduǒ. Yī bōrě bōluómìduō gù. Xīn wú guà'ài. Wú guà'ài gù. Wú yǒu kǒngbù. Yuǎnlí diāndǎo mèngxiǎng. Jiūjìng nièpán.*

**Translation:**
**Bodhisattvas**, relying on Prajñāpāramitā, have **no obstruction in their minds**.
Because there is no obstruction, they have **no fear**.
Falling far away from **inverted dream-thinking**, they [realize] **Ultimate Nirvāṇa**.[^3]

[^3]: **Ultimate Nirvāṇa (Ch. 究竟涅槃 *jiūjìng nièpán*):** Distinguishes the Bodhisattva's goal from the "incomplete" Nirvana of the Arhat. In the *Lotus Sutra*, this is revealed to be the state of the Tathāgata, not merely the cessation of suffering, but the active, eternal play of Wisdom.

### VI. The Fruit of Enlightenment

> **三世諸佛。依般若波羅蜜多故。得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。**
>
> *Sānshì zhūfó. Yī bōrě bōluómìduō gù. Dé ānòuduōluó sānmiǎo sānpútí.*

**Translation:**
All **Buddhas of the three times** (past, present, and future), relying on Prajñāpāramitā, attain **Anuttarā-Samyak-Saṃbodhi** (Unsurpassed Perfect Enlightenment).

---

### VII. The Great Mantra

> **故知般若波羅蜜多。是大神咒。是大明咒。是無上咒。是無等等咒。能除一切苦。真實不虛。**
>
> *Gù zhī bōrě bōluómìduō. Shì dà shén zhòu. Shì dà míng zhòu. Shì wú shàng zhòu. Shì wú děng děng zhòu. Néng chú yīqiè kǔ. Zhēnshí bù xū.*

**Translation:**
Therefore know that Prajñāpāramitā is the **great spiritual mantra** (*mahā-mantra*), is the **great illumination mantra** (*mahā-vidyā-mantra*), is the **unsurpassed mantra** (*anuttara-mantra*), is the **unequaled mantra** (*asamasama-mantra*). It is able to remove all suffering; it is **true, not false**.

> **故說般若波羅蜜多咒。即說咒曰。**
>
> *Gù shuō bōrě bōluómìduō zhòu. Jí shuō zhòu yuē:*

**Translation:**
Therefore, proclaim the Prajñāpāramitā mantra. Proclaim the mantra thus:

> **揭諦揭諦　波羅揭諦　波羅僧揭諦　菩提薩婆訶。**
>
> *Jiēdì jiēdì. Bōluó jiēdì. Bōluósēng jiēdì. Pútí sàpóhē.*

**Sanskrit Reconstruction:**
***Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā!***

**Translation of the Mantra:**
"Gone, gone, gone beyond, gone completely beyond—Awakening, Hail!"

## 3. Analysis: The Heart Sutra and the One Vehicle

While the **Heart Sutra** belongs to the Prajñā period (according to Tiantai classification), it serves as the essential "clearing" operation that makes the **Lotus Sutra** possible.

1.  **Deconstruction:** Before the Buddha can reveal the "Real" (the eternal life of the Buddha, the universality of Buddha-nature), He must first deconstruct the "Provisional" (the rigid categories of the Arhat path). The Heart Sutra performs this radical surgery.
2.  **No Attainment:** By declaring "no wisdom and no attainment," the Heart Sutra collapses the distance between the Seeker and the Goal. This prepares the ground for the Lotus Sutra's revelation that **all beings are already children of the Buddha**.
3.  **The Mantra:** The shift from dialectic ("No eye, no ear...") to incantation (*Gate gate...*) mirrors the shift from the "Trace Teaching" (theoretical) to the "Essential Teaching" (mystical/liturgical) found in the latter half of the Lotus Sutra.

In this sense, the Heart Sutra is not a nihilistic denial of the world, but the **roaring lion's cleaning of the den**—removing all furniture of attachment so that the King of Truth may sit.
