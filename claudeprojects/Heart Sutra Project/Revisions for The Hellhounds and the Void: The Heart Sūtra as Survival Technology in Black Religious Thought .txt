Reviewers' comments:

Reviewer 1:
This article is well-organized and well-written, and innovative in a way that I have not previously encountered. The author is making a compelling argument about embodying Blackness and non-self. The author is clearly familiar with theories of African-American music - especially the Blues - as well as Mahayana Buddhist texts. The author also conveys an awareness of the fruits of Buddhist practice and an empathic analysis of Black subjugation. The author ably backed up their claims by quoting Ralph Ellison's _Invisible Man_. Perhaps most importantly, the author articulated a constructive practice of psychological liberation that - even as it gestures towards material conditions - argues for the possibility of transcending racial and colonial oppression.

My primary critique is that the author does not broadly engage Black Buddhist writings that expand many of the essay's arguments. For example, the author lifts up Rev. angel Kyodo williams, but does not reference numerous other dharma teachers who further their analysis. I suggest that the essay would be better served by including additional Black Buddhist writings that engage dharma teachings and Black music, including Kamilah Majied's essay in _Black & Buddhist_ (in which she writes about Billie Holliday) as well as her new book _Joyfully Just_ (in which she writes about Buddhism and Black music more broadly). I encourage the author to also consult Ralph Craig III's biography on Tina Turner (in which he discusses the importance of chanting) and Pamela Ayo Yetunde's new book on Prince.

On the whole, I found myself deeply engaged with this memorable essay, and look forward to recommending it should it be published.

Reviewer 2:
While the topic and comparative project are both commendable and necessary, the article lacks: sufficient background information for the subject matter; rigorous engagement with sources--both primary and secondary; and 3) adequate citations. See comments below.

At the same time, the source text that the author bases themself on--William Altig's The Heart Sutra Reborn--is of dubious quality. The author needs to provide a very strong rationale for using this work by Altig who, as far as I can determine, has no formal credentials for being able to offer such an idiosyncratic reading of this sūtra. The work in question is self-published and seems to respond to no hermeneutical community (i.e., scholars, publishers, or practitioners). It is hard to take Altig's work seriously.

The interpretive issues in the article set in almost from the first page (all page references are to the PDF pages):
Pg. 3: "In approximately 260 Chinese characters (or 14 Sanskrit ślokas), this text dismantles every category... ." The Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya-sūtra (hereafter, Heart Sūtra) is not in śloka-s. Śloka is verse; the text is in prose.

Section 2 (pgs. 5-9):
Pg. 6: This is woefully insufficient for introducing the reader to scholarly research on the Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya-sūtra. There is a vast body of scholarship on this text, not just the work of Lopez. At the same time, this author does not engage sufficiently with Lopez's work.

Pg. 7: "But in the shorter Sanskrit versions... ." As this alludes to, there is a longer Sanskrit version, and there are also versions which emerge from formal commentaries in both Sanskrit and Tibetan. The author here jumps back and forth between considering the Chinese text and the Sanskrit text as if they are more or less versions of the same text. The complex textual history of the Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya-sūtra (and the larger corpus of Prajñāpāramitā literature from which it emerges) needs to be more fully engaged with and understood. A start would be the author reading the extremely detailed "Prajñāpāramitā" entry in the Brill Encyclopedia of Buddhism.

Pg. 8: "The Heart Sūtra refuses... ." Statements like this show that the author either ignores or is unaware of the interpretative traditions in which the text has been contextualized.

"The Buddha merely confirms what has been said." Again, the author here demonstrates that they do not understand the larger corpus of Mahāyāna Buddhist literature, wherein which it is not uncommon for the Buddha to let another figure (usually an advanced disciple or bodhisattva) give a teaching and then "only" confirms what they have said.

Pg. 9 (and throughout the article): "As one contemporary Buddhist teacher has put it, the Heart Sūtra teaches us not to get rid of the waves but to learn to surf." Citation is needed here.

Section 3 (pgs. 9-14):
Pg. 9: "At the structural center of the Heart Sūtra lies the mahā-vyavadāna, the great negation." I am not sure where the author got this meaning of mahā-vyavadāna from. Mahā does indeed mean "great." Vyavadāna means, as a technical term in Buddhist texts, "purification." Searching for this term in a standard Sanskrit dictionary, such as in "Monier-Williams," will reveal only one entry from a Buddhist text. Apte, an even better Sanskrit dictionary, does not have the term at all, which confirms that it is indeed a Buddhist technical term. The compound term mahāvyavadāna is only attested in the Divyāvadāna, and in that context it only means "great purification." If this is a mistake for mahā-vyavadhāna then this is still wrong because that term means "intervention," "obstruction," or "cessation." None of these mean or imply negation. This compound term mahā-vyavadhāna, then, is attested only in Abhidharma literature, and there it can only mean "great hindrance."

Pg. 10: "The standard Mahāyāna reading of this passage... ." Citations need. What is the "standard" Mahāyāna reading? Where is that drawn from?

Pg. 14 note 18: If this is indeed the author's own translation, about which I have strong doubts, they should provide the Chinese and/or Sanskrit primary source in the endnote.

Pg. 14: "In traditional Buddhist commentary... ." Again, frequent use of terms like "traditional" and "standard" requires comment. Which "traditional" Buddhist exegetes and sources is the author drawing on? Traditional for whom? The Heart Sūtra, as Lopez ably demonstrates, has been interpreted by many different Buddhist thinkers and lineages, each with significantly different understandings. The author does not do any of the necessary background and citational work to show how the sūtra has been understood in the commentarial tradition.

Section 4 (pgs. 14-18):
This section needs a much more robust discussion of how śūnyatā has been received in the West. And, it needs citations.

Pg. 17: "The 'stomp' is not contemplative; it is rhythmic action, embodied resistance." The author here sets up a dichotomy between contemplation and rhythmic action, a dichotomy that need not be maintained. Howard Thurman spoke often about the generative space of rest, as did Tina Turner. On this point see Craig, Dancing in My Dreams: A Spiritual Biography of Tina Turner, chapt. 6., and Vesely-Flad, Black Buddhists and the Black Radical Tradition.

Pg. 17: "Avalokiteśvara is not sitting still and having a vision; she is doing something. The vernacular translation captures this with characteristic directness: 'She looks into the nature of reality. And
what she sees sets her free.'" Avalokiteśvara is a male bodhisattva. In East Asia, the bodhisattva is transformed into the female bodhisattva Guanyin/Guanshiyin (觀音/觀世音). Under no circumstances should one refer to Avalokiteśvara as female when dealing with the Sanskrit sources. If the author insists on switching to feminine pronouns for the bodhisattva, they should explain this difference and make explicit their choices.

Section 5 (pgs. 18-22):
This entire section requires a stronger interpretive and citational practice.

Section 6 (pgs.22-25):
Pg. 22: Regarding the citation from Altig, I would say that this is yet another reason that the author's source text--Altig's work--is spurious. There is much scholarship that addresses the thorny issue of whether Kumārajīva translated this text at all.

Pg. 24: "There is also a critical dimension to the translation's ethical stance. By claiming the Heart Sūtra as a text amenable to Blues interpretation, the translation challenges the cultural ownership of Buddhism by Asian and (increasingly) white American sanghas. It asserts that Black religious thinkers have as much right to inherit and adapt this tradition as any other community. This assertion has historical support. As mentioned earlier, African American intellectuals have engaged with Asian religions since the nineteenth century, and Black Buddhist practitioners and teachers have made significant contributions to American Buddhism. The vernacular translation is a continuation of this lineage, not an aberration from it." Citations are desperately needed for the scholarship on this history.

Pg. 24: "Finally, the ethics of vernacular translation must be understood in terms of impact. The Heart Sūtra, for all its profundity, is in danger of becoming in the West what it has often been in East Asia: ritual background noise, a text chanted but not understood, a formula repeated without penetration. The vernacular translation restores impact." This is thinly veiled orientalism. The Heart Sūtra has not "often" been "ritual background noise" in East Asia, as the number of commentaries and scholarly tracts on it amply demonstrate (scholarly tracks that the author clearly has not read).

Section 7 (pgs. 25ff):
Pg. 26: "When a Black translator renders a Sanskrit sūtra into the idiom of the Mississippi Delta... ." Does William Altig identify as Black?

Other Comments:
-I am troubled by there being no mention in this article of the Madhyamaka Buddhist philosophical school that has done some of the most sustained work on interpreting śūnyatā (emptiness) as it is promulgated in Prajñāpāramitā literature.

-The article needs a more robust discussion of ontology. Especially given that scholars who study Buddhist philosophy equivocate on whether to understand śūnyatā in the Heart Sūtra as making claims about ontology, epistemology, both, or neither.
