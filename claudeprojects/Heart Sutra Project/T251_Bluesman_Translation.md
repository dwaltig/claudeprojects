# The Heart Sutra (T251): A Blues Translation
## The Bluesman's Full Rendering

*Survival Technology from the Crossroads*

---

**(Spoken, over a slow, steady resonator guitar slide)**

Well now… listen close. This here's an old, old testimony. Came down the long road, from the palace to the penitentiary, from the temple to the tannery. It's about seein' clear when the world gon' try to blind you. 'Bout findin' a road out of no road. Survival technology.

First, you got the word of the Emperor—a man who knew the weight of the world, the cost of a chain. He speaks his piece:

## Part 1: The Emperor's Testimony

Back when the sky first parted from the earth, and everythin' found its place, the people had their rulers and their rules. Laid down the law, tried to show folks how to walk a straight line. But some hard-headed souls, they just wouldn't listen. Kept walkin' straight into the fire, jumpin' into the deep water, and they couldn't even see it. That kind of reckless? It ain't just here in the Delta. It's the human condition.

Then along came a man from the West. They called him Sakyamuni—the Buddha. He had a heavy wish on his soul, a deep intention. He wasn't playin'. He was lookin' for a way out of the meat-grinder of sufferin'. He taught kindness and patience to find the "True Life." He wanted *everybody* to cross that river.

Now, folks today don't understand what the Buddha was about. They say his teachin' is empty, hollow, got no use for the righteous or the wayward. But I tell you it ain't so. The Buddha's teachin' is *real*. It ain't the Void that's empty; it's the *foolishness* that's empty. What's real is your True Nature. The Buddha just showed a different road, wore a different name, to set sufferin' folks free.

Here's where you gotta pay attention:

The Heart Sutra talks a lot about "Empty." But that "Empty" is the *empty show*—the shadows on the wall. The empty talk of the mouth. The empty colors the eyes see. The empty sounds the ears hear. The empty smells, tastes, touches. These are the Six Empty Shadows. And they ain't the *true* empty. They're the *fake* empty—the lies your mind tells you. And these lies? They've been bringin' down kings and common folk alike since the beginning of time.

Old Emperor Wu of Liang? Got caught in the fake empty. Huizong of Song? Same story. They were chasin' a "Buddha-Heaven" up in the clouds while they were losin' the ground they stood on. They neglected their duties, chasin' a dream, and got their throats cut in the waking world.

But listen: that "Buddha-Heaven" ain't far away. It ain't up in the clouds. If you're a ruler who governs justly, your realm *is* that Heaven. You're already standin' in it. If you're a poor man who keeps his heart clean, you're already there. But chase the shadow? Use a deluded mind? You walk straight into the void, and the void swallows you whole.

The rich get caught in the fake empty and drown in lust. The poor get caught and drown in lies. The would-be righteous get caught and lose their way. Even the monks and preachers lose their footing.

So why is it called the *Heart* Sutra? Because it's a tool to scrape the *wrong* out of your heart and point you back to the true road. This ain't no Buddhist fraud. This is the medicine for what ails you.

I'm tellin' you this so you can see the sun and the moon, the turnin' of the seasons, and ask yourself: What's real? What's just smoke? How do I stay alive?

If you take the true path and hold it close, ain't that the good medicine of the Dharma? Ain't that the subtle truth of Form and Emptiness?

## Part 2: The Old Master's Preface
*(Huizhong's Word)*

**(Quieter now, almost a whisper)**

The truth is bigger than your head. You can't put a yardstick on the Void. You can't explain the Blues with a dictionary.

The Dharma-nature is boundless—how you gonna measure that with a thinkin' mind? Suchness got no *face*—how you gonna trap it in words?

That's why the masses are vast and endless, and the Ocean of Truth got no shore. You go searchin' for the meanin' in the text, you're like a man lookin' for his reflection *inside* the mirror. You try to stop your thoughts and stare at the Empty, you're like a man runnin' from his own shadow at high noon.

This here Sutra is like the ground itself. What don't grow out of the ground? All the Buddhas point to *one thing*: the Heart. What law don't stand on the Heart?

You understand the ground of the Heart, that's what they call "holdin' it all together." You wake up to the unborn nature of things, that's what they call "the subtle awareness."

One thought breaks through—and you're free. Ain't no need for a long sermon.

## Part 3: The Song of Gettin' to the Other Shore
*(The Heart Sutra)*

**(The guitar picks up, a driving Delta stomp)**

Let me tell you how this started. It was Avalokiteśvara—the One Who Hears the Cries of the World—sittin' deep, *real* deep, in that pocket of wisdom they call "Gettin' to the Other Shore."

She looked into the nature of reality. And what she saw set her free.

She saw that the five parts of a person—the body, the feelin's, the ideas, the habits, and the consciousness—they all empty. And in that seein', every last bit of trouble was crossed over.

"Listen here, Śāriputra! Form ain't different from Empty. Empty ain't different from Form. Form *is* that very Empty. Empty *is* that very Form. It's the same for feelin', for thinkin', for all your doin', for all your knowin'… just like that.

"Now, all these things showin' empty like this: they don't get born, they don't die. They ain't dirty, they ain't clean. They don't increase, they don't fall away.

"So, in this Empty, there ain't no form, no feelin', no thought, no habit, no consciousness.  
No eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind.  
No sight, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no thought-object.  
No world of sight, all the way to no world of mind-knowin'.  
No ignorance, and no end to ignorance… all the way to no old age and death, and no end to that.  
No sufferin', no cause of it, no end to it, no path to walk.  
No wisdom to get, and nothin' to get ahold of.

"'Cause there ain't nothin' to get.

"And it's *because* there ain't nothin' to get, that a Wisdom-Being, leanin' on this Gettin'-to-the-Other-Shore, finds the heart clear. No blockages. No blockages, so no fear. Stays clear of all them upside-down dreams. Lands at last on the Far Shore.

"All the Awakened Ones, past, present, and to come, they lean on this Gettin'-to-the-Other-Shore, and arrive at the Truest, Most Equal Wisdom.

"So you *know* this Gettin'-to-the-Other-Shore… it's the great spirit-chant. It's the bright-breakin'-daylight chant. It's the nothin'-above-it chant. It's the nothin'-even-equal-to-it chant. It cuts clean through *all* the trouble. True. No lie.

"So I speak the chant of Gettin'-to-the-Other-Shore."

And the chant goes like this:

---

**(Voice drops to a low, steady work-song hum, then rises into a call)**

> **Gone, gone,**  
> **Gone on over,**  
> **Everybody gone on over to the Other Shore.**  
> **Landed. Amen.**

**(Final guitar note rings out and fades)**

---

*May all beings see the emptiness that sets them free.*  
*May all beings cross to the other shore.*  
*Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā.*
