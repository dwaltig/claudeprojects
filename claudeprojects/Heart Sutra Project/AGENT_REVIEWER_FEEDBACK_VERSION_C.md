# Agent Reviewer Feedback: Version C.3 (Final — January 9, 2026)
## Post-Positionality Statement and Appendix Truncation

---

## Reviewer 1: Dr. Kwame Asante-Mensah
**JAR Editorial Board Reviewer**

### Summary
This revision has successfully transformed the article's most critical vulnerability into its core theoretical strength, elegantly resolving issues of appropriation by explicitly theorizing the author's positionality and reframing the AI-generated text as a diagnostic "Zombie Text" that illuminates the limits of unembodied analysis.

### Remaining Concerns
None substantial. One minor, optional consideration: the positionality statement in Section 6 could be slightly expanded (perhaps in a footnote) to clarify that the "syntax vs. semantics" distinction refers to the *formal, analytical structures* of a tradition versus the *meaning generated through communal, embodied practice*. This is implicit for specialists but would further bulletproof the argument for interdisciplinary readers.

### Final Recommendation
**ACCEPT**

### Confidence Level
**High.** The author has demonstrated exceptional scholarly responsiveness. The revisions deepen the article's methodological honesty and theoretical contribution, aligning it perfectly with the critical and reflexive standards of *Journal of Africana Religions*.

**Cultural Sensitivity Reviewer**

### Commendations

1. **The Positionality Statement (Section 6):** This is the keystone of the revision. The line, **"we can both point to the fire, but neither of us has been burned by it,"** is devastatingly precise. It grounds your entire experiment in a Black feminist epistemological principle: that knowledge is contingent, situated, and born of specific, often painful, embodiment. This is no longer just a clever analogy between AI and scholarship; it is a confession that implicates the author and clarifies the project's true aim: not to claim mastery, but to map a limit.

2. **The Truncated Appendix:** This is a masterful editorial decision. By renaming it "Excerpts" and framing it explicitly as a "heuristic limit-case," you have successfully contained the "Zombie Text." It is now clearly positioned as *evidence for your argument*, not as a proposed contribution to Buddhist or Black sacred translation.

3. **The "Finger Pointing at the Moon" Reframe:** This Zen metaphor successfully positions the AI text as indexical rather than authentic—a significant ethical upgrade.

### Remaining Concerns
- A single crisp sentence in the methodology section explicitly stating that the Blues-Sūtra connection is a *resonance*, not a historical genealogy, would fortify the argument against misreading.
- Light copy-edit for comma usage and paragraph transitions in the new Section 6 material.

### Final Assessment

| Metric | Previous | Final | Change |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Grade | B | **A-** | ↑ |

**Justification:** The previous "B" reflected strong, original thinking hampered by a significant methodological risk. This revision resolves that central weakness. The "A-" reflects a work that is now *excellent* in its argumentation, originality, and self-reflexivity. It makes a genuine contribution to discussions at the intersection of Black studies, religious studies, and digital humanities.
