THE HEART OF THE PERFECTION OF WISDOM
The William Altig Choir

DESCRIPTION:
A choral meditation on the Buddhist Heart Sutra, the oldest and most beloved teaching on emptiness and liberation.

For 1,600 years, the mantra "Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā" has been chanted in temples across Asia—a song of going beyond, of crossing to the other shore where suffering cannot reach. Now The William Altig Choir brings this ancient wisdom to life through the soulful harmonies of gospel and blues tradition.

Gone, gone, gone beyond. Gone all the way beyond. Awakening. Hail!

From the book "The Heart Sutra Reborn: An American Blues Interpretation" by William Altig.
