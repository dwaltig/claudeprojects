Dear Editors of the *Journal of Africana Religions*,

I am pleased to submit my article, **"The Hellhounds and the Void: The Heart Sūtra as Survival Technology in Black Religious Thought,"** for consideration in the *Journal of Africana Religions*.

This article proposes a novel interpretation of the Buddhist Heart Sūtra through the lens of African-American Blues epistemology. Drawing on Clyde Woods's theorization of the Blues as a system of survival knowledge, I argue that the Sūtra's famous negations—"no eyes, no ears, no body, no mind"—function not as metaphysical abstractions but as a strategic dissolution of the self-as-target under conditions of radical precarity. The analysis centers on a recent vernacular translation, "The Heart Sutra Reborn" (2025), which renders the Sanskrit text into the idiom of the American South, treating it as a primary document of Africana religious production.

This work contributes to the journal's mission of expanding the boundaries of what constitutes "Africana religion." It engages with the growing body of scholarship on Black Buddhism (Jan Willis, Charles Johnson, Zenju Earthlyn Manuel) while grounding its argument in the theoretical frameworks of Blues epistemology and critical race theory. The article addresses the functional utility of religion in Black life—not as doctrine but as survival technology.

I believe this article is well-suited for JAR given the journal's commitment to interdisciplinary approaches and its explicit interest in challenging received definitions of the field. The work has not been previously published and is not under consideration elsewhere.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

William Altig
Houston, Texas
