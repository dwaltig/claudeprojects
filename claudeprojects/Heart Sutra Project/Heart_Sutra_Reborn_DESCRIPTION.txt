The Heart Sutra Reborn: An American Blues Interpretation

The Buddha's shortest and most powerful teaching, reimagined through the soul of American Blues.

For 1,600 years, the Heart Sutra has offered liberation in just 260 words. Now, translator William Altig brings this ancient wisdom to life through the rhythms and raw honesty of the Blues tradition.

Follow Avalokiteśvara—the One Who Hears the Cries of the World—as she looks deep into the heart of reality and discovers what the Blues has always known: when you've got nothing left to hold onto, that's when you're finally free.

This interpretive translation includes prose and verse renderings, call-and-response chants, and insights connecting Buddhist wisdom to the lived experience of suffering and liberation.

Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā.
Gone, gone, gone beyond—awake forever.
