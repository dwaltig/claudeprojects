## Reviewer 2 Requests (Major Revisions)

### R2.1: Technical Corrections

#### R2.1a: Śloka Error (Page 3/Line 21)

**Current text:**
> "In approximately 260 Chinese characters (or 14 Sanskrit ślokas), this text dismantles every category..."

**Problem:** The Heart Sūtra is in **prose**, not verse. Śloka is a verse meter.

**Correction:**
> "In approximately 260 Chinese characters, this condensed prose text dismantles every category..."

**Footnote to add:**
> The Heart Sūtra is composed in prose (*gadya*), not verse (*śloka*). The brevity of the text—under 50 words in the shortest Sanskrit version—reflects the genre of *dhāraṇī* literature, which employs compressed, often cryptic language for ritual and mnemonic purposes.

---

#### R2.1b: "Mahā-vyavadāna" Terminology (Page 9/Line 67)

**Current text:**
> "At the structural center of the Heart Sūtra lies the *mahā-vyavadāna*, the great negation."

**Problem:** Reviewer states:
- *vyavadāna* means "purification" (not negation)
- *mahāvyavadāna* only attested in *Divyāvadāna*, meaning "great purification"
- If meant *vyavadhāna*, that means "obstruction" or "hindrance"

**Options:**
1. Remove the term entirely and use plain English
2. Use correct Sanskrit terminology with explanation
3. Acknowledge the neologism as a hermeneutical device

**Recommended correction:**
> "At the structural center of the Heart Sūtra lies what might be called the great negation (*mahā-pratiṣedha*)—or more colloquially, the 'Big No.'"

Or simply:
> "At the structural center of the Heart Sūtra lies the great litany of negation."

---

#### R2.1c: Avalokiteśvara Gender (Page 17/Lines 62-63, 133)

**Current text:**
> "Avalokiteśvara is not sitting still and having a vision; she is doing something."

**Problem:** Avalokiteśvara is male in Sanskrit sources. Transforms to female Guanyin only in East Asian contexts.

**Solution:** Add explicit rationale footnote:

> In the Sanskrit tradition, Avalokiteśvara is grammatically and iconographically male. However, the bodhisattva's transformation into the female Guanyin (觀音) in Chinese Buddhism—a transformation theologically grounded in the Lotus Sūtra's teaching that Avalokiteśvara can manifest in any form to save sentient beings—has made feminine pronouns customary in East Asian devotional contexts. The vernacular translation follows this latter tradition, consistent with its grounding in Kumārajīva's Chinese text rather than the Sanskrit. For the gender transformation, see Chün-fang Yü, *Kuan-yin: The Chinese Transformation of Avalokiteśvara* (Columbia University Press, 2001).

---

#### R2.1d: Note 18 Source Text

**Current text:**
> [^13]: My translation, following the standard Chinese text (T. 251).

**Requirement:** If claiming translation, provide Chinese and/or Sanskrit source.

**Solution:** Add the Chinese text:

> [^13]: My translation of T0251_.08.0848c04-13 (Kumārajīva's Chinese version). The original reads: 是故空中無色，無受想行識，無眼耳鼻舌身意，無色聲香味觸法，無眼界乃至無意識界。無無明亦無無明盡，乃至無老死亦無老死盡。無苦集滅道，無智亦無得。

---

#### R2.1e: "Ritual Background Noise" / Orientalism (Page 24/Lines 205-206)

**Current text:**
> "The Heart Sūtra, for all its profundity, is in danger of becoming in the West what it has often been in East Asia: ritual background noise, a text chanted but not understood, a formula repeated without penetration."

**Problem:** Reviewer calls this "thinly veiled orientalism," noting rich commentarial traditions.

**Revised text:**
> "The Heart Sūtra, for all its profundity, is in danger of becoming in the West a text chanted but not grappled with, a formula repeated without penetration. The rich commentarial traditions that have animated the text in East Asia—from the Indian scholastic interpretations preserved in Tibetan translation to the innovative readings of Chan and Zen masters—demonstrate that the Sūtra has consistently provoked sustained intellectual and spiritual engagement. The vernacular translation aims to restore that engagement for a new audience."

---

### R2.2: Scholarly Apparatus Expansion

#### R2.2a: Engage Lopez More Deeply (Section 2)

**Current:** References Lopez's *Elaborations on Emptiness* and *Heart Sutra Explained* but doesn't engage deeply.

**Add:** More substantive discussion of Lopez's argument about the Heart Sūtra's multiple functions across Asian Buddhist cultures.

**Draft addition for Section 2:**
> Lopez's magisterial survey in *Elaborations on Emptiness* demonstrates how the Heart Sūtra has served radically different functions across its reception history: as philosophical treatise demanding scholastic commentary in India, as ritual technology for both protection and meditation in Tibet, and as popular devotional scripture in East Asia where it is chanted daily by millions. This functional diversity suggests that the text itself is, in Buddhist terms, a form of *upāya* (skillful means)—its meaning arising in relation to the needs and capacities of its audience rather than residing statically in the words themselves.

---

#### R2.2b: Add Brill Encyclopedia Reference

**Citation to add:**
> Stefano Zacchetti, "Prajñāpāramitā," in *Brill's Encyclopedia of Buddhism*, vol. 1: *Literature and Languages*, ed. Jonathan Silk et al. (Leiden: Brill, 2015), 171-209.

**Usage context:** Section 2, discussing the textual history and Prajñāpāramitā corpus.

---

#### R2.2c: Add Madhyamaka Philosophical Context

**Current gap:** No mention of the philosophical school most associated with interpreting śūnyatā.

**Add to Section 4 (Emptiness as Mobility):**
> The philosophical elaboration of *śūnyatā* owes its most systematic treatment to the Madhyamaka school founded by Nāgārjuna (c. 150-250 CE). In his *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*, Nāgārjuna equated emptiness with dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*): phenomena are empty precisely because they arise in dependence on causes and conditions, lacking any inherent, self-sufficient existence (*svabhāva*). Crucially, Nāgārjuna also argued that emptiness itself is empty—that *śūnyatā* is not a new absolute or ground but a pointer to the processual, relational nature of all things. This prevents the nihilistic misreading the reviewer rightly identifies as a danger. The Blues epistemology's emphasis on fluidity and mobility resonates with this Madhyamaka insight: both point toward a reality that is neither solid nor void but dynamically interdependent.

#### R2.2d: Textual History of Heart Sūtra (Section 2)

**Add paragraph:**
> The textual history of the Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya is more complex than its brevity might suggest. Scholars have identified multiple recensions: a shorter version lacking the narrative frame, found in some Sanskrit manuscripts and the Tibetan translations of Kamalaśīla and Atiśa; and a longer version including the *nidāna* (setting) and *pariniṣpanna* (conclusion), exemplified by Kumārajīva's influential Chinese translation (T0251). Recent scholarship by Jan Nattier has argued provocatively that the text may have been composed or compiled in China rather than India, drawing heavily on Kumārajīva's translation of the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra*. Whether one accepts Nattier's hypothesis or not, it underscores the text's deep entanglement with Chinese Buddhist culture—the very culture from which it now travels, via vernacular translation, into the idiom of the American South.

#### R2.2e: Add Citations for "Standard" / "Traditional" Claims

**Lines requiring citation:**

| Line | Current Text | Citation Needed |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| 71 | "The standard Mahāyāna reading of this passage..." | Cite Lopez, Nattier, or Tanahashi |
| 103 | "In traditional Buddhist commentary..." | Cite specific commentators (Vimalamitra, Kamalaśīla, Fazang) |

**Suggested revision for Line 71:**
> "The standard Mahāyāna reading of this passage, articulated in commentaries from Vimalamitra (8th century) to Fazang (643-712), emphasizes its ontological claim..."

**Suggested revision for Line 103:**
> "In the exegetical traditions preserved in Tibetan and Chinese commentaries—particularly those by Vimalamitra and the Chinese Huayan master Fazang—the 'two obscurations' are typically identified as..."

---

#### R2.2f: Western Reception of Śūnyatā (Section 4)

**Current gap:** Reviewer notes Section 4 needs "much more robust discussion of how śūnyatā has been received in the West."

**Add paragraph:**
> The Western reception of *śūnyatā* has been vexed from the beginning. Schopenhauer's melancholic appropriation of Buddhist themes in the nineteenth century, filtered through missionary accounts and early Orientalist scholarship, conflated emptiness with pessimistic negation—a reading that persists in popular culture. More sympathetic interpreters, from D.T. Suzuki to contemporary philosophers like Jay Garfield, have labored to correct this misunderstanding, emphasizing that emptiness is not nihilism but a diagnosis of our tendency to reify. The phenomenological turn in Buddhist-Western dialogue—represented by thinkers like Evan Thompson and Francisco Varela—has brought new resources for articulating śūnyatā in terms of enactivism and embodied cognition. The Blues epistemological frame I propose here offers yet another idiom: one that emphasizes mobility, survival, and the creative transformation of precarity rather than intellectual cognition.

- Evan Thompson, *Waking, Dreaming, Being: Self and Consciousness in Neuroscience, Meditation, and Philosophy* (Columbia University Press, 2014)

---

#### R2.2g: Ontology vs. Epistemology Discussion

**Add to Section 4:**
> Buddhist philosophers have long debated whether *śūnyatā* is primarily an ontological claim (about what exists), an epistemological claim (about how we know), or a soteriological tool (for liberation) that transcends both categories. The Madhyamaka tradition, in its various sub-schools, has offered different answers. For the present argument, what matters is the *pragmatic* dimension: the experience of emptiness as release from fixity, which operates regardless of one's metaphysical commitments. The Blues tradition similarly functions on a pragmatic register: it transforms suffering not by explaining it metaphysically but by *moving* it aesthetically.

### R2.3: Black Buddhist Scholarship Expansion

#### R2.3a: Additional Black Buddhist Voices

**Add citations for:**
- Rima Vesely-Flad, *Black Buddhists and the Black Radical Tradition* (NYU Press, 2022)
- Jan Willis, *Dreaming Me: Black, Baptist, and Buddhist* (already in bibliography)
- Charles Johnson, *Turning the Wheel: Essays on Buddhism and Writing* (Scribner, 2003)

**Draft addition for Introduction or Section 6:**
> Rima Vesely-Flad's recent *Black Buddhists and the Black Radical Tradition* (2022), based on interviews with over seventy Black Buddhist teachers and practitioners, documents how Black Buddhists integrate dharmic teachings in ways that align with radical Black thought. Vesely-Flad argues that Buddhist practices of ancestor veneration and intergenerational trauma healing offer resources for Black liberation that conventional white-dominated sanghas have failed to develop. The vernacular translation participates in this tradition of Black Buddhist innovation.

---

#### R2.3b: Black Buddhist History Citations (Page 24)

**Current text (uncited):**
> "African American intellectuals have engaged with Asian religions since the nineteenth century, and Black Buddhist practitioners and teachers have made significant contributions to American Buddhism."

**Citations to add:**
- Vijay Prashad, *Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting* (already cited)
- Rima Vesely-Flad, *Black Buddhists and the Black Radical Tradition*, ch. 1
- Scott A. Mitchell and Natalie Quli, eds., *Buddhism beyond Borders: New Perspectives on Buddhism in the United States* (SUNY Press, 2015)

### R2.4: Strategic Questions

#### R2.4a: Altig Translation Legitimacy

**Reviewer quote:**
> "The source text that the author bases themself on—William Altig's The Heart Sutra Reborn—is of dubious quality. The author needs to provide a very strong rationale for using this work by Altig who, as far as I can determine, has no formal credentials."

**Options:**

1. **Reveal authorship** (HIGH RISK/HIGH REWARD): Disclose that you are Altig, reframe article as self-reflexive practice documentation
2. **Defend methodology** (SAFER): Add extensive rationale for treating vernacular translation as legitimate religious production regardless of academic credentials
3. **Pivot framing**: Emphasize that the article is not claiming the translation is *philologically authoritative* but *religiously productive*

**Recommended approach: Option 3**

**Draft addition for Section 6 (Ethics of Vernacular Translation):**
> The question of credentials—who is authorized to translate sacred texts?—is itself a site of contestation. The vernacular translation this article engages does not claim philological authority on par with academic editions. Rather, it claims *religious* legitimacy: the right of any practitioner to speak the Dharma in their own tongue, adapting it to their own conditions. This is the logic of Kumārajīva, who was not a native Chinese speaker but whose translations became the liturgical standard for East Asian Buddhism. It is also the logic of the vernacular Bible translations that shaped Protestant religious culture—translations often executed by individuals whose credentials were questioned by established authorities. The translator's legitimacy, in this view, derives not from institutional sanction but from the religious community that receives and is transformed by the translation.

---

#### R2.4b: Identity Question

**Reviewer quote:**
> "When a Black translator renders a Sanskrit sūtra into the idiom of the Mississippi Delta... Does William Altig identify as Black?"

**This is delicate.** Options:

1. **Clarify in revised text**: If you do not identify as Black, reframe the article's claims
2. **Reframe the argument**: The Blues idiom is *American* cultural heritage accessible to many communities
3. **Sidestep**: Focus on the translation's function rather than the translator's identity

**Recommended revision for Section 7:**

**Current:** "When a Black translator renders a Sanskrit sūtra into the idiom of the Mississippi Delta..."

**Revised:**
> "When the Heart Sūtra is rendered into the vernacular idiom of the Mississippi Delta—an idiom forged in Black communities but now part of broader American cultural vocabulary—something new is created..."

**Add footnote:**
> The translator William Altig does not identify as Black, and this raises legitimate questions about cultural authority that deserve direct address. The translation does not claim to speak *for* Black communities but *with* a tradition that has shaped American English in deep and abiding ways. Whether such ventriloquism is itself a form of appropriation or a legitimate act of creative synthesis remains an open question. The author's position is that the Blues, like jazz, has become a shared American idiom—though one whose Black origins must always be acknowledged and honored.
