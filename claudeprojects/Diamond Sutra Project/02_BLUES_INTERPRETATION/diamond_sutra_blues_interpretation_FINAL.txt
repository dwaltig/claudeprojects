INTRODUCTION

The Diamond Sutra cuts through everything. It's the sword of wisdom that says: "What you think is real ain't real. What you think you are, you ain't." It's the ultimate Blues teaching—stripping away the ego until there's nothing left but the naked truth.

PASSAGE ONE: SUBHUTI'S QUESTION
How to Hold the Mind in a World of Trouble

[PROSE RENDERING]

Listen now, 'cause what you're about to hear is the real thing.

Subodhi stands up in that assembly—and brother, this ain't no small thing. He's an elder, respected, known for understanding the deep emptiness that the Buddha been talking about. And he rises up respectful, bows low, and asks the Buddha a question. Not a complicated question. Just the real one.

"World-Honored One," he says, "you speak good things about those of us who want to help all beings. Those of us whose hearts have been opened by this teaching. But I gotta ask you straight up: How are we supposed to live?

"How should we hold our minds? What's the real practice? How do we actually dwell in this awakening?"

Now, that's the question right there. 'Cause see, anybody can talk about enlightenment. Anybody can say, "Yeah, I want to save all beings." Easy words. But Subodhi's asking the hard thing. What's the day-to-day reality?

The Buddha looks at him, smiles, and speaks: "Listen, Subodhi. You want to know how to hold your mind? I'll tell you. Here's the thing: If you think you're saving beings, you're already off the path.

"Why? Because there is no fixed 'you.' There are no solid 'beings' to save. There's no actual enlightenment to attain that exists as a thing.

"The bodhisattva mind doesn't hold onto the idea of 'me' or 'you' or 'beings' or 'life.' It doesn't grab onto any image or form or concept.

"You want to know how to dwell? Dwell nowhere. Don't hold onto any view. Don't attach to any understanding. Stay right here, in the middle of everything, but attached to nothing. That's how you dwell. That's how you hold your mind."

[VERSE RENDERING]

(Slow, soulful intro)

Brother asks a question,
Standing in the assembly,
Not asking about technique,
Not asking about meditation,
But asking the real thing:

"How should we who want to serve
Hold our minds?
How do we dwell in this awakening?
What's the actual practice
Of those of us who choose this path?"

(Tempo picks up)

And the Buddha smiles—you can feel it—
Like he's been waiting for this question all along.
And he says:
"You want to know how to dwell?
Dwell nowhere.
You want to know what to hold?
Hold nothing.

(Chorus)
Hold nothing in your hand,
Hold nothing in your mind.
Leave your heavy burdens,
Leave them all behind.
If you think you're someone special,
Saving souls today,
You missed the whole damn point,
You lost the holy way.

PASSAGE TWO: NO MARKS
The Teaching on Generosity and Emptiness

[PROSE RENDERING]

Now, Subodhi, listen to this 'cause this is the teaching that's gonna set you free.

The Buddha says: "You want to know the real practice? It's giving. But not the kind of giving you think. When a bodhisattva gives—and I mean really gives—they give without clinging to anything. They don't hold onto the idea, 'I am the giver.' They don't hold onto the idea, 'This is the gift.' They don't hold onto the idea, 'This is the one who's receiving.'

"When all three—giver, gift, and receiver—when all three dissolve like morning mist, THAT'S when real giving happens. And the merit? It can't be measured.

"Let me ask you something, Subodhi. Can you measure the space in the East? Can you count it? Can you find its edges?"

And Subodhi says, "No, World-Honored One. The space in the East has no measure. It's infinite."

"Exactly," says the Buddha. "The merit of a bodhisattva who gives without attachment is like that immeasurable space. It can't be bounded. It can't be contained.

"So here's the teaching: Give like you're pouring water into the ocean. The water merges with the ocean. Where's your gift now? Where are you? Where is the one receiving? All three dissolve into the same boundlessness. That's the generosity that matters."

[VERSE RENDERING]

(Rhythmic, flowing beat)

The Buddha asks:
"Subodhi, can you measure the space?
Can you count the East sky?
Can you find where it ends?"

"No," says Subodhi.
"Space is boundless.
It has no measure."

"That's right," says the Buddha.
"And the merit of giving without clinging?
It's just like that.

It just spreads—
Like light through all directions,
Like water finding its level,
Like love that doesn't ask back.

(Chorus)
Pour it out, let it flow,
Don't hold back, let it go.
Don't claim the credit, don't claim the prize,
Don't look for thanks in another's eyes.
Just give like the rain falls on the ground,
Making life grow without a sound.

PASSAGE THREE: THE GREAT VERSE
Everything is a Dream

[PROSE RENDERING]

Now the Buddha is moving toward the end of the teaching. He wants to leave Subodhi with something that's gonna shake his bones.

He says: "Subodhi, listen. I'm gonna give you the real thing. Not as a doctrine, not as something to believe. But as a way of seeing.

"Look at a dream you had last night. It felt real, didn't it? But when you woke up, where was it? Gone.

"All of life is like that. Your success, your failure, your relationships, your body, your identity - all of it like a dream.

"And an illusion - a magician's trick. Light and shadow playing on consciousness.

"A bubble - appears for a moment, catches the light, looks beautiful. Then - pop - it's gone.

"A shadow - follows you around, seems real, but it's not a thing. It's the absence of light.

"Dew - the morning dew on the grass. So fragile. So temporary. A breath of warmth and it evaporates.

"And lightning - you see it flash. In that moment it seems like the brightest thing in the world. But it's over in an instant.

"That's what all conditioned things are like. Everything that arises through causes and conditions. Which is everything. Your whole world. Your whole life.

"So here's the question: If everything is like that - dream, illusion, bubble, shadow, dew, lightning - then what is it that's supposed to be permanent? The answer, Subodhi, is this: There's nothing permanent. And in that knowing, you're free."

[VERSE RENDERING]

(Haunting, acapella or single guitar)

All conditioned things
Are like dreams—
You believe in them while they're happening,
But you wake up
And they dissolve completely.
Gone. Never were.

Like illusions—
The magician points,
You see the elephant,
But there's no elephant there.

Like bubbles—
Beautiful when they catch the light,
Seeming to float and dance,
But they're hollow,
Just air and film.

Like shadows—
You see them, fear them sometimes,
But they're not things.
They're the absence of light.

Like dew—
Fragile beyond measure,
Clinging to the spider's web,
Catching the dawn light.

Like lightning—
A flash of brightness
In the darkness,
Illuminating everything for an instant,
But gone before you can blink.

(Chorus / Outro)
Your success, like that.
Your failure, like that.
Your love, like that.
Your loss, like that.

All of it dream-like.
All of it illusory.
All of it without substance.

And in that seeing,
Something shifts.
The tight grip loosens.
The desperate seeking stops.
The pretense falls away.

And what remains?
Awareness.
Simple.
Clear.
Already here.
Already free.
Already free.
