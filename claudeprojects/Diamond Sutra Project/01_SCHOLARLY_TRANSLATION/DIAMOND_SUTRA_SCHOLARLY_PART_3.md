## Chapter 21: Non-Speaking, Non-Teaching
**(非說所說分第二十一)**

"Subhūti, do not say that the Tathāgata thinks: 'I have a Dharma to speak.' Do not think this. Why? If someone says the Tathāgata has a Dharma to speak, they slander the Buddha because they do not understand what I say. Subhūti, regarding speaking Dharma: there is no Dharma that can be spoken; this is named speaking Dharma."

At that time, the Wise Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, will there be sentient beings in the future who, hearing this Dharma spoken, will give rise to faith?"

The Buddha said: "Subhūti, they are not sentient beings, nor are they not sentient beings. Why? Subhūti, 'sentient beings, sentient beings'—the Tathāgata says they are not sentient beings; they are named sentient beings."

---

## Chapter 22: No Dharma Obtained
**(無法可得分第二十二)**

Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, did the Buddha obtain *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* by obtaining nothing?"

The Buddha said: "So it is, so it is. Subhūti, regarding *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*, I did not obtain even the slightest dharma. This is named *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*."

---

## Chapter 23: Purifying the Mind through Goodness
**(淨心行善分第二十三)**

"Furthermore, Subhūti, this Dharma is equal, with no high or low. This is named *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*. By means of no self, no person, no sentient being, and no life-span, cultivating all good dharmas, one obtains *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*.

"Subhūti, regarding 'good dharmas,' the Tathāgata says they are not good dharmas; they are named good dharmas."

---

## Chapter 24: Merit and Wisdom Beyond Comparison
**(福智無比分第二十四)**

"Subhūti, if someone were to take piles of the seven treasures equal in size to all the Sumeru Kings of Mountains in three thousand great thousand worlds and use them for giving;

"And if another person were to accept, uphold, read, and recite even a four-line verse of this *Prajñā Pāramitā Sutra* and explain it to others;

"The former merit would not equal one hundredth of the latter merit, nor one hundred millionth of a billionth, nor any calculation or analogy."

---

## Chapter 25: Transformation without Those Transformed
**(化無所化分第二十五)**

"Subhūti, what do you think? Do not say that the Tathāgata thinks: 'I shall liberate sentient beings.' Subhūti, do not think this. Why? In reality there are no sentient beings for the Tathāgata to liberate. If there were sentient beings for the Tathāgata to liberate, the Tathāgata would have the notion of a self, a person, a sentient being, and a life-span.

"Subhūti, the Tathāgata says 'having a self' is not having a self, yet ordinary people take it as having a self. Subhūti, regarding 'ordinary people,' the Tathāgata says they are not ordinary people; they are named ordinary people."

---

## Chapter 26: The Dharmakāya has No Characteristics
**(法身非相分第二十六)**

"Subhūti, what do you think? Can one contemplate the Tathāgata by means of the thirty-two marks?"

Subhūti said: "So it is, so it is. One contemplates the Tathāgata by means of the thirty-two marks."

The Buddha said: "Subhūti, if one could contemplate the Tathāgata by means of the thirty-two marks, then a Wheel-Turning Sage King (*Cakravartin*) would be a Tathāgata."

Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, as I understand the meaning of what the Buddha has said, one should not contemplate the Tathāgata by means of the thirty-two marks."

At that time, the World-Honored One spoke a verse:

> "If one sees me in forms,
> Or seeks me in sounds,
> This person walks a deviant path
> And cannot see the Tathāgata."

---

## Chapter 27: No Interruption and No Annihilation
**(無斷無滅分第二十七)**

"Subhūti, if you think: 'The Tathāgata does not attain *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* by means of complete marks,' Subhūti, do not think this: 'The Tathāgata does not attain *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* by means of complete marks.'

"Subhūti, if you think that those who generate the *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* mind advocate the annihilation of all dharmas, do not think this. Why? Those who generate the *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* mind do not advocate the characteristic of annihilation regarding dharmas."

---

## Chapter 28: Not Accepting, Not Greeding
**(不受不貪分第二十八)**

"Subhūti, if a Bodhisattva were to fill worlds equal to the sands of the Ganges with the seven treasures and use them for giving;

"And if another person knows that all dharmas are selfless and achieves perfection in patience (*kṣānti*);

"This Bodhisattva's merit surpasses the former Bodhisattva's merit. Why? Subhūti, because Bodhisattvas do not accept merit."

Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, why do Bodhisattvas not accept merit?"

"Subhūti, the merit created by a Bodhisattva should not be greedily attached to. Therefore it is said they do not accept merit."

---

## Chapter 29: Dignity is Quiescent
**(威儀寂靜分第二十九)**

"Subhūti, if someone says: 'The Tathāgata comes, goes, sits, or lies down,' this person does not understand the meaning of what I say. Why? The Tathāgata does not come from anywhere, nor does he go anywhere. Therefore he is named the Tathāgata."

---

## Chapter 30: The Unity of Characteristics
**(一合理相分第三十)**

"Subhūti, if a good man or good woman were to smash three thousand great thousand worlds into dust motes, what do you think? Would those dust motes be many?"

Subhūti said: "Very many, World-Honored One. Why? If those dust motes were real entities, the Buddha would not speak of 'dust motes.' Why? The Buddha says: 'Dust motes are not dust motes; they are named dust motes.'

"World-Honored One, the 'three thousand great thousand worlds' spoken of by the Tathāgata are not worlds; they are named worlds. Why? If the world were a real entity, it would be a Unified Characteristic (*piṇḍa-grāha*). The Tathāgata says: 'A Unified Characteristic is not a Unified Characteristic; it is named a Unified Characteristic.'"

"Subhūti, a Unified Characteristic is inexpressible, but ordinary people greedily attach to such things."

---

## Chapter 31: Knowledge and Views are Not Created
**(知見不生分第三十一)**

"Subhūti, if someone says: 'The Buddha speaks of a view of self, a view of person, a view of sentient being, and a view of life-span,' Subhūti, what do you think? Does this person understand the meaning of what I say?"

"No, World-Honored One. This person does not understand the meaning of what the Tathāgata says. Why? The World-Honored One says: 'A view of self, person, sentient being, and life-span is not a view of self, person, sentient being, and life-span; it is named a view of self, person, sentient being, and life-span.'"

"Subhūti, those who generate the *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* mind should thus know, thus view, and thus believe and understand all dharmas, not giving rise to the characteristic of a dharma. Subhūti, regarding the 'characteristic of a dharma,' the Tathāgata says it is not a characteristic of a dharma; it is named a characteristic of a dharma."

---

## Chapter 32: Responses and Transformations are Unreal
**(應化非真分第三十二)**

"Subhūti, if someone were to fill immeasurable *asaṃkhyeya* worlds with the seven treasures and use them for giving;

"And if a good man or good woman who has generated the Bodhi-mind were to hold this sutra, even a four-line verse, accepting, upholding, reading, reciting, and explaining it for others, their merit would surpass the former.

"How should they explain it to others? Not grasping at characteristics, unmoving in suchness (*tathatā*). Why?

> **All conditioned dharmas**
> **Are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow,**
> **Like dew and like a flash of lightning.**
> **One should contemplate them thus.**"

When the Buddha had finished speaking this sutra, the elder Subhūti, the monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, and all the worlds of gods, men, and asuras, hearing what the Buddha said, rejoiced greatly, believed and accepted it, and respectfully practiced it.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

[^1]: **Unified Characteristic** (Chinese: *yi he xiang* 一合相; Sanskrit: *piṇḍa-grāha*): The delusion of seeing a composite entity (like a world, body, or self) as a single, solid, indivisible unit. This is a fundamental error in perception—mistaking an aggregate of parts for a unified whole. The teaching deconstructs this by showing that:
   - The world is composed of countless atoms (dust motes)
   - Each atom is itself composite
   - No ultimate, indivisible unit exists
   - Therefore, no "unified characteristic" can be found
   
   This parallels modern physics' discovery that matter dissolves into energy and probability. The Lotus Sutra addresses this through the teaching that the "burning house" (seemingly solid world) is actually the eternal Buddha-land (LS Chapter 16)—both transcend the notion of a fixed, unified reality.

[^2]: **Conditioned Dharmas** (Sanskrit: *saṃskṛta-dharma*; Chinese: 有為法): Any phenomenon that arises dependent on causes and conditions. This includes:
   - All physical phenomena
   - All mental states
   - All relationships
   - All experiences
   - Essentially everything in conventional reality
   
   The famous final verse (*gāthā*) of Chapter 32 summarizes the entire sutra's teaching on the impermanence and emptiness of all conditioned reality through six similes: dream, illusion, bubble, shadow, dew, lightning. This verse is often chanted independently and has become one of the most famous passages in all Buddhist literature.

### Key Concepts and Cross-References

**Non-Speaking, Non-Teaching** (Chapter 21): The paradox that the Tathāgata has no Dharma to speak, yet has spoken the Dharma for forty-nine years. This resolves when we understand:
- The Dharma is not a fixed doctrine to be transmitted
- Teaching adapts to circumstances (skillful means)
- Ultimate truth cannot be captured in words
- Yet conventional truth requires words

The Lotus Sutra expresses this same paradox through the teaching of skillful means (LS Chapter 2)—all teachings are provisional, yet necessary. Both sutras acknowledge the limitation of language while using language extensively.

**Sentient Beings Are Not Sentient Beings** (Chapter 21): "They are not sentient beings, nor are they not sentient beings." This double negation transcends both existence and non-existence. Sentient beings:
- Don't exist as fixed, independent entities (emptiness)
- Yet function conventionally (compassion still applies)
- Are neither real nor unreal
- Require liberation yet are already liberated

This teaching prevents both the error of reifying beings (eternalism) and denying their conventional existence (nihilism). The Lotus Sutra's teaching that all beings will attain Buddhahood (LS Chapter 2) complements this: beings are empty yet their Buddha-nature is real.

**No Dharma Obtained** (Chapter 22): Subhūti's realization that the Buddha obtained enlightenment by obtaining nothing. This is the culmination of the sutra's teaching:
- Enlightenment is not an acquisition
- Nothing is added to what already is
- Realization is recognition, not attainment
- "Not even the slightest dharma" was obtained

This parallels the Lotus Sutra's teaching that the Buddha realized enlightenment countless kalpas ago (LS Chapter 16)—he didn't become a Buddha; he revealed what he always was. Both sutras point to enlightenment as uncovering rather than achieving.

**Dharma Is Equal** (Chapter 23): "*Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* is equal, with no high or low." This teaching on the equality of the Dharma means:
- All beings have equal Buddha-nature
- No hierarchy in ultimate truth
- Distinctions are conventional, not ultimate
- The path is available to all equally

This directly parallels the Lotus Sutra's central teaching of the One Vehicle (LS Chapter 2-3)—all beings will attain the same Buddhahood, with no lesser or greater enlightenment. Both sutras express the Mahāyāna conviction of universal equality and liberation.

**Good Dharmas Are Not Good Dharmas** (Chapter 23): Even wholesome practices must not be grasped. This prevents:
- Spiritual pride ("I am virtuous")
- Attachment to merit
- Reification of practice
- Dualistic thinking (good vs. evil)

The teaching: cultivate all good dharmas while recognizing their emptiness. This is the Middle Way—neither abandoning practice nor clinging to it. The Lotus Sutra similarly teaches that even the Bodhisattva practices are skillful means (LS Chapter 2), not ultimate realities.

**Mount Sumeru Comparison** (Chapter 24): Piles of treasures equal to Mount Sumeru (the cosmic mountain) in all worlds—yet the merit of upholding a four-line verse surpasses this. This extreme hyperbole serves to:
- Emphasize the incomparable value of wisdom
- Encourage sutra preservation
- Validate the teaching's supreme status
- Inspire faith in difficult times

The Lotus Sutra uses identical rhetoric (LS Chapter 10, 17), showing this is standard Mahāyāna missionary strategy. Both sutras claim to be the supreme teaching.

**Transformation Without Those Transformed** (Chapter 25): "Do not say that the Tathāgata thinks: 'I shall liberate sentient beings.'" This teaching prevents the Bodhisattva from:
- Developing a savior complex
- Reifying beings as objects to be saved
- Clinging to the notion of a self who liberates
- Falling into dualistic thinking (liberator/liberated)

The paradox: liberate all beings while recognizing no beings are liberated. This is the ultimate non-dual compassion. The Lotus Sutra expresses this through the eternal Buddha's ceaseless teaching activity (LS Chapter 16) that arises spontaneously without a doer.

**Ordinary People Are Not Ordinary People** (Chapter 25): Even the category "ordinary person" (*pṛthagjana*) is empty. This prevents:
- Spiritual elitism
- Dualistic thinking (enlightened/unenlightened)
- Reifying ignorance as a substantial state
- Despair about one's current condition

The teaching: ordinary people are empty of inherent ordinariness; they are potential Buddhas. This parallels the Lotus Sutra's teaching that all beings possess Buddha-nature (LS Chapter 2) and will attain Buddhahood, even those currently "ordinary."

**Dharmakāya Has No Characteristics** (Chapter 26): The ultimate Buddha-body (*Dharmakāya*) transcends all physical marks. The thirty-two marks belong to the *Nirmāṇakāya* (emanation body), not the *Dharmakāya* (truth body). This teaching on the Trikāya (three bodies) is central to Mahāyāna:
1. **Dharmakāya**: Ultimate reality, emptiness itself
2. **Saṃbhogakāya**: Subtle form for advanced practitioners
3. **Nirmāṇakāya**: Physical manifestation for ordinary beings

The Lotus Sutra Chapter 16 reveals the eternal Dharmakāya, showing that the historical Buddha's birth and death were skillful means, not ultimate reality. Both sutras point beyond the physical Buddha to the eternal truth-nature.

**Wheel-Turning Sage King** (*Cakravartin*, Chapter 26): A universal monarch who rules through Dharma rather than force. According to Buddhist cosmology, a *Cakravartin* possesses the thirty-two marks but is not a Buddha. This proves that the marks alone don't reveal Buddhahood. The difference:
- *Cakravartin*: Worldly power and virtue
- Buddha: Transcendent wisdom and liberation

This teaching prevents confusing worldly excellence with spiritual realization.

**Famous Verse** (Chapter 26): "If one sees me in forms, or seeks me in sounds, this person walks a deviant path and cannot see the Tathāgata." This became one of the most quoted verses in all Buddhism, especially in Zen/Chan. It teaches:
- The Buddha cannot be found through sensory perception
- Seeking externally is a deviant path
- True seeing is non-seeing
- The Tathāgata is the nature of reality itself, not a person

This parallels the Lotus Sutra's teaching that the Buddha's lifespan is eternal (LS Chapter 16)—the historical Buddha is a manifestation, not the ultimate reality. Both sutras point to the Buddha-nature beyond all forms.

**No Interruption, No Annihilation** (Chapter 27): This teaching on the Middle Way prevents two errors:
1. **Eternalism** (interruption): Believing enlightenment destroys something
2. **Nihilism** (annihilation): Believing enlightenment leads to nothingness

The truth: enlightenment neither adds nor removes anything. It is the recognition of what always is. The Lotus Sutra expresses this through the teaching that the Buddha is neither born nor extinct (LS Chapter 16)—beyond the categories of existence and non-existence.

**Not Accepting Merit** (Chapter 28): "Bodhisattvas do not accept merit." This doesn't mean merit doesn't arise, but that:
- Merit is not grasped as a possession
- No pride arises from virtuous action
- Merit is dedicated to all beings
- The threefold purity (giver, gift, recipient) is maintained

This teaching prevents spiritual materialism—treating merit as spiritual wealth to accumulate. The Lotus Sutra similarly teaches that Bodhisattvas dedicate all merit to universal liberation (LS Chapter 10, 23).

**Tathāgata's Quiescence** (Chapter 29): "The Tathāgata does not come from anywhere, nor does he go anywhere." This teaching on the Buddha's non-movement means:
- The Dharmakāya is beyond space and time
- Coming and going are conventional appearances
- The Buddha-nature is ever-present
- Movement and stillness are both transcended

This parallels the Lotus Sutra's revelation of the eternal Buddha (LS Chapter 16) who appears to be born and die but actually transcends all temporal categories. Both sutras point to the timeless, spaceless nature of ultimate reality.

**Dust Motes and Worlds Revisited** (Chapter 30): The teaching returns to the theme of composite entities. Smashing worlds into dust motes reveals:
- No ultimate, indivisible particle exists
- All phenomena are aggregates
- The "unified characteristic" is a mental construct
- Reality is empty of inherent existence

This anticipates modern physics' discovery that matter dissolves into energy and probability. The Lotus Sutra's teaching on the eternal Buddha-land (LS Chapter 16) complements this: the world we perceive is not ultimate reality.

**Inexpressible Yet Attached** (Chapter 30): "A Unified Characteristic is inexpressible, but ordinary people greedily attach to such things." This describes the human condition:
- We cannot truly conceive ultimate reality
- Yet we cling to our limited concepts
- Language fails, yet we rely on language
- The inexpressible becomes an object of attachment

This is why the Diamond Sutra must use language to point beyond language. The Lotus Sutra similarly uses the parable of the burning house (LS Chapter 3) to show how we cling to what is actually empty.

**Knowledge and Views Not Created** (Chapter 31): "Those who generate the *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* mind should thus know, thus view, and thus believe and understand all dharmas, not giving rise to the characteristic of a dharma." This teaching on non-conceptual wisdom means:
- Know without creating fixed knowledge
- View without creating fixed views
- Understand without creating fixed understanding
- The characteristic of dharma is no characteristic

This is the perfection of wisdom—knowing that transcends conceptual knowledge. The Lotus Sutra expresses this through the Buddha's wisdom that sees all beings' capacities without conceptual elaboration (LS Chapter 2, 5).

**Final Verse - Six Similes** (Chapter 32): The famous concluding *gāthā* summarizes the entire sutra through six similes for all conditioned phenomena:

1. **Dream** (夢): Seems real while occurring, but upon awakening, completely gone. All our experiences are like this—vivid yet ultimately empty. We believe in the dream while dreaming; we see its emptiness upon waking. Enlightenment is waking from the dream of samsara.

2. **Illusion** (幻): A magician's trick—appears real but has no substance. Light and shadow create forms that seem solid but are mere appearances. All phenomena are like this—they appear but lack inherent existence. The magician knows the trick; the audience is fooled. The wise see through the illusion; the ignorant take it as real.

3. **Bubble** (泡): Appears for a moment, catches the light beautifully, then pops and is gone. So fragile, so temporary. All our achievements, relationships, identities—like bubbles. Beautiful while they last, but inherently unstable and impermanent.

4. **Shadow** (影): Follows the body, seems real, but is not a thing—merely the absence of light. We fear shadows, chase shadows, but they have no substance. Our concepts, our egos, our problems—all shadows. Not things to be grasped or fought, but empty appearances.

5. **Dew** (露): Morning dew on grass, so delicate. A breath of warmth and it evaporates. All conditioned things are this fragile. Life, youth, health, relationships—like dew. Precious because temporary, beautiful because fleeting.

6. **Lightning** (電): A flash in the darkness, brilliant for an instant, then gone. In that flash, everything is illuminated, then darkness returns. All moments are like this—arising and passing in an instant. Even this present moment, as you read these words, is like lightning—already gone.

These six similes work together to convey the impermanence, insubstantiality, and dreamlike nature of all conditioned existence. They are not nihilistic—the dream, illusion, bubble, shadow, dew, and lightning all appear and function. But they are empty of the permanence and solidity we attribute to them.

The Lotus Sutra's teaching on the eternal Buddha (LS Chapter 16) complements this: while all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, the Buddha-nature is eternal. The Diamond Sutra shows what is empty; the Lotus Sutra shows what is eternal. Together, they present the complete teaching.

**"Unmoving in Suchness"** (*tathatā*, Chapter 32): The instruction to explain the sutra "not grasping at characteristics, unmoving in suchness" means:
- Rest in the nature of reality as it is
- Don't fabricate or elaborate
- Remain in non-conceptual awareness
- Let suchness be suchness

This is the ultimate instruction for practice. The Lotus Sutra's teaching to "dwell in the Dharma" (LS Chapter 10) points to the same reality—resting in what is, without grasping or rejecting.

**Assembly Rejoicing** (Chapter 32): The sutra concludes with the assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, men, and asuras—rejoicing, believing, accepting, and practicing. This mirrors the Lotus Sutra's conclusions (LS Chapter 28) and reflects the Mahāyāna conviction that the teaching brings joy and transformation. The rejoicing indicates:
- Deep understanding has occurred
- Faith has been inspired
- Practice will follow
- The Dharma will be preserved

### Connections to the Lotus Sutra

**Dharmakāya Teaching**: Both sutras point beyond the historical Buddha to the eternal truth-body. The Diamond Sutra does this through negation ("cannot be seen through marks"); the Lotus Sutra through revelation ("eternal lifespan"). Complementary methods pointing to the same reality.

**Final Verse and Impermanence**: The Diamond Sutra's six similes (dream, illusion, bubble, shadow, dew, lightning) emphasize the impermanence of all conditioned phenomena. The Lotus Sutra's teaching on the eternal Buddha (LS Chapter 16) shows what transcends impermanence. Together: all conditioned things are impermanent; the Buddha-nature is eternal.

**Equality and One Vehicle**: The Diamond Sutra's teaching that the Dharma is equal (Chapter 23) parallels the Lotus Sutra's One Vehicle teaching (LS Chapter 2-3). Both express the Mahāyāna conviction that all beings have equal access to enlightenment.

**Supreme Teaching Claims**: Both sutras claim supreme status and promise extraordinary merit to those who uphold them. This shared rhetoric reflects Mahāyāna's confidence in its teachings and its missionary impulse to preserve the Dharma for future generations.

**Complementary Wisdom**: The Diamond Sutra and Lotus Sutra together provide complete Mahāyāna wisdom:
- **Diamond Sutra**: Cuts through all attachments, shows emptiness, uses negative language
- **Lotus Sutra**: Reveals eternal Buddha, shows skillful means, uses positive language

Reading them together prevents:
- Mistaking emptiness for nihilism (Diamond Sutra alone)
- Mistaking skillful means for eternalism (Lotus Sutra alone)

The Diamond Sutra empties the cup; the Lotus Sutra shows what fills it. The Diamond Sutra cuts away delusions; the Lotus Sutra reveals what remains. Both are essential for complete understanding of Mahāyāna Buddhism.
