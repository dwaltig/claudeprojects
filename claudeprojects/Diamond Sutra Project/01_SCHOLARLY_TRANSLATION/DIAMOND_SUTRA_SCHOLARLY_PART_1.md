## Chapter 1: The Convocation of the Assembly
**(法會因由分第一)**

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was in the kingdom of Śrāvastī, staying at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍada's park, together with a great assembly of twelve hundred and fifty monks.

At that time, when the mealtime had arrived, the World-Honored One put on his robe, took up his bowl, and entered the great city of Śrāvastī to beg for food. Within the city, he begged in sequential order, then returned to his original place. having finished his meal, he put away his robe and bowl, washed his feet, arranged his seat, and sat down.

## Chapter 2: Subhūti's Request
**(善現啟請分第二)**

At that time, the elder Subhūti rose from his seat in the midst of the assembly, bared his right shoulder, knelt on his right knee, joined his palms together in reverence, and addressed the Buddha, saying:

"It is rare, World-Honored One! The Tathāgata skillfully protects and keeps in mind all the Bodhisattvas; he skillfully entrusts the Bodhisattvas.[^1] World-Honored One, when good men and good women generate the mind of *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* (Supreme Perfect Enlightenment), how should they abide? How should they subdue their minds?"

The Buddha said: "Excellent, excellent, Subhūti! It is just as you say: the Tathāgata skillfully protects and keeps in mind all the Bodhisattvas and skillfully entrusts the Bodhisattvas. Now listen attentively, and I shall explain it for you. Good men and good women who generate the mind of *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* should abide like this, and should subdue their minds like this."

"Yes, World-Honored One. I listen with joy."

---

## Chapter 3: The Orthodox Doctrine of the Great Vehicle
**(大乘正宗分第三)**

The Buddha told Subhūti: "All Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas should subdue their minds in this manner:

'As for all the different categories of sentient beings—whether born from eggs, born from wombs, born from moisture, or born by transformation; whether having form or without form; whether having thought or without thought; or whether neither having thought nor without thought—I shall cause them all to enter the Nirvana without Remainder (*Anupadhiśeṣa-nirvāṇa*) and liberate them. Thus liberating immeasurable, countless, boundless sentient beings, in reality, no sentient being obtains liberation.'

Why is this? Subhūti, if a Bodhisattva has the notion of a self, the notion of a person, the notion of a sentient being, or the notion of a life-span, he is not a Bodhisattva."[^2]

---

## Chapter 4: Wonderful Conduct without Abiding
**(妙行無住分第四)**

"Furthermore, Subhūti, a Bodhisattva should not abide anywhere when practicing giving (*dāna*). That is to say, he should not abide in forms when giving, nor should he abide in sounds, scents, tastes, tactile sensations, or dharmas when giving. Subhūti, a Bodhisattva should give in this way: not abiding in any notion (*lakṣaṇa*).

Why is this? If a Bodhisattva gives without abiding in notions, his merit is immeasurable.

"Subhūti, what do you think? Is the space in the east measurable?"

"No, World-Honored One."

"Subhūti, is the space in the south, west, north, the four intermediate directions, the zenith, and the nadir measurable?"

"No, World-Honored One."

"Subhūti, the merit of a Bodhisattva who gives without abiding in notions is likewise immeasurable. Subhūti, Bodhisattvas should only abide in this teaching."

---

## Chapter 5: Seeing Truth through the Real
**(如理實見分第五)**

"Subhūti, what do you think? Can one see the Tathāgata by means of his bodily marks?"

"No, World-Honored One. One cannot see the Tathāgata by means of his bodily marks. Why? The bodily marks spoken of by the Tathāgata are not true marks."

The Buddha told Subhūti: "Whatever possesses a characteristic (*lakṣaṇa*) is illusory. If one sees that all characteristics are not characteristics, then one sees the Tathāgata."

---

## Chapter 6: Rare Integrity of Faith
**(正信希有分第六)**

Subhūti addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, will there be sentient beings in the future who, hearing such words and sentences spoken, will give rise to true faith?"

The Buddha told Subhūti: "Do not speak like that. Five hundred years after the Tathāgata's extinction, there will be those who uphold the precepts and cultivate blessings who will be able to give rise to faith in these words, taking them to be true. You should know that such people have not merely planted good roots with one Buddha, two Buddhas, three, four, or five Buddhas, but have planted all kinds of good roots with immeasurable thousands of tens of thousands of Buddhas. Upon hearing these sentences, if they give rise to even a single thought of pure faith, Subhūti, the Tathāgata fully knows and fully sees that these sentient beings obtain such immeasurable merit.

Why is this? Because these sentient beings no longer have the notion of a self, the notion of a person, the notion of a sentient being, or the notion of a life-span. They have no notion of dharma (*dharma-saṃjñā*) and no notion of non-dharma (*adharma-saṃjñā*).

Why is this? If the minds of these sentient beings grasp a characteristic, then they cling to a self, a person, a sentient being, and a life-span. If they grasp the characteristic of a dharma, they cling to a self, a person, a sentient being, and a life-span. Why? If they grasp the characteristic of non-dharma, they also cling to a self, a person, a sentient being, and a life-span.

Therefore, one should not grasp dharma, nor should one grasp non-dharma. Because of this meaning, the Tathāgata acts as one who constantly says: 'You monks should know that the Dharma I speak is like the parable of the raft. Even the Dharma must be discarded, how much more so the non-Dharma?'"

---

## Chapter 7: Nothing Obtained, Nothing Spoken
**(無得無說分第七)**

"Subhūti, what do you think? Has the Tathāgata obtained *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*? Has the Tathāgata spoken any Dharma?"

Subhūti said: "As I understand the meaning of what the Buddha has said, there is no fixed dharma called *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*, and there is no fixed dharma that the Tathāgata can speak. Why? The dharma spoken by the Tathāgata can neither be grasped nor spoken; it is neither dharma nor non-dharma. Why is this? All sages and worthies are distinguished by the unconditioned Dharma (*asaṃskṛta*)."

---

## Chapter 8: Emergence of the Dharma based on Merit
**(依法出生分第八)**

"Subhūti, what do you think? If someone were to fill the three thousand great thousand worlds with the seven treasures and give them as a gift, would the merit obtained by that person be great?"

Subhūti said: "Very great, World-Honored One. Why? This merit does not have the nature of merit; therefore the Tathāgata says the merit is great."

"If, on the other hand, someone were to accept and uphold even a four-line verse from this sutra and explain it to others, his merit would be greater than the other's. Why? Subhūti, all Buddhas and the *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* dharma of all Buddhas emerge from this sutra. Subhūti, the so-called Buddha-dharmas are not Buddha-dharmas."

---

## Chapter 9: The One Form is No Form
**(一相無相分第九)**

"Subhūti, what do you think? Can a Stream-Enterer (*Srota-āpanna*) think this thought: 'I have obtained the fruit of the Stream-Enterer'?"

Subhūti said: "No, World-Honored One. Why? A Stream-Enterer is called one who has 'entered the stream,' yet he enters nothing. He does not enter forms, sounds, scents, tastes, tactile sensations, or dharmas. Thus he is named a Stream-Enterer."

"Subhūti, what do you think? Can a Once-Returner (*Sakṛdāgāmin*) think this thought: 'I have obtained the fruit of the Once-Returner'?"

Subhūti said: "No, World-Honored One. Why? A Once-Returner is named one who goes and returns once, yet in reality there is no going or returning. Thus he is named a Once-Returner."

"Subhūti, what do you think? Can a Non-Returner (*Anāgāmin*) think this thought: 'I have obtained the fruit of the Non-Returner'?"

Subhūti said: "No, World-Honored One. Why? A Non-Returner is named one who does not return, yet in reality there is no non-returning. Therefore he is named a Non-Returner."

"Subhūti, what do you think? Can an Arhat think this thought: 'I have obtained the Arhat path'?"

Subhūti said: "No, World-Honored One. Why? In reality there is no dharma named Arhat. World-Honored One, if an Arhat were to think 'I have obtained the Arhat path,' that would be attachment to a self, a person, a sentient being, and a life-span.

"World-Honored One, the Buddha says I have attained the Samadhi of No-Disputation (*Araṇa-samādhi*) and am foremost among men, the foremost Arhat free from desire. World-Honored One, I do not think this thought: 'I am an Arhat free from desire.' World-Honored One, if I were to think 'I have obtained the Arhat path,' the World-Honored One would not have said that Subhūti is one who delights in the practice of *Araṇa* (peace/no-disputation). Since Subhūti essentially practices nothing, he is named 'Subhūti, who delights in the practice of *Araṇa*.'"

---

## Chapter 10: Adornment of Pure Lands
**(莊嚴淨土分第十)**

The Buddha told Subhūti: "What do you think? In the past, when the Tathāgata was at the place of Dīpaṃkara Buddha, did he obtain any dharma?"

"No, World-Honored One. When the Tathāgata was at the place of Dīpaṃkara Buddha, he in reality obtained no dharma."

"Subhūti, what do you think? Does a Bodhisattva adorn Buddha-lands?"

"No, World-Honored One. Why? Adorning Buddha-lands is not adorning; it is named adorning."

"Therefore, Subhūti, all Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas should thus give rise to a pure mind. They should not give rise to a mind that abides in forms; they should not give rise to a mind that abides in sounds, scents, tastes, tactile sensations, or dharmas. They should give rise to a mind that abides nowhere (應無所住而生其心).

"Subhūti, suppose there were a person with a body like Mount Sumeru, the King of Mountains. What do you think? Is that body great?"

Subhūti said: "Very great, World-Honored One. Why? The Buddha says it is not a body; therefore it is named a great body."

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

[^1]: **Skillfully entrusts** (Chinese: *shan fu zhu* 善付囑): The Buddha not only protects his disciples but trusts them with the responsibility of transmitting the Dharma. This parallels the Lotus Sutra's transmission scenes, particularly Chapter 22 where the Dharma is entrusted to future generations. Both sutras emphasize the sacred responsibility of preserving and teaching the Mahāyāna path.

[^2]: **The Four Notions** (Sanskrit: *catur-saṃjñā*; Chinese: 四相): Self (*ātman*), Person (*pudgala*), Sentient Being (*sattva*), Life-span (*jīva*). These represent progressively subtle forms of ego-clinging:
   - **Self**: The immediate subjective "I" 
   - **Person**: The self extended through time and rebirth
   - **Sentient Being**: The self as distinct from non-sentient phenomena
   - **Life-span**: The temporal duration of personal existence
   
   Transcending these four is essential to Bodhisattva practice. Compare with Lotus Sutra Chapter 16, where the eternal Buddha transcends all notions of birth, death, and temporal existence.

### Key Concepts and Cross-References

**Opening Assembly Scene** (Chapter 1): The simple, mundane description of the Buddha begging for food contrasts sharply with the Lotus Sutra's elaborate assembly scenes (LS Chapter 1). This reflects the Diamond Sutra's emphasis on ordinariness and non-attachment to special states. The Buddha's enlightenment is found in everyday actions, not supernatural displays.

**Subhūti as Interlocutor**: Subhūti (Sanskrit: "Well-Born" or "Good Existence"; Chinese: 須菩提 *Xūpútí*) is chosen as the primary questioner because of his deep understanding of emptiness (*śūnyatā*). In the Lotus Sutra, Śāriputra—foremost in wisdom—plays a similar role. The choice of interlocutor reflects each sutra's emphasis: Śāriputra for skillful means, Subhūti for emptiness.

**Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi** (Sanskrit: अनुत्तर सम्यक् संबोधि; Chinese: 阿耨多羅三藐三菩提 *ānòuduōluó sānmiǎo sānpútí*): "Supreme Perfect Enlightenment" or "Unsurpassed Complete Perfect Awakening." This is the ultimate goal of the Bodhisattva path in both Diamond and Lotus Sutras. However, the Diamond Sutra emphasizes that even this supreme goal must not be grasped as a "thing" to attain.

**Nirvana without Remainder** (*Anupadhiśeṣa-nirvāṇa*; Chinese: 無餘涅槃): The complete extinction of all karmic residue and the five aggregates. The Diamond Sutra's paradox—liberating all beings while recognizing no beings are liberated—parallels the Lotus Sutra's teaching that all beings already possess Buddha-nature (LS Chapter 2).

**Non-Abiding Giving** (Chapter 4): The perfection of generosity (*dāna-pāramitā*) practiced without attachment to giver, gift, or recipient. This "threefold purity" is central to Mahāyāna practice. Compare with Lotus Sutra Chapter 10, where Medicine King burns his body as the ultimate offering—yet the Lotus Sutra emphasizes the positive merit, while the Diamond Sutra emphasizes the emptiness of merit itself. Two perspectives on the same truth.

**Immeasurable Merit**: Both sutras use hyperbolic comparisons to emphasize the supreme merit of upholding their teachings. The Diamond Sutra compares sutra-upholding to filling worlds with treasures (Chapter 4, 8); the Lotus Sutra makes similar comparisons (LS Chapter 10, 17). This shared rhetoric reflects the Mahāyāna conviction that wisdom-practice surpasses material generosity.

**Bodily Marks** (*lakṣaṇa*; Chinese: 相): The thirty-two major and eighty minor physical marks of a Buddha. The Diamond Sutra repeatedly teaches that one cannot see the Tathāgata through these marks (Chapters 5, 13, 20, 26). This contrasts with the Lotus Sutra Chapter 16's revelation of the eternal Buddha—not negating form, but transcending temporal limitations. The Diamond Sutra uses negative language (not this, not that); the Lotus Sutra uses positive revelation (eternal, boundless). Both point to the same truth beyond conceptual grasping.

**Faith and Merit** (Chapter 6): The Diamond Sutra predicts that 500 years after the Buddha's extinction, some will have faith in these teachings. This parallels the Lotus Sutra's concern with the "Latter Age of the Dharma" (LS Chapter 13, 20). Both sutras promise extraordinary merit to those who uphold them in degenerate times, reflecting Mahāyāna's missionary impulse to preserve the teaching for future generations.

**Planting Good Roots**: The metaphor of planting wholesome seeds (*kuśala-mūla*) with countless Buddhas appears in both sutras. In the Diamond Sutra (Chapter 6), it explains why some have faith; in the Lotus Sutra (Chapter 2), it explains why some understand the One Vehicle. Both emphasize that current understanding results from vast past practice.

**The Raft Parable** (Chapter 6): "Even the Dharma must be discarded, how much more so the non-Dharma." This famous teaching parallels the Lotus Sutra's burning house parable (LS Chapter 3), where the provisional teachings (the carts) are skillful means to be transcended. The Diamond Sutra emphasizes non-attachment to teachings; the Lotus Sutra emphasizes their provisional nature. Both warn against clinging to conceptual formulations.

**Nothing Obtained, Nothing Spoken** (Chapter 7): The Buddha obtained no fixed dharma called enlightenment and speaks no fixed dharma. This radical emptiness teaching complements the Lotus Sutra's revelation that all teachings are skillful means (*upāya*). If the Diamond Sutra deconstructs all concepts, the Lotus Sutra shows why such deconstruction is itself a skillful teaching adapted to circumstances.

**Four-Line Verse** (*gāthā*; Chinese: 四句偈): References to accepting and upholding "even a four-line verse" appear throughout (Chapters 8, 13, 15, etc.). This likely refers to the famous final verse of Chapter 32, though it could mean any brief extract. The emphasis on minimal text reflects the Prajñāpāramitā tradition's conviction that true wisdom cannot be measured by quantity. Compare with Lotus Sutra's similar emphasis on upholding even one phrase (LS Chapter 10).

**Stream-Enterer through Arhat** (Chapter 9): The Diamond Sutra examines the four stages of Hīnayāna attainment—Stream-Enterer (*Srota-āpanna*), Once-Returner (*Sakṛdāgāmin*), Non-Returner (*Anāgāmin*), and Arhat—showing that true attainment involves no notion of attainment. This critiques the Hīnayāna goal from a Mahāyāna perspective. The Lotus Sutra goes further, declaring these "three vehicles" to be provisional teachings leading to the One Buddha Vehicle (LS Chapter 2-3). The Diamond Sutra deconstructs the attainments; the Lotus Sutra subsumes them into a greater vehicle.

**Araṇa-samādhi** (Sanskrit: अरण समाधि; Chinese: 阿蘭那 or 無諍三昧): "Samadhi of No-Disputation" or "Peaceful Practice." Subhūti's specialty, representing the perfection of non-contention and harmony. This connects to the Lotus Sutra's emphasis on peaceful practices (*śānta-caryā*) in Chapter 14, where the Bodhisattva avoids all disputes and dwells in patience.

**Adorning Buddha-Lands** (Chapter 10): The paradox that adorning Buddha-lands is not adorning parallels the Lotus Sutra's teaching on the eternal, already-perfect Buddha-land revealed in Chapter 16. The Diamond Sutra emphasizes emptiness of adornment; the Lotus Sutra reveals the eternal purity already present. Both transcend dualistic thinking about pure and impure lands.

**"Abide Nowhere"** (應無所住而生其心): Perhaps the most famous phrase in the Diamond Sutra. The mind should arise without abiding in any object or concept. This is the heart of Prajñāpāramitā practice. In Zen/Chan tradition, this phrase is said to have triggered the Sixth Patriarch Huineng's awakening. It represents the perfect balance of wisdom (non-abiding) and compassion (mind arising to help beings). Compare with the Lotus Sutra's teaching to "dwell in the Dharma" (LS Chapter 10)—not a contradiction, but complementary: dwell in the Dharma by abiding nowhere.

**Mount Sumeru** (Sanskrit: सुमेरु; Chinese: 須彌山 *Xūmí shān*): The cosmic mountain at the center of the world in Buddhist cosmology. Used here (Chapter 10) for comparison of merit. Both sutras use cosmic imagery to convey the inconceivable merit of their teachings, reflecting the Mahāyāna tendency toward the superlative and universal.

### Connections to the Lotus Sutra

The Diamond Sutra and Lotus Sutra represent two essential and complementary aspects of Mahāyāna wisdom:

- **Diamond Sutra**: Emphasizes *emptiness* (śūnyatā), deconstruction, non-attachment, and the via negativa
- **Lotus Sutra**: Emphasizes *skillful means* (upāya), revelation, universal salvation, and the via positiva

Together, they provide a complete picture: The Diamond Sutra shows that all concepts (including "Buddha," "enlightenment," "beings") are empty of inherent existence. The Lotus Sutra shows that precisely because of this emptiness, infinite skillful means can arise to guide beings. Emptiness is not nihilism but the ground of compassionate activity.

Reading them together prevents two errors:
1. Mistaking the Lotus Sutra's positive teachings for eternalism (grasping at concepts)
2. Mistaking the Diamond Sutra's negative teachings for nihilism (falling into emptiness)

The Diamond Sutra cuts through all attachments; the Lotus Sutra reveals what remains when attachments are cut: the eternal, compassionate Buddha-activity working for the liberation of all beings.
