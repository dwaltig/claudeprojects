# Song 09: Five Eyes
**Diamond Sutra Chapters 18-22 Combined**

---

## The Teaching
The Buddha sees with five eyes—physical, heavenly, wisdom, Dharma, Buddha—yet holds no fixed view. Past, present, future minds cannot be grasped. Merit is empty yet infinite. The Buddha obtained nothing—that's why it's Supreme Perfect Enlightenment.

## Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1 - Five Eyes]
The Buddha has five eyes
Physical eye sees forms
Heavenly eye sees beings' births and deaths
Wisdom eye sees emptiness
Dharma eye sees all teachings
Buddha eye sees everything at once

Sees all
Knows all
Understands all

[Verse 2 - Three Minds]
But then he says
All those minds
Past, present, future
Cannot be grasped

Past mind, gone
Can't hold it
Present mind, passing
Can't catch it
Future mind, not here
Can't grab it

[Chorus 1]
So what is it that knows?
What is it that sees?
If you can't grasp any mind
Who's doing the grasping?

You see everything
By holding nothing

[Verse 3 - Merit is Empty]
Did the Tathāgata obtain merit?

No, says Subhūti
The Tathāgata obtained no merit

Because if merit were real
If it were a thing you could grab
You could count it
You could measure it

But because merit is empty
It's infinite
Because it has no substance
It's boundless

[Verse 4 - Nothing Obtained]
When you attained enlightenment
Did you obtain nothing?

That's right, says the Buddha
I obtained not even
The slightest dharma

Enlightenment ain't something you get
Ain't a prize you win
Ain't a state you achieve
And then possess

[Chorus 2]
It's the recognition
That there was never anything to get
Never anyone to get it
Never any getting happening at all

Nothing obtained
That's why it's called
Supreme Perfect Enlightenment

[Outro]
You already are
What you're looking for

You just don't know it yet
```
