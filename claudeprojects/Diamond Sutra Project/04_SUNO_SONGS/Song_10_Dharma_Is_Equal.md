# Song 10: Dharma is Equal
**Diamond Sutra Chapters 23-25 Combined**

---

## The Teaching
The Dharma is equal—no high, no low. Emperor and beggar have equal access to freedom. Even a mountain of merit is empty. And the Bodhisattva saves all beings by seeing there are no beings to save.

## Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1 - Equal]
This Dharma is equal
Without high or low

No hierarchy
No levels
No better than
No less than

The truth is the same for everyone
Emperor and beggar
Scholar and illiterate
Monk and layperson

All have equal access
To this freedom

[Chorus 1]
Why?
Because it ain't based on
What you do
What you know
Who you are

It's based on seeing through
All those distinctions

Seeing that there's no self
To be high or low
No person to be
Better or worse

When you see
The equality of all things
You're free

[Verse 2 - Mountain of Merit]
Gather together
All the Mount Sumerus
In a three-thousand great thousand world system

Pile them up
One on top of another
A mountain of mountains
A heap of merit
Beyond imagination

Would that be great?

Very great, says Subhūti
But the heap of merit
Is not a heap of merit

[Bridge]
Even a mountain of merit
Is empty

It's like trying to pile up space
You can talk about it
You can imagine it
But what are you actually piling?

Nothing
Just emptiness on top of emptiness

[Verse 3 - No Beings to Liberate]
Don't say the Tathāgata thinks
I should liberate sentient beings

Why?
Because there are actually
No sentient beings
For the Tathāgata to liberate

Not because beings don't suffer
Not because compassion doesn't matter
But because in ultimate truth
There are no separate beings

[Chorus 2]
The Bodhisattva vows
To save all beings
Works tirelessly
Gives everything

But never thinks
I am saving them

Why?
Because there's no fixed I
Doing the saving
No separate them
Being saved

[Outro]
You save all beings
By seeing there are no beings to save

You liberate everyone
By recognizing
There's no one bound
```
