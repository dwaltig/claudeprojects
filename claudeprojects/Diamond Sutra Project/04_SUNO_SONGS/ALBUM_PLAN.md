## Part One: The Opening

### Song 1: "The Scene / Hold Nothing"
**Chapters 1-2 Combined**

The overture. We open with the Buddha's ordinary morning—waking, robing, begging, eating—showing enlightenment in the everyday. Then Subhūti rises with THE question: "How should we hold our minds?" The Buddha's answer destroys everything: "Dwell nowhere. Hold nothing."

**Musical Arc**: Starts intimate and acoustic, builds to full band on the chorus "Hold nothing, brother / Hold nothing, sister."

---

## Part Two: The Foundations

### Song 2: "The Bodhisattva Vow"
**Chapter 3**

The great paradox: Save all beings, but know that no beings are actually saved. Do everything, claim nothing. This is strong enough to stand alone.

### Song 3: "No Marks"
**Chapters 4-5 Combined**

True generosity (giver, gift, receiver all dissolve) flows into the teaching that Buddha can't be seen through physical form. What you're looking for has no marks.

### Song 4: "Faith in Hard Times"  
**Chapters 6-7 Combined**

Will anyone believe this hard teaching? Yes—those prepared through many lifetimes. And the Buddha hasn't obtained anything, hasn't spoken any fixed dharma. Faith meets emptiness.

### Song 5: "Merit Beyond Measure"
**Chapters 8-10 Combined**

The teaching surpasses all material treasures. Four stages of awakening—but each one releases the claim to attainment. You reach the top by giving up climbing.

---

## Part Three: The Deep Teaching

### Song 6: "Ganges Sands"
**Chapters 11-13 Combined**

Mind-bending infinity: Ganges Rivers full of Ganges sands. The sutra itself becomes a sacred site. And the name "Diamond Sutra"? Even that's a provisional teaching.

### Song 7: "Subhūti Weeps"
**Chapters 14-15 Combined**

The emotional climax of Part Three. Subhūti breaks down weeping when he truly hears the teaching. Then the story of King Kali—the Buddha's past life of absolute patience while being dismembered. Tears and forbearance.

### Song 8: "Ultimate Selflessness"
**Chapters 16-17 Combined**

Karma works, but there's no one it happens to. The deepest teaching on no-self. This is where many listeners will need to pause and breathe.

---

## Part Four: The Paradoxes

### Song 9: "Five Eyes"
**Chapters 18-22 Combined**

The Buddha sees with five kinds of eyes—yet holds no fixed view. Past, present, future minds can't be grasped. A cascade of paradoxes building intensity.

### Song 10: "Dharma is Equal"
**Chapters 23-25 Combined**

No high or low, no attainment, no merit that can be measured. No beings to actually liberate. The paradoxes reach their peak.

### Song 11: "The Famous Verse"
**Chapters 26-31 Combined**

The first great verse: "All phenomena are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, dew, lightning." This is the verse practitioners have chanted for 1,500 years. Build it as a suite, with the verse as the climax.

---

## Part Five: The Great Verse

### Song 12: "The Great Verse"
**Chapter 32 Alone**

The final teaching. The summation. Dream, illusion, bubble, shadow, dew, lightning—rendered in full, with the closing benediction. This is the album closer. Make it unforgettable.
