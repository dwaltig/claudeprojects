# Song 05: Merit Beyond Measure
**Diamond Sutra Chapters 8-10 Combined**

---

## The Teaching
Four lines of this teaching surpass all treasures in all worlds. But don't worship the finger pointing at the moon. The four stages of awakening? Each one releases the claim to attainment. You reach the top by giving up climbing. Generate a mind that abides nowhere—that's the heart of the sutra.

## Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1 - Treasures]
Fill three thousand worlds
With treasures beyond measure
Gold and silver
Diamonds and pearls
Everything precious
Everything rare

Give it all away

The merit would be great
Beyond calculation

[Verse 2 - Four Lines]
But take four lines
Just four lines of this teaching
Receive them
Hold them
Share them with others

That merit?
It surpasses all the treasures
In all the worlds

[Chorus 1 - Why]
Why?
Cause treasures you can hold
But this teaching sets you free
Treasures you can count
But this merit's infinity

Four lines that point beyond themselves
Four lines that cut through everything
Four lines that show you
You were never bound

[Bridge 1 - The Finger]
The finger pointing at the moon
Don't worship the finger
The raft that crosses the river
Don't carry the raft
The teaching that frees you
Don't cling to the teaching

The Dharma spoken
Is not the Dharma
That's why it's called
The Dharma

[Verse 3 - Four Stages]
Four stages on the path
Stream-Enterer
Once-Returner
Non-Returner
Arhat

Each one higher
Each one closer
Each one nearer to freedom

But here's the thing
The moment you think you reached it
You lost it

[Chorus 2 - Giving Up Climbing]
You reach the top
By giving up climbing
You arrive
By letting go of the journey

The highest attainment
Is no attainment
The greatest freedom
Is claiming nothing

[Verse 4 - Abide Nowhere]
Generate a mind
That abides nowhere

Not in form
Not in sound
Not in smell or taste or touch
Not in any dharma

Abide nowhere
That's the practice
Abide nowhere
That's the path

[Outro]
You looking for home?
Stop looking
You trying to get somewhere?
Stop trying

Home is the groundless ground
The nowhere that's everywhere

Abide nowhere
And you're home
Hold nothing
And you have everything

Let go of every fixed position
And you find the truth
That was never lost
```

## SoundCloud Description by Maya "Ink" Reynolds

### Short Description
Treasures filling three thousand worlds can't compare to four lines of truth. The highest attainment is claiming nothing.

### Full Description
Merit Beyond Measure
The William Altig Choir

💎 *"The merit would be great... but take four lines of this teaching... that merit surpasses all the treasures in all the worlds."*

We chase merit. We chase status. We chase "spiritual materialism." The Buddha cuts through it all. Fill the galaxy with diamonds—it's finite. But wake up to the truth of "Abide Nowhere"? That's infinite.

This song traverses the four stages of awakening—from Stream-Enterer to Arhat—and reveals the secret: You reach the top by giving up the climb. You arrive by realizing you never left.

🙏 Part of the Diamond Sutra Reborn series
📿 Based on Diamond Sutra Chapters 8-10 ("Real Merit & The Four Stages")

## Cover Art Brief by Deja "Vision" Williams

### Visual Concept
**"The Weight of Light"**. A grand, antique scale balancing against a starry void.
- **Left Scale Pan**: Piled high with glowing galaxies, mountains of gold, and jewels (The "Three Thousand Worlds").
- **Right Scale Pan**: Contains a single, simple floating scroll or a feather of pure white light.
- **The Result**: The single scroll/feather outweighs the galaxies. The scale tips heavily toward the simple truth.

### Image Prompts

**Option A**:
```
album cover, antique brass scale balancing against deep space background, left pan piled with glowing galaxies and gold treasure, right pan holding a single feather of white light, the feather outweighs the galaxies, cinematic lighting, epic spiritual theme, hyper-realistic surrealism, Title: Merit Beyond Measure, Artist: The William Altig Choir
```

**Option B**:
```
album cover, four lines of glowing text floating in a void, shining brighter than a background of thousands of jewels and gold, minimal and powerful, deep indigo and blinding gold contrast, typography focused, gospel album aesthetic, Title: Merit Beyond Measure, Artist: The William Altig Choir
```
