# Song 11: The Famous Verse
**Diamond Sutra Chapters 26-31 Combined**

---

## The Teaching
The verse that's echoed through Buddhist history: "If one sees me in forms, or seeks me in sounds, this person walks a deviant path." The Buddha ain't in the mirror—he's the one looking. The Middle Way: not destruction, but seeing emptiness. Everything flows, nothing is fixed.

## Lyrics for Suno

```
[Intro - The Famous Verse]
If one sees me in forms
Or seeks me in sounds
This person walks a deviant path
And cannot see the Tathāgata

[Verse 1 - Wrong Place]
You looking for the Buddha
In what you can see?
In what you can hear?
In what you can touch?

You're looking in the wrong place

The Buddha ain't in the form
Ain't in the voice
Ain't in the body
Ain't in the marks

The Buddha ain't something
You can point to and say
There he is

[Chorus 1]
The Buddha is in the seeing itself
In the hearing itself
In the knowing that can't be grasped
In the truth that has no form

You want to find the Buddha?
Stop looking
Stop seeking
Just be what you already are

The Buddha you're searching for
Ain't in the mirror
The Buddha is the one
Looking in the mirror

[Verse 2 - The Middle Way]
Don't say the Tathāgata thinks
I should cut off and annihilate dharmas

The Middle Way
Not eternalism
Not nihilism

Not thinking things are permanent
Not thinking nothing exists

[Bridge]
The Diamond Sutra cuts through everything
But it doesn't annihilate
It empties everything
But it doesn't destroy

It's like the difference
Between breaking a cup
And seeing that the cup is empty

Breaking it is destruction
Seeing its emptiness is wisdom

[Verse 3 - Nothing Fixed]
The Buddha doesn't destroy dharmas
He shows you they were never solid
To begin with

Never permanent
Never separate
Always empty
Always flowing

That's the Middle Way

[Chorus 2]
No interruption
Things aren't destroyed

No annihilation
Things aren't nothing

Just seeing things as they are
Empty yet appearing
Flowing yet present

[Outro]
If one sees me in forms
Or seeks me in sounds
This person walks a deviant path

Stop looking
And you'll see

Stop seeking
And you'll find

The Buddha was never lost
You were never bound
Freedom was never distant

Just be what you already are
```
