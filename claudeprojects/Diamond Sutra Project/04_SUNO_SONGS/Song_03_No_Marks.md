# Song 03: No Marks
**Diamond Sutra Chapters 4-5 Combined**

---

## The Teaching
True generosity dissolves giver, gift, and receiver into boundless space. And you can't find the Buddha by looking at physical marks—the real Buddha has no form, no features. What you're searching for has no marks.

## Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1 - The Question]
The Buddha asks
Subhūti, can you measure the space?
Can you count the East sky?
Can you find where it ends
Put a fence around the infinite?

No, says Subhūti
His voice quiet but sure
Space is boundless
It has no measure
It just is

[Verse 2 - The Teaching]
That's right, says the Buddha
And his smile is like sunshine
And the merit of giving without clinging?
It's just like that
Boundless, immeasurable, free

It just spreads
Like light through all directions
Like water finding its level
Like love that doesn't ask back
Like rain that don't care whose field it's falling on

[Chorus 1 - Pour It Out]
Pour it out, let it flow
Don't hold back, let it go
Don't claim the credit, don't claim the prize
Don't look for thanks in another's eyes

Just give like the rain falls on the ground
Making life grow without a sound
Give like the sun shines on the earth
Giving light to everything of worth

[Bridge 1]
Pour it out
Your love, your time, your self
Let it merge with the ocean
Let it disappear into the vastness

When the giver dissolves
When the gift dissolves
When the receiver dissolves
That's when you know you're free

[Verse 3 - Looking for Buddha]
You looking for the Buddha
In the golden skin?
You searching for the truth
In the marks upon his form?

You checking off the features
Counting up the signs
Looking for the special
Looking for the divine?

[Verse 4 - Wrong Place]
But the Buddha says, Listen
You looking in the wrong place
Whatever has a characteristic
Whatever has a face
Whatever you can point to
Whatever you can name
That ain't the truth, brother
That's just the illusion's game

[Chorus 2 - Can't See the Buddha]
Can't see the Buddha in the body
Can't find truth in the form
Can't grab hold of the formless
Can't contain what can't be born

The real Buddha got no features
The true nature got no marks
It's in the seeing, not the seen
It's in the light, not in the dark

[Bridge 2]
You want to see the Tathāgata?
Stop looking at the man
You want to know the truth?
Let go of every plan

The Buddha you're searching for
Ain't in the special signs
He's in the emptiness itself
In the space between the lines

[Outro]
See all characteristics
As not characteristics
That's when you see clear
That's when the Buddha
Appears everywhere
Cause he was never not here
```

## Production Notes

- **Two themes in one song**: Giving (joyful) and Looking for Buddha (searching then peaceful)
- **The transition**: Mark the shift from Chapter 4 to Chapter 5 with a key change or tempo shift
- **Hook lines**: "Pour it out, let it flow" and "Can't see the Buddha in the body"
- **End peacefully**: "Cause he was never not here" should land with certainty

**Suggested Title**: "No Marks" or "Pour It Out"
