# Song 08: Ultimate Selflessness
**Diamond Sutra Chapters 16-17 Combined**

---

## The Teaching
Being despised for upholding truth isn't punishment—it's purification. Old karma burns away like impurities in gold. Then the Buddha returns to the original question: "How should we hold our minds?" The answer, deepened: "Abide nowhere. Hold nothing."

## Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1 - Despised]
You uphold this teaching
You read these words
You practice this truth

And people despise you
Look down on you
Treat you with contempt

That ain't a sign
You're doing it wrong

That's the fire
Burning away old karma

[Verse 2 - The Fire]
The evil from past lives
The karma that should have
Dragged you down
Into suffering

It's being consumed
Right now
In this present moment
By the contempt you're experiencing

[Chorus 1 - Purification]
The suffering you feel
While upholding the truth
Ain't punishment
It's purification

The fire that burns
Ain't destroying you
It's burning away
What was never you

[Bridge 1]
Like gold in the refiner's fire
The heat ain't destroying the gold
It's burning away the impurities

What remains?
Pure
Free
Enlightened

So when they despise you
When they look down on you
When they treat you with contempt

Know this
The old karma is burning
The past is being consumed
The future is being freed

[Verse 3 - Return to the Question]
The Buddha returns
To where it all began

How should we hold our minds?

He served countless Buddhas
Made offerings beyond measure
Generated merit
Beyond calculation

But this teaching
This sutra
In the final age?

Its merit surpasses all of that

[Chorus 2 - The Answer Complete]
Generate a mind
That abides nowhere

Not in form
Not in sound
Not in smell or taste or touch
Not in any dharma

Abide nowhere
Hold nothing
Claim nothing
Grasp nothing

[Outro]
The question that started it all
Comes back around
Richer now
Deeper now
Complete

How should we hold our minds?

Dwell nowhere
And you're home

Hold nothing
And you have everything

Let go of every fixed position
And you find the freedom
That was never lost
```
