# Song 07: Subhūti Weeps
**Diamond Sutra Chapters 14-15 Combined**

---

## The Teaching
When Subhūti truly hears the teaching, he breaks down weeping—tears of recognition, tears of coming home. Then the Buddha tells of King Kali, who dismembered him in a past life. With no notion of self, there was no anger—only perfect patience that transformed suffering into liberation.

## Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1 - The Tears]
Subhūti hears the teaching
And tears come
Deep tears
Soul tears

This is rare, he says
So rare
I've never heard
Anything like this

[Verse 2 - Terrifying Truth]
And the Buddha says
In the future
When beings hear this teaching
Some will be startled
Some will be frightened
Some will be afraid

Cause this teaching is terrifying
If you're holding onto something
It strips away everything
Everything you thought was solid
Everything you thought was you

[Chorus 1 - Breaking Open]
But if you can hear it
Without fear
If you can let it
Break you open
If you can stand
In the emptiness
Without running away

That's when the tears come

Not tears of sadness
But tears of recognition
Tears of coming home

[Bridge 1]
The truth breaks you open
But what spills out
Ain't blood
It's light

The teaching terrifies
But what dies
Ain't you
It's the lie you been believing

[Verse 3 - King Kali]
The Buddha tells a story
From long ago

King Kali
Cruel and jealous
Cut off his limbs
One by one

Hands
Feet
Ears
Nose

Piece by piece
Dismembered

[Verse 4 - No Self to Harm]
And in that moment
The Buddha had no notion
Of a self being harmed
No notion of a person suffering
No notion of a being being cut

Just the cutting
Happening in emptiness

And because there was no self
There could be no anger
Because there was no person
There could be no hatred

Just patience
Perfect patience

[Chorus 2 - Suffering Becomes the Path]
The worst thing that can happen
Being torn apart
Piece by piece
Becomes the path to freedom
When you see through
The illusion of self

The body can be cut
The ego can be shattered
But what you really are?
That can't be touched

[Outro]
Not startled
Not frightened
Not afraid

Suffering becomes the path
When you let go of the sufferer
Pain becomes liberation
When you see through
The one who hurts

That's the rare being
That's the one who's ready
That's the one who's free
```

- **"What you really are can't be touched"**: The resolution after the darkness

**Suggested Title**: "Subhūti Weeps" or "Tears of Coming Home"
