# Song 06: Ganges Sands
**Diamond Sutra Chapters 11-13 Combined**

---

## The Teaching
Numbers beyond counting—Ganges Rivers multiplied by grains of sand—yet four lines of this teaching surpass all those treasures. Wherever this sutra is spoken becomes holy ground. And the name "Diamond Perfection of Wisdom"? Even that must be let go.

## Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1 - Beyond Counting]
Count the grains of sand
In the Ganges River

Now multiply that
By Ganges Rivers

Now fill that many worlds
With treasures beyond measure

Give it all away

The merit would be great
Beyond imagination
Beyond calculation
Beyond comprehension

[Verse 2 - Four Lines]
But take four lines
Just four lines of this teaching
And share them with another

That merit surpasses
All the treasures
All the worlds
All the Ganges sands

[Chorus 1]
You can't count the truth
Can't measure freedom
Can't put a number
On what was never bound

Treasures come and go
Worlds rise and fall
But this teaching cuts through
To what's eternal

[Verse 3 - Holy Ground]
Wherever this sutra is spoken
Even just four lines
That place becomes a shrine
That ground becomes holy

Not because the words are magic
Not because the book is special
But because the truth they point to
Is always here
Always sacred
Always free

[Chorus 2]
You don't need a temple
Don't need golden statues
Don't need incense burning

You got this teaching?
You got the Buddha
You got the shrine
You got the holy ground

[Bridge]
The place where you're sitting
Reading these words right now
That's the shrine
That's the stupa
That's where the Buddha lives

[Verse 4 - The Title]
What should we call this teaching?
Subhūti asks

Call it the Diamond
Says the Buddha
The Diamond Perfection of Wisdom

Diamond
Because it cuts through everything
Can't be broken
Can't be destroyed

[Outro]
But here's the thing
The Perfection of Wisdom
Is not the Perfection of Wisdom

That's why it's called
The Perfection of Wisdom

Even the teaching
Must cut through the teaching
Even wisdom
Must let go of wisdom

The Diamond Sutra
Cuts through the Diamond Sutra

That's the perfection
That's the wisdom
That's the freedom
```
