The Diamond Sutra Reborn: An American Blues Interpretation
William Altig

---

Twelve songs. One teaching. Nothing to hold on to.

The Diamond Sutra been cutting through delusion for 1,500 years—a late-night dialogue between the Buddha and his brother Subhūti that leaves no concept standing. Now that teaching walks into the juke joint, sits down at the bar, and starts testifying.

This ain't philosophy. This is what happens when the deepest wisdom meets the music that knows suffering from the inside out. Delta guitar meets emptiness. Gospel choir meets "no self, no soul, no thing." The crossroads where letting go IS the path home.

Every song here carries a piece of the Diamond Sutra's impossible logic: How do you help all beings without thinking you're helping anyone? How do you walk the path without believing there's a path? How do you hold nothing and love everything at the same time?

The Buddha didn't preach. He cut. These songs swing that same blade.

Dwell nowhere. Hold nothing. Let the music take it from here.

"All phenomena are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow—
like dew, like lightning.
Contemplate them thus."

If you ready to put down what you think you know, press play.
