# Song 02: The Bodhisattva Vow
**Diamond Sutra Chapter 3**

---

## The Teaching
The great paradox: Save all beings—every last one—but know that in reality, not a single being has been saved. Do everything, claim nothing. If you think you're the savior, you've missed the point.

---

## Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1]
The Buddha says, listen close now
I'm gonna tell you how to live

Save all beings
Every last one
Born from eggs, born from wombs
Born from moisture, born from sun

Those with form and those without
Those who think and those who don't
Every creature, every soul
Every being, leave none out

Cause them all to enter freedom
Set them all completely free

[Verse 2]
But here's the thing you got to know
Here's the truth that sets you free

After saving all those beings
Not a single one was saved
After all that liberation
Not a soul was truly freed

[Chorus]
Cause if you think you're the savior
If you think you're doing good
If you hold the notion I helped them
You ain't understood

There's no you
There's no them
No liberation as a thing
Just the doing
Just the loving
Just the freedom that you bring

[Bridge]
You got to do everything
Give everything
Pour yourself out completely

But you can't claim nothing
Can't hold nothing
Can't believe you're somebody special

That's the paradox
That's the path
That's the blues of the Bodhisattva

[Outro]
Doing everything
Claiming nothing
Saving all
Knowing none are saved

That's how you walk
That's how you serve
That's how you live
In the freedom you already have
```

## Lyric Analysis

- **Primary Emotion**: Awe-struck revelation, humbling truth
- **Emotional Arc**: Grand vow → Paradox revealed → Acceptance
- **Key Imagery**: Saving all beings, pouring out, claiming nothing
- **Energy Profile**: Medium, builds to chorus, settles in outro

---

## Musical Recommendations

### Primary Sound Palette
Memphis soul-blues with testimony delivery. Think Al Green meets Bobby "Blue" Bland—big, soulful, sermon-like. The paradox needs weight.

### Tempo & Feel
75-80 BPM, medium shuffle with space. Not rushed—let the paradox breathe.

### Instrumentation
- Hammond B3 organ (foundation)
- Electric guitar with warm overdrive
- Horns (optional—Memphis style stabs)
- Bass and drums in the pocket
- Gospel-style backing vocals on chorus

### Vocal Direction
Testimony style—like a preacher who's just realized the deepest truth. Builds conviction, then settles into quiet knowing on the outro.

## Cover Art Brief (Deja "Vision" Williams)

### Song Essence
The impossible beauty of giving everything while claiming nothing. Hands that save the world but never close into fists. Service without ego—the paradox made visible.

### Visual Concept
Open hands releasing something precious—light, water, or doves—into the world. The hands are weathered, working hands. They give freely without grasping. The gesture is simultaneously powerful and surrendered.

**Alternative:** A figure pouring water endlessly from a vessel, but the vessel never empties. The giving that costs nothing because there's no giver holding on.

**Alternative 2:** A silhouette walking away from a great crowd, having helped them all, casting no shadow. The helper who doesn't need to be seen.

### Color Palette
- Deep gold and amber (warmth of service)
- Soft white light (purity of giving)
- Earth tones (grounded compassion)
- Deep blues (depth of wisdom)
- Warm shadows (humility)

### Typography Direction
Bold but humble serif—something that commands respect without demanding attention. The title should feel like a vow carved in stone, ancient and enduring.

## Image Generation Prompts

### Option A: Open Hands Releasing Light
```
album cover, weathered open hands releasing golden light upward, palms facing up, giving gesture, warm amber tones, spiritual but grounded, vintage photography texture, blues soul aesthetic, theme of selfless service and letting go, contemplative mood
```

### Option B: The Endless Vessel
```
album cover, figure pouring water from ancient vessel, water never depleting, symbolic of boundless giving, warm earth tones, spiritual imagery, backlit by golden light, blues aesthetic, theme of service without self, contemplative and profound
```

### Option C: The Humble Helper
```
album cover, silhouette of figure walking away from crowd into light, having served without recognition, no shadow cast, golden hour lighting, minimal composition, spiritual blues aesthetic, theme of ego-less service, profound and peaceful
```

## SoundCloud Description (Maya "Ink" Reynolds)

**The Bodhisattva Vow**
*The William Altig Choir*

🎵 **Diamond Sutra Blues – Song 2**

Save all beings. Every last one.
Born from eggs, born from wombs, born from moisture.
Those with form and those without.
Every creature, every soul—leave none out.

Cause them all to enter freedom.

...But here's the thing:

After saving all those beings?
*Not a single one was saved.*

Wait—what?

That's the paradox at the heart of the Bodhisattva path. You do everything, give everything, pour yourself out completely—but you can't claim it. Can't hold onto "I helped them." Can't believe you're somebody special.

Because if you think you're the savior, you missed the whole point.

There's no you. There's no them. No liberation as a thing.
Just the doing. Just the loving. Just the freedom that you bring.

## YouTube Music Video Description (Marcus "Echo" Thompson)

**Short Description:**
Save all beings—but know that not a single one was saved. That's the paradox of real service. 🙏🎵

**Full Description:**

The Buddha says: Save all beings. Every last one.
Born from eggs, born from wombs, born from moisture.
Those with form and those without.
Every creature, every soul—leave none out.

Cause them all to enter freedom.

But then comes the teaching that breaks your mind open:

*After saving all those beings—not a single one was saved.*

How can that be? Because if you think you're the savior—if you hold onto "I helped them"—you missed the whole point.

There's no fixed you. No solid them. No liberation as a thing to grab.
Just the doing. Just the loving. Just the freedom that you bring.

Do everything. Give everything. Pour yourself out completely.
But you can't claim nothing. Can't hold nothing. Can't believe you're somebody special.

That's the paradox. That's the path. That's the blues of the Bodhisattva.

## Facebook Post (Marcus "Echo" Thompson)

The Buddha gave the most impossible instruction:

"Save all beings. Every last one. Born from eggs, born from wombs. Those with form and those without. Every creature, every soul—leave none out."

Okay. I'm in. Let's do this.

But then he said something that stopped me cold:

*"After saving all those beings... not a single one was saved."*

Wait—what?

Here's the teaching that changed everything for me:

If you think you're the savior—if you hold onto "I helped them"—you missed the whole point. There's no fixed you. No solid them. No trophy for being the good guy.

Just the doing. Just the loving. Just the freedom you bring by showing up.

Do everything. Claim nothing.

That's the blues of the Bodhisattva. And it's the most liberating thing I ever learned.
