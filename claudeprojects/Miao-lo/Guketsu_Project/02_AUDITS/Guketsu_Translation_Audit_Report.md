## Summary Statistics
- **Total Files Analyzed**: 60- **Total Added Headers**: 2373- **Total Bracketed Interpolations**: 529 (Words added for English grammar/context)- **Total Inline Chinese Glosses**: 5530 (Original characters preserved for philological precision)
## Analysis of Additions
### 1. Structural Headers
The original text is a continuous flow (fascicles). divide the text into 'Sections' and 'Parts' (e.g., 'The Ten Intentions') are modern editorial choices to facilitate reading.
### 2. Bracketed Interpolations [...]
Classical Chinese is telegraphic. The translator has added subjects (e.g., '[students]'), verbs (e.g., '[set forth]'), and connective particles to make the English grammatically complete.
### 3. Inline Glosses (*pinyin* 漢字)
These are retained source texts interspersed with translation to allow for philological verification. They are strictly additions to the *English target text* but represent the *original source*.
