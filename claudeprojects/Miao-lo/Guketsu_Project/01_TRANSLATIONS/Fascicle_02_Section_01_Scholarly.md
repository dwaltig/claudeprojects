## Introduction: What Does the Name Mean?

The second of the Ten Chapters is **釋名** (*Shi Ming* — "Explanation of the Name"). Before any practice can begin, the practitioner must understand what "Zhiguan" means.

Miao-lo explains that Zhiyi analyzes the name through **four aspects** (四門 *si men*):

| # | Chinese | English | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **相待** (*Xiang Dai*) | **Relative** | Defining "Zhi" and "Guan" in relation to each other |
| 2 | **絕待** (*Jue Dai*) | **Absolute** | Transcending the duality of "Zhi" and "Guan" |
| 3 | **次與不次** (*Ci yu Bu Ci*) | **Sequential vs. Non-Sequential** | Whether the two are practiced in order |
| 4 | **通三德** (*Tong San De*) | **Communication with the Three Virtues** | How Zhi and Guan correspond to the Three Virtues |

---

## 1. Relative (*Xiang Dai*)

### Definition

**Zhi** (止 — "calming," "stopping") and **Guan** (觀 — "contemplation," "insight") are defined *in relation to each other*.

-   **Zhi** is defined as "not-Guan."
-   **Guan** is defined as "not-Zhi."

Like "long" and "short," each term gets its meaning by contrast with the other.

### The Three Kinds of Relative Zhi

| # | Name | Chinese | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Ceasing** | 止息 (*Zhi Xi*) | Ceasing the afflictions (like "extinguishing a fire") |
| 2 | **Stopping** | 停止 (*Ting Zhi*) | Stopping the mind on an object (like "halting a horse") |
| 3 | **Non-Stop Stopping** | 不止止 (*Bu Zhi Zhi*) | The principle (理 *li*) neither stops nor is stopped |

### The Three Kinds of Relative Guan

| # | Name | Chinese | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Penetrating** | 貫穿 (*Guan Chuan*) | Penetrating through the layers of delusion |
| 2 | **Observing** | 觀察 (*Guan Cha*) | Observing the nature of phenomena |
| 3 | **Non-Observe Observing** | 不觀觀 (*Bu Guan Guan*) | The principle neither observes nor is observed |

> Miao-lo: "The first two kinds are 'thought-about' (*ke si* 可思). The third is 'not thought-about' (*bu ke si* 不可思議)."

## 2. Absolute (*Jue Dai*)

### Definition

**絕待** (*Jue Dai*) means "cutting off relativity."

In the Relative mode, Zhi and Guan are two different things. In the Absolute mode, they are **not two**.

-   **Zhi** is empty. **Guan** is empty.
-   That which is "stopped" is empty. That which is "observed" is empty.
-   Even the "stopping" and "observing" are empty.

> "When you enter the Absolute, there is no longer any 'Zhi' to contrast with 'Guan,' no 'Guan' to contrast with 'Zhi.' The names disappear into the reality."

### The Relationship Between Relative and Absolute

This is structurally identical to the relationship between **Expedient** and **True** teachings in the *Fahua Xuanyi*:

-   The **Relative** is used to *enter* the teaching.
-   The **Absolute** is the destination.

One moves through the Relative to arrive at the Absolute—but the Absolute was always present.

## 3. Sequential vs. Non-Sequential (*Ci yu Bu Ci*)

### Definition

This aspect asks: Do you practice Zhi first and then Guan? Or are they simultaneous?

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Sequential** (*Ci*) | First calm, then insight. First cessation, then observation. (Belongs to the Gradual/Indeterminate teachings.) |
| **Non-Sequential** (*Bu Ci*) | Calming and insight at the same time. (Belongs to the Perfectly Sudden teaching.) |

Miao-lo clarifies:

> "In the Gradual teaching, Zhi and Guan are practiced sequentially. In the Perfect teaching, to 'calm' is already to 'observe.' To 'observe' is already to 'calm.' There is no before or after."

---

## 4. Communication with the Three Virtues (*Tong San De*)

### Definition

The **Three Virtues** (*San De*) are:

1.  **法身** (*Fa Shen*) — Dharma-body (Truth)
2.  **般若** (*Bo Re*) — Prajñā (Wisdom)
3.  **解脫** (*Jie Tuo*) — Liberation (Freedom)

How do Zhi and Guan correspond to these?

| Term | Correspondence |
|---|---|
| **Zhi** (Calming) | Corresponds to **Liberation** (cutting off afflictions) |
| **Guan** (Insight) | Corresponds to **Prajñā** (wisdom) |
| **Both Together** | Corresponds to **Dharma-body** (the non-dual reality) |

But Miao-lo warns: This correspondence is only pedagogically convenient. In the Perfectly Sudden teaching:

> "Zhi is Prajñā. Guan is Liberation. Both are Dharma-body. The Three Virtues are not three. Zhi and Guan are not two."

---

## Summary

The name "Zhiguan" is explained through four angles:

1.  **Relative**: Zhi and Guan are distinguished from each other.
2.  **Absolute**: Zhi and Guan are not two.
3.  **Sequential/Non-Sequential**: Depends on the teaching (Gradual vs. Perfect).
4.  **Three Virtues**: Zhi and Guan communicate with the complete Buddhahood.

This fourfold analysis ensures that the practitioner does not understand "Zhiguan" in a shallow, technique-oriented way. The name itself is already the teaching.
