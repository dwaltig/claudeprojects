## Source-Aligned Bilingual Block

[01][CN] 大章第二釋名者。  
[01][EN] The second major chapter is "Explaining the Name."

[02][CN] 夫立名不同。  
[02][EN] As for establishing names, they are not all the same.

[03][CN] 涅槃亦爾。無有因緣彊為立名。  
[03][EN] Nirvana is also like this: though it has no causal basis, a name is provisionally imposed.

[04][CN] 止觀亦爾彊名止觀。即此無因名為有因。  
[04][EN] Zhiguan is likewise: it is provisionally named "zhi-guan"; this "without cause" is named "with cause."

[05][CN] 為眾生故隨機立稱。  
[05][EN] For the sake of beings, designations are set according to capacities.

[06][CN] 又依於世名立出世名。  
[06][EN] Further, supramundane names are established based on worldly names.

[07][CN] 故知諸名法理而立。名既法理理亦因名。  
[07][EN] Hence we know names are established by dharmic principle; since names are dharmic principle, principle is also disclosed through names.

[08][CN] 故假妙名以詮妙理。  
[08][EN] Therefore wondrous names are provisionally employed to interpret wondrous principle.

[09][CN] 今解釋名。初結前生後亦是來意次第。  
[09][EN] In this explanation of names: first it concludes what precedes and gives rise to what follows; this is also the sequence of intent.

[10][CN] 復以何義名為止觀。故今文中開為四門。  
[10][EN] By what meaning is it called "zhi-guan"? Therefore this text opens it into four gates.

[11][CN] 是故四段。前三正明能詮之名後一旁立以所顯能。  
[11][EN] Hence there are four sections: the first three directly clarify names that can interpret; the last is additionally established by what is manifested.

[12][CN] 待詮次第絕詮不次。會異秖是絕待異名。  
[12][EN] "Relative" interprets sequence; "absolute" interprets non-sequence; "meeting differences" is simply another name for the absolute-relative.

[13][CN] 初相待者彼此互形曰相。以他望己為待。  
[13][EN] First, in relative correlation: "xiang" means mutual shaping of each side; "dai" means taking the other in relation to oneself.

[14][CN] 如長短大小互受其名。  
[14][EN] Like long and short, large and small, each receives its name through the other.

[15][CN] 判今法華唯具二妙。所謂待絕。  
[15][EN] In judging the Lotus now, it possesses only two "wondrous" modes: relative and absolute.

[16][CN] 所言待者唯有待麁成妙。更無待妙成麁。  
[16][EN] What is called "relative" means only using the coarse as relative to become wondrous; there is no using the wondrous as relative to become coarse.

[17][CN] 相待是麁。義當待麁論妙。絕待是妙。義當開麁論妙。  
[17][EN] Relative correlation is coarse, its meaning being to discuss the wondrous through the coarse; absolute correlation is wondrous, its meaning being to open the coarse and discuss the wondrous.

[18][CN] 故法華中唯論二妙。更無非待非絕之名。  
[18][EN] Therefore in the Lotus only these two wondrous modes are discussed; there is no third name outside relative and absolute.

[19][CN] 今此相待則判為麁。唯明絕觀無部可待則無竪待。無教可望名無橫待。  
[19][EN] Here, this "relative" is judged coarse; only absolute contemplation is clarified: with no section to compare, there is no vertical relativity; with no teaching to look toward, there is no horizontal relativity.

[20][CN] 故唯一絕以為能詮。  
[20][EN] Therefore only the absolute is taken as the active interpretive term.

[21][CN] 雖立相待以顯絕待。尚無於絕何待之有。  
[21][EN] Though relative is established to reveal the absolute, once in the absolute, what relativity could remain?

[22][CN] 為詮三德故假名絕。  
[22][EN] To interpret the three virtues, the name "absolute" is provisionally used.

[23][CN] 故唯絕待方稱為妙。  
[23][EN] Thus only the absolute-relative truly deserves the name "wondrous."

[24][CN] ○次釋絕待者。先總標文意。次破橫竪。次正明絕。  
[24][EN] Next, explaining the absolute-relative: first give the overall meaning, then refute horizontal and vertical constructions, then directly clarify the absolute.

[25][CN] 令知橫待不名為絕。令知竪待不名為絕。  
[25][EN] This makes clear that horizontal relativity is not called absolute, and vertical relativity is not called absolute.

[26][CN] 絕待無生不從相待四句立名。  
[26][EN] Absolute-relative is unborn; it is not named on the basis of the four propositions of relative correlation.

[27][CN] 四句立名下。斥成待義。互相因依待對而立。可思可說即可思議。  
[27][EN] Naming by those four propositions is reproved as relative construction: they arise through mutual dependence and opposition, and are thinkable and sayable, thus conceptually conditioned.

[28][CN] 今言下正釋絕待。先明所絕。所絕即上橫竪諸待。  
[28][EN] In now properly explaining the absolute: first clarify what is cut off; what is cut off is precisely the various horizontal and vertical relativities above.

[29][CN] 煩惱秖是四性計耳。由性計故有業有果。  
[29][EN] Afflictions are merely calculations based on four natures; because of such calculations, karma and result arise.

[30][CN] 既云絕待即待名絕故名為止。止亦自亡名不可得。  
[30][EN] Since it is called "absolute-relative," it is "absolute" with respect to relative naming and is thus called stopping; yet stopping itself also vanishes and is not obtainable as a fixed name.

[31][CN] 觀亦如是。觀亦自亡故云何得有觀。  
[31][EN] Contemplation is likewise: contemplation itself also vanishes, so how could there be contemplation as a graspable thing?

[32][CN] 止觀尚無等者斥於相待。絕待尚無豈立相待。  
[32][EN] If even stopping and contemplation are absent, this reproves relative correlation: when even the absolute is not established, how could relative be established?

[33][CN] 待即是絕。無待可論。故云止不至非止非不止皆不可得。  
[33][EN] Relative itself is the absolute; there is no relativity left to discuss. Therefore "stopping, non-stopping, neither stopping nor non-stopping" are all unobtainable.

[34][CN] 不可思等者。不可以前橫竪四句。思之能見。  
[34][EN] "Unthinkable" means one cannot see it by thinking through the former four horizontal/vertical propositions.

[35][CN] 非言說等明絕待不可說。  
[35][EN] "Beyond speech" means the absolute-relative is unsayable.

[36][CN] ○三會異者。會諸經論悉皆成絕止觀。  
[36][EN] Third, "meeting differences": reconciling the sutras and treatises so they all become expressions of absolute zhiguan.

[37][CN] 一切皆是三德異名。是故會之令入三德。  
[37][EN] All are variant names of the three virtues; therefore they are reconciled so as to enter the three virtues.

[38][CN] 初般若下是觀異名。即般若德。  
[38][EN] First, names such as prajna are variant names of contemplation, namely the virtue of prajna.

[39][CN] 解脫下即止異名。是解脫德。  
[39][EN] Next, names such as liberation are variant names of stopping, namely the virtue of liberation.

[40][CN] 如虛空下是止觀不二異名。即法身德。  
[40][EN] Names like empty space are variant names of nonduality of stopping and contemplation, namely the virtue of dharma-body.

[41][CN] 三德秖是一實相法。隨眾生類為立異名。  
[41][EN] The three virtues are only one dharma of true aspect; variant names are established according to classes of sentient beings.

[42][CN] ○四通三德中。初文先明用名之意。  
[42][EN] Fourth, in "penetrating the three virtues," the opening first clarifies why these names are used.

[43][CN] 菩薩初心常觀涅槃。自行初修也。亦令眾生常觀涅槃。化他初修也。  
[43][EN] At a bodhisattva's initial mind, one constantly contemplates nirvana: this is initial self-cultivation; one also leads beings to contemplate nirvana: this is initial cultivation for benefiting others.

[44][CN] 故知自他初心無不皆修。自他後心無不皆入。  
[44][EN] Thus we know that in the initial stage, self and other all cultivate; in later stages, self and other all enter.

[45][CN] 始終秖是觀於三德入於三德。  
[45][EN] From beginning to end, it is only contemplation of the three virtues and entry into the three virtues.

[46][CN] 若分兩字不能具德。故須二合義方具三。  
[46][EN] If the two words are split apart, they cannot fully contain the virtues; only by joining both in one meaning are all three complete.

[47][CN] 藏通止觀二法別異。尚不能通別異三德。若不思議一心止觀則能通於一心三德。  
[47][EN] In the Tripitaka and Shared teachings, stopping and contemplation are two separate dharmas and cannot penetrate the separately conceived three virtues; but inconceivable one-mind zhiguan can penetrate one-mind three virtues.
