### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "subtle enough to wear holy clothes" `{RHYTHM: vernacular rendering of disguised-virtue warning}`
- "Not less important. More difficult to detect." `{LEXICON: preserves ordering rationale}`
- "test whether maturity is genuine" `{DOCTRINE: keeps advanced-stage diagnostic pressure}`
- "more effort is not always the cure" `{DOCTRINE: preserves release-over-accumulation emphasis}`
- "compassion that does not retire" `{RHYTHM: counters two-vehicle drift}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Expository overview with long scaffolding | Tight doctrinal framing with operational tone |
| Table-forward sequencing | Oral cadence preserving progression logic |
| Diffuse close | High-pressure closing directive for advanced practice |
| Broad summary voice | Fidelity-locked diagnostic voice |

### 4. Notes
- Strong bridge into Sections 1-2 without conceptual overreach.
- Maintains explicit sequencing of objects 7-10.
