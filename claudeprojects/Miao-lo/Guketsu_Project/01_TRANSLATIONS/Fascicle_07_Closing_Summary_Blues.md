## What We Covered: Modes 5-10

### The Setup

Fascicle 7 completed the **Ten Modes of Contemplation** (十乘觀法).

Fascicles 5-6 gave you Modes 1-4 — the **core methods**.

This fascicle gave you Modes 5-10 — the **diagnostic and finishing tools**.

---

## The Six Modes in Summary

### Mode 5: Openness and Obstruction (通塞)

**The tool**: The diagnostic.

**The question**: Is the path clear or blocked?

**The method**: Four-sentence examination. Check for obstruction within openness. Check for openness within obstruction.

**Key insight**: Even the right method can become an obstacle if you cling to it.

**Blues translation**: **Open Road or Roadblock**.

---

### Mode 6: Adjustment of Path Factors (道品調適)

**The tool**: The tuner.

**The question**: Which of the 37 factors do I need right now?

**The method**: Work from the roots (四念處) up through the trunk (四正勤) to the fruit (八正道).

**Key insight**: You don't use all 37 at once. You use what fits.

**Blues translation**: **Tuning the Amp**.

---

### Mode 7: Counteractive Aids (對治助開)

**The tool**: The medicine cabinet.

**The question**: What specific poison is blocking me?

**The method**: Six poisons, six medicines. Direct treatment, turn, combination, ultimate.

**Key insight**: When general practice fails, use targeted treatment.

**Blues translation**: **Medicine for the Buzz**.

---

### Mode 8: Knowing the Stages (知次位)

**The tool**: The map.

**The question**: Where am I on the journey?

**The method**: Four Foundations of Mindfulness. Understand the stages of each teaching. Don't overestimate or underestimate.

**Key insight**: Claiming attainment you don't have is a grave offense. Dismissing real progress is also a mistake.

**Blues translation**: **Reading the Map**.

---

### Mode 9: Patient Endurance (安忍)

**The tool**: The anchor.

**The question**: Can I hold steady when it gets hard?

**The method**: Settled patience. Don't fight, don't flee. Endure.

**Key insight**: Inner and outer obstacles will arise. The practice is to not wobble.

**Blues translation**: **Playing Through**.

---

### Mode 10: Freedom from Dharma-Attachment (無法愛)

**The tool**: The release.

**The question**: Am I attached to the practice itself?

**The method**: Use the teachings to get free. Then let go of the teachings.

**Key insight**: The raft is for crossing. Don't carry it on land.

**Blues translation**: **Dropping the Raft**.

## Major Teachings in This Fascicle

### The 500 Yojanas (五百由旬)

The *Lotus Sutra*'s metaphor for the complete journey. Miao-lo critiques six masters' interpretations and shows how to read it through Tiantai eyes — horizontally, vertically, and in **one mind**.

### The Four Kinds of Openness/Obstruction

1. **Horizontal** (橫) — All at once
2. **Vertical** (竪) — Step by step
3. **Horizontal-Distinct** (橫別) — Different gates for different people
4. **One-Mind** (一心) — All of it in a single moment

**The Tiantai way is One-Mind**.

### The Three Gates of Liberation

1. **Emptiness** (空門) — No inherent self
2. **Signlessness** (無相門) — No fixed characteristics
3. **Wishlessness** (無作門) — No craving for results

**In the Perfect Teaching, these are one gate with three names**.

### The Six Poisons and Medicines

| Poison | Medicine |
|--------|----------|
| Stinginess | Generosity |
| Immorality | Morality |
| Anger | Patience |
| Laziness | Effort |
| Distraction | Concentration |
| Ignorance | Wisdom |

### The Four Followings (四隨)

1. **Direct treatment** — Try the obvious medicine
2. **Turn** — If that fails, try another
3. **Combination** — Use two or three together
4. **Ultimate** — Go straight to observing the mind

### The Five Repentances (五悔)

1. **Confession** (懺悔) — Acknowledge wrongdoing
2. **Entreaty** (勸請) — Request the teaching to continue
3. **Rejoicing** (隨喜) — Take joy in others' good
4. **Transfer** (迴向) — Give away your merit
5. **Vow** (發願) — Set your direction

### The Three Animals

- **Small deer** (麞) → Śrāvaka — Escapes alone
- **Larger deer** (鹿) → Pratyekabuddha — Escapes with backward glance
- **Elephant** (大象) → Bodhisattva — Leads everyone out

## The Luthier's Final Summary

### What You Got

A complete **troubleshooting manual** for the practice.

Not just "do this." But: "If that didn't work, check this. If this is blocked, try that. Know where you are. Stay steady. Let go."

### What You Do

1. **Start with Modes 1-4**: See the whole. Set your heart. Find the stop. Break through.

2. **If stuck, use Mode 5**: Check for roadblocks. Run the diagnostic.

3. **If blocked, use Modes 6-7**: Tune the practice. Apply the right medicine.

4. **Always use Mode 8**: Know where you are. Don't lie to yourself.

5. **When it's hard, use Mode 9**: Endure. Play through. Don't wobble.

6. **At the end, use Mode 10**: Let go of the practice itself. The raft is for crossing, not carrying.
