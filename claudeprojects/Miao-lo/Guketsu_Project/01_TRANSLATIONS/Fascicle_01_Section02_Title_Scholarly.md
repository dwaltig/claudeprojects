已述新舊有無次第。
> We have already set forth the old and new sequence of presence and absence.
所以改稱摩訶名者有二義故。
> The reason for changing the title to "Mohe" has two meanings.
一者為對俗兄出小止觀。
> First, it was to correspond to the Small Zhiguan composed for the lay elder brother.
二者為存梵音兼含之富。
> Second, it was to preserve the Sanskrit sound's richness of combined meanings.
故大論云。
> Therefore, the Great Treatise says:
言摩訶者名含三義。
> "The term mohe contains three meanings."
謂大多勝。
> Namely: great, many, and superior.
依疏四教釋比丘位則非今意。
> To interpret bhiksu ranks by the Four Teachings according to the commentary is not the present intent.
用此三名釋圓三觀正當題旨。
> Using these three names to explain the Perfect Teaching's three contemplations exactly fits the title's purport.
大是空義多是假義勝是中義。
> Great is emptiness-meaning, many is provisional-meaning, superior is middle-meaning.
是故改從兼含之名。
> Therefore, it was changed to a name with combined inclusion.
以題一心三觀之部。
> This serves as the title for this treatise on one-mind three contemplations.
若爾。
> If so,
何異圓頓改從摩訶。
> how is this different from changing "perfect-sudden" to "mohe"?
答。
> Answer:
圓頓之名雖異偏漸。
> Although the name "perfect-sudden" differs from partial and gradual,
其言通總闕於含三。
> its wording is broad and general but lacks inclusion of the three.
故改此土單淺之音以存彼語多含之稱。
> Therefore we change this land's single and shallow sound to preserve that language's title rich in multiple inclusions.
以是應知止觀二字無非摩訶。
> From this one should know that the two characters zhi and guan are nothing other than mohe.
即是一心三止三觀之止觀也。
> They are precisely the zhi-guan of one-mind three zhis and three guans.
故知總攬一部以為首題。
> Therefore we know the whole treatise is comprehensively gathered as the heading-title.
始自大意終於旨歸無非摩訶之止觀也。
> From Great Meaning at the beginning to Ultimate Return at the end, all is mohe zhi-guan.
是則題名是總十章為別。
> Thus the title is the general, and the ten chapters are the particular.
於十章中則大意為總餘八是別。
> Within the ten chapters, Great Meaning is general, and the remaining eight are particular.
故知總別自行因果化他能所咸是摩訶妙定慧也。
> Therefore know that general/particular, self-practice cause/effect, and transforming-others agent/object are all mohe's wondrous samadhi and wisdom.
何者於總釋中發心修行自行因也。
> Why? In the general exposition, arousing mind and cultivation are self-practice cause.
次感大果自行果也。
> Next, realizing the great fruit is self-practice fruit.
次裂大綱化他能也。
> Next, opening the great outline is the ability for transforming others.
既有能化必有所被。
> Since there is ability to transform, there must be those transformed.
文略舉能以攝於所。
> The text briefly raises the agent in order to include the object.
能所事畢同入旨歸。
> When agent/object are complete, both enter the Ultimate Return.
於別釋中始從釋名終至正觀自行因也。
> In the particular exposition, from Explaining the Name through Proper Contemplation is self-practice cause.
次果報章自行果也。
> Next, the Fruits-and-Rewards chapter is self-practice fruit.
起教一章化他能也。
> The Arising-Teaching chapter is the ability in transforming others.
所被義當化他所也。
> In meaning, those transformed correspond to the object in transforming others.
後三大章其文闕略義意同前總中後三。
> The latter three major chapters are textually abbreviated, but their meaning matches the latter three in the previous general section.
是故後文略而不說。
> Therefore the later text is brief and not explained.
初序分為二。
> The initial preface section is divided into two.
於通序中雖類集經通中五事既是私記。
> In the common preface, although it resembles the five items in collected-sutra common prefaces, this is a private record.
故闕同聞。
> Therefore, co-hearers are omitted.
於中為六。
> Within it there are six items.
初之四字述所聞體。

始終十章正觀十法莫非止觀體咸明靜。
> From beginning to end, in ten chapters and ten dharmas of proper contemplation, all are zhi-guan whose substance is entirely luminous and still.
則通指一部以為所聞。
> Thus it generally points to the whole treatise as what was heard.
如法華經本門迹門無非妙法體咸真實。
> As in the Lotus Sutra's origin-gate and trace-gate, all are wondrous Dharma whose substance is entirely true-real.
前代未聞者明能聞人。
> "Not heard in previous generations" clarifies the person able to hear.
反以他往顯成我聞述己兼他語現及往。
> By contrast with others in the past, it reveals "my hearing," speaking of oneself while including others, in language of present and past.
故云前代。
> Therefore it says "previous generations."
今章安聞已遠霑餘世後代可聞。
> Now that Zhang'an heard it, this has far-moistened later ages, so later generations can hear.
所言代者雖義立三十年今取代更為異世義。
> As for "generation," although one meaning sets it at thirty years, here it is taken as the meaning of a different age.
異世弘法世世有之故云代也。
> Since Dharma is propagated in different ages, age after age, it is called "generation."
自漢明夜夢洎乎陳朝。
> From Emperor Ming of Han's night-dream down to the Chen dynasty,
凡諸著述當代盛行者溢目。
> writings flourishing in their own times filled the eyes.
預廁禪門衣鉢傳授者盈耳。

豈有不聞止觀二字。

故南山歎云。
> Therefore Nanshan praised, saying:
唯衡岳台崖雙弘禪慧。
> Only Hengyue and Tiantai together propagated meditation and wisdom.
豈南山諂附而虛授哉。

大隋等者說教時也。

諸經既多乃通云一時。
