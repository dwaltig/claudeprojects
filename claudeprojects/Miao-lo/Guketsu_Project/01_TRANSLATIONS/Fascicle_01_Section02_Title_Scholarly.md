## Translation

### The Reason for Changing the Title to "Mohe" (摩訶)

Having explained the old and new [versions'] presence or absence of sequential ordering, [I now turn to] the reason for changing the title to the name "Mohe" (*Mahā*). There are two meanings:

**First**, to distinguish it from the *Small Zhiguan* (*Xiao Zhiguan* 小止觀) written for [the Master's] lay elder brother.

**Second**, to preserve the Sanskrit sound's richness of multiple meanings (*jianhan zhifu* 兼含之富).

Therefore, the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* (*Dazhidu Lun* 大智度論) states: "The word *mahā* (摩訶) contains three meanings: Great (*da* 大), Many (*duo* 多), and Superior (*sheng* 勝)."

If one were to use the explication of *bhikṣu* (比丘) positions according to the Four Teachings found in the commentary, that would not accord with the present intention. [Instead], using these three names to explicate the Perfect Teaching's Three Contemplations (*yuanjiao sanguan* 圓教三觀) precisely matches the purport of the title:

- **Great** (*da* 大) is the meaning of **Emptiness** (*kong* 空)
- **Many** (*duo* 多) is the meaning of **Provisional** (*jia* 假)
- **Superior** (*sheng* 勝) is the meaning of **Middle** (*zhong* 中)

Therefore, [the title] was changed to follow the [Sanskrit] name with multiple meanings, in order to serve as the title for this treatise on the **Three Contemplations in One Mind** (*yixin sanguan* 一心三觀).

**[Objection]**: If this is so, how does [using] "Yuandun" (Perfect-Sudden, 圓頓) differ from changing to "Mohe"?

**[Answer]**: Although the name "Yuandun" differs from partial and gradual [teachings], its language is general and comprehensive, yet it **lacks** (*que* 闕) the [explicit] inclusion of the three [truths]. Therefore, [we] change this land's simple and shallow sound (*ci tu dan qian zhi yin* 此土單淺之音) in order to preserve that [Sanskrit] language's designation rich in multiple meanings (*bi yu duo han zhi cheng* 彼語多含之稱).

### The Two Characters "Zhiguan" (止觀) Are Nothing Other Than *Mahā*

By this reasoning, one should know: the two characters "Zhiguan" (Concentration-Insight, 止觀) are nothing other than *mahā* (無非摩訶). [This text] is precisely the *Zhiguan* of **One Mind, Three Concentrations, Three Contemplations** (*yixin san zhi san guan* 一心三止三觀).

Therefore, one should know: the entire treatise is comprehensively grasped (*zong lan* 總攬) to form the primary title. From the **Great Meaning** (*dayi* 大意) at the beginning through the **Ultimate Return** (*zhigui* 旨歸) at the end—all is the *Zhiguan* of *mahā*.

### The Structure: General and Particular (總別)

This being so, the title-name is the **general** (*zong* 總); the Ten Chapters are the **particular** (*bie* 別).

Within the Ten Chapters, the **Great Meaning** chapter is general; the remaining eight are particular.

Therefore, one should know: the **general and particular** (*zongbie* 總別), **self-practice** and **teaching others** (*zixing huata* 自行化他), **cause and effect**, **ability and object** (*neng suo* 能所)—all are *mahā*'s wondrous concentration and wisdom (*miao ding hui* 妙定慧).

### Elaboration of the Structure

**How so?**

**In the General Exposition** (*zong shi zhong* 總釋中):

1. **Arousing the mind and practicing** (*fa xin xiu xing* 發心修行) = self-practice **cause** (*zixing yin* 自行因)
2. **Next, experiencing the great fruit** (*ci gan da guo* 次感大果) = self-practice **effect** (*zixing guo* 自行果)
3. **Next, spreading wide the great outline** (*ci lie da gang* 次裂大綱) = **ability** in teaching others (*huata neng* 化他能)

Since there exists the ability to teach, there must exist those who are taught. The text briefly raises the ability in order to include the object [of teaching] within it. When the matters of ability and object are completed, both alike enter the **Ultimate Return**.

**In the Particular Exposition** (*bie shi zhong* 別釋中):

1. From **Explaining the Names** (*shi ming* 釋名) through **Proper Contemplation** (*zheng guan* 正觀) = self-practice **cause**
2. The **Fruits and Rewards** chapter (*guo bao zhang* 果報章) = self-practice **effect**
3. The **Arising of Teachings** chapter (*qi jiao yi zhang* 起教一章) = **ability** in teaching others

The meaning of "those who are taught" corresponds to the **object** in teaching others.

The latter three major chapters—though their text is omitted and abbreviated (*que lüe* 闕略)—their meaning and purport are the same as the latter three [sections] in the General [Exposition]. Therefore, the later text is abbreviated and not explained.

---

### The Preface Division (序分)

The initial [section] divides the Preface into two parts.

In the **Common Preface** (*tong xu* 通序), although [the structure] resembles the five items in the common [preface] of collected sūtras, since this is a private record, [the section on] "those who heard together" (*tongwen* 同聞) is omitted.

Within [the Common Preface] are six [elements]. The initial four characters describe the **substance of what was heard** (*shu suo wen ti* 述所聞體).

The two characters "Zhiguan" (止觀) properly indicate the substance of what was heard.

The two characters "Mingjing" (明靜, "luminous stillness") praise the virtue of the substance. That is to say: **the substance of *zhǐ* (concentration) is stillness** (*zhi ti jing* 止體靜); **the substance of *guān* (insight) is luminosity** (*guan ti ming* 觀體明).

From beginning to end, the ten chapters' proper contemplation of the ten dharmas—all are nothing other than Concentration-Insight whose substance is entirely luminous and still.

This comprehensively indicates the entire treatise as what was heard, just as in the *Lotus Sūtra*, both the **Trace Gate** (*jimen* 迹門) and the **Origin Gate** (*benmen* 本門) are nothing other than the Wondrous Dharma (*miao fa* 妙法), whose substance is entirely true and real (*xian zhen shi* 咸真實).

## Doctrinal Analysis

### 1. The Semantic Argument for Sanskrit Over Chinese

Miao-lo's defense of preserving the Sanskrit *mahā* (摩訶) instead of translating it to Chinese "da" (大, "great") is **not mere linguistic conservatism**—it is a **doctrinal necessity** grounded in the Tiantai principle that **names are dharma-gates** (*ming wei famen* 名為法門).

#### The Problem with "Yuandun" (圓頓)

"Yuandun" (Perfect-Sudden) accurately designates the *Mohe Zhiguan*'s doctrinal position within Tiantai's taxonomic system:
- **圓** (*yuan*, "perfect"): The teaching of mutual interpenetration of all dharmas
- **頓** (*dun*, "sudden"): Non-gradual, immediate realization

**However**, as Miao-lo notes, "其言通總闕於含三" (its language is general and comprehensive, yet it **lacks** the explicit inclusion of the three [truths]).

"Yuandun" tells us **what kind** of teaching this is (perfect, sudden) but does not **name the structure** of the contemplation itself. It is a **classificatory term**, not a **descriptive term**.

#### The Richness of *Mahā*: 大多勝 = 空假中

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* (T25n1509) states that *mahā* contains **three meanings**:
- **大** (*da*, "great")
- **多** (*duo*, "many")
- **勝** (*sheng*, "superior/victorious")

This is not mere synonym-stacking. Each meaning maps to one of the **Three Truths** (*san di* 三諦):

| Sanskrit | Chinese | Truth (諦) | Contemplation (觀) |
|:---------|:--------|:-----------|:-------------------|
| **Mahā** (greatness) | 大 *da* | **Emptiness** 空 *kong* | Emptiness contemplation |
| **Mahā** (multiplicity) | 多 *duo* | **Provisional** 假 *jia* | Provisional contemplation |
| **Mahā** (superiority) | 勝 *sheng* | **Middle** 中 *zhong* | Middle contemplation |

**Why this mapping?**

1. **大 = 空**: "Great" signifies the **vastness beyond measure** that characterizes emptiness (*śūnyatā*). Emptiness is not "small" (a particular negation) but "great" (the universal negation of svabhāva, inherent existence). The *Prajñāpāramitā-hṛdaya-sūtra* states: "Form is emptiness" (色即是空)—the totality (*da*) of form's nature is empty.

2. **多 = 假**: "Many" signifies the **inexhaustible multiplicity** of provisional designations (*prajñapti*). The conventional truth (*saṃvṛti-satya*) is the realm of differentiation: the ten dharma-realms, the three thousand realms in a single thought-moment. "Many" is not chaos but the **plenitude of phenomenal manifestation**.

3. **勝 = 中**: "Superior" signifies the **transcendent synthesis** of the Middle Way (*madhyamā pratipad*), which neither negates emptiness nor provisional existence but **includes both** (*shuang zhao* 雙照) while transcending both (*shuang qian* 雙遣). The Middle is "superior" because it is the **ultimate truth** (*paramārtha-satya*) that subsumes and completes the dialectic.

#### "此土單淺之音" vs. "彼語多含之稱"

Miao-lo's critique of Chinese terminology is devastating: "此土單淺之音" (this land's simple and shallow sound).

**單** (*dan*, "single/simple"): Chinese "da" (great) conveys only **one meaning**. It lacks the polysemy inherent in *mahā*.

**淺** (*qian*, "shallow"): Without the structural tri-partite meaning, Chinese loses the **depth** of Tiantai's contemplative architecture.

By contrast, Sanskrit *mahā* is "彼語多含之稱" (that language's designation rich in multiple meanings). The single word *mahā* **already contains** the Three Truths, making the title itself a **contemplative instruction**.

### 2. The Title as Dharma-Gate: "止觀二字無非摩訶"

Miao-lo's assertion that "the two characters *zhiguan* are nothing other than *mahā*" is radical. It means:

**Every instance of "concentration" (*zhǐ*) in this text is *mahā*-concentration**:
- Concentration on **emptiness** (空止)
- Concentration on **provisional existence** (假止)
- Concentration on the **Middle** (中止)

**Every instance of "insight" (*guān*) in this text is *mahā*-insight**:
- Insight into **emptiness** (空觀)
- Insight into **provisional existence** (假觀)
- Insight into the **Middle** (中觀)

This is why the text is titled **一心三止三觀** (One Mind, Three Concentrations, Three Contemplations). The "one mind" (*yixin*) is *mahā*—the unified field in which the three truths are simultaneously realized.

### 3. The Structural Logic: 總別 (General-Particular)

Miao-lo's analysis of the text's architecture reveals a **fractal structure**: the whole is mirrored in each part.

#### **Level 1: Title (總) vs. Ten Chapters (別)**

- **Title** "摩訶止觀" = **General** principle (all is *mahā*-concentration-insight)
- **Ten Chapters** = **Particular** unfolding of that principle

#### **Level 2: Within the Ten Chapters**

- **大意** (Great Meaning) = General (overview of the entire practice)
- **Remaining 8 chapters** = Particular (detailed instructions)

#### **Level 3: Within Each Major Division**

Both the **General Exposition** (大意 chapter) and **Particular Exposition** (remaining chapters) contain the **same threefold structure**:

| Category | General Exposition | Particular Exposition |
|:---------|:-------------------|:----------------------|
| **Self-practice cause** | Arousing mind, practicing | Chapters 2-8 (Explaining Names → Proper Contemplation) |
| **Self-practice effect** | Experiencing great fruit | Chapter 9 (Fruits and Rewards) |
| **Teaching others (ability)** | Spreading the great outline | Chapter 10 (Arising of Teachings) |
| **Teaching others (object)** | [Implicit] | [Implicit] |
| **Ultimate Return** | Final section of Great Meaning | [Omitted—refer to Great Meaning] |

**Why this fractal repetition?**

Because **the part contains the whole** (*hu ju* 互具). This is Tiantai's signature doctrine of **mutual inclusion** (*yuanrong* 圓融): each dharma-realm contains all ten dharma-realms; each thought-moment contains the three thousand realms.

The *Mohe Zhiguan*'s **structure enacts its content**. The text itself is a demonstration of *mahā*-principle: the title contains the chapters, the Great Meaning contains the text, each contemplation contains all three truths.

### 4. Self-Practice vs. Teaching Others: The Bodhisattva Path

The division into **自行** (*zixing*, self-practice) and **化他** (*huata*, teaching others) reflects the Mahāyāna distinction between:

1. **Prajñā** (wisdom) = self-perfection
2. **Karuṇā** (compassion) = benefiting others

**Self-practice cause** (*zixing yin*): The practitioner arouses bodhicitta, engages in the ten contemplations, purifies the mind. This is the **upward aspiration** (*shang qiu* 上求) for bodhi (enlightenment).

**Self-practice effect** (*zixing guo*): The fruits and rewards—supernatural powers, merits, rebirths in pure lands. This is the **verification** (*zheng* 證) that the path works.

**Teaching others** (*huata*): The practitioner "spreads wide the great outline" (裂大綱), establishing teachings for others. This is the **downward transformation** (*xia hua* 下化) of sentient beings.

**Ability and object** (*neng suo* 能所): The practitioner (能 *neng*, "ability") teaches sentient beings (所 *suo*, "object"). Miao-lo notes that the text "briefly raises the ability in order to include the object within it"—because the **method** of teaching reveals the **target** of teaching. One cannot teach formless beings; teaching presupposes the conventional truth (假諦) of distinct beings.

**Ultimate Return** (*zhigui* 旨歸): Both self-practice and teaching others culminate in **returning to stillness** (*gui ji* 歸寂)—the realization that nirvāṇa and saṃsāra are non-dual. This is the final section of the text, where practice "rests" (歸) in its ultimate ground.

### 5. Why the Latter Three Chapters Are "Omitted and Abbreviated"

Miao-lo notes: "後三大章其文闕略義意同前總中後三" (the latter three major chapters—though their text is omitted and abbreviated—their meaning and purport are the same as the latter three [sections] in the General [Exposition]).

This refers to the **incomplete transmission** of the *Mohe Zhiguan*. As documented in the "Opening" section, Guanding states that Zhiyi's lectures reached only the **seventh object** (見境) before the summer retreat ended. The remaining **three objects** and **three major chapters** were never expounded.

However, Miao-lo insists: "義意同前" (their meaning and purport are the same as the earlier [sections]). This is **not** a deficiency but a **pedagogical economy**. Why?

Because the **Great Meaning** (大意) chapter **already contains the complete teaching**. It is the "general" (*zong*) that makes the "particular" (*bie*) redundant. A practitioner who thoroughly understands the Great Meaning can **extrapolate** the remaining sections by applying the same **fractal principle**.

This also reflects the Tiantai hermeneutic of **一卽一切** (*yī jí yīqiè*, "one is all"): one chapter, fully comprehended, unlocks all chapters.

## Key Annotations

### **摩訶** (*mohe*, Sanskrit *mahā*)

**Philology**: Transcription of Sanskrit *mahā* (महा), meaning "great." In Buddhist Sanskrit, *mahā* functions as a prefix (e.g., *mahāyāna* "great vehicle," *mahāsattva* "great being").

**Doctrinal usage**: In Tiantai, *mahā* is **not** translated as 大 (*da*) because the Sanskrit term contains **three meanings** (大多勝) that map to the Three Truths (空假中). This makes *mahā* a **technical term** that preserves doctrinal precision.

**Canonical source**: *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* (大智度論 T25n1509), attributed to Nāgārjuna, translated by Kumārajīva. The passage Miao-lo cites explains that *mahā* (when applied to *prajñāpāramitā*) signifies:
- **Great** in extent (空諦)
- **Many** in number (假諦)
- **Superior** to all (中諦)

### **一心三觀** (*yixin sanguan*, "One Mind, Three Contemplations")

**Structure**:
- **一心** (*yixin*): A single thought-moment (*yinian* 一念)
- **三觀** (*sanguan*): Three contemplations (*guan*)

**The Three Contemplations**:
1. **空觀** (*kongguan*): Contemplation of emptiness—all dharmas lack inherent existence (*svabhāva*)
2. **假觀** (*jiaguan*): Contemplation of provisional existence—all dharmas arise through dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*)
3. **中觀** (*zhongguan*): Contemplation of the Middle Way—all dharmas are neither existent nor non-existent

**"One Mind"**: Unlike the **sequential Three Contemplations** (次第三觀) of the Distinct Teaching (別教), where one contemplates emptiness, *then* provisional existence, *then* the Middle, the Perfect Teaching's **One Mind, Three Contemplations** contemplates all three **simultaneously** (一心具三觀).

**Canonical basis**: *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-sūtra*, *Madhyamaka-kārikā* (via Kumārajīva's translation as 中論).

### **總別** (*zongbie*, "General and Particular")

**Hermeneutical principle**: A text contains both:
- **總** (*zong*): General/comprehensive principles
- **別** (*bie*): Particular/detailed applications

**In exegesis**: The *zong* section provides the **overview** (概括); the *bie* section provides the **elaboration** (詳解). The two are **mutually inclusive**: the general contains the particular (總攝別), and the particular reveals the general (別顯總).

**Application to *Mohe Zhiguan***:
- Title (*mahā-zhiguan*) = *zong*
- Ten Chapters = *bie*
- Within chapters: Great Meaning = *zong*, other chapters = *bie*

This creates a **recursive structure** where every level contains the distinction between *zong* and *bie*.

### **自行化他** (*zixing huata*, "Self-Practice and Teaching Others")

**Etymology**:
- **自行** (*zixing*): Self (自) + practice/conduct (行)
- **化他** (*huata*): Transform (化) + others (他)

**Doctrinal context**: The Bodhisattva path requires **both**:
1. **Self-perfection** (自利): Wisdom (*prajñā*), meditation (*dhyāna*), precepts (*śīla*)
2. **Benefiting others** (利他): Compassion (*karuṇā*), skillful means (*upāya*), teaching (*deśanā*)

**Tiantai innovation**: Unlike Hīnayāna, which prioritizes self-liberation, and unlike some Mahāyāna schools that emphasize compassion to the exclusion of wisdom, Tiantai maintains that **self-practice and teaching others are non-dual** (自行化他不二).

The *Mohe Zhiguan* integrates both: the practitioner perfects meditation (self-practice) in order to teach effectively (teaching others), and teaching others deepens one's own practice.

### **能所** (*neng suo*, "Ability and Object")

**Grammatical origin**: In Classical Chinese grammar:
- **能** (*neng*): Subject, agent (that which acts)
- **所** (*suo*): Object, patient (that which is acted upon)

**Philosophical usage**: In Buddhist epistemology, *neng suo* designates the **subject-object duality**:
- **能緣** (*nengyuan*): The knowing mind (subject)
- **所緣** (*suoyuan*): The known object

**In Tiantai**: The distinction is **provisionally maintained** for pedagogical purposes but **ultimately dissolved**. In the Perfect Teaching, subject and object are **mutually inclusive** (能所不二).

**Application here**:
- **化他能** (*huata neng*): The *ability* to teach others (the teacher, the method)
- **化他所** (*huata suo*): The *object* of teaching others (the students, the beings)

Miao-lo notes that the text "briefly raises the ability in order to include the object"—because once you establish the *method* of teaching, the *target* is implicit.

### **止體靜,觀體明** (*zhi ti jing, guan ti ming*)

**Translation**: "The substance of concentration is stillness; the substance of insight is luminosity."

**Analysis**:
- **止** (*zhǐ*, *śamatha*): Concentration, calming, cessation
- **體** (*ti*): Substance, essence, nature (*svabhāva*)
- **靜** (*jing*): Stillness, tranquility (*śānti*)

- **觀** (*guān*, *vipaśyanā*): Insight, contemplation, discernment
- **明** (*ming*): Luminosity, clarity, illumination (*prakāśa*)

**Doctrinal significance**: This is a **definition by essential characteristic**. Concentration's defining feature is **stillness** (the cessation of discursive thought); insight's defining feature is **luminosity** (the clear apprehension of reality).

**Non-duality**: Although *zhǐ* and *guān* are distinguished (stillness vs. luminosity), they are **inseparable** in practice. True stillness is luminous (止而明); true insight is still (觀而靜). This is the **unity of concentration-insight** (定慧不二).

**Connection to title**: The opening phrase "止觀明靜" (Concentration-Insight is luminous in its stillness) **reverses** the usual order (靜明) to emphasize that **luminosity** (*ming*) and **stillness** (*jing*) are **simultaneous**, not sequential.

---

## Philological Notes

### 1. The Argument Structure: 問答體 (Question-Answer Format)

**Pattern**: "若爾。何異..." (If this is so, how does X differ from Y?)

This is a **dialectical objection** (*nan* 難), a standard move in Buddhist commentary. Miao-lo anticipates the reader's confusion: "If *mahā* and *yuandun* both designate the Perfect Teaching, why prefer one over the other?"

The **answer** (答) clarifies the **nuance**: *yuandun* is **doctrinally correct** but **structurally incomplete**; *mahā* is both doctrinally correct **and** structurally explicit.

### 2. Negation: "無非摩訶" (Nothing Other Than *Mahā*)

**Grammar**: 無 (*wu*, "not") + 非 (*fei*, "not/non-") = **double negative** = emphatic affirmative.

**Literal**: "There is nothing that is not *mahā*."

**Meaning**: "Everything [in this text] is *mahā*."

This is a **totalizing claim**: not just the title, not just the main practices, but **every word** in the *Mohe Zhiguan* is an expression of *mahā*-principle.

### 3. "闕於含三" (Lacks the Inclusion of the Three)

**Grammar**:
- **闕** (*que*): Lack, omit, be deficient in
- **於** (*yu*): Preposition ("in," "at," "regarding")
- **含** (*han*): Include, contain, embrace
- **三** (*san*): Three (i.e., the Three Truths)

**Translation**: "[The term *yuandun*] is deficient regarding the inclusion of the three [truths]."

**Doctrinal point**: This is a **critique by omission**. "Yuandun" is not *wrong*, but it is **incomplete**. It tells you the teaching is perfect and sudden, but it doesn't **name the structure** (空假中) of that perfection.

### 4. "此土單淺之音" vs. "彼語多含之稱"

**Rhetorical structure**: **Antithesis** (對偶 *dui'ou*), a Classical Chinese device that uses parallel syntax to create contrast.

| Component | 此土單淺之音 | 彼語多含之稱 |
|:----------|:------------|:------------|
| **Demonstrative** | 此 (this) | 彼 (that) |
| **Noun** | 土 (land/region) | 語 (language) |
| **Adjective** | 單淺 (simple-shallow) | 多含 (many-containing) |
| **Particle** | 之 (possessive) | 之 (possessive) |
| **Noun** | 音 (sound) | 稱 (designation/name) |

**Effect**: The parallelism emphasizes the **contrast** between Chinese (此土) and Sanskrit (彼語), while the **value-laden adjectives** (單淺 vs. 多含) make clear Miao-lo's preference.

### 5. "總攬一部以為首題" (Comprehensively Grasp the Entire Treatise to Form the Primary Title)

**Grammar**:
- **總攬** (*zonglan*): Comprehensive grasp/summary
- **一部** (*yi bu*): One treatise/text
- **以為** (*yi wei*): "in order to," "to serve as"
- **首題** (*shouti*): Primary title/heading

**Analysis**: The verb 總攬 (*zonglan*) is significant. It means not merely "to summarize" but to **gather together** (攬) in a **comprehensive** (總) way.

**Implication**: The title is not an **arbitrary label** but a **concentrated essence** of the entire text. To understand the title is to understand the whole; to misunderstand the title is to miss the whole.

This reflects the Tiantai hermeneutic that **the name is the dharma-gate** (名為法門). Titles are not incidental; they are **pedagogical entry-points** that encode the teaching's structure.

---

## Translator's Reflections

### The Title as Contemplative Instruction

What strikes me most forcefully in this passage is Miao-lo's insistence that **the title itself is a meditation manual**.

For a modern reader, "Mohe Zhiguan" is simply "The Great Treatise on Concentration and Insight"—a descriptive label. But for Miao-lo, the title is a **threefold instruction**:

1. **摩訶** (*mahā*) = Contemplate the Three Truths (空假中) simultaneously
2. **止** (*zhǐ*) = Stillness—cease discriminative thought
3. **觀** (*guān*) = Luminosity—clearly see reality

To recite the title is to **invoke the practice**. This is why preserving the Sanskrit *mahā* matters: it is not mere exoticism but **semantic precision**. The Chinese "da" (great) lacks the **tri-partite structure** that *mahā* encodes.

### The Fractal Hermeneutic

Miao-lo's analysis of the text's structure (總別) reveals what I call a **fractal hermeneutic**: the whole is mirrored at every level.

- **Title** contains **Ten Chapters**
- **Great Meaning** contains **remaining chapters**
- **Each chapter** contains **self-practice, teaching others, ultimate return**

This is not mere literary architecture; it is **contemplative pedagogy**. By making the structure **recursive**, Miao-lo teaches the student to see the **mutual inclusion** (互具) of part and whole, which is itself the **content** of Tiantai contemplation (一即一切).

The text **enacts** what it teaches. Reading it is already practicing it.

### The Problem of Incompleteness

The acknowledgment that "the latter three major chapters are omitted and abbreviated" (後三大章其文闕略) is both humbling and liberating.

**Humbling**: Even the greatest teachers (Zhiyi, Guanding) could not transmit everything. Circumstances intervened—the summer retreat ended, illness perhaps, or simply the limitations of time and human capacity.

**Liberating**: The **incompleteness is not a defect** because "their meaning and purport are the same as the earlier [sections]" (義意同前). The student who thoroughly understands the **Great Meaning** has the **principles** (*li* 理) to extrapolate the **details** (*shi* 事).

This reflects the Mahāyāna emphasis on **prajñā** (wisdom) over **jñāna** (knowledge). It is better to **understand the principles** than to **memorize the details**. Principles generate understanding; details without principles are dead letter.

### The Tension Between Chinese and Sanskrit

Miao-lo's critique of Chinese terminology as "單淺" (simple and shallow) is startling, given that he is writing in Chinese, for a Chinese audience, in 8th-century China—over 700 years after Buddhism's entry into the Middle Kingdom.

Yet his loyalty is not to **linguistic nationalism** but to **doctrinal fidelity**. If Chinese lacks the semantic richness to convey the Three Truths in a single term, then **Sanskrit must be preserved**.

This is a **universalist** stance: truth transcends culture. The Dharma is neither "Chinese" nor "Indian" but **simply true**. Language is a **vehicle** (*yāna*), not the **destination**. When the vehicle is inadequate, change vehicles.

This has profound implications for translation theory: **fidelity to meaning** may require **infidelity to linguistic norms**. Better a "foreign" term that is doctrinally precise than a "native" term that is doctrinally vague.

**Translation Notes**:
- Brackets [...] supply grammatical elements implicit in Classical Chinese
- Parenthetical terms give original Chinese or Sanskrit where relevant
- Technical terms are glossed upon first occurrence

**Methodology**:
- Translation prioritizes philological precision while maintaining readability
- Doctrinal analysis draws on Tiantai commentarial tradition (Zhiyi, Guanding, Zhanran)
- Textual-critical observations reference CBETA apparatus where relevant

**END OF FASCICLE 1, PART 2**

**Next**: Fascicle 1, Part 3 will examine Miao-lo's discussion of the Common Preface (通序) and the opening phrase "止觀明靜" (Concentration-Insight is luminous in its stillness).
