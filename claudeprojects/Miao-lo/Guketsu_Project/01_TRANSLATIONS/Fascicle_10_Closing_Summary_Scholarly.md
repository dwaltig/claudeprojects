## What This Fascicle Covered

### Part 1: The Māra Object (魔事境)

The fifth of the Ten Objects, addressing external interference during practice.

**The Four Māras**:
1. **Affliction-Māra** (煩惱魔) — Internal saboteur
2. **Aggregate-Māra** (陰魔) — Body-mind trap
3. **Death-Māra** (死魔) — Fear of impermanence
4. **Heavenly-Māra** (天魔) — External adversary

**The Twelve Categories of Demonic Activity**:
- Physical (pain, pleasure, abnormal states, illness)
- Emotional (grief, terror, rage, false devotion)
- Cognitive (confusion, false insight, visions, dreams)

**The Core Teaching**:
> "The māra-realm is suchness; the Buddha-realm is suchness. One suchness, not two suchnesses."

### Part 2: Integration of the Ten Objects

## The Essential Teaching

### The Three Truths

| Truth | Chinese | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Emptiness** | 空諦 | No inherent existence |
| **Provisional** | 假諦 | Functional manifestation |
| **Middle** | 中諦 | Neither and both |

> "Three truths, one reality. One reality, three aspects. Not sequence. Not separation. Simultaneous."

### The Core Formula

> "一念三千" — "3,000 worlds in one thought-moment."

Every moment of mind contains:
- 10 dharma-realms × 10 (mutual inclusion) = 100
- 100 × 10 suchnesses = 1,000
- 1,000 × 3 domains = 3,000

This is the inconceivable that is contemplated in the first mode.

## Miao-lo's Contribution

### What the Commentary Provides

1. **Clarification**: Making explicit what Zhiyi left implicit
2. **Organization**: Structuring the vast material
3. **Defense**: Responding to criticisms from other schools
4. **Transmission**: Ensuring the teaching survives

### The Lineage Preserved

```
Nāgārjuna → Huiwen → Huisi → Zhiyi → Guanding → ... → Zhanran (Miao-lo)
```

Miao-lo is the ninth patriarch of Tiantai. His commentary ensures the teaching reaches future generations.

## For the Practitioner

### The Work

1. **Sit**: Establish regular practice
2. **Contemplate**: Apply the method to what arises
3. **Continue**: Through obstacles internal and external
4. **Trust**: The path has been walked before

### The Method

> "Contemplate this thought-moment as containing the 3,000 worlds. See the empty, provisional, and middle nature of what arises. Do not grasp, do not reject. Rest in seeing."

### The Fruit

Comes naturally when conditions are complete. Do not chase it.

### The Return

To where you already are. To what you already are.

## Final Words

### From the Commentary

> "The Mohe Zhiguan is the heart of Tiantai. This commentary is the explication of that heart. But explication is not the heart itself. The practitioner must find the heart in practice, not in words."

### The Transmission

> "What is transmitted? Not the words. Not even the concepts. What is transmitted is the recognition: 'This very mind is Buddha.' When that recognition is stable, the transmission is complete."
