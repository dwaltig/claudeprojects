## What We Covered: The Long Sanding

### The Setup

This fascicle was about **thought-delusion** (思惑) — the grain in the wood that won't straighten.

You broke through **view-delusion** (見惑). That was seeing the truth. **Lightning bolt**.

Now comes **thought-delusion**. That's **living** the truth. **Long sanding**.

---

## The Three Correct Poisons

**Greed**. **Anger**. **Delusion**.

Still there. But **transformed**.

You're not going to hell anymore. You're not creating evil karma. You're just... **working through the momentum**.

Like the wood grain bending the way it's always bent.

---

## The Map: 81 Categories

**Three realms**:
- Desire realm (where we live)
- Form realm (meditation states)
- Formless realm (deep absorption)

**Nine grades** in each:
- Upper-upper to lower-lower

**Total**: 81 categories of habit.

But don't get hung up on the math. The point is: **This takes time**.

## The Stream-Enterer's Seven Returns

You break through view-delusion. You're a **Stream-Enterer**.

**Maximum**: Seven more lifetimes.  
**Minimum**: One more lifetime (if you're sharp).

You're in the current. You're headed downstream. The ocean's waiting.

You just gotta keep paddling.

## Two Ways to Sand

### Analytical Contemplation (析觀)

**Take it apart**. Examine every piece. See how it's put together.

**For**: Slow learners. Methodical types.

**Method**: Four questions. Sixty-four examinations. Sand grain by grain.

### Substantial Contemplation (體觀)

**See the whole**. Direct perception. No need to break it down.

**For**: Sharp practitioners. Quick studies.

**Method**: One look. **Boom**. You're done.

---

## The Three Provisional Designations

Every affliction has three aspects:

1. **Cause-and-Effect** (因成假) — How it's built
2. **Continuous** (相續假) — How it streams
3. **Relative** (相待假) — How it's defined by what it's not

You work through all three. For each grade. For each affliction.

**That's the long sanding**.

## The Four Gates: Different Doors, Same Room

### Gate 1: Existence (有門)

**The Setup**: Everything arises from causes and conditions.

**The Realization**: No permanent self. No inherent existence.

**The Example**: The Buddha's first five disciples.

### Gate 2: Emptiness (空門)

**The Setup**: Who's experiencing this? Where's the experiencer?

**The Realization**: No person. No thing. Just emptiness.

**The Example**: Subhūti in his stone chamber.

### Gate 3: Both (亦有亦空門)

**The Setup**: Things exist provisionally. But they're empty ultimately.

**The Realization**: Both perspectives matter.

### Gate 4: Neither (非有非空門)

**The Setup**: Not existence. Not emptiness. Beyond both.

**The Realization**: Let go of grasping itself.

---

## The Unity

**Four doors. One room.**

Different methods. Same truth.

Don't argue about which door is best. **Pick a door. Walk through.**

---

## The Luthier's Summary

### What You Learned

1. **Thought-delusion is the grain** — the habits that won't straighten
2. **81 categories** — the map of what you're working with
3. **Seven returns** — maximum lifetimes left
4. **Two methods** — analytical (slow) or substantial (fast)
5. **Three provisional designations** — how to examine each affliction
6. **Four gates** — different ways to enter the truth

### What You Do

**Work the wood**.

Sand the grain. Examine the build. See the emptiness.

**One grade at a time**. One affliction at a time.

**It's not glamorous**. It's not a lightning bolt.

It's **seven lifetimes of sanding**.

But here's the good news: **You're in the current**. You're headed downstream.

The ocean's waiting.

---

## The Path Forward

You've got the methods. You've got the map. You've got the tools.

Now you gotta **do the work**.

**Fascicle 7** will refine the methods. Deepen the exploration. Show you the advanced applications.

But for now, you know what you need to know:

**Sand the grain. See the emptiness. Keep paddling.**

**END OF TAPE**
