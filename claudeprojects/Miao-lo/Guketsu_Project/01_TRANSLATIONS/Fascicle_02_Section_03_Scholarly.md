## Introduction: What Does Zhiguan "Embrace"?

The fourth of the Ten Chapters is **攝法** (*She Fa* — "Embracing the Dharmas"). After knowing the name and the essence, the practitioner must understand how Zhiguan *relates to* and *contains* all other Buddhist teachings.

Miao-lo explains that Zhiguan "embraces" (*she* 攝) teachings through **six meanings** (六義 *liu yi*):

| # | Chinese | English | What It Embraces |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **攝理** (*She Li*) | Embracing Principle | The ultimate truth (理 *li*) |
| 2 | **攝惑** (*She Huo*) | Embracing Delusion | All afflictions (惑 *huo*) |
| 3 | **攝智** (*She Zhi*) | Embracing Wisdom | All kinds of knowing (智 *zhi*) |
| 4 | **攝行** (*She Xing*) | Embracing Practice | All methods of cultivation (行 *xing*) |
| 5 | **攝位** (*She Wei*) | Embracing Stages | All levels of attainment (位 *wei*) |
| 6 | **攝教** (*She Jiao*) | Embracing Teachings | All doctrinal categories (教 *jiao*) |

---

## 1. Embracing Principle (*She Li*)

### Definition

The "principle" (*li*) is the ultimate reality that all teachings point to. Zhiguan embraces two kinds of principle:

| Type | Chinese | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Expedient Principle** | 權理 | The partial truths taught in provisional teachings (Emptiness, Conventional) |
| **True Principle** | 實理 | The complete truth of the Middle Way |

### Application

The Perfect Zhiguan embraces *both* principles. It does not reject the Expedient in favor of the True. Instead:

> "The Expedient is revealed as already True. The True does not exist apart from the Expedient."

---

## 2. Embracing Delusion (*She Huo*)

### The Three Delusions

| Delusion | Chinese | What It Obscures | Teaching That Addresses It |
|---|---|---|---|
| **View/Thought Delusions** | 見思惑 | True Emptiness | Tripiṭaka, Shared |
| **Dust-and-Sand Delusions** | 塵沙惑 | Conventional Truth | Distinct |
| **Ignorance** | 無明 | Middle Way | Perfect |

### Application

The Perfect Zhiguan *embraces* all three delusions simultaneously. It does not break them sequentially (first View/Thought, then Dust-and-Sand, then Ignorance). Instead:

> "In one contemplation, all three delusions are seen as empty, conventional, and middle. To 'embrace' means to transform, not to eliminate."

---

## 3. Embracing Wisdom (*She Zhi*)

### The Three Wisdoms (Reprise)

| Wisdom | Chinese | Corresponds To |
|---|---|---|
| **All-Knowing Wisdom** | 一切智 | Emptiness |
| **Path Wisdom** | 道種智 | Conventional methods |
| **All-Mode Wisdom** | 一切種智 | Middle Way |

### Application

The Perfect Zhiguan *embraces* all three wisdoms because it contemplates all three truths at once:

> "One wisdom is three wisdoms. Three wisdoms are one wisdom. This is the meaning of *embracing*."

---

## 4. Embracing Practice (*She Xing*)

### The Two Kinds of Practice

| Type | Chinese | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Principal Practice** | 正行 | The main cultivation (i.e., the Ten Modes of Contemplation) |
| **Auxiliary Practice** | 助行 | Supporting practices (precepts, repentance, etc.) |

### Application

The Perfect Zhiguan embraces both Principal and Auxiliary:

> "Without the Auxiliary, the Principal lacks support. Without the Principal, the Auxiliary lacks direction. Both are embraced in one practice."

---

## 5. Embracing Stages (*She Wei*)

### The Six Identities (Reprise)

| Stage | Chinese | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Principle | 理即 | All beings are Buddha in principle. |
| 2. Name | 名字即 | Hearing the teaching. |
| 3. Contemplation | 觀行即 | Beginning to practice. |
| 4. Resemblance | 相似即 | Approaching realization. |
| 5. Partial Realization | 分真即 | Breaking ignorance. |
| 6. Ultimate | 究竟即 | Full Buddhahood. |

### Application

The Perfect Zhiguan *embraces* all six stages because:

> "From the first stage to the last, the practitioner is contemplating the same truth. The difference is only in the degree of clarity."

---

## 6. Embracing Teachings (*She Jiao*)

### The Four Teachings

| Teaching | Chinese | Characteristic |
|---|---|---|
| **Tripiṭaka** | 藏教 | Analytical, gradual |
| **Shared** | 通教 | Body-contemplating, shared with Hīnayāna |
| **Distinct** | 別教 | Sequential Middle Way |
| **Perfect** | 圓教 | Non-dual, immediate |

### Application

The Perfect Zhiguan *embraces* all four teachings because:

> "The first three are not rejected. They are *opened* to reveal the Perfect that was always present."

This is the principle of **開權顯實** (*kai quan xian shi* — "opening the expedient to reveal the real").

---

## Summary

The "Embracing the Dharmas" chapter shows that the Perfect Zhiguan is not one method among many. It is the *encompassing* method that:

1.  Contains both Expedient and True Principle.
2.  Transforms all three Delusions.
3.  Includes all three Wisdoms.
4.  Unifies Principal and Auxiliary Practice.
5.  Spans all Six Stages.
6.  Incorporates all Four Teachings.

Nothing is left outside. This is why the *Mohe Zhiguan* is called "Great" (*Mo He* = Mahā).
