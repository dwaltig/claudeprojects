## Source-Aligned Bilingual Block

[01][CN] 攝法秖明體所攝法。  
[01][EN] "Embracing dharmas" specifically clarifies the dharmas embraced by the body.

[02][CN] 初釋名者即標名也。次體相者即顯體也。攝法秖明體所攝法。  
[02][EN] First, explaining the name is marking the name; next, body-characteristics is revealing the body; embracing dharmas specifically clarifies the dharmas embraced by that body.

[03][CN] 此為成觀觀由解生。名體偏圓並屬於解。由解立行故次解後方便正觀。  
[03][EN] This is for completing contemplation; contemplation arises from understanding. Name/body and partial/complete all belong to understanding; because practice is established from understanding, after understanding come expedient means and proper contemplation.

[04][CN] 行始為因行終為果。故次正觀以明果報。  
[04][EN] Practice begins as cause and ends as fruit; therefore proper contemplation is followed by clarifying fruit-result.

[05][CN] 釋名下去諸義皆然。  
[05][EN] From "explaining the name" onward, all these meanings follow the same principle.

[06][CN] 所以釋名論待論絕。體相唯論次與不次。攝法六義偏圓五門亦復如是。  
[06][EN] Therefore, explaining the name discusses relative and absolute; body-characteristics only discusses sequential and non-sequential; embracing dharmas with six meanings, and partial/complete with five gates, are likewise so.

[07][CN] 雖無部會可以對論。還借教味以顯圓妙。  
[07][EN] Even without formal sectional convergence for direct comparison, one still borrows doctrinal flavors to reveal perfect wondrousness.

[08][CN] 故知一部之文共成圓乘開權妙觀。  
[08][EN] Hence one knows the whole text jointly forms the Perfect Vehicle's opening of expedient means into wondrous contemplation.

[09][CN] 豈指一句別謂高深。若其然者。何殊體踏。  
[09][EN] How could one isolate a single sentence and call that alone lofty and profound? If one does so, how is it different from trampling over the full body of doctrine?

[10][CN] 此中四段。文四義二意唯在一。  
[10][EN] Here, in these four segments: text is fourfold, meanings are dual, but intent is only one.

[11][CN] 待絕為二意在於絕又所一能三亦名義一以所顯能故云意一。  
[11][EN] Relative and absolute are two in wording, yet intent rests in the absolute; because what is revealed is one while revealing functions are three, this is also called one meaning, and thus one intent.

[12][CN] 次釋體相中。所詮諦理名之為體。分別權實大小不同。故名為相。  
[12][EN] In the subsequent body-characteristics explanation, interpreted truth-principle is called body; distinguishing expedient/real and great/small differences is called characteristics.

[13][CN] 亦云顯體者。體是所顯。教相眼智即是能顯。  
[13][EN] It is also called revealing-body: body is what is revealed; teaching-characteristics and eye-wisdom are revealing agencies.

[14][CN] 故釋名四段意在絕待。體相四章意在境界。  
[14][EN] Therefore, the four sections in explaining names intend absolute-relativity, while the four chapters in body-characteristics intend realm.

[15][CN] 是故四章文四義二章意在一。  
[15][EN] Thus four chapters with four textual divisions and two semantic tracks still carry one chapter-intent.
