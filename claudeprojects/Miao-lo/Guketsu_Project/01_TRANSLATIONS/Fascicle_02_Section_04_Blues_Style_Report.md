# Blues Tone Check Report
## Fascicle_02_Section_04_Blues.md

### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.6/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "From emptiness to provisional, from provisional to middle." `{DOCTRINE: direct mapping of 因空入假因假入中}`
- "Applying, opening, setting aside" `{DOCTRINE: mirrors 施開廢 sequence}`
- "Expedient is not outside buddhahood-body." `{LEXICON: preserves 權本是諸佛妙體}`
- "No Separate Principle" section `{DOCTRINE: preserves 無別理 + 雙非/一實 linkage}`
- "Neither clutch expedient nor clutch 'real' as an idol." `{RHYTHM: vernacular rendering of 非權非實 closure}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Binary scorecard simplification | Source-ordered treatment of 漸頓 + 權實 blocks |
| Heavy analogical substitutions | Clausal doctrinal anchors preserved in every section |
| Overconfident "real vs fake" rhetoric | Nuanced opening/setting-aside logic retained |
| Missing four siddhantas role | Added explicit 四悉 mapping statement |

### 4. Notes
- Register remains oral and forceful while avoiding polemical distortion.
- Next pass can widen coverage if scholarly section adds fourfold/sevenfold sub-classification lines.
