## I. Causes and Conditions for the Arising of Dhyāna

Before detailing the states, Miao-lo explains **why** they arise.

### 1. The Internal Cause (內因)
All sentient beings possess the potential for these states.
> "Just as all beings have the potential for Buddhahood, they also possess the seeds of the fundamental dhyānas."

These seeds are "moistened" by past practice. Even if one did not master them in a past life, the imprint remains.

### 2. The External Condition (外緣)
The triggering factors:
- **Teaching**: Hearing the method.
- **Protection**: The aid of Buddhas and spirits.
- **Practice**: The immediate application of methods (like the 25 Preparations).

## II. The Root Dhyānas (根本禪) — Worldly Zen

These are called "Root" (根本) because they are the foundation for all other meditations, and "Flavor" (味) because beings become attached to the taste of bliss within them.

### The Four Dhyānas (四禪)

**1. First Dhyāna (初禪)**
- **Trigger**: Through the "Eight Touches" (八觸) - movement, itch, lightness, heaviness, cold, heat, roughness, smoothness.
- **Characteristics**: Separation from desire (離欲). Five branches:
  1.  **Vitarka** (覺 - Investigation/Coarse thought)
  2.  **Vicara** (觀 - Analysis/Fine thought)
  3.  **Piti** (喜 - Joy)
  4.  **Sukha** (樂 - Bliss)
  5.  **Ekaggata** (一心 - One-pointedness)
- **The Danger**: Attachment to the Eight Touches. Mistaking the sensation for realization.

**2. Second Dhyāna (二禪)**
- **Trigger**: Cessation of coarse and fine thought.
- **Characteristics**: Internal purity (內淨).
  1.  **Internal Purity** (內淨)
  2.  **Joy** (喜)
  3.  **Bliss** (樂)
  4.  **One-pointedness** (一心)
- **The Shift**: The mind is like a still pool. No waves of discursive thought.

**3. Third Dhyāna (三禪)**
- **Characteristics**:
  1.  **Equanimity** (捨)
  2.  **Mindfulness** (念)
  3.  **Wisdom** (慧)
  4.  **Bliss** (樂)
  5.  **One-pointedness** (一心)
- **The Note**: This contains the highest worldly bliss. The danger of attachment is highest here.

**4. Fourth Dhyāna (四禪)**
- **Characteristics**:
  1.  **Neither-pain-nor-pleasure** (不苦不樂)
  2.  **Equanimity** (捨)
  3.  **Mindfulness-purity** (念清淨)
  4.  **One-pointedness** (一心)
- **The State**: Breath ceases. The mind is immobile like a lamp in a windless room.

### The Four Formless Absorptions (四無色定)

When the practitioner turns away from matter (form) completely:

1.  **Infinite Space** (空無邊處): Removing the limits of matter.
2.  **Infinite Consciousness** (識無邊處): Focusing on the mind that perceives space.
3.  **Nothingness** (無所有處): Dropping even consciousness. "There is nothing."
4.  **Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception** (非想非非想處): The limit of worldly existence. The mind is so subtle it can hardly be said to exist, yet it is not non-existent.

**Miao-lo's Critique**:
> "These are the peak of samsara. But they are still samsara. Like an arrow shot into the sky, eventually it must fall."

## III. The Also-Worldly-Also-Transcendental Zens (亦有漏亦無漏禪)

These practices bridge the gap. They use worldly methods but can lead to transcendental results if directed by wisdom.

### 1. The Six Wondrous Gates (六妙門)
1.  **Counting** (數): Regulating the breath.
2.  **Following** (隨): Unification with the breath.
3.  **Stopping** (止): Quiescence.
4.  **Contemplating** (觀): Insight.
5.  **Returning** (還): Turning back to the source of mind.
6.  **Purifying** (淨): No marks.

### 2. The Sixteen Special Excellences (十六特勝)
An expansion of breath mindfulness (Anapanasati). Unlike the Root Dhyānas, these maintain **insight/wisdom** throughout the levels of dhyāna. They prevent "flavor" (attachment).

- Includes: Knowing breath short/long, experiencing joy/bliss, calming mental formations, gladdening the mind, concentrating the mind, liberating the mind, contemplating impermanence, fading away, cessation, relinquishment.

### 3. The Transparent Light Dhyāna (通明禪)
A practice that produces "Transparent Light" (通明) - realizing the non-substantiality of the breath and the mind. It illuminates the internal organs and the nature of the body without dissection. It is distinct from the Nine Thoughts (which focus on impurity).
