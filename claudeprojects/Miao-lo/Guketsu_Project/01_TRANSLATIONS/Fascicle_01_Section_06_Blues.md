## The Main Chords

Miao-lo says: "Okay, you threw out the cheap pedals (The Ten Wrongs). The hum is gone. Now, what are you gonna play?"

You don't just stand there in silence. You need a setlist. In the business, we call this **The Four Great Vows**. But let's call them the **Four Main Chords** of the Universe. Everything else is just jazz variation.

### 1. The Audience is Infinite (Save 'Em All)
**The Text**: "Sentient Beings are numberless; I vow to save them."
**The Luthier**: You don't pick and choose who hears the music. You don't say, "I'm only playing for the guys in the front row." You play for the whole stadium, including the cheap seats in the back.
** The Vibe**: **Universal Validity.** If your Truth doesn't work for the janitor, it doesn't work for the CEO.

### 2. The Feedback is Infinite (Cut the Noise)
**The Text**: "Defilements are inexhaustible; I vow to end them."
**The Luthier**: Noise (Greed, Anger, Ignorance) is always trying to creep into the signal chain. You never say, "Eh, good enough." You are constantly gating the noise, fixing the grounds, shielding the cavities.
**The Vibe**: **Zero Tolerance for Bullsh*t.**

### 3. The Songbook is Infinite (Learn the Licks)
**The Text**: "Dharma gates are measureless; I vow to learn them."
**The Luthier**: You can't just play the Pentatonic scale your whole life. You gotta learn Jazz, Classical, Funk, Country. You need the *skills* to reach people. A Bodhisattva is a session musician who can play *anything* the gig requires.
**The Vibe**: **Professional Competence.**

### 4. The Tone is Infinite (Master the Rig)
**The Text**: "The Buddha Way is unsurpassable; I vow to attain it."
**The Luthier**: There is no "perfect tone," but you die trying to find it. You never stop chasing the sound. It's the pursuit of Excellence. You want to be the Master Builder, not just a guy with a soldering iron.
**The Vibe**: **Total Mastery.**

## Technical Note: The "Natural" Tone

Miao-lo talks about "Uncreated Vows." That sounds fancy.
It just means **Flow State**.
When you're first learning, you think: "Okay, pointer finger on the 5th fret, ring finger on the 7th." That's the **Dualistic Vow**. It's hard work.
But when you *know* the instrument, you don't think. You hear a sound in your head, and your hands just make it happen. The music plays *you*.
That's the **Uncreated Vow**. You're not "saving beings"—you're just vibrating, and everything around you starts to resonate in key.

## Luthier's Verdict

Get these four chords down.
1.  Play for everyone.
2.  Kill the noise.
3.  Learn every style.
4.  Chase the perfect tone.

Do that, and you're ready for the main stage.
