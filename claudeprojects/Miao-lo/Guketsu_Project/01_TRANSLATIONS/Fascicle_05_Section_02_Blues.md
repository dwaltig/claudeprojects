## Opening Word

Final two objects cut deep:

Two-vehicle retreat:
private peace over universal vow.

Bodhisattva attachment:
path-identity over path-freedom.

---

## Two Vehicles Object

This turn can arise
after real insight,
when weariness and relief
tempt practice into exit-mode.

Signs include:
exhaustion with samsara,
shrinking compassion,
satisfaction with partial completion,
withdrawal from vows.

Response center:
reawaken bodhi intention.

Not by guilt.
By remembering shared suffering
and shared dependency on help.

---

## Conjured-City Warning

Rest stop is not destination.

If peace-state becomes endpoint,
one halts in provisional completion.

So emptiness must stay joined
with great compassion,
and nirvana must not be split
from samsara-function.

---

## Bodhisattva Object

Advanced stages,
powers,
refined capacities may arise.

Obstacle is not their appearance.
Obstacle is identification:
"I am this stage."
"I am this power."
"I am this role."

Even bodhisattva identity
must be released.

---

## Ten-Mode Completion at This Level

All modes remain relevant,
but release mode is decisive.

Attainment acknowledged.
Attainment not possessed.

Service continues
without self-narrative enthronement.

---

## Closing Moan

When even noble identity loosens,
benefit-function can move freely.

No retreat.
No self-crowning.
No frozen completion.

Just vow,
clarity,
and unowned activity for beings.
