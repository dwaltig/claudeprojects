## The Final Two

- **Two Vehicles** (二乘境) — Hīnayāna tendencies
- **Bodhisattva** (菩薩境) — Advanced bodhisattva experiences

Most subtle obstacles. Only show up at advanced stages after you've transcended gross afflictions and even subtle intellectual obstacles.

---

## Part 1: Two Vehicles Object (二乘境)

### What It Is

Despite practicing Perfect Teaching, you develop tendencies toward **śrāvaka** or **pratyekabuddha** paths—seeking personal liberation rather than universal Buddhahood.

### The Two Vehicles

| Vehicle | Focus | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| **Śrāvaka** | Hearing the teaching | Personal nirvāṇa |
| **Pratyekabuddha** | Dependent origination | Solitary realization |

**Both**: Focus on personal liberation, limited compassion, satisfaction with partial realization

---

### Why It Shows Up

After deep practice, you might experience:
1.  Profound weariness with saṃsāra
2.  Taste of peace in emptiness
3.  Desire to rest from bodhisattva's work
4.  Doubt about helping all beings

The thought: "I've suffered enough. I've worked enough. Why not enter nirvāṇa now and rest?"

---

### How It Shows Up

#### 1. Weariness with Saṃsāra

**Healthy**: Seeing suffering clearly
**Obstacle**: Wanting to escape permanently

**The distinction**:
- Bodhisattva sees suffering but stays to help
- Two Vehicles sees suffering and wants to leave

---

#### 2. Lack of Compassion

**What it is**: "I've realized the truth. Others must find it themselves."

**The error**: Forgetting your own realization depended on teachers and conditions

**The fix**: Recall how you were helped; vow to help others similarly

---

#### 3. Satisfaction with Partial Realization

**The metaphor**: The conjured city (化城) from Lotus Sutra
- Rest stop on the journey, not the final destination
- Mistaking the rest stop for the goal

**The danger**: Stopping at arhatship instead of continuing to Buddhahood

---

#### 4. Retreat from the Vows

**What it is**: Forgetting or abandoning the Four Great Vows

**The cause**: Exhaustion, doubt, or attachment to peace

**The fix**: Renew the vows; remember the original aspiration

---

### Hīnayāna vs. Mahāyāna

| Aspect | Hīnayāna | Mahāyāna |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Personal nirvāṇa | Universal Buddhahood |
| **Motivation** | Escape suffering | Help all beings |
| **View** | Saṃsāra ≠ nirvāṇa | Saṃsāra = nirvāṇa |
| **Practice** | For oneself | For all beings |
| **Result** | Arhatship | Complete Buddhahood |

---

### Ten Modes on Two Vehicles

**Mode 2 (Bodhi-Mind)**: The critical mode

**Renew the Four Great Vows**:
1.  Beings are numberless; I vow to save them
2.  Afflictions are inexhaustible; I vow to end them
3.  Dharma-gates are boundless; I vow to master them
4.  Buddhahood is unsurpassable; I vow to attain it

**Cultivate Great Compassion**:
- Remember all beings suffer as you have
- Recall how you were helped
- Vow to help others as you were helped

---

### Luthier's Point

> "Two Vehicles aren't wrong. They're incomplete. The arhat has realized emptiness but not fullness. The pratyekabuddha has realized dependent origination but not Middle Way. Both must continue to complete Buddhahood."

> "In Perfect Teaching, there's no separate nirvāṇa to enter. Saṃsāra, when seen clearly, is nirvāṇa. The bodhisattva doesn't escape saṃsāra but transforms it through wisdom and compassion."

---

## Part 2: Bodhisattva Object (菩薩境)

### What It Is

Advanced experiences on the bodhisattva path:
- Ten Stages (十地)
- Supernatural Powers (神通)
- Bodhisattva practices and attainments

Even here, subtle obstacles can show up.

---

### The Ten Stages

| Stage | Meaning | Realization |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Joyful | 歡喜地 | First breakthrough |
| 2. Stainless | 離垢地 | Purity of precepts |
| 3. Luminous | 發光地 | Patience and meditation |
| 4. Radiant Wisdom | 焰慧地 | Burning afflictions |
| 5. Difficult to Conquer | 難勝地 | Mastery of truths |
| 6. Manifest | 現前地 | Wisdom of dependent origination |
| 7. Far-Going | 遠行地 | Skillful means perfected |
| 8. Immovable | 不動地 | Effortless practice |
| 9. Good Wisdom | 善慧地 | Perfect teaching ability |
| 10. Dharma Cloud | 法雲地 | Approaching Buddhahood |

---

### Obstacles at This Level

#### 1. Attachment to Stages

**What it is**: Pride in having reached a particular stage

**The error**: Making the stages into fixed attainments

**Point**: "Stages are skillful designations. Where's the stage?"

---

#### 2. Attachment to Powers

**The Six Supernatural Powers**:
1.  Divine eye (seeing distant/hidden things)
2.  Divine ear (hearing distant/subtle sounds)
3.  Mind-reading (knowing others' thoughts)
4.  Recollection of past lives
5.  Supernatural abilities (flying, etc.)
6.  Extinction of outflows (liberation)

**The danger**: Pride in powers, using them for display

**The teaching**: "Powers are byproducts, not goals. Use them to help beings, not to impress them."

---

#### 3. Attachment to Bodhisattva Identity

**What it is**: "I am a bodhisattva"

**The subtlety**: Even this identity must be released

**Diamond Sutra**:
> "A bodhisattva who gives rise to the notion 'I am a bodhisattva' is not a bodhisattva."

---

#### 4. Dharma-Attachment

**What it is**: Attachment to:
- The bodhisattva path itself
- Practices and methods
- Teachings and realizations

**The final release**: Even the path must be let go

---

### The Transition to Buddha

**Tenth Stage**: On the verge of Buddhahood

**The final step**: Release even the bodhisattva identity

**What remains**: Not a "Buddha" as an identity, but Buddha-activity without a doer

---

### Ten Modes on Bodhisattva Object

**All Ten Modes necessary** at this level:

**Mode 1**: See all attainments as Three Truths
**Mode 2**: Maintain Bodhi-Mind without clinging
**Mode 3**: Effortless Zhi-Guan
**Mode 4**: Deconstruct even bodhisattva views
**Mode 5**: Discern what truly helps beings
**Mode 6-7**: Perfect skillful means
**Mode 8**: Know you're approaching but not yet at the goal
**Mode 9**: Patience with final obstacles
**Mode 10**: **Release everything**, even the bodhisattva path

---

### Luthier's Point

> "Bodhisattva path has many stages, many attainments, many powers. But all must be released. The highest bodhisattva is the one who has forgotten they are a bodhisattva."

> "When even the bodhisattva identity is released, what remains? Not emptiness. Not existence. Not a Buddha. Not a non-Buddha. What remains can't be spoken, but it functions perfectly to benefit all beings."

---

## Completion of the Ten Objects

| Objects | Nature | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Aggregates | Universal foundation |
| **2-6** | Afflictions → Dhyāna | Common obstacles |
| **7-8** | Wrong Views, Pride | Subtle intellectual/attitudinal |
| **9** | Two Vehicles | Motivational obstacle |
| **10** | Bodhisattva | Identity obstacle |

**The pattern**: Each level requires releasing what was helpful at the previous level

---

## Summary

| Object | Core Issue | Primary Mode | Key Insight |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Two Vehicles** | Seeking personal liberation | Mode 2 (Bodhi-Mind) | Saṃsāra = nirvāṇa |
| **Bodhisattva** | Clinging to path/identity | Mode 10 (Release All) | Even the path must be released |

**The ultimate teaching**:
> "The Ten Objects aren't ten separate things to overcome. They're ten aspects of one fundamental clinging—the clinging to self. When self is completely released, all ten objects dissolve simultaneously."

---

**END OF TAPE**
