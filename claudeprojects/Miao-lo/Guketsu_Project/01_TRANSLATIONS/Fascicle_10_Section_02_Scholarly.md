## The Ten Objects Complete (十境總論)

Having covered all ten objects across the preceding fascicles, Miao-lo now provides a synthetic overview. This section addresses:

1. Why there are ten objects
2. Their order and interrelationship
3. How each contains all ten
4. The practical implications for practice

## Why Ten Objects?

### The Logic of the Classification

The ten objects arise from analyzing all possible phenomena that can appear during contemplation:

| Category | Objects | Logic |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Universal** | 1. Aggregates | Always present; the basis of experience |
| **Internal** | 2. Afflictions, 3. Illness, 4. Karma | Arise from within the practitioner |
| **External** | 5. Māra | Appears to come from outside |
| **Practice-Induced** | 6. Dhyāna States | Arises specifically from meditation |
| **Cognitive** | 7. Wrong Views, 8. Pride | Errors in understanding or attitude |
| **Aspirational** | 9. Two Vehicles, 10. Bodhisattva | Incomplete goals |

Miao-lo clarifies:

> "These ten exhaust the possibilities. Whatever arises during practice falls into one of these categories. The practitioner who knows these ten is prepared for anything."

---

## The Order of the Ten Objects

### Why This Sequence?

**Object 1: Aggregates (陰入界境)**

The aggregates come first because they are always present. Before any specific obstacle arises, there is already body-mind. This is the universal ground.

> "Even when sitting peacefully with no disturbance, the aggregates are present. Therefore, contemplation begins here."

**Objects 2-4: Internal Obstacles**

After establishing contemplation on the aggregates, internal disturbances naturally surface:

- **Afflictions** (煩惱): The three poisons stir
- **Illness** (病患): Physical discomfort intensifies
- **Karma** (業相): Past actions manifest as visions, feelings, memories

These arise from within. They are "mine" in the conventional sense.

**Object 5: External Obstacle**

Once internal obstacles are somewhat stabilized, external interference may begin:

- **Māra** (魔事): Opposition from outside

This marks the transition from internal to external work.

**Object 6: Practice State**

As practice deepens, meditative states arise:

- **Dhyāna** (禪定): Jhāna, samādhi, various absorptions

These are not obstacles in themselves, but become obstacles through attachment.

**Objects 7-8: Cognitive Errors**

With states comes the danger of misinterpretation:

- **Wrong Views** (諸見): Misunderstanding the meaning of experiences
- **Pride** (慢): Inflating the significance of attainment

These corrupt genuine progress.

**Objects 9-10: Incomplete Goals**

Finally, even correct understanding can aim at wrong destinations:

- **Two Vehicles** (二乘): Settling for personal liberation
- **Bodhisattva** (菩薩): Advanced but not yet complete

These represent the subtlest traps.

## The Interrelationship of the Ten Objects

### Horizontal Integration (橫論十境)

All ten objects are present simultaneously in any moment of experience:

| Object | Present As |
|--------|------------|
| Aggregates | The experience itself |
| Afflictions | Subtle reactive patterns |
| Illness | Physical sensations |
| Karma | Conditioning of perception |
| Māra | Resistance to liberation |
| Dhyāna | Quality of concentration |
| Wrong Views | Interpretive framework |
| Pride | Sense of self-reference |
| Two Vehicles | Habitual goal-orientation |
| Bodhisattva | Aspiration and its limits |

> "In a single moment, all ten are present. The classification into sequence is for teaching purposes. Reality does not arise in sequence."

### Vertical Integration (竪論十境)

In practice, objects tend to arise in the given order:

```
1. Aggregates (always present)
      ↓
2-4. Internal obstacles surface
      ↓
5. External interference begins
      ↓
6. Meditative states develop
      ↓
7-8. Cognitive errors arise
      ↓
9-10. Aspirational limits encountered
```

This sequence describes a typical progression, but individuals may experience variations.

## Each Object Contains All Ten

### The Principle of Mutual Inclusion

Miao-lo emphasizes:

> "One object contains all ten. Ten objects are one object. This is not metaphor but reality."

**Example: Aggregates Containing All Ten**

When contemplating the aggregates:

1. **Aggregates**: The aggregates themselves
2. **Afflictions**: Clinging to aggregates
3. **Illness**: Physical aspect of form aggregate
4. **Karma**: Conditioned nature of aggregates
5. **Māra**: Aggregates as the basis for māra's operation
6. **Dhyāna**: Subtle states within perception
7. **Wrong Views**: Mistaking aggregates for self
8. **Pride**: "My" aggregates
9. **Two Vehicles**: Using aggregate contemplation for personal escape
10. **Bodhisattva**: Seeing aggregates of all beings

**Example: Māra Containing All Ten**

When the Māra Object arises:

1. **Aggregates**: Māra appears within body-mind experience
2. **Afflictions**: Fear, desire, confusion triggered by māra
3. **Illness**: Physical symptoms from māra interference
4. **Karma**: Māra activating karmic traces
5. **Māra**: The māra phenomenon itself
6. **Dhyāna**: Māra appearing as false samādhi states
7. **Wrong Views**: Māra teaching false doctrine
8. **Pride**: "I defeated māra"
9. **Two Vehicles**: Māra encouraging limited aspiration
10. **Bodhisattva**: Māra appearing as false bodhisattva

## Practical Implications

### The One-Method Approach

Because each object contains all ten, and the Ten Modes apply to any object, the practitioner needs only one fundamental method:

> "Contemplate the inconceivable. Whatever arises is the 3,000 worlds in one thought. Empty, provisional, middle. No need to change the method when the object changes."

This is the simplicity on the far side of complexity.

### The Adaptive Approach

However, Miao-lo also validates adapting to circumstances:

> "For those whose roots are sharp, one method suffices. For those whose roots are dull, specific treatments for specific objects may be needed."

The Ten Modes were created precisely for this: to provide multiple tools for practitioners who cannot immediately realize the direct approach.

### The Signs of Mastery

How does the practitioner know the Ten Objects are understood?

1. **Nothing surprising**: Whatever arises is recognized as one of the ten
2. **No panic**: Even dramatic experiences are met with equanimity
3. **No attachment**: Even blissful states are not grasped
4. **No rejection**: Even painful states are not fled
5. **Continuity**: Practice continues regardless of what arises

## The Ten Objects and the Ten Modes

### Their Relationship

| Ten Objects | Ten Modes |
|-------------|-----------|
| What can arise | How to work with what arises |
| The territory | The tools |
| Passive (encountered) | Active (applied) |
| Descriptive | Prescriptive |

> "The Ten Objects describe the field. The Ten Modes describe the work. A farmer must know both the land and the tools."

### The First Mode as Master Key

While all ten modes can be applied to any object, the first mode—Contemplate the Inconceivable Object—is the master key:

> "One who truly realizes the 3,000 worlds in one thought has, in that realization, completed the work of all ten modes. The remaining nine are elaborations for those who have not yet seen."

---

## The Aggregates Object as Primary

### Why Begin with Aggregates?

Miao-lo returns to this fundamental point:

> "All objects are modifications of the aggregates. Afflictions arise within the aggregate of formations. Illness arises within the aggregate of form. Karma is stored in consciousness. Even māra operates through the aggregates."

Therefore:

> "The practitioner who thoroughly contemplates the aggregates has, in principle, contemplated all ten objects. The distinction into ten is pedagogical, not ontological."

### The Trap of Chasing Objects

Some practitioners, learning about the ten objects, begin to look for them:

- "When will māra appear?"
- "I haven't experienced wrong views yet—am I missing something?"
- "The bodhisattva object sounds advanced—I want that one"

Miao-lo warns:

> "Do not seek the objects. Contemplate what is present. The aggregates are present now. Begin there. What needs to arise will arise."

## The Completion of Correct Contemplation

### The Scope of Chapter Seven

The seventh chapter of the *Mohe Zhiguan*—Correct Contemplation (正觀)—covers:

- The ten objects
- The ten modes
- Their interrelationship
- Their application

With this section, the treatment of the seventh chapter is essentially complete.

### What Remains

The final three chapters address what happens after correct contemplation is established:

- **Fruit** (果報): The results that arise
- **Teaching** (起教): How realization leads to teaching others
- **Return** (旨歸): The ultimate destination

These are treated briefly in Section 3.

---

## Summary

The ten objects form a complete map of contemplative territory. Whether the practitioner encounters internal turmoil, external opposition, altered states, cognitive errors, or aspirational limitations, the map locates the experience and the Ten Modes provide the tools.

The deepest teaching: all ten objects are one object, all ten modes are one mode. The apparent complexity resolves into the simplicity of:

> "This very mind is Buddha. This very object is the dharma-realm. Nothing to add, nothing to remove."
