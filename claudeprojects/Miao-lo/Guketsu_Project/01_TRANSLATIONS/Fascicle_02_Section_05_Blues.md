## Opening Word

Before proper contemplation is stable,
this chapter lays out twenty-five expedient factors.

First it speaks broadly
of gradual and sudden forms.
Then it turns specifically
to the expedients of this text.

---

## Why Called Skillful Expedient Means

"Skillful" means these factors,
when dedicated and transferred,
become wondrous causes.

Guided by all-mode wisdom,
even tiny goodness does not stall,
and can pass beyond
terminal fruit of the two vehicles.

"Expedient means" is re-said:
skillful harmonizing makes attainment possible.
Cause is established for fruit,
and such cause can obtain fruit.

---

## Twenty-Five as Harmonized Cause

These twenty-five are not random checkboxes.
They are harmonized regulation.

By harmonizing them,
one establishes cause
for initial abiding in the Perfect,
and obtains wondrous awakening fruit.

---

## Near and Far

Ten objects are called near:
through contemplation and manifestation,
entry into grade is not far.

Twenty-five factors are called far:
relative to direct true attainment,
their position is preparatory distance.

Near and far are not contradiction.
They are training topology.

---

## Five Categories and Analogical Mapping

The chapter lists five categories,
then gives their generative sequence,
with initial abiding named as destination.

Analogy then maps each cluster:
complete conditions,
rebuking desires,
abandoning hindrances,
regulating five matters,
practicing five dharmas.

Then zhiguan joins the analogy
to full practice-integration.

---

## The Fifth Cluster and Proper Practice

Without aspiration,
without bodily-mental exertion,
without sustained mindfulness,
without expedient skill,
without one-pointedness,
proper zhiguan does not mature.

With delight in cultivation,
diligence day and night,
thought-continuity,
skillful grasp of intent,
and non-divergent one-pointed mind,
proper practice is fulfilled.

---

## Closing Moan

If even shallow worldly meditative work
needs these twenty-five expedients,
all the more the supramundane
Perfect-Sudden path.

So this section is not ornament.
It is load-bearing mercy.
