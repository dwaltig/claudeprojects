## The Question

You're ready to build. But is your **shop** ready?

Before you make a single cut, you need:
-   Clean workspace
-   Tools sharpened
-   Materials gathered
-   Mind focused

Same deal with Zhiguan. Before you start the actual contemplation, you need **25 preparations**—organized into **five groups of five**.

## The 25 Preparations

| Group | What It Covers |
|---|---|
| **1. Five Conditions** | External setup |
| **2. Five Desires** | Gross obstacles to remove |
| **3. Five Hindrances** | Subtle obstacles to remove |
| **4. Five Matters** | Body-mind tuning |
| **5. Five Dharmas** | Mental cultivation |

---

## Group 1: Five Conditions (*Ju Wu Yuan*)

**Your external setup:**

| # | Condition | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Pure Precepts** | Your moral discipline is intact. No guilt dragging. |
| 2 | **Sufficient Clothing/Food** | Basic needs met. Not hungry. Not cold. |
| 3 | **Quiet Dwelling** | A peaceful place. No construction noise. |
| 4 | **Cessation of Affairs** | Worldly business is set aside. Phone off. |
| 5 | **Good Teachers** | Access to someone who knows what they're doing. |

> "No wings, no flight."

## Group 2: Five Desires (*He Wu Yu*)

**Gross obstacles—the five sense hooks:**

| # | Desire | What It Is |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Forms** | Pretty things you want to look at. |
| 2 | **Sounds** | Music, voices, noise. |
| 3 | **Smells** | Perfume, food, flowers. |
| 4 | **Tastes** | Flavor cravings. |
| 5 | **Touches** | Comfort, texture, contact. |

**The Practice:** "Reject" doesn't mean hate. It means:
1.  Notice the desire.
2.  Understand the object isn't inherently pleasurable.
3.  Let go without forcing.

## Group 3: Five Hindrances (*Qi Wu Gai*)

**Subtle obstacles—the mind's static:**

| # | Hindrance | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Desire** | Pulls you toward pleasant things. |
| 2 | **Aversion** | Pushes you away from unpleasant things. |
| 3 | **Sloth** | Makes you dull and sleepy. |
| 4 | **Restlessness** | Makes you jittery and regretful. |
| 5 | **Doubt** | Makes you question everything. |

**Antidotes:**

| Hindrance | Fix |
|---|---|
| Desire | Contemplate impurity. |
| Aversion | Contemplate loving-kindness. |
| Sloth | Contemplate light. |
| Restlessness | Contemplate stillness. |
| Doubt | Contemplate causation. |

## Group 4: Five Matters (*Tiao Wu Shi*)

**Tuning the instrument—body and mind balance:**

| # | Matter | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Food** | Not too much, not too little. |
| 2 | **Sleep** | Not too much, not too little. |
| 3 | **Body** | Correct posture. |
| 4 | **Breath** | Smooth, even, natural. |
| 5 | **Mind** | Neither tense nor slack. |

**The Metaphor:** A lute.
-   **Too tight** → String breaks.
-   **Too loose** → No sound.
-   **Just right** → Music plays.

> "Tune the strings before you play."

## Group 5: Five Dharmas (*Xing Wu Fa*)

**Mental cultivation—building the right mindset:**

| # | Dharma | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Aspiration** | You *want* to do this. |
| 2 | **Effort** | You keep going. |
| 3 | **Mindfulness** | You don't forget. |
| 4 | **Skillful Wisdom** | You know what's good and what's junk. |
| 5 | **One-pointedness** | Your mind is unified. |

**The Progression:**
-   Aspiration → starts the engine.
-   Effort → keeps it running.
-   Mindfulness → keeps you on the road.
-   Wisdom → picks the right turns.
-   One-pointedness → arrives at the destination.

> "No aspiration, no beginning. No one-pointedness, no completion."
