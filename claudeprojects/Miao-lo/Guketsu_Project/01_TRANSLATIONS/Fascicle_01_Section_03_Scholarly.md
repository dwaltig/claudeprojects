後三大章亦准五略後之三略。
> The latter three major chapters also accord with the latter three summaries of the Five Summaries.
其文雖闕於義已足。
> Though their wording is absent, in meaning they are already sufficient.
故託夏末以為闕緣。
> Therefore, the end of the summer retreat is taken as the condition for this omission.
信行圓乘於茲罷唱故云法輪停轉。
> The teaching for faithful practice of the perfect vehicle ceased here, therefore it is said "the Dharma-wheel stopped turning."
被行略周餘止不說故云後分弗宣。
> Since the covered praxis had been outlined sufficiently, the remaining parts were not expounded, therefore it is said "the latter section was not proclaimed."
弗者不也。
> "Fu" means "not."
然挹流尋源下別序也。
> Now, "drawing from the stream and seeking the source" below is the separate preface.
前言通者義通而文別。
> Earlier, what was called "common" is common in meaning but particular in wording.
別語止觀明靜等故。
> Because it uses particular expressions such as "zhi-guan ming-jing."
今別序者意別而存通。
> As for this separate preface, its intention is separate while retaining what is common.
通語二十三師等故。
> Because it uses common expressions such as "the twenty-three masters."
雖通別不同而亦不出師資人法。
> Though common and separate differ, they still do not go beyond persons and Dharma in teacher-disciple transmission.
故通序中止觀秖是師資所聞所說之法。
> Therefore, in the common preface, zhi-guan is simply the Dharma heard and spoken by teacher and disciple.
次舉能聞能說之人。
> Next, it raises the persons who can hear and can speak.
次明聞說若時若處。
> Next, it clarifies when and where this hearing and speaking occurred.
故舉通中所聞之法如香如流。
> Therefore, it cites in the common section the Dharma that was heard, as fragrance and as stream.
令知大覺如根如源。
> This makes one know great awakening as root and as source.
又此別者雖無餘部可望。
> Further, though this separate section has no other treatise to compare with,
師資所承三部不同。
> within teacher-disciple transmission, the three works received are distinct.
頓對餘二故名為別。
> In direct contrast to the other two, it is therefore named "separate."
又此所承與諸師異亦名為別。
> Also, what is transmitted here differs from other masters, and is thus called "separate."
於中先明祖承付法由漸。
> Within this, first it clarifies the patriarchal succession by gradual Dharma-transmission.
若不先指如來大聖無由列於二十三祖。
> If one does not first point to the Great Sage Tathagata, there is no basis for listing the twenty-three patriarchs.
若不列於二十三祖無由指於第十三師。
> If one does not list the twenty-three patriarchs, there is no basis for indicating the thirteenth master.
若不指於第十三師。
> If one does not indicate the thirteenth master,
無由信於衡崖台岳。
> there is no basis for trusting Heng, Ya, Tai, and Yue.
故先譬其由如尋源討根。
> Therefore, its process is first likened to seeking the source and investigating the root.
今之止觀興于像末如流如香。
> The present zhiguan flourishes in the Semblance and Final ages, like a stream and like fragrance.
金口梵音如根如源。
> The Brahma-sound from the Golden Mouth is like root and source.
挹者斟酌也。
> "Yi" means to ladle and measure.
詩云。
> The Odes says:
惟北有斗不可挹酒漿。
> "Only in the north is there the Dipper, yet it cannot ladle ale and wine."
酌其流須尋其濫觴。
> To draw from its flow, one must seek its headwaters.
知其香須討其根本。
> To know its fragrance, one must seek its root and basis.
故大經云。
> Therefore the Great Sutra says:
聞其香氣則知其地當有是藥。
> On smelling its fragrance, one knows that land should have this medicine.
其藥真味停留在山猶如滿月。
> The medicine's true flavor abides in the mountain, like the full moon.
隨其流處有種種名。
> Following where its stream reaches, there are various names.
真味實理也。
> The true flavor is the real principle.
眾名末教也。
> The many names are the latter teachings.
滿月譬實理也。
> The full moon is a metaphor for the real principle.
在山譬理在陰也。
> Being in the mountain is a metaphor for principle abiding in concealment.
如來依理隨機立名。
> The Tathagata establishes names by relying on principle and adapting to capacities.
像末四依弘宣佛化。
> In the Semblance and Final ages, the Four Reliances broadly proclaim Buddha-transformation.
受化稟教須討根源。
> Those who receive transformation and instruction must seek root and source.
若迷於根源則增上濫乎真證。
> If one is deluded about root and source, overestimation corrupts true realization.
若香流失緒則邪說混於大乘。
> If fragrance and stream lose their thread, heterodox claims mix into Mahayana.
由是而知台衡慧文宗于龍樹。
> From this, one knows that Tiantai's Huiwen takes Nagarjuna as ancestral source.
二十三聖繼踵堅林。
> The twenty-three sages followed one another in a firm succession.
實有由也良可信也。
> There truly is a causal line; it is indeed credible.
論曰至次良者欲明付法。
> From "the treatise says" down to "next, liang," it intends to clarify Dharma transmission.
汎引教驗有師無師。
> It broadly cites teachings as evidence for both having a teacher and having no teacher.
言無師者如大論第二云。
> As for no teacher, Great Treatise fascicle two says:
我行無師保志一無等侶。
> In my practice I have no teacher-guardian; my resolve is one, without equal companion.
積一行得佛自然通其道。
> Accumulating the one practice, one attains Buddhahood and naturally penetrates its path.
增一第十五云。
> Ekottarika, fascicle fifteen, says:
阿若等五人問佛。
> Ajnata and four others asked the Buddha:
師為是誰。
> Who is your teacher?
佛答云。
> The Buddha answered:
我亦無師保亦復無等侶。
> I too have no teacher-guardian and likewise no equal companion.
獨等無過者冷而無復溫。
> Unique, equal to none and surpassed by none, cool with no return to heat.
律文大同。
> Vinaya passages are largely the same.
那先經云。
> The Naxian Sutra says:
佛無師成道自悟一切法法華云。
> The Buddha, without teacher, attained the Way and self-awakened to all dharmas; the Lotus says:
佛智無師智。
> Buddha-wisdom is wisdom without teacher.
俗中太師太傅太保皆師義也。
> In secular usage, Grand Preceptor, Grand Tutor, and Grand Guardian all carry the sense of teacher.
次云有師。
> Next it speaks of having a teacher.
受莂等者。
> Receiving prediction and related cases:
莂字謂派莂亦分別。
> The character bie's means branching differentiation, also discrimination.
字書多作別字如瑞應云。
> Lexicons often write it as bie; as Ruijing says:
至于昔者定光佛興時。
> In former times, when Dipankara Buddha appeared,
我為菩薩名曰儒童乃至買華奉定光佛。
> I was a bodhisattva named Rutong, and even bought flowers to offer Dipankara Buddha.
散華供養華住空中。
> Scattering flowers in offering, the flowers remained in space.
佛知其意而讚歎言。
> The Buddha knew his intent and praised, saying:
汝無數劫所學清淨。
> For countless kalpas your training has been pure.
因記之曰。
> Thereupon he gave prediction, saying:
汝自是後九十一劫。
> After this, in ninety-one kalpas,
劫號為賢。
> the kalpa will be named Wise.
汝當作佛名釋迦文。
> you shall become Buddha named Sakyamuni.
乃至身升虛空得無生忍。
> Eventually his body rose into space and he attained patience of non-arising.
論云無師經稱記莂。
> The treatise says no-teacher; sutras call it predictive designation.
書言去復引俗典亦具二義。
> After citing canonical statements, it again cites secular classics, which also contain these two meanings.
生知如無師學成如記莂。
> Innate knowing corresponds to no-teacher; knowledge completed through study corresponds to prediction.
故論語云。
> Thus the Analects says:
生而知之者上。
> Those who know by birth are highest.
學而知之者次。
> Those who know through learning are next.
困而學之又其次也。
> Those distressed yet who learn are next again.
困而不學民斯為下矣。
> Distressed yet not learning: such people are lowest.
良者善也長也。
> Liang means good and also chief.
書雖不論久遠因果。
> Though the classic does not discuss long-range cause and effect,
今且汎引相似之言以證二義於理無失。
> for now it broadly cites similar statements to prove these two meanings; in principle there is no error.
讀此文者應以良字而為句末。
> Readers of this passage should take liang as the end of the sentence.
世有不曉句逗之人以良字為句頭甚為未隱。
> Some in the world do not understand sentence pauses and place liang at sentence-beginning, which is quite inappropriate.
如第二本下句頭復有然字。
> For example, in the second version the next sentence already begins with ran.
豈可讀彼第二本云良然法門等耶。
> How could one read that second version as liang-ran dharma-gate, and so on?
故不可用。
> Therefore that reading cannot be used.
然無師之與記莂約事雖殊其理不二。
> Yet no-teacher and prediction differ in event, while their principle is nondual.
在因必藉師保果滿稱為獨悟。
> At the causal stage one must rely on teacher-guidance; when fruit is full it is called solitary awakening.
以此因果共為諸師所承元祖。
> By this, cause and fruit together serve as the primal ancestor inherited by all masters.
次法門浩妙至藍而青者。
> Next, from "the dharma-gate is vast and subtle" to "blue from indigo":
汎舉法喻問上二途。
> it broadly raises Dharma and analogy to question the above two routes.
人既分於事理因果。
> Since persons are divided by event/principle and cause/fruit,
所證法體亦分二耶。
> is the realized Dharma-body likewise divided in two?
浩者水大貌。
> Hao means the appearance of vast waters.
法既大妙為事為理。
> If the Dharma is great and subtle, is it event or principle?
為天真獨朗者問無師法為從藍而青者問學成法。
> "Naturally true and singly bright" asks the no-teacher Dharma; "blue from indigo" asks Dharma completed through learning.
理非造作故曰天真。
> Principle is uncreated, therefore called naturally true.
證智圓明故云獨朗。
> Realizing wisdom is perfectly bright, therefore called singly luminous.
由師染習故曰從藍由學功遂故曰而青。
> Conditioned through teacher-training, it is called from indigo; accomplished through study, it is called blue.
書云。
> The classic says:
青出於藍而青於藍染使然也。
> Blue comes from indigo yet is bluer than indigo; this is caused by dyeing.
今引染義非引勝藍。
> Now it cites the dyeing meaning, not the "bluer-than-indigo" meaning.
行人若聞至宗元者總答也。
> From "if practitioners hear" to "ancestral source" is the general answer.
宗尊也主也。
> Zong means honored and also primary.
元首也長也。
> Yuan means head and also chief.
若尋所傳法展轉相付乃識能傳人元由宗緒。
> If one traces transmitted Dharma through successive handing-on, one then knows the transmitting persons' primal origin and lineage.
故識一期佛為元由。
> Therefore one knows the Buddha of a given period as the primal source.
方曉今師宗於龍樹。
> Only then does one understand that our present lineage takes Nagarjuna as ancestor.
從大覺至降魔者別答也。
> From "Great Awakening" to "subduing Mara" is the specific answer.
先雙酬兩問大覺義當天真行滿義當記莂。
> First it answers both questions together: Great Awakening corresponds to natural truth; completion of practice corresponds to prediction.
人之與法兩意咸爾。
> For persons and Dharma alike, both meanings are so.
二意兼備師資道成。
> With both meanings complete, teacher-disciple way is accomplished.
故書云。
> Thus the classic says:
崐竹未剪則鳳音不彰。
> If Kun bamboo is uncut, phoenix tones do not manifest.
情性未鍊則神明不發。
> If disposition is unrefined, spiritual clarity does not emerge.
凡情既待鍊而發故真理亦由學而成。
> Since ordinary dispositions emerge through refinement, true principle likewise is accomplished through learning.
覺者詩云有覺德行。
> As for awakening, the Odes says, "there is awakened virtuous conduct."
又云覺者大明也。
> It also says awakening means great brightness.
曉也直也。
> It means understanding and uprightness.
今亦如是。
> Now likewise so.
十號具足種智圓明。
> The ten titles complete, seed-wisdom perfectly bright.
三惑頓盡大夜斯曉。
> The three delusions suddenly exhausted, the great night thereby dawns.
二死永除無復迴曲。
> The two deaths forever removed, no further turning or crookedness.
又覺滿等名為大覺。
> Also, fullness of awakening and so on is called Great Awakening.
四教不同覺智亦異。
> The four teachings differ, and awakening-wisdom also differs.
且寄漸始通總而說略云大覺。
> For now, using gradual beginnings in a broad/general way, it is briefly called Great Awakening.
以覺大故世間中尊。
> Because awakening is great, he is world-honored among beings.
積劫行滿者亦通總而說。
> Accumulated kalpas and completed practice are likewise spoken broadly and generally.
是故不云三阿僧祇及以無量阿僧祇等。
> Therefore it does not state three asamkhyeyas and immeasurable asamkhyeyas, etc.
劫此云時。
> Kalpa here means time.
俱舍等論多以二十增減為一中劫。
> Treatises such as Abhidharmakosa mostly take twenty increase-decrease cycles as one middle kalpa.
八十增減為一大劫。
> Eighty increase-decrease cycles make one great kalpa.
金光明云。
> Golden Light says:
梵天三銖天衣三年一拂。
> Brahma heaven's three-zhu heavenly robe brushes once every three years.
拂盡畟方四十里石以為小劫。
> When it wears out a forty-li square stone, that is one small kalpa.
八十里盡以為中劫。
> Wearing out eighty li makes a middle kalpa.
百二十里盡名為大劫。
> Wearing out one hundred twenty li is called a great kalpa.
不於如此劫數修學不名菩薩。
> Without cultivation over such kalpa counts, one is not called bodhisattva.
又云。
> It also says:
有一里劫二里劫乃至萬里劫。
> There are one-li kalpas, two-li kalpas, up to ten-thousand-li kalpas.
又云。
> It also says:
有大方城周四十里。
> There is a great square city forty li in circumference.
滿中芥子不概令平。
> Fill it with mustard seeds, not leveling it by pressing.
百年取一盡名為劫。
> Taking one every hundred years, when exhausted it is called a kalpa.
經劫無數名阿僧祇。
> Passing through countless kalpas is called asamkhyeya.
委出劫義非文正意故不廣明。
> A detailed exposition of kalpa-meaning is not this passage's main intent, so it is not extensively explained.
涉六年以伏見至降魔者。
> From enduring six years, subduing wrong views, up to subduing Mara:
伏見為調外道降魔為摧天魔。
> Subduing views means taming non-Buddhist doctrines; subduing Mara means crushing the heavenly Mara.
故六年苦行過其所行。
> Therefore the six-year ascetic practice exceeded what others practiced.
先同後異化道宜然。
> First conforming then differing, this is fitting for the transforming path.
故五人中著愛行者而捨之去。
> Hence among the five men, those attached to desire-practice left him.
過六年已食食修禪。
> After six years, he ate food and cultivated meditation.
著見行者又捨之去。
> Those attached to view-practice also left him.
後降天魔樹王成道。
> Later he subdued heavenly Mara and attained the Way beneath the king of trees.
降魔之相廣在諸經。
> The signs of subduing Mara are extensively recorded in various sutras.
且瑞應云。
> For example, Ruijing says:
天魔與佛相難詰。
> Heavenly Mara challenged and questioned the Buddha.
佛云。
> Buddha said:
丈夫會當鬪戰死終不身在為他降。
> A true man should fight even to death and never live only to submit to others.
魔云。
> Mara said:
比丘何求坐樹下樂於林藪毒獸間。

雲起可畏杳冥冥。

佛云。

古有真道佛所行。

吾覩欲盛吞火同棄國如唾無所貪。
> I see desire blazing like swallowing fire; I cast away kingship like spittle, craving nothing.
得王亦有老死憂去此無利勿妄譚。
> Even gaining kingship still has the grief of aging and death; apart from this there is no benefit, so do not speak vainly.
魔云。
> Mara said:
何安坐林而快語委國財位守空閑。

始鹿苑至鶴林者。
> As for from Deer Park at the beginning to Crane Grove at the end:
既成道已說必託處故略舉此始中終三。
> Since after attaining the Way, teaching must rely on places, it briefly cites these three: beginning, middle, and end.
