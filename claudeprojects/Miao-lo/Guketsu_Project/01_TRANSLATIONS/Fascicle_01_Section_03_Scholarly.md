## Translation

### The Five Summaries (五略)

**Text**:
> 何者。大意五略。初發大心期心大處。大處秖是旨歸三德。三德即是究竟荼義。
> *Why is this? The "Great Intention" [chapter] contains Five Summaries. First is **Generating the Great Intention** (*Fa Da Xin*), which anticipates the mind's [arrival at] the Great Abode. The Great Abode is simply the Three Virtues of the Ultimate Consummation (*Zhigui San De*). The Three Virtues are the meaning of the ultimate "Tha" [Nirvana].*

**Commentary**:
Miao-lo explains that the entire *Mohe Zhiguan* is holographically contained in its opening chapter ("The Great Intention"). The "Five Summaries" are not just an introduction; they are the **genetic code** for the entire ten-chapter structure.

1.  **Generating the Great Intention** (*Fa Da Xin* 發大心): The Cause. Identifying the target (The Three Virtues).
2.  **Cultivating the Great Practice** (*Xiu Da Xing* 修大行): The Condition. Specifically, the **Four Samadhis** (*Si Zhong Sanmei* 四種三昧).
    > *Text: 雖復期心五百由旬... 是故勸行四種三昧。*
    > *Although one anticipates the mind [reaching] the 500 yojanas... one must therefore encourage the practice of the Four Samadhis.*
3.  **Realizing the Great Fruit** (*Gan Da Guo* 感大果): The Result.
    > *Text: 故說果報而慰悅之。為令初心聞而策進。*
    > *Therefore, one speaks of the Fruit of Retribution to comfort and gladden them... to cause the initial mind to hear and be spurred forward.*
4.  **Rending the Great Net** (*Lie Da Wang* 裂大網): The Function (Breaking Doubts).
    > *Text: 破謂裂破... 破他疑網... 如繫鳥在籠情無所適。*
    > *"Reviewing" means "Rending." ... Breaking the doubt-net of others... Like a bird bound in a cage, its feelings finding no comfort.*
5.  **Returning to the Great Abode** (*Gui Da Chu* 歸大處): The Ultimate Destination.
    > *Text: 化物既周歸於祕藏... 無始而始... 無終而終。*
    > *Transforming beings being complete, one returns to the Secret Store... Beginningless beginning... Endlessly ending.*

### The Lineage Transmission (師承)

**Text**:
> 金口祖承則人法兼舉。今師祖承則總別重出。
> *The Golden Mouth [Lineage] (Jinkou Zucheng) presents both Person and Dharma together. The Current Master's [Lineage] (Jinshi Zucheng) brings them out again in general and specific.*

**Commentary**:
Miao-lo defends the specific transmission line used by the Tiantai school. He cites the **Twenty-Three Patriarchs** (*Ershisan Zu* 二十三祖), referencing the *Fu Fazang Yinyuan Zhuan* (History of the Transmission of the Dharma Treasury), but with a critical Tiantai modification (often implied as 24 in later computations to include Madhyāntika, though here he sticks to the text).

> *Text: 若不先指如來大聖無由列於二十三祖。若不列於二十三祖無由指於第十三師。若不指於第十三師。無由信於衡崖台岳。*
> *If one does not first point to the Great Sage Tathāgata, there is no way to list the Twenty-Three Patriarchs. If one does not list the Twenty-Three Patriarchs, there is no way to point to the **Thirteenth Master** [Nāgārjuna / Huiwen connection]. If one does not point to the Thirteenth Master, there is no way to have faith in [the Masters of] Heng, Ya, Tai, and Yue [i.e., Huisi and Zhiyi].*

This is the **Chain of Legitimacy**:
1.  **Buddha** (The Source)
2.  **23 Patriarchs** (The Indian Transmission)
3.  **Huiwen / Huisi** (The Chinese Connection)
4.  **Zhiyi** (The Great Master)

**Lineage Polemics**:
Miao-lo explicitly links the transmission to **Dragon Tree** (Nāgārjuna, *Longshu* 龍樹), whom he calls the "High Ancestor" (*Gaozu* 高祖).
> *Text: 今家亦以龍樹為始。是故智者指為高祖。*
> *Our house also takes Nāgārjuna as the beginning. Therefore, the Wise One [Zhiyi] points to him as the High Ancestor.*

## Doctrinal Analysis

### The Paradox of "Summaries" (略)

Miao-lo argues that *Lue* (Summary) does not mean "less." It means "essential."
> *Text: 五略秖是十廣者。*
> *The Five Summaries **are simply** the Ten Extensive [Chapters].*

The relationship is **Non-Dual**.
- **Five Summaries**: The teaching contracted to its essence.
- **Ten Chapters**: The teaching expanded to its function.
- **Example**: The textual metaphor of the "Bag and the Knot" (*Nang Kuo* 囊括).
    > *Text: 如囊有寶繫口人則不知... 釋名為始旨歸為末... 大意如囊有括盛持結束十章之法。*
    > *Like a bag containing jewels; if the mouth is tied, people do not know [what's inside]... The "Explanation of the Name" is the beginning, the "Ultimate Abode" is the end... The Great Intention is like the bag's knot, holding and binding the Dharma of the ten chapters.*

### The "Thirteenth Master" Puzzle

Miao-lo mentions the "Thirteenth Master." In the classic 24-Patriarch count, Nāgārjuna is the 14th. However, in the *Fu Fazang* (which lists 23), he is the 13th? No, he is usually 14th.
*Correction*: The text says "Point to the Thirteenth Master." This might refer to a specific counting method in the Tiantai tradition where Nāgārjuna is pivotal.
*Resolution*: Miao-lo is emphasizing the *link* between the Indian patriarchs and the Chinese masters. By validating the Indian line, he validates Huiwen (who "received" the Dharma from Nāgārjuna via text, not person—a "remote transmission").

## Philological Notes

- **發大心** (*Fa Da Xin*): "Generate the Great Heart/Mind." *Bodhicitta*. In Tiantai, this isn't just a wish; it's the *activation* of the embryonic Buddha-nature.
- **裂大網** (*Lie Da Wang*): "Rend the Great Net." *Lie* = to rip or tear open. *Wang* = the net of doubts (*yi*) and views (*jian*) that traps the bird of wisdom.
- **囊括** (*Nang Kuo*): "Bag-Knotting." A idiom for "encompassing" or "bringing everything together." The "Great Intention" is the drawstring that pulls the entire *Mohe Zhiguan* together. If you lose the drawstring, the jewels (the chapters) spill out and get lost.
- **金口** (*Jin Kou*): "Golden Mouth." Synedoche for the Buddha's own speech. A transmission that is "Golden Mouth" is theoretically unadulterated.

## Translator's Reflection

Miao-lo is doing something very modern here: **Structural Analysis**. He is less interested in the *content* of the lineage (who begat whom) and more interested in the *function* of the lineage (how it acts as an electrical conduit).
He treats the "Five Summaries" as a **diagnostic tool**. If you don't have all five (Intention, Practice, Result, Doubt-Breaking, Return), your practice is incomplete. You might be meditating (Practice), but if you haven't "Rended the Net" (resolved doctrinal doubts), you're just a "bird in a cage."
