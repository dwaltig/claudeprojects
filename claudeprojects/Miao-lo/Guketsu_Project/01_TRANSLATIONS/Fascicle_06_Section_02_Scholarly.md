## The Four Gates: Methods of Entry

### Introduction to the Four Gates

Having established the methods of contemplation (analytical and substantial), the text now addresses the **four gates** (四門, *sì mén*) — four distinct approaches to entering the truth.

**The fundamental question**: Why must we distinguish these four gates when examining the breaking through of delusions?

**The answer**: "**To penetrate the principle, therefore the sixteen gates all break through view and thought**" (為通理故故十六門並破見思).

The principle (*lǐ*, 理) is singular, but the gates of entry are multiple. The **sixteen gates** refer to:
- Four gates for each of the four teachings (Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct, Perfect)
- 4 × 4 = 16 total approaches

All sixteen gates serve the same ultimate purpose: breaking through view-delusion and thought-delusion to realize emptiness.

## The Four Gates of the Tripiṭaka Teaching

### 1. The Gate of Existence (有門)

**Doctrinal foundation**: This gate is based on the *Abhidharma* teachings that establish the existence of dharmas.

**Initial contemplation**: 

The text cites the *Abhidharma* treatises: "**Contemplate that all conditioned dharmas arise from causes and conditions**" (觀一切有為法從因緣生).

This means:
- All phenomena arise through causation
- Nothing exists independently
- Everything is interdependent

**Application to breaking through**:

"**Contemplating in this way breaks through delusions**" (如此下用觀破惑).

By understanding that all dharmas arise from causes and conditions, one realizes:
- No permanent self
- No inherent existence
- All is empty of self-nature

**Historical example**:

"**The five bhikṣus at Deer Park**" (鹿苑下明得益之人).

The Buddha's first five disciples — Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya (阿若憍陳如), Aśvajit (頞鞞), Bhadrika (跋提), Mahānāman (十力迦葉), and Daśabala-Kāśyapa (拘利太子) — all attained realization through this gate.

**The encounter with Śāriputra**:

When Aśvajit (頞鞞) met Śāriputra, he spoke the famous verse:

> "All dharmas arise from conditions,  
> The Tathāgata has explained their causes,  
> And also their cessation —  
> This is what the Great Śramaṇa teaches."

This verse contains three of the Four Noble Truths:
- "Arise from conditions" = **Suffering** (苦諦)
- "Explained their causes" = **Origin** (集諦)  
- "Their cessation" = **Cessation** (滅諦)

Upon hearing this, Śāriputra attained the **fruit of Stream-Entry**.

**The twelve hundred disciples**:

The text mentions "**one thousand two hundred**" (千二百人) — this refers to:
- The three Kāśyapa brothers and their 1,000 disciples
- Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana with their 200 disciples

(Note: The text is missing fifty to make the traditional 1,250, but this is a common textual variation.)

**The necessity of skillful means**:

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* warns: "**The great physician must employ skillful means**" (大論下明用門者善須方便).

Even though this gate leads to realization, one must not become attached to it. The *Prajñāpāramitā* teaches non-attachment (*wú zhuó*, 無著) as its essence.

**If one uses existence, one falls into the trap of existence**.

The same applies to all four gates — each can become an obstacle if grasped.

**Evidence from the *Mahāsaṃnipāta Sūtra***:

The text cites examples of people in the Buddha's time who attained realization through the gate of existence, demonstrating its efficacy when properly applied.

### 2. The Gate of Emptiness (空門)

**Doctrinal foundation**:

"**Therefore it is said: 'Is it old age and death? Or who experiences old age and death?'**" (故彼下證門體).

This refers to the contemplation of the **twelve links of dependent origination** (十二因緣) from the perspective of emptiness.

**The two emptinesses**:

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* explains:

1. **Emptiness of persons** (生空, *shēng kōng*): 
   - "Who experiences old age and death?" — There is no person
   - This refutes the notion of a permanent self

2. **Emptiness of dharmas** (法空, *fǎ kōng*):
   - "Is it old age and death?" — There is no inherent old age and death
   - This refutes the inherent existence of phenomena

**The Great Emptiness Sūtra**:

The Buddha taught this in the village of Gavāṃpati (調牛聚落), calling it the "**Great Emptiness Sūtra**" (大空經) because it contains both emptinesses.

**Clarification on "dharma-emptiness"**:

Some claim that Hīnayāna only teaches person-emptiness, not dharma-emptiness. However, this is a misunderstanding.

**The text clarifies**:

In the Hīnayāna context:
- **Person-emptiness** = emptiness of self and possessions
- **Dharma-emptiness** = emptiness of the five aggregates as inherently existing entities

In the Mahāyāna context:
- **Person-emptiness** = same as above
- **Dharma-emptiness** = emptiness of all phenomena, including nirvāṇa and Buddha-dharmas

**Therefore**: When scriptures say that śrāvakas only attain person-emptiness, this is a **comparative statement** (與奪之言) — giving to one side while taking from another. It does not mean they have no realization of dharma-emptiness at all.

**Subhūti's specialization**:

"**Subhūti's wisdom of emptiness was particularly clear**" (須菩提空智偏明等者).

Though Subhūti was an Arhat like others, his particular strength was in the contemplation of emptiness.

**The stone chamber contemplation**:

When the Buddha descended from Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, all disciples rushed to see him. Subhūti remained in his stone chamber, thinking:

> "Should I go to see the Buddha, or should I not? The Buddha constantly teaches that if one observes the Dharma-body through wisdom, this is the supreme way of seeing the Buddha."

He then contemplated: "This great assembly, though magnificent, is impermanent. All conditioned things return to extinction."

Through this contemplation of impermanence as a gateway, he realized that **all dharmas are empty and without reality**.

At that moment, he attained realization.

Meanwhile, the bhikṣuṇī Utpalavarṇā (蓮華色比丘尼) transformed herself into a wheel-turning king to be first to see the Buddha. But the Buddha said:

> "You were not first to see me. Subhūti was first to see me. Why? Because Subhūti contemplated the emptiness of all dharmas and saw the Dharma-body. This is true offering — the supreme offering. It is not offering to the physical body that constitutes true offering."

**Empowerment in the *Prajñāpāramitā***:

"**The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra* records his empowerment**" (大品被加等者).

The Buddha empowered Subhūti to teach the *Prajñāpāramitā* because:
- Subhūti's realization of emptiness accorded with the *Prajñāpāramitā*
- The Buddha also empowered Śāriputra for his wisdom

The text states: "**Desiring to use the great emptiness to parallel the small emptiness**" (故云欲以大空並小空等).

This means the *Prajñāpāramitā* extensively teaches emptiness, so the Buddha empowered these two disciples — one for emptiness, one for wisdom.

**The necessity of skillful means**:

As with the gate of existence, the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* warns that one must employ skillful means when using this gate, lest attachment to emptiness become an obstacle.

### 3. The Gate of Both Existence and Emptiness (亦有亦空門)

**The third gate** combines the insights of the first two gates, recognizing both the provisional existence of phenomena and their ultimate emptiness.

**Textual note**: The text briefly mentions this gate with the notation "**斥非中盪**" — indicating that this gate sweeps away the extremes of the previous two.

**The principle**: 
- Phenomena provisionally exist (有)
- Yet they are ultimately empty (空)
- Both perspectives are necessary

### 4. The Gate of Neither Existence nor Emptiness (非有非空門)

**The fourth gate** transcends both existence and emptiness, entering the realm of the inexpressible.

**Historical example**:

"**Chāṇakya**" (車匿) — one of the Buddha's attendants.

Before his *parinirvāṇa*, the Buddha instructed Ānanda on four matters, including how to deal with the ill-tempered Chāṇakya:

> "Treat him according to the Brahma-method. If his mind becomes gentle and compliant, teach him the *Nādakātyāyana Sūtra*."

**The teaching**: "**Separate from existence and non-existence, one can attain the Way**" (離有離無乃可得道).

This sūtra teaches:
- Not grasping at existence
- Not grasping at non-existence  
- Transcending both extremes

**Contemplation of the境**:

When contemplating phenomena (*jìng*, 境):
- "**Provisional non-existence is the same as before**" (假無同前)
- One recognizes that both existence and non-existence are provisional designations
- Both are ultimately empty

**The observation method**:

"**Making this contemplation**" (作此觀者) — one applies the fourfold analysis to this gate as well, discovering that neither existence nor non-existence can be found.

**Result**:

"**Contemplating in this way**" (如此下破惑結成) — through this contemplation, one breaks through delusions and achieves realization.

## The Unity of the Four Gates

**The principle**: "**The four gates, though different, all lead to the same principle**" (四門下明門異理同).

**Explanation**:

Though there are four distinct approaches:
- They all aim at the same truth
- They all break through the same delusions
- They all lead to the same realization

**Metaphor**: Like four doors to a single room — the doors are different, but the room is one.

**Scriptural evidence**: The text provides法譬證 (dharma, metaphor, and scriptural proof) to establish this point.

**Resolving disputes**:

"**Relying on principle to resolve disputes**" (依理通諍中) — when different schools argue about which gate is superior, one must return to the principle: all gates lead to the same truth.

**Example of Bhadanta Dharmatrāta**:

Bhadanta Dharmatrāta (跋摩, *Bá Mó*) — a master who came to China during the Liu Song dynasty and resided at Jetavana Monastery.

Before his death, he left a letter describing his realization, stating he had attained the second fruit. He wrote forty-six verses, including:

> "That Abhidharma speaks of the five-cause dharma,  
> The true meaning cultivates wisdom,  
> The name-giver cannot see it...  
> Various treatises have different approaches,  
> But the principle of cultivation is not two."

**The point**: Though Bhadanta Dharmatrāta followed the *Abhidharma* (which emphasizes the gate of existence), and others followed the *Satyasiddhi Śāstra* (which emphasizes emptiness), both attained realization.

**The error**: Some criticized those who followed different gates, saying they could not attain the Way. This is mistaken.

**The truth**: "**True principle is silent and empty**" (真諦寂寥等非偈文也) — the ultimate truth transcends all conceptual frameworks. Different gates are merely skillful means.
