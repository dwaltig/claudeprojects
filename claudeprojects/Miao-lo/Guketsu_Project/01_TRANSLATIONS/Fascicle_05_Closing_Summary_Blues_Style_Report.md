## Fascicle_05_Closing_Summary_Blues.md

### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.6/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "Completion here means... not triumphal endpoint." `{DOCTRINE: preserves non-finality warning}`
- "self-reference in refined disguise" `{LEXICON: concise subtle-obstacle unifier}`
- "self-honesty becomes central method" `{RHYTHM: practical advanced emphasis}`
- "release path-ownership itself" `{DOCTRINE: retains final release logic}`
- "No identity to defend" `{RHYTHM: strong contemplative closure}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Recap-heavy explanatory close | Compressed doctrinal synthesis with action steps |
| Long quotations and paraphrase loops | Short-form retention of key release progression |
| Static summary tables | Dynamic progression/continuation framing |
| Broad future-oriented notes | Precise handoff to next fascicles |

### 4. Notes
- Closing now matches the cadence and density of Fascicles 3-4 rewrites.
- Good sequential handoff for immediate continuation into Fascicle 6.
