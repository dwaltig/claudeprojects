## When Afflictions Take Over

The **Afflictions Object** (煩惱境) shows up when strong emotions—greed, anger, delusion—won't go away through aggregate contemplation alone.

Miao-lo's point:
> "This isn't a failure. It's a natural development for practitioners with deep karmic roots in affliction. When it shows up, it becomes the main object."

---

## Two Main Types

| Type | Number | What It Is |
|---|---|---|
| **Root Afflictions** | 6 | Primary defilements |
| **Secondary Afflictions** | 20 | Derivative defilements |

## The Six Root Afflictions

### 1. Greed (貪)

**What it is**: Craving, desire, attachment to pleasant stuff

**How it shows up in practice**:
-   Wanting pleasant meditative states
-   Attached to spiritual experiences
-   Craving attainment

**How to work with it**:
1.  Observe greed arising
2.  See it's empty
3.  See the object of greed is empty
4.  Realize greed itself is Buddha-nature

> "Greed isn't separate from emptiness. See greed clearly, you see the Dharma-realm."

### 2. Anger (瞋)

**What it is**: Aversion, hostility, rejection of unpleasant stuff

**How it shows up in practice**:
-   Frustrated with lack of progress
-   Aversion to obstacles
-   Angry at distractions
-   Hostile toward difficult teachings

**How to work with it**:
1.  Observe anger arising
2.  See it has no fixed essence
3.  See the object of anger is empty
4.  Realize anger is wisdom's energy distorted

> "Anger is fire. It can burn or illuminate. Seen as empty, anger becomes the fire of wisdom."

---

### 3. Delusion (癡)

**What it is**: Ignorance, confusion, not seeing things as they are

**How it shows up in practice**:
-   Confused about the method
-   Can't tell truth from delusion
-   Misinterpreting experiences
-   Clinging to wrong views

**How to work with it**:
1.  Recognize delusion is present
2.  Study the teachings
3.  Contemplate causation
4.  Realize even delusion is empty

> "Delusion is darkness. No substance. When wisdom's light shines, darkness disappears."

---

### 4. Pride (慢)

**What it is**: Arrogance, sense of superiority

**Seven types**:
| Type | What It Looks Like |
|---|---|
| Simple | "I'm better than equals" |
| Greater | "I'm better than superiors" |
| Pride of pride | "I'm the absolute best" |
| Self-pride | "I am" (attachment to self) |
| Inferior | "I'm only slightly worse" |
| False | Pride in non-attainments |
| Perverse | Pride in wrong things |

**How it shows up in practice**:
-   Pride in spiritual attainments
-   Comparing to others
-   Attached to your own understanding
-   Dismissing other teachings

**How to work with it**:
1.  Study Six Identities (know where you actually are)
2.  Contemplate elements (body is just earth, water, fire, wind)
3.  Serve others (cultivate humility)
4.  Realize pride is empty

> "Pride is the last chain. Even advanced practitioners watch for it. Antidote: see all beings are inherently Buddha."

---

### 5. Doubt (疑)

**What it is**: Uncertainty, lack of confidence

**How it shows up in practice**:
-   Questioning if the method works
-   Uncertain about progress
-   Wavering between approaches
-   Over-analyzing

**How to work with it**:
1.  Study scriptures
2.  Get guidance from teachers
3.  Contemplate causation (see the logic)
4.  Develop faith through practice

> "Doubt is standing at a crossroads. Pick a path and walk it. Standing still gets you nowhere."

---

### 6. Wrong Views (惡見)

**What it is**: Mistaken intellectual understandings

**Five types**:
| Type | Error |
|---|---|
| View of self | Believing in permanent self |
| Extreme views | Eternalism or nihilism |
| Wrong views | Denying causality |
| View-attachment | Clinging to inferior views as supreme |
| Precept-attachment | Clinging to wrong practices |

**How it shows up in practice**:
-   Misunderstanding emptiness as nihilism
-   Clinging to one-sided views
-   Attached to concepts
-   Mistaking technique for realization

**How to work with it**:
1.  Study Middle Way (avoid extremes)
2.  Deconstruct all views (Mode 4)
3.  Contemplate Three Truths
4.  Realize even views are empty

> "Views are chains. Even golden chains bind. Middle Way is freedom from all views."

## The Twenty Secondary Afflictions

These come from the six root afflictions:

**Small (10)**: Anger, resentment, concealment, spite, jealousy, stinginess, deceit, fraud, arrogance, harmfulness

**Medium (2)**: Shamelessness, lack of conscience

**Great (8)**: Restlessness, torpor, disbelief, laziness, carelessness, forgetfulness, distraction, non-discernment

---

## Applying Ten Modes to Afflictions

### Mode 1: Contemplate the Inconceivable

See the affliction as Three Truths:
-   **Empty**: No inherent existence
-   **Conventional**: Appears anyway
-   **Middle**: Neither empty nor existent

> "See anger as Three Truths, anger becomes the Dharma-realm."

### Mode 2: Generate Bodhi-Mind

**Vow**: "I'll help all beings who suffer from this affliction."

Transforms it from personal problem to universal concern.

### Mode 3: Stabilize

Use the affliction as the object:
-   **Zhi**: Calm while affliction is present
-   **Guan**: Observe its nature

### Mode 4: Break Through

Deconstruct views:
-   "This affliction is mine" → empty
-   "This affliction is real" → empty
-   "I must eliminate it" → empty
-   "Afflictions are obstacles" → empty

### Mode 5: Discern

**What opens**: Seeing afflictions as empty, recognizing them as Buddha-nature, using them as the path

**What blocks**: Suppressing, indulging, identifying with them

---

## The Perfect Teaching's View

Afflictions aren't obstacles to remove. They're **Buddha-nature to recognize**.

### Three Levels

| Level | View | Practice |
|---|---|---|
| **Tripiṭaka** | Afflictions are enemies | Eliminate them |
| **Shared/Distinct** | Afflictions are empty | See through them |
| **Perfect** | Afflictions are Buddha-nature | Recognize them |

### The Key

> "Afflictions and Bodhi aren't two. See afflictions clearly, you see Buddha-nature. Not suppression. Not transformation. Recognition."

---

## Luthier's Summary

Working with Afflictions Object:
1.  Recognize which affliction showed up
2.  Classify it (root or secondary)
3.  Apply Ten Modes
4.  Realize afflictions are Buddha-nature

**Miao-lo's point**:
> "Practitioners who work deeply with Afflictions Object realize afflictions are the swiftest path. Why? They reveal attachment most clearly. When attachment is seen, it dissolves."
