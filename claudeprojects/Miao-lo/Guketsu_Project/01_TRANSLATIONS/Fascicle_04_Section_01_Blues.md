## Opening Word

When afflictions surge
and aggregate contemplation alone
does not settle them,
afflictions become the object.

Not proof of failure.
A required turn in training.

---

## Core Classification

Two layers are marked:
root afflictions and secondary afflictions.

Root set drives the pattern.
Secondary set proliferates expression.

---

## Six Root Afflictions

Greed:
craving and grasping,
including spiritual craving.

Anger:
aversion and hostility,
including frustration with practice.

Delusion:
confusion about method,
cause-effect,
and true orientation.

Pride:
stage-inflation,
comparison,
self-hardening.

Doubt:
hesitation,
method-fracture,
confidence collapse.

Wrong views:
one-sided conceptual fixation,
including nihilistic or eternalist drift.

---

## Working Principle

Do not suppress.
Do not indulge.
Do not identify.

Observe arising.
See emptiness of affliction.
See emptiness of object.
Recover middle-way function.

---

## Ten-Mode Application Signal

Use inconceivable contemplation
on the affliction itself.

Keep bodhi intention active
so affliction-work
serves all beings,
not private self-protection.

Stabilize mind in the heat.
Break attached views about the affliction.
Discern what opens and obstructs.

---

## Perfect-Teaching Turn

Affliction is not outside
buddha-nature field.

When seen with three-truth clarity,
affliction is no longer enemy-material,
but disclosure-material.

---

## Closing Moan

Same fire that burns
can illuminate.

Right view,
right method,
right release:
affliction becomes path.
