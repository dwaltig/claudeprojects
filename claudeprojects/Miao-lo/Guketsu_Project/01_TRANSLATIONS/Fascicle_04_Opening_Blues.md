## Opening Word

Fascicle 3 gave foundation.
Fascicle 4 turns that foundation
into depth-work.

Same road,
but subtler terrain.

---

## Three Pressures in Advanced Practice

First:
conditional objects arise.
Not always,
but when they rise,
method must be precise.

Second:
subtle attachments remain.
Not only to things,
but to emptiness,
attainment,
method,
and even non-attachment.

Third:
integration is required.
Ten modes must move
from deliberate technique
to lived spontaneity.

## What This Fascicle Develops

Detailed work on key conditional objects.
Refined use of ten modes.
Resolution of deeper obstacles.

The point is not novelty.
The point is depth of embodiment.

---

## Systematic and Flexible Use

Beginners often need
full ordered application.

Advanced practitioners
apply what is needed
without losing whole-method integrity.

So flexibility here
is not randomness.
It is matured precision.

---

## Integration Signal

When stopping and contemplating
no longer feel split,
practice and daily life
stop being two arenas.

Mode 1 becomes background.
Bodhi intention stays active.
Other modes arise as needed.

---

## Closing Moan

Do not seek hard objects.
Do not avoid hard objects.

When they rise,
recognize and work them.
When they fade,
do not crave their return.

That is how depth begins.
