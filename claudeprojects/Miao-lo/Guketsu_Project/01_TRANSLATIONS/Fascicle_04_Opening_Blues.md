## The Shift

Fascicle 3 was **learning the method**. Fascicle 4 is **deepening the method**.

You've got the basics:
-   Object 1 (Aggregates) — the foundation
-   Ten Modes — the tools
-   Overview of Objects 2-10

Now you go deeper.

## What Fascicle 4 Covers

| Theme | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Detailed Objects** | Deep dive into Objects 2-6 |
| **Advanced Modes** | Subtle applications, refinements |
| **Complex Obstacles** | Harder problems, deeper fixes |

---

## Why You Need Advanced Practice

After the basics, you hit **three challenges**:

### 1. Conditional Objects Show Up

Not everyone gets Objects 2-10. But if they show up, you need to know how to work with them.

> "Object 1 is learning to walk. Conditional objects are learning to run, climb, dance. Each needs its own skill."

### 2. Subtle Attachments Remain

Even after breakthrough, **subtle stuff** lingers:
-   Attachment to emptiness
-   Attachment to meditative states
-   Attachment to the method
-   Attachment to non-attachment

### 3. Integration Is Required

The Ten Modes need to become **spontaneous**:
-   From technique → nature
-   From effort → effortlessness
-   From practice → realization

## Fascicle 3 vs. Fascicle 4

| Aspect | Fascicle 3 | Fascicle 4 |
|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Foundation | Depth |
| **Objects** | Object 1 (detailed), 2-10 (overview) | Objects 2-10 (detailed) |
| **Modes** | Complete method | Advanced applications |
| **Obstacles** | Common problems | Complex problems |
| **Level** | Beginning → intermediate | Intermediate → advanced |

## Key Themes

### Theme 1: Afflictions Object (煩惱境)

**When it shows up**: Strong emotions that won't go away through aggregate contemplation.

**What you learn**:
-   Different types of afflictions
-   Specific methods for each
-   Afflictions as Buddha-nature

> "In the Perfect Teaching, afflictions aren't obstacles to remove. They're Buddha-nature to recognize."

### Theme 2: Illness Object (病患境)

**When it shows up**: Physical sickness messing with practice.

**What you learn**:
-   Four types of illness
-   Specific remedies
-   Using illness as a teacher
-   Health and sickness aren't two

> "Illness shows where you're attached to the body. See it clearly, illness becomes medicine."

### Theme 3: Karma and Demons (業相境・魔事境)

**When they show up**: Past stuff or Māra showing up during practice.

**What you learn**:
-   Telling karmic visions from real insight
-   Four types of Māra in detail
-   Protective practices
-   Ultimate remedy: see it all as empty

> "Karma and Māra have no power over emptiness. They're shadows—look substantial, but empty."

### Theme 4: Meditative States (禪定境)

**When it shows up**: You hit dhyāna or other deep states.

**What you learn**:
-   Four dhyānas and four formless absorptions
-   Danger of getting attached to bliss
-   Dhyāna vs. prajñā
-   Using meditative states as objects

> "Dhyāna is concentration. Prajñā is wisdom. Concentration without wisdom = blind. Wisdom without concentration = unstable. Perfect Teaching unites both."

## Advanced Application of Ten Modes

Fascicle 3: **Systematic** (apply all ten in order)
Fascicle 4: **Flexible** (apply only what's needed)

| Approach | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Systematic** | Beginning | All ten modes in order |
| **Flexible** | Advanced | Only the modes you need |

**Miao-lo's point**:
> "Sharp practitioners: Mode 1 might be enough. Average: need 1-5. Obstacles: need 6-7. Everyone: must understand 8-10."

### Integration

At advanced levels, the Ten Modes aren't **ten separate things**. They're **one integrated awareness**:

-   Mode 1 (Inconceivable) = constant background
-   Mode 2 (Bodhi-Mind) = constant motivation
-   Mode 3 (Stabilize) = effortless
-   Modes 4-10 = arise spontaneously as needed

## Luthier's Key Points

### On Conditional Objects
> "Don't seek them. Don't avoid them. When they show up, recognize them. When they're gone, don't miss them."

### On Advanced Practice
> "Difference between beginning and advanced isn't the method—it's the depth. Beginner applies modes deliberately. Advanced practitioner embodies them naturally."

### On Integration
> "When Zhi and Guan are fully integrated, there's no 'practice' and 'non-practice.' Every moment is contemplation. Every action is the path."
