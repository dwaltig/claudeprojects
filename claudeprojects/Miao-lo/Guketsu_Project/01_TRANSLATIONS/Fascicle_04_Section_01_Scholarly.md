## Introduction: When Afflictions Become the Object

The **Afflictions Object** (煩惱境 *Fan Nao Jing*) arises when strong afflictions—greed, anger, delusion—cannot be resolved through aggregate contemplation alone. This is the second of the Ten Objects and the first of the conditional objects.

Miao-lo emphasizes:
> "The Afflictions Object is not a failure of practice. It is a natural development for practitioners with deep karmic roots in affliction. When it arises, it becomes the primary object of contemplation."

## Classification of Afflictions

### The Two Main Categories

| Category | Chinese | Number | Nature |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Root Afflictions** | 根本煩惱 (*Gen Ben Fan Nao*) | 6 | Primary defilements |
| **Secondary Afflictions** | 隨煩惱 (*Sui Fan Nao*) | 20 | Derivative defilements |

## The Twenty Secondary Afflictions (隨煩惱)

These arise from the six root afflictions and include:

### Small Secondary Afflictions (10)

### Medium Secondary Afflictions (2)
Shamelessness, lack of conscience

### Great Secondary Afflictions (8)
Restlessness, torpor, disbelief, laziness, carelessness, forgetfulness, distraction, non-discernment

---

## Applying the Ten Modes to Afflictions

### Mode 1: Contemplate the Inconceivable

**See the affliction as the Three Truths**:
-   **Empty**: The affliction has no inherent existence
-   **Conventional**: The affliction provisionally appears
-   **Middle**: The affliction is neither empty nor existent

> "When you see anger as the Three Truths, anger becomes the Dharma-realm."

### Mode 2: Generate Bodhi-Mind

**Vow**: "I vow to help all beings who suffer from this affliction."

This transforms the affliction from a personal problem into a universal concern.

### Mode 3: Stabilize the Mind

**Use the affliction as the object**:
-   **Zhi**: Calm the mind while the affliction is present
-   **Guan**: Observe the nature of the affliction

### Mode 4: Break Through

**Deconstruct views about the affliction**:
-   "This affliction is mine" → empty
-   "This affliction is real" → empty
-   "I must eliminate this affliction" → empty
-   "Afflictions are obstacles" → empty

### Mode 5: Discern Openness and Obstruction

**What opens the way**:
-   Seeing afflictions as empty
-   Recognizing afflictions as Buddha-nature
-   Using afflictions as the path

**What obstructs**:
-   Suppressing afflictions
-   Indulging afflictions
-   Identifying with afflictions

## The Perfect Teaching's View of Afflictions

In the Perfect Teaching, afflictions are not obstacles to be removed but **Buddha-nature to be recognized**.

### The Three Levels of Understanding

| Level | View | Practice |
|---|---|---|
| **Tripiṭaka** | Afflictions are enemies | Eliminate them |
| **Shared/Distinct** | Afflictions are empty | See through them |
| **Perfect** | Afflictions are Buddha-nature | Recognize them |

### The Key Insight

> "Afflictions and Bodhi are not two. When you see afflictions clearly, you see Buddha-nature. This is not suppression. This is not transformation. This is recognition."

---

## Summary

The Afflictions Object requires:
1.  **Recognition** of which affliction has arisen
2.  **Classification** (root or secondary)
3.  **Application** of the Ten Modes
4.  **Realization** that afflictions are Buddha-nature

**Miao-lo's final point**:
> "The practitioner who works with the Afflictions Object deeply will realize that afflictions are the swiftest path to enlightenment. Why? Because they reveal attachment most clearly. When attachment is seen, it dissolves."
