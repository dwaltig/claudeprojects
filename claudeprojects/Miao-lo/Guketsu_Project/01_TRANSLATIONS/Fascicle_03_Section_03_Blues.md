## The Reality

You're practicing. Things go wrong. That's normal.

Obstacles aren't failures. They're **part of the process**. The key is knowing what's wrong and how to fix it.

## Obstacle 1: Drowsiness (昏沈)

### What It Looks Like
-   Mind gets foggy
-   Can't stay alert
-   Fall asleep during practice

### Why It Happens

-   Tired or bad diet
-   Attached to peaceful states

### The Fix

| Method | What to Do |
|---|---|
| **More Guan** | Shift to analytical contemplation |
| **Contemplate light** | Visualize brightness to wake up |
| **Stand up** | Walk or stand instead of sitting |
| **Fix sleep** | Get enough rest, but not too much |
| **Remember urgency** | Life is short, practice now |
