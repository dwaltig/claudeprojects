## Opening Word

Obstacles do not prove failure.
They reveal where practice is unstable.

So this section trains diagnosis:
recognize,
trace cause,
apply remedy,
release.

---

## Dullness and Restlessness

Dullness:
heavy, cloudy, fading presence.
Often from excess calming,
fatigue,
or attachment to peace.

Restlessness:
scattered, jumpy, unsettled.
Often from excess analysis,
unsettled desire,
or poor regulation.

Remedy principle:
rebalance stopping and contemplating.
Energize when collapsed.
Settle when agitated.

---

## Attachment to Meditative Bliss

Pleasant states arise,
then clinging sneaks in.

Bliss is conditioned,
not final liberation.

So apply impermanence,
return bodhi-vow,
and release attachment to the state.

---

## Doubt and Pride

Doubt fractures continuity,
keeps practice switching lanes.

Pride inflates partial attainment
into imagined completion.

Remedy principle:
study,
teacher guidance,
stage discernment,
humility through service and correction.

---

## Fear, Pain, and Disturbance

Fear often comes
when emptiness is misread as annihilation.

Physical pain can arise
from method imbalance,
health factors,
or karmic ripening.

Disturbing experiences may appear.

Remedy principle:
do not dramatize.
Do not chase.
Do not flee.
Return to contemplation,
apply practical supports,
seek guidance where needed.

---

## Operating Formula

Every obstacle:
1. Recognize clearly.
2. Understand likely cause.
3. Apply matched remedy.
4. Release when it dissolves.

No obstacle is wasted
if met with right view and right method.

---

## Closing Moan

What interrupts practice
can become the road itself.

Handled rightly,
obstacle becomes fuel,
and the gate moves forward.
