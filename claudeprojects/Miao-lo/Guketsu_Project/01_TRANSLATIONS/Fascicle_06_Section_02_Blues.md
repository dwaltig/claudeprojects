## The Four Gates: Different Doors, Same Room

### Why Four Gates?

You've got **one truth**. But you've got **four ways in**.

Miao-lo says: "**To penetrate the principle, the sixteen gates all break through delusions**."

**Sixteen gates?**

Yeah. Four gates for each of the four teachings (Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct, Perfect). 4 × 4 = 16.

But don't get hung up on the math. The point is: **Different doors. Same room.**

---

## Gate 1: The Gate of Existence (有門)

### The Setup

This gate says: "**Everything arises from causes and conditions**."

You look at the guitar. You see: wood, strings, glue, lacquer. All put together. **Causes and conditions**.

Nothing exists on its own. Everything's **interdependent**.

### The Realization

When you see that everything arises from causes and conditions, you realize:

- **No permanent self**
- **No inherent existence**
- **All is empty of self-nature**

### The First Five

The Buddha's **first five disciples** at Deer Park got it through this gate.

One of them, **Aśvajit** (頞鞞), met **Śāriputra** and said:

> "All dharmas arise from conditions,  
> The Tathāgata has explained their causes,  
> And also their cessation —  
> This is what the Great Śramaṇa teaches."

Śāriputra heard that and **boom** — Stream-Enterer.

### The Warning

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* says: "**The great physician must use what works**."

Don't get **attached** to existence. If you use existence and then **grasp** at existence, you're stuck.

The gate works. But don't make it a cage.

## Gate 2: The Gate of Emptiness (空門)

### The Setup

This gate says: "**Who experiences old age and death?**"

You look at the guitar. You ask: "Who's playing? Where's the player?"

**No player**. Just the sound.

### The Two Emptinesses

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* breaks it down:

1. **Emptiness of persons** (生空): There's no permanent "you."
2. **Emptiness of dharmas** (法空): There's no inherent "thing."

### The Clarification

Some people say: "Hīnayāna only teaches person-emptiness. Mahāyāna teaches dharma-emptiness."

**Wrong**.

Hīnayāna teaches **both**. It's just that:

- In Hīnayāna, "dharma-emptiness" means the five aggregates are empty.
- In Mahāyāna, "dharma-emptiness" means **everything** is empty — even nirvāṇa, even Buddha-dharmas.

So when scriptures say śrāvakas only get person-emptiness, that's a **comparison**. It doesn't mean they don't get dharma-emptiness at all.

### Subhūti's Realization

**Subhūti** (須菩提) was the **emptiness guy**. His specialty.

When the Buddha came down from Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, everyone rushed to see him. Subhūti stayed in his stone chamber.

He thought: "Should I go see the Buddha? Or should I stay here and contemplate?"

He contemplated: "This assembly is impermanent. All conditioned things return to extinction."

Through that contemplation, he realized: **All dharmas are empty**.

The Buddha said: "Subhūti saw me first. Why? Because he saw the **Dharma-body**. That's the real seeing."

### The Warning

Same as before. Don't get **attached** to emptiness. If you grasp at emptiness, you're stuck.

The gate works. But don't make it a cage.

## Gate 3: Both Existence and Emptiness (亦有亦空門)

### The Setup

This gate says: "**Both**."

Things **exist** provisionally. But they're **empty** ultimately.

You look at the guitar. It's **there** (existence). But it's **empty** of inherent nature (emptiness).

### The Point

You need **both perspectives**.

If you only see existence, you're stuck in form.  
If you only see emptiness, you're stuck in void.

**Both**. That's the gate.

---

## Gate 4: Neither Existence nor Emptiness (非有非空門)

### The Setup

This gate says: "**Neither**."

Not existence. Not emptiness. **Beyond both**.

You look at the guitar. It's not "there." It's not "not there." It's... **beyond words**.

### The Teaching

The Buddha told Ānanda: "When Chāṇakya's mind becomes gentle, teach him the *Nādakātyāyana Sūtra*."

That sūtra says: "**Separate from existence and non-existence, one can attain the Way**."

Don't grasp existence. Don't grasp non-existence. **Let go of both**.

### The Realization

When you let go of both, you see: **There's nothing to grasp**.

Not because there's nothing there. But because **grasping itself is the problem**.

## The Unity: Four Doors, One Room

### The Point

Miao-lo says: "**The four gates, though different, all lead to the same principle**."

Different doors. Same room.

### The Metaphor

Like a house with four doors. North door. South door. East door. West door.

You can enter through any door. But once you're inside, **it's the same room**.

### The Dispute

People argue: "My gate is better than your gate!"

**Wrong**.

All gates work. The principle is **one**.

### The Example: Bhadanta Dharmatrāta

There was a master named **Bhadanta Dharmatrāta** (跋摩). He followed the *Abhidharma* (existence gate).

Other people followed the *Satyasiddhi Śāstra* (emptiness gate).

Some people said: "Your gate doesn't work! Only my gate works!"

Bhadanta Dharmatrāta said: "**Various treatises have different approaches, but the principle of cultivation is not two**."

**Translation**: Different methods. Same truth.

### The Truth

**True principle is silent and empty**. It's beyond all frameworks.

The gates are just **skillful means**. They're tools. They're not the destination.

## The Luthier's Take

You've got **four ways to tune the guitar**:

1. **Existence Gate**: Tune by the frets. Measure the distances. Calculate the ratios.
2. **Emptiness Gate**: Tune by ear. Forget the frets. Just listen.
3. **Both Gate**: Use the frets **and** your ear. Both matter.
4. **Neither Gate**: Forget the frets. Forget your ear. Just **play**.

All four work. All four get you to the same place: **in tune**.

The mistake is thinking: "My way is the only way."

**Wrong**.

Your way is **your** way. But it's not the **only** way.

The room is one. The doors are many.

Pick a door. Walk through. Don't argue about which door is best.
