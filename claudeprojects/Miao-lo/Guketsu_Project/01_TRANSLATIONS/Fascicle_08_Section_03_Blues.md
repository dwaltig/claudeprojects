## Object 4: The Karma Object (業境)

### The Setup

You're sitting. Mind's quiet. Body's settled. And then:

Visions appear. Old guilt rises. Faces from decades ago. Things you did. Things that were done to you.

**That's the Karma Object.**

Practice doesn't just work on the present. It stirs up the past.

---

## How Karma Surfaces

### The Mechanism

> "Due to the power of contemplative practice, evil karma from past lives suddenly manifests in the present."

**Translation**: The deeper you go, the more stuff comes up.

Miao-lo gives the metaphor:

> "Like wind blowing earth, dust suddenly rises. The wind does not create the dust; the dust was already in the earth."

**Practice is the wind.** The karma was always there. Practice just makes it visible.

## Three Types of Karma

### What You're Dealing With

**1. Fixed Karma (定業)**

Heavy stuff. Must ripen. The tradition lists the five worst:
- Killing your father
- Killing your mother
- Killing an arhat
- Shedding Buddha's blood
- Splitting the community

If you've done these, the karma is fixed. It must be experienced.

**2. Unfixed Karma (不定業)**

Lighter stuff. Can be changed. This is where practice actually shifts things.

**3. Present-Life Karma (現業)**

What you're making right now. Still in motion. Still adjustable.

## Signs of Karmic Manifestation

### What Shows Up

When karma surfaces during practice, it shows in three ways:

**1. Visions (見業相)**

You see things. Hell realms. Hungry ghosts. Animals. Or: heavenly palaces, pure lands.

| Vision | Indicates |
|--------|-----------|
| Dark, terrifying | Unwholesome karma surfacing |
| Light, beautiful | Wholesome karma surfacing |

**Either way, don't cling.** It's just old stuff processing.

**2. Dream Signs (夢中業相)**

The tradition says purification shows in dreams:
- Vomiting bad food (expelling negativity)
- Drinking milk or yogurt (receiving purity)
- Seeing sun or moon (illumination)
- Flying through sky (transcendence)
- Defeating dark figures (overcoming death)
- Seeing monks and nuns (connection to sangha)
- Climbing mountains (spiritual ascent)

**The strange one**: Dreaming of beheading indicates exhaustion of afflictions.

**3. Emotional Surges (心業發)**

Sudden waves of guilt, fear, remorse. No apparent cause. Old karma surfacing.

## The Four Powers of Purification (四力)

### How to Work It

The tradition gives four powers:

**Power 1: Revulsion (追悔力)**

> "Regarding the created sins, generate deep shame and remorse."

**What it means**: Acknowledge what you did. No rationalization. No denial. Feel the weight of it.

**Power 2: Antidote (對治力)**

> "Cultivate various wholesome dharmas to extinguish evil karma."

**What it means**: Do positive actions. Study profound teaching. Meditate on emptiness. Offer at stupas.

**Power 3: Restraint (遮止力)**

> "Vow never to repeat the action."

**What it means**: Commit. Bind yourself. "I will not do this again."

**Power 4: Support (依止力)**

> "Take refuge in the Three Treasures and generate bodhicitta."

**What it means**: Don't try to do this alone. Rely on Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. Generate the awakening-mind.

The tradition says bodhicitta is like "the fire at the end of an aeon" — it can consume enormous amounts of negative karma.

## Applying the Ten Modes to Karma

### Mode 1: The Inconceivable Object (觀不思議境)

> "Contemplate that karma is precisely the dharma-realm. The nature of karma is fundamentally empty."

**What it means**: Karma functions. But search for it — where is it? Who did it? Who receives it?

> "Karma is like a dream or illusion. Although it has function, it has no real substance."

**The Indian teaching agrees**: "While karma and its ripening function, no intrinsic 'thing' moves from this life to the next."

### Mode 2: Arousing the Mind (發菩提心)

> "Both I and all sentient beings have such karmic obstacles. May all be liberated."

**What it means**: Your karma connects you to everyone who's ever made mistakes. Universal compassion arises.

### Mode 3: Settling the Mind (善巧安心)

> "Settle the mind upon karmic signs. Neither startled nor frightened, neither pleased nor worried."

**What it means**: Dark vision? Don't panic. Light vision? Don't cling. Just watch.

## The Ultimate Purification

### Seeing Through

> "The nature of karma is fundamentally empty. What need is there to extinguish it further?"

**Wait — isn't that dangerous?**

Miao-lo immediately guards against misunderstanding:

> "This does not mean indulgence. It is because one truly sees that karma is empty."

**Translation**: This is genuine realization, not philosophical dodge. You look at the karma. You search for it. You don't find anything solid.

The Indian tradition says: "True purification is seeing 'transgression as no-transgression.'"

**Not denial.** Not justification. Just: seeing what isn't there.

## Heavy Cases

### When It's Serious

For the really heavy stuff — the five heinous acts — the tradition prescribes intensified methods:

1. **Recitation of Buddha names**: The 35 Buddhas. The Medicine Buddha.
2. **Dharani recitation**: Protective mantras. The Cundī Dhāraṇī.
3. **Invoking Ākāśagarbha**: For confession of root downfalls.
4. **Stupa offerings**: Even a single flower can prevent lower rebirth.

**The point**: Heavy karma requires heavy antidotes. Don't try to skip steps.

## The Luthier's Take

### The Songs You Wish You Hadn't Written

Every songwriter has them. Songs from a bad place. Songs that hurt someone. Songs you're not proud of.

You've got three options:

**Option 1**: Pretend they don't exist. Never play them. Never mention them.
Result: They keep haunting you.

**Option 2**: Wallow in them. Beat yourself up forever.
Result: You can't move forward.

**Option 3**: Acknowledge them. Learn from them. Keep writing.
Result: The old songs become part of the whole.

That's the karma work. Not erasing the past. Not being crushed by it. Just: integrating it.

> "Whatever the nature of afflictions, that is the nature of bodhi."

The same material. Different relationship.

## The Three Internal Obstacles: Complete

### What Fascicle 8 Covered

| Object | Domain | The Problem | The Work |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Affliction | Mind | Poisons intensify | Apply antidotes / See empty nature |
| Illness | Body | Instrument breaks | Treat appropriately / Body as path |
| Karma | Action | Past surfaces | Four powers / Karma is empty |

**All three are internal.** They come from inside you.

Next fascicle: the **external** obstacles. Demons. Meditation states. Wrong views.

## The Tiantai Difference

### Not Gradual, Not Sudden

> "This is not like the Hīnayāna severance of karma, nor like the non-Buddhist doctrine of naturalism. It is the Perfect Teaching's [approach of] understanding karma as empty."

**Translation**:

- **Gradual schools**: Cut karma through effort
- **Non-Buddhist**: Ignore karma; it's natural
- **Tiantai**: Penetrate karma's empty nature while respecting its functional power

You don't eliminate obstacles. You see through them. And you still work with them.
