## Two Subtle Obstacles

- **Wrong Views** (諸見境) — Intellectual obstacles
- **Pride** (慢境) — Attitude obstacles

Both come from **partial realization**. Subtle clinging that advanced practitioners must recognize and release.

---

## Part 1: Wrong Views Object (諸見境)

### When It Shows Up

When you:
- Have experienced real insight
- Develop conceptual understanding based on it
- Cling to the conceptual understanding
- Mistake understanding for complete realization

> "Danger isn't having views. It's clinging to views. Even correct views, when clung to, become obstacles."

---

### The Five Wrong Views

Same five from Fascicle 4, but now at a more subtle level.

#### 1. View of Self (身見)

**At advanced level**:
- Not "I am this body"
- But "I am the one who realized emptiness"
- Clinging to identity of "realized practitioner"

**Point**: "Who realized? Search for the realizer. Where is it?"

---

#### 2. Extreme Views (邊見)

| Extreme | Advanced Manifestation |
|---|---|
| **Eternalism** | Clinging to Buddha-nature as permanent entity |
| **Nihilism** | Clinging to emptiness as annihilation |

**Middle Way**:
- Buddha-nature is neither permanent nor impermanent
- Emptiness is neither existence nor non-existence
- Middle Way itself must not be clung to

> "Middle Way isn't a third position between two extremes. It's the release of all positions."

---

#### 3. Wrong Views (邪見)

**At advanced level**:
- Denying validity of other teachings
- Believing only your understanding is correct
- Dismissing practices that don't align with your experience

**Examples**:
- "Only sudden enlightenment is valid"
- "Only emptiness is real"
- "Only Perfect Teaching is true"

> "All teachings are tools in the kit. Cling to one and reject others, you miss the point of all."

---

#### 4. View-Attachment (見取見)

**What it is**: Clinging to inferior views as if supreme

**At advanced level**:
- Clinging to partial realization as complete
- Believing current understanding is final
- Attachment to your own interpretation

> "Practitioner who believes they've understood everything has understood nothing. True understanding knows its own incompleteness."

---

#### 5. Precept-Attachment (戒禁取見)

**What it is**: Clinging to wrong practices as if liberating

**At advanced level**:
- Rigid adherence to forms without understanding essence
- Believing technique alone brings liberation
- Attachment to specific methods

**The balance**: Precepts are necessary. But clinging to them is an obstacle. Use skillfully, release when appropriate.

---

### More Advanced Wrong Views

#### View of Attainment (得見)

**What it is**: "I have attained emptiness / Middle Way / Buddha-nature"

**The error**: Making realization into something possessed

**Point**: "What's attained? Who attains? Search for attainment. Where is it?"

---

#### View of Non-Attainment (無得見)

**What it is**: "Nothing to attain, so I need not practice"

**The error**: Nihilistic interpretation

**Middle Way**: Neither attainment nor non-attainment; practice without seeking

---

#### View of the Teaching (法見)

**What it is**: Clinging to words and concepts of the teaching

**The error**: Mistaking finger pointing at moon for the moon

**The remedy**: "Teaching is a raft. Once you cross the river, let go of the raft."

---

### Ten Modes on Wrong Views

**Mode 1**: See the view itself as empty, conventional, middle

**Mode 4**: Deconstruct all views
- "This view is true" → empty
- "This view is mine" → empty
- "Views are obstacles" → empty
- "I must eliminate views" → empty

**Mode 10**: Let go of even the correct view

> "Highest view is no-view. But clinging to no-view is still a view."

---

## Part 2: Pride Object (慢境)

### When It Shows Up

When you:
- Made real progress
- Compare yourself to others
- Develop sense of superiority
- Mistake partial attainment for complete realization

---

### Seven Types of Pride

At advanced levels, pride gets extremely subtle:

#### 1. Simple Pride (慢)

**What it is**: "I'm more advanced than practitioners at my level"

**The subtlety**: Often disguised as confidence or certainty

**Point**: "What's this 'I' that's advanced? Where's advancement?"

---

#### 2. Greater Pride (過慢)

**What it is**: "I'm more advanced than those superior to me"

**Example**: Believing you've surpassed your teachers

**The danger**: Closes off further learning

---

#### 3. Pride of Pride (慢過慢)

**What it is**: "I'm among the most advanced practitioners"

**The subtlety**: May be factually true but still an obstacle

**The point**: Even if you are advanced, clinging to that identity is bondage

---

#### 4. Self-Pride (我慢)

**What it is**: "I am" / "I have attained"

**The core**: Subtle clinging to self-identity

**Point**: "Before you attained, where was this 'I'? After attainment, where is it?"

---

#### 5. Inferior Pride (卑慢)

**What it is**: "I'm only slightly less advanced than the masters"

**The subtlety**: Appears as humility but contains comparison

**The issue**: Still measuring and comparing

---

#### 6. False Pride (邪慢)

**What it is**: Pride in non-attainments

**Example**: Believing you've attained what you haven't

**The danger**: Complete delusion about your level

---

#### 7. Perverse Pride (增上慢)

**What it is**: Pride in wrong attainments

**Example**: Pride in supernatural powers, visions, experiences

**The teaching**: "Supernatural powers aren't the goal. They're byproducts. To be proud of them is to miss the point."

---

### Pride and the Six Identities

| Identity | Pride Manifestation |
|---|---|
| **Name** | "I understand better than others" |
| **Contemplation** | "My practice is superior" |
| **Resemblance** | "I've approached realization" |
| **Partial** | "I've broken through ignorance" |
| **Ultimate** | (No pride remains) |

**The key**: At each level, recognize achievement without clinging to it

---

### Ten Modes on Pride

**Mode 8 (Know Stages)**: Understand where you actually are
- Study Six Identities carefully
- Be honest about current level
- Neither underestimate nor overestimate

**Mode 2 (Bodhi-Mind)**: Remember all beings are inherently Buddha
- Your progress isn't yours alone
- All beings have same potential
- Serve others with humility

**Mode 10 (Let Go)**: Release attainment
- Even genuine attainment must be released
- Clinging to progress is still clinging
- Highest attainment is no-attainment

---

## How They Connect

| Aspect | Wrong Views | Pride |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | Intellectual | Attitudinal |
| **Basis** | Partial understanding | Partial attainment |
| **Manifestation** | Clinging to views | Clinging to identity |
| **Remedy** | Deconstruct views | Recognize equality |

**Common root**: Both arise from **reification**—making something solid out of what's empty.

## Luthier's Points
*[TRANSLATOR'S COMMENTARY — Not Miao-lo's text]*

### On Recognition

> "Subtle obstacles are hardest to recognize because they disguise themselves as virtues. Wrong views appear as wisdom. Pride appears as confidence. Only through profound self-honesty can they be seen."

### On Humility

> "Sign of true realization isn't certainty but humility. The more you realize, the more you see how much remains unknown. The master is the one who knows they're still a student."

### On Release

> "To work with wrong views and pride, you must be willing to release even correct understanding and genuine attainment. This is the hardest release because it feels like losing something precious. But what's released was never truly possessed."

## Summary

| Object | Core Issue | Primary Mode | Key Insight |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Wrong Views** | Clinging to understanding | Mode 4 (Break Through) | Highest view is no-view |
| **Pride** | Clinging to attainment | Mode 8 (Know Stages) | Highest attainment is no-attainment |

**Both need**: Profound self-honesty, willingness to release, Mode 10 (Let Go)
