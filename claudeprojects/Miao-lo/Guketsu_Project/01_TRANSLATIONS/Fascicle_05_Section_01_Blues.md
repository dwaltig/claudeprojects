## Opening Word

Wrong views and pride
rise from partial realization
that mistakes itself for completion.

Both are subtle.
Both are adhesive.

---

## Wrong Views Object

Issue is not "having any view" at all.
Issue is clinging to view.

Even correct formulation,
when possessed as identity,
becomes obstruction.

Core wrong-view patterns at this level:
self-view in refined form,
extreme positioning,
doctrinal exclusivism,
attachment to partial insight,
attachment to method-form.

Additional advanced distortions:
view of attainment,
view of non-attainment,
view-attachment to teachings themselves.

---

## Contemplative Response

See the view as object.
See object as empty,
provisional,
and middle.

Deconstruct recursively:
"this is true"
"this is mine"
"I have no view"
all opened,
all released.

Highest view is not a slogan.
It is non-clinging function.

---

## Pride Object

Pride here includes coarse boasting,
subtle comparison,
and spiritual self-typing.

It can hide inside humility-performance
or certainty-performance.

Seven pride-patterns remain useful markers,
but diagnosis must include
how identity reconstitutes itself
through attainment language.

---

## Pride and Stage Confusion

When level is misunderstood,
pride inflates or despairs.

Right stage-knowledge
protects against both inflation and collapse.

Humility here is not self-negation.
It is accurate seeing.

---

## Closing Moan

Wrong views harden mind.
Pride hardens heart.

If both are softened by three-truth seeing,
path movement resumes.
