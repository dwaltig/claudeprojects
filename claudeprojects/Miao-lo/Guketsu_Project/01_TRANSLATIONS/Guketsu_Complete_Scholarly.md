### Question and Answer: Why This Commentary Was Compiled

**Question**: What causes and conditions have led you to rashly compile this record?

**Answer**: The matter could not be avoided. I述 述 [set forth] these causal origins in ten intentions:

### The Ten Intentions (十意)

**1. [Lineage Authentication]** So that [students] may know there exists a lineage transmission (*shicheng* 師承), and not任 [arbitrarily follow] their own personal judgment, thereby differing from the mind of the師 [authentic teacher].

**2. [Preservation Against Abandonment]** So that those who have曾 [previously] received the lineage transmission do not abandon the root and foundation by following what they have not [properly] seen.

**3. [Prevention of Doctrinal Drift]** So that in後代 [later generations], [when teachings are] transmitted successively, heterodox interpretations do not arise, thereby losing the original foundation upon which [the teaching] depends.

**4. [Provision for the Isolated]** So that those who have faith in the [Tiantai] school and are fond of studying in余方 [other regions] where there is no teacher from whom they can receive and承稟 [inherit the transmission], [may have access to authentic instruction].

**5. [Integration of Principle and Contemplation]** So that those who practice both義 [doctrinal understanding] and觀 [contemplation] together, and who prefer to憑 [rely upon] the teachings, [may have] both practice and understanding fully prepared.

**6. [Structural Illumination]** So as to點示 [point out and reveal] the關節 [crucial junctures]—the extensive and abbreviated, the beginnings and endings, the essential purport of the文 [text].

**7. [Preservation of the Teacher's Interpretation]** So as to建立 [establish and uphold] the teacher's [Guanding's] interpretation, causing it not to淪墜 [sink and fall into oblivion], thereby benefiting來世 [future ages].

**8. [Self-Clarification]** So as to自資 [provide resources for myself] in觀解 [contemplative understanding], thereby防 [preventing]誤謬 [errors and falsehoods], making [the text]易 [easy for]尋討 [investigation and discussion].

**9. [Request for Correction]** So as to呈露 [present and reveal] my own understanding, fearing there may be迷忘 [confusion and forgetfulness], thereby求 [seeking]刪削 [deletion and revision from others].

**10. [Compassionate Propagation]** So as to隨順 [accord with] the Buddha's intention and運 [exercise] the great compassionate mind in利他 [benefiting others]—the practice of benefiting others.

### The Three Versions of the *Mohe Zhiguan*

This single work exists in three versions from前後 [earlier and later periods]:

**The First Version** was completed in twenty *fascicles* (*juan* 卷).

**The Second Version** was completed in ten *fascicles*.

At the beginning of both the first and second versions, [the text] is uniformly titled as "圓頓" (*yuandun*, "Perfect-Sudden"). This is為 [done in order to]異 [distinguish it from]偏小 [partial and Hinayana teachings] as well as及 [from]不定 [indeterminate teachings].

The second version is即 [precisely] the one where at文初 [the beginning of the text] is列 [listed the passage beginning] "竊念" (*qiannian*, "I privately ponder...").

**The Third Version**'s title意 [meaning is]少異 [slightly different]. [This will be] fully [explained] in具 後釋 [the later elucidation]. [This version] begins初 with the phrase "止觀明靜者是" ("*Zhiguan* [Concentration-Insight] is明 [luminous in its]靜 [stillness]...").

**The version we現在承 [presently receive and transmit] is precisely this third version.**

時人 [People of the time]相傳 [mutually transmit] that the third version is mostly以 [considered] the略本 [abbreviated version], while the second version號為 [is called] the廣本 [expanded version].

一往觀之 [At first glance], it似有 [appears to have] an extensive-abbreviated [distinction]. [However, when one]尋討 [investigates and examines] from始末 [beginning to end], the紙數 [number of sheets of paper]乃齊 [is actually equal/the same].

Therefore應以 [one should regard] the third version為 [as] the再治本 [re-edited version], and不須云 [need not call it] the略 [abbreviated version].

## Doctrinal Analysis

### The Programmatic Function of the Ten Intentions

Miao-lo's Ten Intentions constitute a **methodological manifesto** for Tiantai scholasticism. They reveal the epistemological crisis facing eighth-century Buddhism: how to preserve authentic transmission across generations when:
- Oral lineages are breaking down (Intentions 1-3)
- Geographic isolation separates students from living masters (Intention 4)
- Textual corruption accumulates over time (Intentions 6-9)
- The balance between contemplative practice and doctrinal study is threatened (Intention 5)

The structure moves from **preservation** (1-4) → **integration** (5-6) → **transmission** (7-10), mirroring the Tiantai concern for harmonizing principle (*li* 理) and phenomena (*shi* 事), wisdom (*hui* 慧) and practice (*xing* 行).

### Why Lineage Authentication Comes First

The placement of "knowing there exists a lineage transmission" (知有師承) as the **first** intention is doctrinally decisive. In the Preface, Pumen Zijing attacked those who claim "mind itself is Buddha" (即心是佛) as a justification for dismissing textual study. Miao-lo's counter-argument begins here: **enlightenment is not solitary**.

Even the Buddha received predictions from Dīpaṃkara; even Nāgārjuna received transmission through texts. The Tiantai lineage—Nāgārjuna → Huiwen → Huisi → Zhiyi → Guanding—is not mere pedigree but **doctrinal verification**. To "任胸臆" (arbitrarily follow personal judgment) is to risk mistaking the five aggregates for enlightenment, as warned in Intention 8's concern about "errors and falsehoods" (誤謬).

This echoes the *Mohe Zhiguan*'s warning against "增上慢" (*abhimāna*, overweening pride), where meditators mistake the Four Dhyānas for arhatship. Lineage is the **corrective mechanism**.

### Connection to "Fish-Lu Textual Corruption"

The Preface's lament that "errors of fish [魚] for lu [魯] inevitably produced variations and discrepancies" (魚魯斯訛,不無同異) after "nearly two hundred years" finds its technical solution in Intentions 6-9:

- **Intention 6** (點示關節): Identifying structural junctures prevents interpolation
- **Intention 7** (建立師解): Establishing Guanding's authoritative interpretation creates a baseline
- **Intention 8** (自資觀解): Miao-lo's own contemplative verification acts as quality control
- **Intention 9** (呈露所解,求刪削): **Crucially**, Miao-lo invites correction, acknowledging his fallibility

The movement from Guanding's oral redaction (c. 594 CE) → three written recensions → Miao-lo's *Guketsu* (c. 765 CE) spans **171 years**. Graphic confusion between similar characters (魚/魯), divergent oral transmissions (Intentions 2-3), and loss of Zhiyi's living voice created what textual critics call **textual drift**.

Miao-lo's solution is not to "return to the original" (impossible) but to **stabilize the third recension** as authoritative through commentary that embeds the correct interpretation **into the text itself**.

### The Meaning of "Perfect-Sudden" (圓頓)

圓頓 (*yuandun*) represents the **highest doctrinal classification** in Tiantai's five-period, eight-teaching (*wushi bajiao* 五時八教) system:

- **圓** (*yuan*, "perfect/complete"): All dharmas interpenetrate without obstruction (*yuanrong wuai* 圓融無礙). The ten dharma-realms (*shi fajie* 十法界) are mutually inclusive (*hu ju* 互具), yielding the "three thousand realms in a single thought-moment" (*yinian sanqian* 一念三千).

- **頓** (*dun*, "sudden"): Realization is **immediate and non-gradual**. Unlike the藏通別 [Tripiṭaka, Shared, and Distinct] teachings, which require sequential stages, the Perfect-Sudden teaching reveals that "the initial aspiration is complete enlightenment" (*fa xin jiu cheng zheng jue* 發心究竟正覺).

That **both** the 20-fascicle and 10-fascicle versions bear this title confirms they were recognized as transmitting Zhiyi's ultimate teaching, distinct from:
- 偏 (*pian*, "partial"): One-sided emphasis on emptiness (Tripiṭaka) or provisional existence (Shared)
- 小 (*xiao*, "Hinayana"): Two-vehicle liberation without bodhisattva compassion
- 不定 (*buding*, "indeterminate"): Mixed teachings that don't clearly establish the ultimate

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is the **praxis manual** for Perfect-Sudden realization. Its title establishes doctrinal supremacy.

### The Significance of "Re-edited Version" (再治本)

再治本 (*zaizhi ben*) is a **textual-critical term** indicating **authorial revision** rather than mere abbreviation. Miao-lo's argument is crucial:

**Popular misunderstanding**:
- 3rd version = 略本 (abbreviated)
- 2nd version = 廣本 (expanded)

**Miao-lo's correction**:
- "紙數乃齊" (the number of sheets is equal) → **same length**
- Therefore: 3rd version = 再治 (re-edited/refined), not 略 (abbreviated)

This implies **Guanding himself** revised the text, not that later copyists condensed it. The changes are:
1. **Structural**: Opening with "止觀明靜" instead of "竊念" shifts the rhetorical frame from Guanding's humility to the text's objective authority
2. **Pedagogical**: Refinement suggests improved clarity, not reduced content
3. **Canonical**: Designating the 3rd version as authoritative establishes a stable text for commentary

By anchoring his commentary to the "re-edited version," Miao-lo performs a **canonizing act**. He transforms a fluid oral transmission into a **fixed scripture**, parallel to how the Pali Canon or Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* were stabilized through commentary.

---

## Key Annotations

### Technical Terms

- **師承** (*shicheng*): "Lineage transmission." Compound of 師 (teacher/master) + 承 (receive/inherit). Distinct from mere "study" (*xue* 學), this term implies **direct personal transmission** of both text and praxis. In Chan contexts, this becomes "mind-to-mind transmission" (*yixin chuanxin* 以心傳心), but Tiantai preserves the textual-oral synthesis.

- **圓頓** (*yuandun*): "Perfect-Sudden." See Doctrinal Analysis above. This pairing is specifically Tiantai; Chan uses 頓 alone, Huayan uses 圓 within a fivefold scheme. Tiantai's innovation is **synthesis**: the perfect teaching is necessarily sudden, and sudden awakening is impossible without perfect doctrinal understanding.

- **再治本** (*zaizhi ben*): "Re-edited version." 再 (again/re-) + 治 (govern/regulate/edit) + 本 (version/edition). Critical term indicating **intentional authorial revision**. Contrasts with:
  - 略本 (*luebon*): Abbreviated edition (content removed)
  - 廣本 (*guangbon*): Expanded edition (content added)
  - 原本 (*yuanbon*): Original version
  - 善本 (*shanbon*): Good/reliable edition

- **關節** (*guanjie*): "Crucial junctures." Literally "joints" or "hinges." In textual analysis, points where:
  - Sections transition
  - Doctrinal themes pivot
  - Misreading would corrupt understanding
  Analogous to Aristotle's "natural joints" in *Phaedrus* 265e.

- **淪墜** (*lunzhui*): "Sink and fall into oblivion." 淪 (submerge/perish) + 墜 (fall/drop). Vivid metaphor for textual loss, suggesting both **passive decay** (forgetting) and **active destruction** (persecution, as in the Preface's reference to Emperor Wuzong's anti-Buddhist purges, though that occurs later).

- **承稟** (*chengbing*): "Receive and inherit [transmission]." Formal compound emphasizing the **ritual-pedagogical** nature of learning. One doesn't merely "read" (讀 *du*) a text; one "receives it from a master" (承稟) through initiation into lineage.

### Textual-Critical Terms

- **竊念** (*qiannian*): "I privately ponder..." Opens the 2nd version. 竊 (secretly/humbly) + 念 (think/recollect). Establishes Guanding's voice as **humble recorder** of Zhiyi's words, emphasizing:
  - The oral origin of the text
  - Guanding's subordination to the master
  - The provisional nature of written transmission

- **止觀明靜** (*zhiguan mingjing*): "Concentration-Insight is luminous in its stillness." Opens the 3rd version. This shift from authorial humility to **doctrinal assertion** marks:
  - Objectification of the teaching (no longer "my notes" but "the teaching itself")
  - Emphasis on果 [result] (luminosity, stillness) rather than process
  - Rhetorical authority for canonical status

### Hermeneutical Concepts

- **任胸臆** (*ren xiongyi*): "Arbitrarily follow personal judgment." 任 (let oneself/indulge) + 胸臆 (chest-mind, i.e., subjective opinion). Pejorative term for **unverified personal interpretation**. Contrasts with:
  - 師承 (verified lineage transmission)
  - 憑教 (relying on scripture, Intention 5)
  - 觀解 (contemplative verification, Intention 8)

The Tiantai epistemology requires **threefold verification**: lineage, scripture, and meditative realization. Any two without the third risks error.

- **根本** (*genben*): "Root and foundation." Essential doctrinal principles that, if lost, render derivative teachings meaningless. In Tiantai context, this refers to:
  - 一心三觀 (*yixin sanguan*): The three contemplations in one mind
  - 一念三千 (*yinian sanqian*): Three thousand realms in a single thought
  - 性具 (*xingju*): Inherent inclusion [of all dharmas in Buddha-nature]

Abandoning the "root" (*gen*) to follow "branches" (*mo* 末) is the heretical trajectory Intention 2 warns against.

---

## Lineage Context

### The Oral-Textual Dialectic

Miao-lo's Ten Intentions reveal the **tension** at the heart of Buddhist transmission:

**Orality's strengths**:
- Flexibility to adapt to students' capacities (*sijiao* 四教)
- Preservation through memorization in monastic communities
- Direct verification through teacher-student relationship

**Orality's vulnerabilities**:
- Memory corruption over generations (魚魯斯訛)
- Loss when communities disperse (as during the An Lushan Rebellion, 755-763 CE, contemporaneous with Miao-lo)
- Inability to transmit to those geographically distant (Intention 4)

**Textuality's strengths**:
- Stability across time and space
- Accessibility for self-study
- Foundation for commentary and elaboration

**Textuality's vulnerabilities**:
- Ossification → treating means as ends
- Literalism → missing oral context
- Authority disputes → which text is authoritative?

Miao-lo's *Guketsu* attempts to **preserve orality within textuality** by:
1. Recording Guanding's oral transmission (Intentions 1, 7)
2. Embedding contemplative verification (Intention 8)
3. Inviting ongoing dialogue (Intention 9: "seeking deletion and revision")
4. Subordinating all to compassionate function (Intention 10)

### Why "Knowing There Is a Lineage" Matters

The assertion "知有師承" (know there exists a lineage) is **performative**, not merely descriptive. It:

1. **Authorizes** the text by embedding it in a narrative: Nāgārjuna → Huiwen → Huisi → Zhiyi → Guanding → (implied: reader)

2. **Disciplines** interpretation by excluding arbitrary readings: one cannot claim "the text means X" if X contradicts the lineage's understanding

3. **Democratizes** access: by **writing down** the lineage's interpretation, Miao-lo makes it available to those who cannot study with a living master (Intention 4), partially resolving the oral-textual tension

4. **Preserves plasticity**: by inviting correction (Intention 9), Miao-lo prevents the lineage from becoming fossilized. The text is authoritative but not absolute.

This is **anti-Chan** polemic in coded form. Contemporary Chan (8th century) emphasized:
- 不立文字 (*bu li wenzi*): Not relying on written words
- 教外別傳 (*jiao wai bie chuan*): Special transmission outside the teachings
- 直指人心 (*zhizhi renxin*): Directly pointing to mind

Tiantai responds: Yes, but **which mind**? Without lineage, scripture, and contemplative verification, "mind" becomes "personal judgment" (胸臆), leading to the errors the *Mohe Zhiguan*'s ten objects diagnose.

The lineage is not **constraint** but **liberation**—freedom from the tyranny of one's own delusions.

---

## Philological Notes

### Grammatical Structures

1. **Parallel Construction in the Ten Intentions**:
Each intention follows the pattern: **為 + [purpose clause] + 故**
   - 為 (*wei*): "in order to," "so that"
   - 故 (*gu*): "therefore," "for this reason"

This creates a rhythmic, liturgical quality, suggesting the Ten Intentions may have been **memorized** as a pedagogical device.

2. **Negation Patterns**:
   - 非任胸臆 (Intention 1): "not arbitrarily follow personal judgment"
   - 不淪墜 (Intention 7): "not sink into oblivion"
   - 不須云略 (Three Versions): "need not call it abbreviated"

The use of 非 vs. 不 is stylistically significant:
   - 非 (*fei*): Categorical negation ("is not")
   - 不 (*bu*): Modal negation ("does not/should not")

3. **Topic-Comment Structure**:
"此之一部前後三本" (This single work exists in three versions from earlier and later periods)
   - Topic: 此之一部 (this one work)
   - Comment: 前後三本 (has three versions from before and after)

This topicalization emphasizes the **continuity** (one work) despite the **plurality** (three versions), linguistically enacting Miao-lo's harmonizing project.

### Key Compound Analysis

1. **展轉** (*zhanzhuan*, Intention 3): "Successively, in sequence"
   - 展 (unfold/extend) + 轉 (turn/revolve)
   - Conveys the **iterative** nature of transmission: teacher → student → student's student...
   - Embedded risk: each iteration introduces potential drift (隨生異解, "heterodox interpretations arise")

2. **憑教** (*ping jiao*, Intention 5): "Rely upon the teachings"
   - 憑 (lean on/depend on) + 教 (teaching/scripture)
   - Physical metaphor: teaching as **支撐** (support structure)
   - Contrasts with 任胸臆 (relying on subjective opinion)

3. **點示** (*dianshi*, Intention 6): "Point out and reveal"
   - 點 (dot/mark/indicate) + 示 (show/display)
   - Technical term in commentary: to **mark** crucial passages and **show** their function
   - Analogous to modern annotation or marginalia

4. **尋討** (*xuntao*, Intentions 8 & Three Versions): "Investigate and examine"
   - 尋 (search/follow) + 討 (probe/discuss)
   - Scholarly activity requiring **both**:
     - Philological investigation (尋: tracking textual variants)
     - Interpretive discussion (討: debating meanings)

5. **紙數乃齊** (*zhishu nai qi*, Three Versions): "The number of sheets is actually equal"
   - 紙數 (sheet count) = empirical textual evidence
   - 乃 (thereupon/actually) = emphatic particle
   - 齊 (equal/uniform) = identical length

This phrase is **methodologically significant**: Miao-lo uses **material evidence** (physical manuscript length) to **refute** the conventional classification (abbreviated vs. expanded). This is **8th-century textual criticism** in action.

### Intertextual Resonances

1. **"竊念" echo**: Guanding's opening "I privately ponder..." (*qiannian*) recalls the *Analects* 2.1: "The Master said: 'One who governs by virtue is like the North Star—it remains in its place while the multitude of stars pay homage to it.'" The humility topos positions Guanding as **faithful recorder**, not author.

2. **"明靜" doctrinal resonance**: "Luminous stillness" (*mingjing*) echoes:
   - *Vimalakīrti Sūtra*: "The mind that is still and luminous" (心本淨明)
   - *Platform Sūtra*: "Originally not one thing exists" (本來無一物)
   - Tiantai synthesis: 止體靜,觀體明 (stillness is the essence of concentration, luminosity the essence of insight)

The shift from "竊念" → "明靜" thus moves from **subjective recorder** to **objective teaching**, authorizing textual canonization.

## Translator's Reflections

This passage represents a **watershed moment** in Chinese Buddhist intellectual history: the self-conscious **theorization of commentary** as a salvific act.

Miao-lo does not merely comment on the *Mohe Zhiguan*; he **justifies** the act of commentary itself through the Ten Intentions. In doing so, he navigates several tensions:

1. **Authority vs. Humility**: He claims to "establish the teacher's interpretation" (建立師解) while simultaneously "seeking deletion and revision" (求刪削), balancing authoritative transmission with intellectual humility.

2. **Preservation vs. Adaptation**: He stabilizes the third recension as canonical while acknowledging the text's evolution through three versions, honoring both fixity and fluidity.

3. **Textuality vs. Practice**: He writes a massive commentary (10 fascicles) on a meditation manual, risking the very "abandoning the root for the branches" he warns against—yet justifies this through Intention 5's integration of "doctrinal understanding and contemplation."

4. **Exclusivity vs. Accessibility**: He restricts interpretation to lineage-verified readings (Intention 1) while expanding access to those without living masters (Intention 4), democratizing authority through textual fixation.

The Ten Intentions are thus both **manifesto** and **meditation**: they articulate a philosophy of transmission that is itself an act of transmission. Reading them, we participate in the lineage they describe.

This is the **hermeneutic circle** made sacred.

**Translation Notes**:
- All Chinese terms are romanized using Pinyin unless standard Buddhist transliterations exist (e.g., *śamatha-vipaśyanā* for 止觀)
- Sanskrit terms are provided where relevant to clarify doctrinal concepts
- Bracketed interpolations [...] supply grammatical elements implicit in Classical Chinese but needed for English clarity
- Technical terms are glossed upon first occurrence and referenced in Key Annotations section

**Methodology**:
- This translation prioritizes **philological precision** over readability where the two conflict
- Classical Chinese grammatical structures are preserved where possible (e.g., topic-comment patterns)
- Doctrinal analysis draws on Tiantai commentarial tradition and comparative Buddhist philosophy
- Textual-critical observations are grounded in CBETA apparatus and manuscript studies

# Preface to the *Zhiguan Fuxing Zhuanhong Jue*
## 止觀輔行傳弘決序

**By Pumen Zijing (普門子敬)**
**Written in 765 CE (永泰元年)**

## Translation

### Preface to the *Auxiliary Record for Transmission and Propagation of Concentration and Insight*

Those who revere emptiness and non-being cause the Way of nominal designation to fall into disuse. Those who abandon written words make the meaning of literary composition go astray. The ancient sages and Brahmā-kings appeared in accord with their times to benefit those they encountered. Though sages and worthies were united with the Way and their virtuous voices never transgressed, still they relied on verbal exposition and entrusted their teachings to various collections.

How much more so in this age, when time has grown distant and we dwell in the semblance period of the Dharma, when learning is scarce and few know the crucial moments! Among those who grasp and comprehend, not even one or two out of ten succeed. There are even those who exhaust years in silent sitting, content to節 themselves in stupor and obscurity; or who spend their whole lives discussing mind, yet hesitate between the perfect and partial teachings. That people err so greatly—is it not thus?

Before attaining the stage of touching the elephant, each proclaims the color of milk. Some claim that "mind itself is Buddha" is the gate to awakening and entry; that "form is not different from emptiness" leaves no trace of root or branch. They imagine that merging with non-duality transcends all verbal formulations, so what use are chapters and sentences?

Alas! That the great teaching should decline thus! This is precisely because they have not discerned that the nature of written words is itself離 [transcendent], nor understood how profound is the function of total retention (*dhāraṇī*).

In ancient times, the Great Master Zhizhe [Zhiyi] descended to birth and manifested in the world. He wondrously expounded mysterious virtue and greatly rescued those swept along in the crosscurrents. He inquired about completing the final basketful [of earth] from the Great Thinker [Nāgārjuna through texts], and revived the severed thread from the Dragon Tree [Nāgārjuna]. In establishing his school and creating its classical form, he took the Middle View (*Madhyamaka*) as his teacher and ancestral model. In establishing the ultimate and building his discourse, he took the Supreme Vehicle as his destination and aim.

He then entrusted this to Guanding. Master Guan[ding] drew it out and extended it, respectfully carrying forward the transmission with extensive records and accounts. The gates and windows of the teaching from this point were illuminated anew.

This was continued by Fahua Wei. Master Wei's accumulated cultivation from former lives did not deviate from his original nature.

Next came Tiangong Wei. Master Wei reverently received it like water being transmitted from one vessel to another.

He conferred it upon Zuoxi Xuanlang. Master Lang was exceptionally outstanding, with natural capacity for independent judgment. [Yet] the successive explanations and interpretations gave no leisure to attend to stylistic refinement.

It was then raised up by Pitan Zhanran. Master Ran was an extraordinary birth—even as a youth in pigtails he displayed keen awakening. Zuoxi deeply recognized his unusual capacities and vowed to transmit the lamp through him.

[Zuoxi] once said: "The two gates of *samatha* and *vipaśyanā* [concentration and insight] comprehensively govern the myriad practices. The establishment of the perfect-sudden [teaching] penetrates them with a single [thread]."

Alas! The succession had continued through four generations, nearly two hundred years. Errors of fish [魚] for lu [魯] inevitably produced variations and discrepancies. Just as [Master Ran] was about to explicate the principles and guide the mysterious current, he extensively refuted heterodox doubts, broadly extending through past and present. [His writing was] substantial yet not crude, erudite yet not excessive.

He composed the *Auxiliary Record* (*Fuxing Ji*) in ten fascicles total. It prepares both the extensive and abbreviated purport of former sages, and accords with the superior and inferior capacities of people today. Not only did it systematize what had been heard; it would moreover regulate what was to be practiced.

What is practiced is precisely the three conducts—the subtle operation [of practice] thereby rapidly ascends its stages. What is heard is solely understanding—the mysterious vision of the one true reality is thereby immersed in.

Now, practice has divergent paths, whereby beginning and end become separated as far as heaven [from earth]. Understanding too has no fixed location, whereby shallow and deep also follow the categories [of beings].

He established the discourse "Auxiliary Practice" (*Fuxing*) in order to raise up its completeness. Therefore, from distant regions they came to inquire about doubts and request clarification. Striking away darkness and uncovering obscurity, diligently day and night—how could this not be a profound assistance, reverently according with transmission and propagation!

That the Way is about to flourish—this fortune does not stand alone!

Though I am a末學 [student of the latter age] presumptuously discussing the Supreme Vehicle, it is like a torch's small fire presuming to add brilliance to the sun and moon.

Reverently composed by Gentleman Pumen Zijing of Junshan.
Written in the first year of Yongtai [765 CE], the fourth year of the eighth generation flourishing the Tang.

## Literary Context

This preface was composed by **Pumen Zijing** (普門子敬), a lay Buddhist scholar and devotee of Miao-lo Zhanran, to introduce Zhanran's magnum opus, the *Zhiguan Fuxing Zhuanhong Jue* (止觀輔行傳弘決, *Auxiliary Record for Transmission and Propagation of Concentration and Insight*), commonly abbreviated as *Fuxing Ji* or *Guketsu*.

**Historical Dating**: The preface is dated to **永泰元年** (Yongtai 1), corresponding to **765 CE**, during the Tang Dynasty. The phrase "八葉之四載" (fourth year of the eighth generation) refers to Emperor Daizong, the eighth emperor of the Tang, in his fourth regnal year under this era name.

**Author**: Pumen Zijing identifies himself as "君山除饉男" (Gentleman of Junshan, one who removes hunger). This suggests he was a lay Buddhist scholar associated with Mount Jun. The name "除饉" (removing famine/hunger) likely refers to spiritual hunger, indicating his devotion to Dharma propagation.

**Purpose**: The preface serves multiple functions:
1. **Polemic defense** of textual study against those advocating silent meditation alone or dismissing scriptural learning
2. **Lineage authentication**, tracing the Tiantai transmission through six generations
3. **Historical contextualization** of the *Fuxing Ji* as correcting two centuries of textual corruption
4. **Justification** of Zhanran's commentary as both preserving tradition and adapting to contemporary needs

**Literary Register**: The preface employs classical parallel prose (駢文, *pianwen*) with balanced four- and six-character clauses, typical of formal Buddhist prefaces of the Tang period. It shows influence from both Confucian literary convention and Buddhist philosophical terminology.

## Key Annotations

### Doctrinal and Philosophical Terms

- **名教之道** (*mingjiao zhi dao*) — "The Way of nominal designation": Refers to the Buddhist teaching that employs conventional language and concepts to point toward truth, despite ultimate reality transcending verbal formulation. This defends the necessity of textual study.

- **文字之性離** (*wenzi zhi xing li*) — "The nature of written words is itself transcendent/離": A key Mahāyāna principle that language, while conventional, is not inherently separate from ultimate truth. The character 離 suggests both "transcendence" and "non-separation."

- **總持** (*zongchi*) — "Total retention": Translation of Sanskrit *dhāraṇī*, referring both to mnemonic formulae and to the comprehensive retention of all teachings within a single practice or realization.

- **即心是佛** (*ji xin shi fo*) — "Mind itself is Buddha": A Chan/Zen slogan that the preface critiques when understood as dismissing textual study. The preface argues this must be understood through proper doctrinal framework.

- **色不異空** (*se bu yi kong*) — "Form is not different from emptiness": Direct quotation from the *Heart Sutra*, used here to exemplify those who misunderstand emptiness as negating all practice and study.

- **絕待** (*juedai*) — "Non-duality" or "transcending opposition": Technical term from Tiantai philosophy referring to truth that transcends all conceptual dichotomies. Full term is 絕待妙 (*juedai miao*, "subtlety of non-duality").

- **半滿** (*banman*) — "Partial and complete" or "half-full": Refers to Tiantai doctrinal classification distinguishing preliminary teachings (半字教, "half-word teachings") from complete perfect teachings (滿字教, "full-word teachings"). Based on the Nirvana Sutra's metaphor of dairy products reaching perfection in ghee.

- **中觀** (*zhongguan*) — "Middle View": Chinese translation of *Madhyamaka*, the philosophical school founded by Nāgārjuna. Tiantai claims direct inheritance from Madhyamaka through Zhiyi's synthesis with the Lotus Sutra.

- **上乘** (*shangsheng*) — "Supreme Vehicle": Synonym for Mahāyāna or specifically the One Buddha Vehicle (*ekabuddhayāna*) taught in the Lotus Sutra.

- **止觀** (*zhiguan*) — "Concentration and Insight": Chinese translation of Sanskrit *śamatha-vipaśyanā*, the twin pillars of Buddhist meditation. In Tiantai, these are synthesized in Zhiyi's *Mohe Zhiguan*.

- **圓頓** (*yuandun*) — "Perfect-sudden": Tiantai's highest doctrinal classification, combining "perfect" teaching (圓教, *yuanjiao*—all phenomena interfuse) with "sudden" awakening (頓教, *dunjiao*—immediate realization without stages). Contrasted with gradual or partial approaches.

- **行三** (*xing san*) — "The three conducts": Likely refers to Zhiyi's threefold practice structure: precepts (*śīla*), concentration (*samādhi*), and wisdom (*prajñā*); or possibly the three contemplations (空假中, empty-provisional-middle).

### Lineage Figures

- **智者大師** (*Zhizhe Dashi*) — "Great Master Zhizhe [Wise One]": **Zhiyi** (智顗, 538-597 CE), founder of the Tiantai school and author of the *Mohe Zhiguan* being commented upon.

- **大思** (*Dasi*) — "Great Thinker": Refers to **Nāgārjuna** (龍樹, *Longshu*, c. 150-250 CE), Indian Madhyamaka philosopher whom Tiantai claims as a patriarchal ancestor. The phrase "覆簣於大思" alludes to the Analects metaphor of completing a mountain by adding the final basketful of earth.

- **龍猛** (*Longmeng*) — "Dragon Tree" or "Dragon-Fierce": Alternative Chinese name for **Nāgārjuna**. "Reviving the severed thread from the Dragon Tree" suggests Zhiyi restored authentic Madhyamaka transmission that had been lost or distorted in China.

- **灌頂** (*Guanding*) — **Guanding** (561-632 CE), Zhiyi's closest disciple and redactor of his oral teachings, including the *Mohe Zhiguan*. "頂公" (Master Ding) is a respectful abbreviation.

- **法華威** (*Fahua Wei*) — **Fahua Wei** (dates uncertain, 7th century), third-generation Tiantai master. Little biographical information survives.

- **天宮威** (*Tiangong Wei*) — **Tiangong Wei** (dates uncertain, 7th century), fourth-generation master, also obscure in historical records.

- **左谿玄朗** (*Zuoxi Xuanlang*) — **Xuanlang** (673-754 CE) of Zuoxi, fifth-generation patriarch and Zhanran's direct teacher. "左谿" (Zuoxi, "Left Stream") refers to his residence.

- **毘壇湛然** (*Pitan Zhanran*) — **Zhanran** (711-782 CE), also called **Miao-lo** (妙樂, "Sublime Joy"), sixth-generation patriarch and author of the *Fuxing Ji*. "毘壇" (Pitan) likely refers to his residence at Mount Tiantai.

### Literary and Historical Allusions

- **梵皇** (*fanhuang*) — "Brahmā-kings": Refers to ancient sage-rulers, possibly alluding to both Indian Brahmā-figures and Chinese legendary emperors. Suggests universal applicability of the teaching.

- **像季** (*xiangji*) — "Semblance period": In Buddhist eschatology, the second of three Dharma ages: True Dharma (正法, 500-1000 years), Semblance Dharma (像法, 1000 years), and Final Dharma (末法, 10,000 years). By the 8th century, Chinese Buddhists generally believed they were in the Semblance or Final period.

- **捫象** (*men xiang*) — "Touching the elephant": Allusion to the Buddhist parable of blind men touching different parts of an elephant and claiming different truths. Found in the *Nirvana Sutra* and *Udāna*. Critiques partial understanding.

- **乳色** (*ru se*) — "Color of milk": Continues the elephant metaphor. Also alludes to the *Nirvana Sutra*'s five-stage metaphor of dairy refinement (milk → cream → curdled milk → butter → ghee), representing progressive doctrinal understanding.

- **魚魯** (*yu lu*) — "Fish and lu": Classical example of textual corruption from graphic similarity of characters. From the *Lunyu* (*Analects*) commentary tradition. "Fish [魚] mistaken for lu [魯]" indicates scribal errors accumulating over generations.

### Temporal and Dynastic References

- **永泰元年** (*Yongtai yuannian*) — "First year of Yongtai": **765 CE**, a brief era name (765-766) during Emperor Daizong's reign.

- **興唐八葉之四載** (*xing Tang ba ye zhi si zai*) — "Fourth year of the eighth generation flourishing the Tang": Emperor Daizong (代宗, r. 762-779) was the eighth emperor of the Tang Dynasty. "四載" counts his fourth year under the Yongtai era name.

## Philological Notes

### Classical Chinese Grammatical Features

1. **Parallel Prose Structure** (*pianwen* 駢文):
   - Opening couplet: "宗虛無者名教之道廢 / 遺文字者述作之義乖"
   - Four-character rhythm: "咨覆簣於大思 / 振絕維於龍猛"
   - Six-character balance: "命家作古以中觀為師宗 / 立極建言以上乘為歸趣"

2. **Topicalization Patterns**:
   - "魚魯斯訛,不無同異" — Topic (fish-lu errors) + comment (variations exist)
   - "所治即行三多之妙運遽階" — Topic (what is practiced) + predicate (rapidly ascends stages)

3. **Negation Structures**:
   - "不孤運矣" — Negative 不 + verb 孤 (be alone) + aspect marker 矣
   - "不無同異" — Double negative (not without = there exist) variations

4. **Verb Complements**:
   - "引而伸之" — "Drew [it] out and extended it" — Phrasal verb with pronominal object 之
   - "著輔行記凡十卷" — "Composed the *Fuxing Ji*, totaling ten fascicles" — Result complement 凡

5. **Aspectual Particles**:
   - "道之將行" — 將 indicating prospective/imminent aspect ("about to flourish")
   - "年將二百" — 將 indicating approximation ("nearly two hundred years")

### Key Compound Analysis

1. **止觀輔行傳弘決** (*Zhiguan Fuxing Zhuanhong Jue*):
   - 止觀 = Concentration-Insight (*śamatha-vipaśyanā*)
   - 輔行 = Auxiliary Practice/Record
   - 傳弘 = Transmission-Propagation
   - 決 = Definitive Resolution/Commentary
   - Full meaning: "Definitive Commentary on Auxiliary Practices for Transmission and Propagation of Concentration and Insight"

2. **覆簣** (*fukui*) — "Completing the final basketful":
   - Allusion to *Analects* 9.19: "If I am building a mountain and stop when one basketful of earth is lacking, the stopping is my own doing."
   - Suggests Zhiyi completed what Nāgārjuna began

3. **絕維** (*juewei*) — "Severed thread":
   - 絕 = cut, severed
   - 維 = rope, cord, thread,維系 (connection/continuity)
   - Metaphor for interrupted lineage transmission

4. **惛懵** (*hunmeng*) — "Stupor and obscurity":
   - 惛 = drowsy, muddled
   - 懵 = ignorant, unconscious
   - Critiques formless meditation without understanding

5. **總持** (*zongchi*) — *Dhāraṇī*:
   - 總 = comprehensive, total
   - 持 = retention, upholding
   - Technical Buddhist term for mnemonic/magical formulae and comprehensive understanding

6. **岐路** (*qilu*) — "Divergent paths":
   - Classical metaphor from *Liezi* for confusion caused by multiple branching roads
   - In Buddhist context: incorrect practice methods leading astray

### Textual Corruption Note

The phrase "魚魯斯訛" (*yu-lu si e*) deserves special attention. This refers to the well-known phenomenon of graphic confusion between similar characters in manuscript transmission:

- 魚 (fish, *yu*) consists of components that can resemble 魯 (Lu, a state name; also "crude")
- The *Lunyu* commentarial tradition extensively discussed such corruptions
- Zhanran's *Fuxing Ji* specifically aimed to correct such errors that had accumulated over ~170 years (from Guanding's redaction c. 594 to Zhanran's work c. 765)

### Humility Topoi

The concluding self-deprecation "爝火增輝二曜" (*jue huo zeng hui er yao*) employs the classical topos of inadequacy:

- 爝火 (*jue huo*) = torch, small fire
- 二曜 (*er yao*) = sun and moon (the "two luminaries")
- Structure: Comparing oneself to a small torch presuming to add light to the sun and moon

This is formulaic in prefaces, expressing ritual humility while paradoxically drawing attention to the work's importance.

## Translator's Notes

This preface exhibits the characteristic tensions of 8th-century Chinese Buddhism:

1. **Anti-textualism vs. Scholasticism**: Pumen Zijing defends extensive textual commentary against Chan critiques of scriptural study, while simultaneously affirming the non-dual nature of words and reality.

2. **Lineage Anxiety**: The elaborate tracing of transmission through six generations reflects concerns about authenticity and authority in an era of competing Buddhist schools.

3. **Textual Corruption**: The acknowledgment of "fish-lu errors" over two centuries reveals awareness of manuscript unreliability and the need for critical editing—a sophisticated philological consciousness.

4. **Doctrinal Classification**: The preface's deployment of Tiantai technical vocabulary (圓頓, 半滿, 絕待妙) assumes reader familiarity with complex doctrinal taxonomies developed over 150+ years.

5. **Practice-Theory Integration**: The defense of textual study is ultimately grounded in practice—understanding (*wen* 聞) must lead to realization (*xing* 行), neither being sufficient alone.

The preface thus serves as both historical document and philosophical argument, situating Zhanran's massive commentary within debates about the relationship between meditation, doctrine, and textual study in Tang Buddhism.

## The Quintessence and The Conduit

## Translation

### The Five Summaries (五略)

**Text**:
> 何者。大意五略。初發大心期心大處。大處秖是旨歸三德。三德即是究竟荼義。
> *Why is this? The "Great Intention" [chapter] contains Five Summaries. First is **Generating the Great Intention** (*Fa Da Xin*), which anticipates the mind's [arrival at] the Great Abode. The Great Abode is simply the Three Virtues of the Ultimate Consummation (*Zhigui San De*). The Three Virtues are the meaning of the ultimate "Tha" [Nirvana].*

**Commentary**:
Miao-lo explains that the entire *Mohe Zhiguan* is holographically contained in its opening chapter ("The Great Intention"). The "Five Summaries" are not just an introduction; they are the **genetic code** for the entire ten-chapter structure.

1.  **Generating the Great Intention** (*Fa Da Xin* 發大心): The Cause. Identifying the target (The Three Virtues).
2.  **Cultivating the Great Practice** (*Xiu Da Xing* 修大行): The Condition. Specifically, the **Four Samadhis** (*Si Zhong Sanmei* 四種三昧).
    > *Text: 雖復期心五百由旬... 是故勸行四種三昧。*
    > *Although one anticipates the mind [reaching] the 500 yojanas... one must therefore encourage the practice of the Four Samadhis.*
3.  **Realizing the Great Fruit** (*Gan Da Guo* 感大果): The Result.
    > *Text: 故說果報而慰悅之。為令初心聞而策進。*
    > *Therefore, one speaks of the Fruit of Retribution to comfort and gladden them... to cause the initial mind to hear and be spurred forward.*
4.  **Rending the Great Net** (*Lie Da Wang* 裂大網): The Function (Breaking Doubts).
    > *Text: 破謂裂破... 破他疑網... 如繫鳥在籠情無所適。*
    > *"Reviewing" means "Rending." ... Breaking the doubt-net of others... Like a bird bound in a cage, its feelings finding no comfort.*
5.  **Returning to the Great Abode** (*Gui Da Chu* 歸大處): The Ultimate Destination.
    > *Text: 化物既周歸於祕藏... 無始而始... 無終而終。*
    > *Transforming beings being complete, one returns to the Secret Store... Beginningless beginning... Endlessly ending.*

### The Lineage Transmission (師承)

**Text**:
> 金口祖承則人法兼舉。今師祖承則總別重出。
> *The Golden Mouth [Lineage] (Jinkou Zucheng) presents both Person and Dharma together. The Current Master's [Lineage] (Jinshi Zucheng) brings them out again in general and specific.*

**Commentary**:
Miao-lo defends the specific transmission line used by the Tiantai school. He cites the **Twenty-Three Patriarchs** (*Ershisan Zu* 二十三祖), referencing the *Fu Fazang Yinyuan Zhuan* (History of the Transmission of the Dharma Treasury), but with a critical Tiantai modification (often implied as 24 in later computations to include Madhyāntika, though here he sticks to the text).

> *Text: 若不先指如來大聖無由列於二十三祖。若不列於二十三祖無由指於第十三師。若不指於第十三師。無由信於衡崖台岳。*
> *If one does not first point to the Great Sage Tathāgata, there is no way to list the Twenty-Three Patriarchs. If one does not list the Twenty-Three Patriarchs, there is no way to point to the **Thirteenth Master** [Nāgārjuna / Huiwen connection]. If one does not point to the Thirteenth Master, there is no way to have faith in [the Masters of] Heng, Ya, Tai, and Yue [i.e., Huisi and Zhiyi].*

This is the **Chain of Legitimacy**:
1.  **Buddha** (The Source)
2.  **23 Patriarchs** (The Indian Transmission)
3.  **Huiwen / Huisi** (The Chinese Connection)
4.  **Zhiyi** (The Great Master)

**Lineage Polemics**:
Miao-lo explicitly links the transmission to **Dragon Tree** (Nāgārjuna, *Longshu* 龍樹), whom he calls the "High Ancestor" (*Gaozu* 高祖).
> *Text: 今家亦以龍樹為始。是故智者指為高祖。*
> *Our house also takes Nāgārjuna as the beginning. Therefore, the Wise One [Zhiyi] points to him as the High Ancestor.*

---

## Doctrinal Analysis

### The Paradox of "Summaries" (略)

Miao-lo argues that *Lue* (Summary) does not mean "less." It means "essential."
> *Text: 五略秖是十廣者。*
> *The Five Summaries **are simply** the Ten Extensive [Chapters].*

The relationship is **Non-Dual**.
- **Five Summaries**: The teaching contracted to its essence.
- **Ten Chapters**: The teaching expanded to its function.
- **Example**: The textual metaphor of the "Bag and the Knot" (*Nang Kuo* 囊括).
    > *Text: 如囊有寶繫口人則不知... 釋名為始旨歸為末... 大意如囊有括盛持結束十章之法。*
    > *Like a bag containing jewels; if the mouth is tied, people do not know [what's inside]... The "Explanation of the Name" is the beginning, the "Ultimate Abode" is the end... The Great Intention is like the bag's knot, holding and binding the Dharma of the ten chapters.*

### The "Thirteenth Master" Puzzle

Miao-lo mentions the "Thirteenth Master." In the classic 24-Patriarch count, Nāgārjuna is the 14th. However, in the *Fu Fazang* (which lists 23), he is the 13th? No, he is usually 14th.
*Correction*: The text says "Point to the Thirteenth Master." This might refer to a specific counting method in the Tiantai tradition where Nāgārjuna is pivotal.
*Resolution*: Miao-lo is emphasizing the *link* between the Indian patriarchs and the Chinese masters. By validating the Indian line, he validates Huiwen (who "received" the Dharma from Nāgārjuna via text, not person—a "remote transmission").

---

## Philological Notes

- **發大心** (*Fa Da Xin*): "Generate the Great Heart/Mind." *Bodhicitta*. In Tiantai, this isn't just a wish; it's the *activation* of the embryonic Buddha-nature.
- **裂大網** (*Lie Da Wang*): "Rend the Great Net." *Lie* = to rip or tear open. *Wang* = the net of doubts (*yi*) and views (*jian*) that traps the bird of wisdom.
- **囊括** (*Nang Kuo*): "Bag-Knotting." A idiom for "encompassing" or "bringing everything together." The "Great Intention" is the drawstring that pulls the entire *Mohe Zhiguan* together. If you lose the drawstring, the jewels (the chapters) spill out and get lost.
- **金口** (*Jin Kou*): "Golden Mouth." Synedoche for the Buddha's own speech. A transmission that is "Golden Mouth" is theoretically unadulterated.

---

## Translator's Reflection

Miao-lo is doing something very modern here: **Structural Analysis**. He is less interested in the *content* of the lineage (who begat whom) and more interested in the *function* of the lineage (how it acts as an electrical conduit).
He treats the "Five Summaries" as a **diagnostic tool**. If you don't have all five (Intention, Practice, Result, Doubt-Breaking, Return), your practice is incomplete. You might be meditating (Practice), but if you haven't "Rended the Net" (resolved doctrinal doubts), you're just a "bird in a cage."

## Translation

### The Master's Origins (智者)
**Text**:
> 智者二字即是教主... 幼名光道亦名王道。此從初生瑞相立名。
> *The two characters "Zhi-zhe" (Wise One) refer to the Lord of the Teaching [Zhiyi]. His childhood name was Guang-dao (Illuminating the Way) or Wang-dao (Kingly Way). These names were established based on the auspicious signs at his birth.*

**Commentary**:
Miao-lo establishes Zhiyi's credentials immediately.
- **Double Pupils** (*Chong Tong* 目有重瞳): A classic sign of a sage (like Emperor Shun).
- **Auspicious Birth**: The room was filled with light (*shi nei dong ming* 室內洞明), forcing the neighbors to think there was a fire.

### The Encounter on Mount Dasu (大蘇山)

**Text**:
> 聞光州大蘇山慧思禪師。遙飡風德如飢渴矣... 思初見笑曰。昔共靈山聽法華經。宿緣所追今復來矣。
> *He heard of Dhyana Master Huisi of Mount Dasu in Guangzhou. He feasted on his virtuous reputation from afar like one hungry and thirsty... When Huisi first saw him, he smiled and said: "In the past, we listened to the Lotus Sutra together at Vulture Peak (Ling-shan). Driven by past karmic bonds, you have come again."*

**The "Vulture Peak" Prediction**:
This is a defining moment in Tiantai history. Huisi validates Zhiyi not by his current resume, but by their *shared past life* at similar assembly where Śākyamuni Buddha was preaching the *Lotus Sutra*.
*Implication*: They are "Dharma Brothers" re-uniting for a new mission in China.

### The Realization (The Lotus Samadhi)

**Text**:
> 即示普賢道場行法華三昧... 豁然入定照了法華... 師曰。非爾弗證非我不識。所發定者法華三昧前方便也。所發持者初旋陀羅尼。
> *He immediately showed him the Universal Worthy Bodhimanda for practicing the Lotus Samadhi... [Zhiyi] suddenly entered concentration and illuminated the Lotus [Sutra]... The Master [Huisi] said: "Without you, there would be no realization; without me, no recognition. The concentration you have triggered is the **Preliminary Expedient of the Lotus Samadhi** (*Fahua Sanmei Qian Fangbian*). The retention you have triggered is the **Dharani of the First Turning** (*Chu Xuan Tuoluoni*)."*

**The Certification**:
Huisi confirms Zhiyi's enlightenment on two counts:
1.  **Dhyana (Samadhi)**: The "Preliminary Expedient" (not the full final stage, but the decisive entry).
2.  **Prajna (Dharani)**: The "Dharani of Turning" (*Xuan*). This implies the ability to "turn" (process) infinite meanings from a single sound.

Huisi's famous assessment follows:
> *Text: 縱令文字法師千群萬眾。尋汝之辯不能窮矣。於說法人中最為第一。*
> *Even if there were thousands of "Text-Only Dharma Masters" (*Wenzi Fashi*), seeking to exhaust your eloquence, they could not do so. Among those who expound the Dharma, you are the foremost.*

---

## Doctrinal Analysis

### The "Dharani of Turning" (*Xuan Tuoluoni* 旋陀羅尼)
Miao-lo emphasizes that *Xuan* (Turning) means "Revolution."
- It spins rapidly, creating a "solid sphere" of meaning.
- One syllable enters the ear, and the mind instantly "turns" it through all its doctrinal implications (Emptiness, Provisionality, Middle).
- It is the "CPU" of the Tiantai Master—the ability to process data at infinite speed.

### The Validation of "Textual vs. Realization"
Huisi distinguishes Zhiyi from "Text-Only Masters."
- **Text-Only**: Can recite the sutra but don't "turn" it. They are static.
- **Zhiyi**: Has the "Dharani of Turning." He creates new insights that *accord* with the text but are not bound by the literal surface.

---

## Translator's Reflection

This section functions as the **License to Operate**.
Before Zhiyi gives us the *Mohe Zhiguan* (the manual), Miao-lo has to prove Zhiyi is qualified to write it.
The qualification isn't a PhD. It's:
1.  **Peer Review from a Buddha**: (The Vulture Peak connection).
2.  **Field Test**: (The realization on Mount Dasu).
3.  **Supervisor Approval**: (Huisi's certification: "You are Number One").

# Fascicle 1, Part 4: Generating the Intention – The Ten Wrongs (十非)
## The Applied Diagnostics

## Translation

### The Necessity of Rejecting the False (簡非)

**Text**:
> 初簡心者。凡厥有情皆悉堪發... 道名既通須以諸非簡之令是。今略為十並是所簡。
> *First, regarding the 'Simplification of the Mind' (Jian Xin): All sentient beings are capable of generating [the intention]... Since the name 'Way' (Dao) is common [to both good and evil], one must use the 'Various Wrongs' (Zhu Fei) to simplify [i.e., filter] it, causing it to be correct/right (Shi). Now, we briefly list ten; all are to be rejected.*

**Commentary**:
Miao-lo explains that "Generating the Intention" (*Fa Xin*) is not inherently good. One can generate an intention to steal, to kill, or to become a demon. Therefore, before we establish the "Right Mind," we must filter out the "Wrong Minds." This is arguably the most critical diagnostic section in the early *Guketsu*.

### The Ten Wrong Minds (List and Analysis)

#### 1. The Mind of the Three Poisons (貪瞋癡)
**Text**:
> 初貪瞋癡其相最甚故名為專... 境強心重判屬上品。
> *First, Greed, Anger, and Stupidity. Their characteristics are most extreme, thus called 'Exclusive'... The object is strong and the mind is heavy; judged as Upper Grade [Evil].*
- **Analysis**: This is the "Hell Path" motivation. Practicing meditation to gain powers for revenge or accumulation.

#### 2. The Mind of the Five *Shantila* (五扇提羅)
**Text**:
> 言五扇提羅等者。未曾有經下卷云... 外形似禪內思邪濁。見者謂聖。
> *Regarding the Five *Shantila* (Sandhila/Eunuchs/Impotent Ones): The *Marvelous Scripture* (*Weicengyou Jing*) says... 'Outwardly they resemble Dhyana [practitioners], but inwardly they think of evil turbidity. Beholders call them Sages.'*
- **Analysis**: These are "Pretenders." They enter the order for profit. They are "spiritual eunuchs"—incapable of producing the seed of enlightenment.

#### 3. The Mind of the Fire Path (行火途)
**Text**:
> 行火途者四解脫經以三途名火血刀也... 且從熱說故云火途。
> *Regarding walking the Fire Path: The *Four Emancipations Sutra* names the Three Paths as Fire, Blood, and Knife... Speaking from the aspect of heat, it is called the Fire Path.*
- **Analysis**: Motivation driven by burning anxiety or the desire to inflict burning.

#### 4. The Mind of Desiring Followers (欲多眷屬)
**Text**:
> 夫畜類者多愛群聚。是故破戒兼好眷屬之所感也。
> *Those of the Animal category mostly love to gather in herds. Therefore, this is the retribution invoked by breaking precepts combined with loving [a large entourage of] followers.*
- **Analysis**: The "Pack Mentality." Practicing to become a cult leader or influencer.

#### 5. The Mind of Swallowing the Flow (吞流)
**Text**:
> 吞流等者。欲他歸己如海吞流。欲己攝他如火焚薪。
> *Swallowing the Flow: Desiring others to return to oneself like the ocean swallows currents. Desiring to consume others like fire burns firewood.*
- **Analysis**: Narcissistic absorbtion. The "Black Hole" teacher.

#### 6. The Mind of Devadatta (如調達)
**Text**:
> 如調達者... 謂教王害父而為新王。我當害佛而為新佛。
> *Like Devadatta... He taught the King to harm his father and become a New King. [He said] 'I will harm the Buddha and become a New Buddha.'*
- **Analysis**: The "Usurper." Ambition to overthrow lineage and replace the teacher. Motivated by jealousy (*Chi*).

#### 7. The Mind of the Six Livestock (六畜)
**Text**:
> 復言六畜者。以六攝盡故也... 從相噉邊故云血途。
> *Speaking of the Six Livestock: The number six exhausts the category... From the aspect of mutual devouring, it is called the Blood Path.*
- **Analysis**: Servility and brutality. Practicing blind obedience or predatory dominance.

#### 8. The Mind of the Four Distants & Eight Directions (四遠八方)
**Text**:
> 四遠八方等者... 次荒之國也。
> *The Four Distants and Eight Directions... The lands of the 'Next Wilderness' (barbarians).*
- **Analysis**: Being a "Spiritual Tourist" or "Barbarian." Uncultured, lacking the central "Civilization" of the Middle Way.

#### 9. The Mind of Self-Praise (歎名曰稱)
**Text**:
> 歎名曰稱。讚德曰揚... 知己無德欲他擬聖。
> *Sighing [for] fame is called 'Cheng'. Praising virtue is called 'Yang'... Knowing oneself has no virtue, yet desiring others to compare one to a Sage.*
- **Analysis**: The "PR Campaign." Fame-seeking.

#### 10. The Mind of Intolerating Inferiors (不耐下人)
**Text**:
> 不耐下人者... 如鴟等者... 豈鴟高飛而勝孔雀。
> *Intolerant of those below... Like the Owl ('Chi')... How can the Owl, flying high, surpass the Peacock?*
- **Analysis**: Arrogance (*Man*). Looking down on beginners or the laity.

---

## Doctrinal Analysis

### The "Net of Wrongs" (簡非之網)
Miao-lo's commentary here serves a crucial function: it **de-romanticizes** the act of "seeking the Way."
He argues that 90% of people who "seek the Way" are actually seeking:
- Power (Devadatta)
- Fame (Self-Praise)
- Comfort (Five Shantila)
- Entourage (Herd Mentality)

Unless these "Ten Wrongs" are filtered out (*Jian* 簡), the energy of meditation will simply amplify the pathology. Meditation acts as a fertilizer; if the seed is "Devadatta," meditation will grow a "Super-Devadatta."

### The Meaning of "Shantila" (扇提羅)
Miao-lo cites the *Weicengyou Jing* to explain this obscure term. It refers to those who are "Stone Women" (*Shi Nu*) or "Eunuchs" (*Huang Men*) in a spiritual sense. They look the part (shaved heads, robes, meditation posture) but lack the biological capacity to reproduce the Dharma lineage. They are "dead ends."

---

## Translator's Reflection

This section feels incredibly contemporary. The critique of "Spiritual Materialism" (Chogyam Trungpa's term) is fully anticipated here by Zhiyi and Miao-lo.
The "Mind of Desiring Followers" (Pack Mentality) is a direct critique of the "Guru/Influencer" complex.
The "Mind of Swallowing the Flow" is a devastating psychological profile of the narcissistic teacher who needs students to "feed" them.

# Fascicle 1, Part 5: The Alignment (Revealing the Right)
## The Four Great Vows and the Structure of Reality

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 22, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## 1. The Necessity of the "Right" (*Xian Shi* 顯是)

After rejecting the "Ten Wrongs," the mind must settle on the "Right." What constitutes the "Right Mind"? It is the mind that generates intention based on reality, not on biological impulse or social conditioning.

Miao-lo explains: "The 'Right' is revealed through the **Four Great Vows** (*Si Hong Shiyuan* 四弘誓願). These are not merely aspirations; they are the structural response of wisdom to the four aspects of the Noble Truths."

### The Correlation of Truths and Vows

In the *Mohe Zhiguan*, the Four Vows are mapped directly to the Four Noble Truths. The vows are the active engagement with the truths.

| **The Four Noble Truths** (Reality) | **The Four Great Vows** (Response) | **Miao-lo's Commentary** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Suffering** (*Ku*) | **Sentient Beings are numberless; I vow to save them.** | We see the universality of suffering (Biological limit), so we broaden our scope to *all* beings. |
| **2. Accumulation** (*Ji*) | **Defilements are inexhaustible; I vow to end them.** | We see the cause (Conditioning/Karma), so we vow to cut the root, not just the branch. |
| **3. Path** (*Dao*) | **Dharma gates are potentialless; I vow to enter them.** | We see the way out requires skill. We don't just "be good"; we master the *technology* of liberation. |
| **4. Extinction** (*Mie*) | ** The Buddha Way is unsurpassable; I vow to attain it.** | We see the final goal (Nirvana) not as a stopping point, but as the perfection of character. |

## 2. The Distinction of Vows

Miao-lo clarifies that there are two types of vows, and only one is "Right":

1.  **Affinity Vows** (*Yuan Shi*): Vows based on loving those who love you. "I will save my family." This is biological, not spiritual. It is narrow and fragile.
2.  **Dharma Vows** (*Fa Shi*): Vows based on the understanding of Emptiness and Interdependence. "I save beings not because I like them, but because we are not separate." This is the Unshakeable Vow.

> "If the vow is not grounded in the Truth of Suffering, it is Sentimental Compassion. If it is not grounded in the Truth of Emptiness, it is Blind Action." — *Miao-lo*

### The "Uncreated" Vows (*Wu Zuo*)

The highest level of vow is the "Uncreated" or "Spontaneous" Vow. At this level, the Bodhisattva does not think "I am saving you." The saving happens naturally, just as a mirror reflects an image without effort.

*   **Ordinary Vow**: "I must work hard to save people." (Effort/Dualistic)
*   **Uncreated Vow**: "Suffering and Enlightenment are non-dual. Saving beings is just the functioning of the True Self." (Spontaneous/Non-dual)

## Summary

To "Reveal the Right" is to align one's will with the structure of reality. The Four Vows are the interface between the chaotic mind (Ten Wrongs) and the enlightened mind. They transform **Passive Suffering** into **Active Agency**.

# Fascicle 1, Part 6: The Six Identities (*Liu Ji* 六即)
## The Architecture of Enlightenment

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 22, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## 1. The Problem the Six Identities Solve

Miao-lo opens with a question that has plagued practitioners for centuries:

> "Is the initial mind [of awakening] the same as the final mind [of Buddhahood]? Or are they different?"

This is not an abstract question. It is a practical trap:

| **Trap 1: Arrogance (*Zeng Shang Man*)** | **Trap 2: Discouragement (*Qie*)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| "I have realized the nature of mind. I am already a Buddha." | "Buddhahood is so distant, so perfect. I am a deluded being with no chance." |
| **Result**: Cessation of effort, inflation of ego. | **Result**: Giving up, despair. |

The **Six Identities** destroy both traps. They affirm: **"You are already a Buddha (即)"** while simultaneously clarifying: **"There are six distinct stages of realization (六)."**

---

## 2. The Source of the Doctrine

Miao-lo cites the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* (*Da Zhidu Lun*):

> "Subhūti asked the Buddha: 'Does one attain Bodhi with the initial mind or the final mind?'"

The Buddha's answer forms the basis of the Six Identities:

> "It is not solely the initial mind, yet not apart from the initial mind."

This is the logic of **"Neither identical nor separate"** (*Bu Ji Bu Li*). The beginner *is* the Buddha in principle, but the beginner is *not* the Buddha in realization.

**Analogy from the Treatise**: A wick must burn from beginning to end to consume the candle. The first flame is not the last flame, yet without the first, the last could never exist. The initial aspiration is essential; the final attainment is its completion.

---

## 3. The Six Stages Explained

### Stage 1: Identity in Principle (*Li Ji* 理即)
- **Definition**: All sentient beings possess the Tathāgatagarbha (Buddha-embryo). The Three Truths (Emptiness, Provisional Existence, Middle) are inherent but **unknown**.
- **Condition**: The being has never heard the teaching. They use it daily without knowing it.
- **Analogy**: A cow grazing in a field. It stands in the same meadow as a sage but does not know the directions of the compass.

### Stage 2: Identity in Name (*Ming Zi Ji* 名字即)
- **Definition**: Through hearing the teaching (from a Buddha, a teacher, or a scripture), one learns the *names* of the truths: Emptiness, Provisional Existence, Middle, Buddha-nature.
- **Condition**: Intellectual understanding only. No personal realization.
- **Key Emphasis**: This stage is essential. Miao-lo criticizes those who "despise the textual teachings and esteem silent contemplation." Without hearing, how can one know?

### Stage 3: Identity in Contemplative Practice (*Guan Xing Ji* 觀行即)
- **Definition**: Hearing is joined with practice. The practitioner begins to *observe the mind* and correlate that observation with the doctrinal teachings.
- **Condition**: Like a "worm-eaten wood" that *happens* to form a character. The realization is real but unstable.
- **Miao-lo's Caution**: "If one merely hears without practicing, one does not understand the meaning of the text." Hearing without practice is like having eyes without sunlight.
- **Citation from *Shoulengyan* (Śūraṅgama)**: One must practice like learning to shoot a bow—first at a large target, then smaller and smaller, until one can hit a single hair in the dark.

### Stage 4: Identity in Resemblance (*Xiang Si Ji* 相似即)
- **Definition**: Contemplation becomes clearer. The practitioner's understanding of the Three Truths begins to *resemble* the truth without being fully realized.
- **Condition**: Like shooting ever closer to the bullseye. The "Ten Faiths" (*Shi Xin*) of the Bodhisattva path.
- **Miao-lo's Phrase**: "The more one contemplates, the more clear; the more one stops [the mind], the more still."

### Stage 5: Identity in Partial Realization (*Fen Zhen Ji* 分真即 or *Fen Zheng Ji*)
- **Definition**: Entry into the "Copper Wheel" (Initial Abiding, *Chu Zhu*). The practitioner first sees the Three Buddha-Natures, breaks one grade of ignorance, and manifests a portion of the Dharma-body.
- **Condition**: From the First Abiding through Equal Enlightenment (*Deng Jue*), each successive stage deepens like the waxing moon.
- **Miao-lo's Analogy (from *Nirvāṇa Sūtra*)**: Like the moon from the first to the fourteenth day. Each night it grows, yet even the fourteenth night is not the full moon.
- **External Function**: Anyone at this stage can manifest in any of the Ten Dharma Realms to teach beings. "If someone should be saved by a Buddha-body, they appear as a Buddha; if by a Śrāvaka, they appear as a Śrāvaka."

### Stage 6: Ultimate Identity (*Jiu Jing Ji* 究竟即)
- **Definition**: The wisdom-light is complete and full. Bodhi (Wisdom-virtue) and Nirvāṇa (Severance-virtue) are both perfected.
- **Condition**: There is no further path. "Beyond the character *荼* (*Tú*), there is no path."
- **Miao-lo's Metaphor**: Forty-two characters represent the path. The Buddha is the final syllable. There is nowhere else to go.

---

## 4. The Parable of the Poor Woman and the Gold Treasure

Miao-lo cites the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* to summarize all six stages in a single image:

> There was a poor woman with a great gold treasure buried in her house. She did not know it. A wise man told her of it. She began to dig. Gradually she came closer. Finally, she uncovered the treasure and used it freely.

| **Stage** | **Parable Element** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Li Ji** | The treasure exists in the house. |
| **2. Ming Zi Ji** | A wise man *tells* her about it. |
| **3. Guan Xing Ji** | She "uproots weeds"—begins to dig. |
| **4. Xiang Si Ji** | She "gradually draws near." |
| **5. Fen Zhen Ji** | She "approaches, and the treasury opens." |
| **6. Jiu Jing Ji** | She "takes and uses it completely." |

---

## 5. Why the Six Identities Belong Uniquely to the Perfect Teaching (*Yuan Jiao*)

Miao-lo states that only the **Perfect Teaching** can use the term **"Identity" (*Ji*)**.

- In the **Tripiṭaka Teaching**: Phenomena are not identical to ultimate truth. There is no "即."
- In the **Shared Teaching**: There is a form of "即" (e.g., form is emptiness), but it applies only to the Three Realms.
- In the **Distinct Teaching**: There is identity in principle, but it unfolds sequentially in practice.
- In the **Perfect Teaching**: All phenomena are *immediately* the Dharma-realm. Even greed and anger are Buddha-nature. This is the only teaching where "六即" can be fully applied.

> "If one were to speak of the Three Preceding Teachings [as having 'Identity'], this would be a shallow, expedient use of the term."

---

## Summary: The Function of the Six Identities

The Six Identities destroy two diseases:

1.  **Arrogance**: "I am already a Buddha" → *No. You are 'Identity in Principle.' You have not yet realized it.*
2.  **Despair**: "I can never become a Buddha" → *No. You are 'identical' to the Buddha in nature. Realization is a matter of practice, not a change of essence.*

This doctrine allows a practitioner to be simultaneously **humble** (acknowledging their current stage) and **confident** (knowing they possess the full potential).

# Fascicle 1, Part 7: The Architecture of the Text
## The Ten Chapters and Five Abbreviations (*Shi Zhang* 十章 / *Wu Lue* 五略)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 22, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## 1. The Question of Structure

After establishing the doctrinal foundations (Four Vows, Six Identities), Miao-lo now explains *how the Mohe Zhiguan is built*.

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is not a random collection of teachings. It is an **architectural system** with:
1.  **Ten Chapters** (*Shi Zhang*): The complete structure of the text.
2.  **Five Abbreviations** (*Wu Lue*): A condensed summary of the Ten Chapters, used for beginners.

---

## 2. The Ten Chapters (*Shi Zhang*)

Miao-lo lists the Ten Chapters as follows:

| # | Chapter Name (Chinese) | Chapter Name (English) | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **大意** (*Da Yi*) | **Grand Outline** | Summary of entire system (like a table of contents) |
| 2 | **釋名** (*Shi Ming*) | **Explanation of the Name** | What does "Zhiguan" mean? |
| 3 | **顯體** (*Xian Ti*) | **Revealing the Essence** | What is the *substance* of Zhiguan? |
| 4 | **攝法** (*She Fa*) | **Embracing the Dharmas** | How does Zhiguan relate to all other teachings? |
| 5 | **偏圓** (*Pian Yuan*) | **Partial vs. Complete** | Distinguishing inferior from superior teachings |
| 6 | **方便** (*Fang Bian*) | **Skillful Means / Preliminaries** | The 25 preparatory conditions for practice |
| 7 | **正觀** (*Zheng Guan*) | **Correct Contemplation** | The actual practice (Ten Objects, Ten Modes) |
| 8 | **果報** (*Guo Bao*) | **Fruit/Result** | What happens when practice succeeds? |
| 9 | **起教** (*Qi Jiao*) | **Arising of Teaching** | How the realized practitioner benefits others |
| 10 | **旨歸** (*Zhi Gui*) | **Ultimate Return** | The final destination (Nirvāṇa, Three Virtues) |

### The Logic of the Ten Chapters

Miao-lo explains the **生起** (*Sheng Qi* — "arising and generation") of these chapters:

1.  **Chapters 1-5** belong to **Understanding** (*Jie* 解): You must first *know* what Zhiguan is before you can practice.
2.  **Chapters 6-7** belong to **Practice** (*Xing* 行): After understanding, you *do* the work.
3.  **Chapters 8-10** belong to **Fruition** (*Guo* 果): After practice, you attain the result and benefit others.

> "If you do not know the name, how can you know the essence? If you do not know the essence, how can you practice? If you do not practice, how can you attain the fruit?"

---

## 3. The Five Abbreviations (*Wu Lue*)

The **Five略** are a *shortened* version of the Ten Chapters, used to give the student a general sense of direction before diving into the details.

| # | Abbreviation (Chinese) | Abbreviation (English) | Corresponding Chapters |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **發大心** (*Fa Da Xin*) | **Generating the Great Mind** | Chapters 1-5 (Understanding) |
| 2 | **修大行** (*Xiu Da Xing*) | **Cultivating the Great Practice** | Chapters 6-7 (Practice) |
| 3 | **感大果** (*Gan Da Guo*) | **Attaining the Great Fruit** | Chapter 8 (Fruition) |
| 4 | **裂大網** (*Lie Da Wang*) | **Tearing Open the Great Net** | Chapter 9 (Arising of Teaching) |
| 5 | **歸大處** (*Gui Da Chu*) | **Returning to the Great Abode** | Chapter 10 (Ultimate Return) |

### The Meaning of "大" (*Da* — Great)

Every abbreviation has "Great" (*Da*) in its name. This is not rhetorical flourish. It refers to the **圓頓** (*Yuan Dun* — Perfectly Sudden) nature of this teaching:

-   **Great Mind**: Not a partial mind (seeking personal liberation), but the mind that vows to save all beings.
-   **Great Practice**: Not a technique, but the "non-dual contemplation" of the Dharma-realm.
-   **Great Fruit**: Not a limited attainment, but the complete realization of the Three Virtues.
-   **Great Net**: The network of doubts that binds all sentient beings. To "tear open" means to teach so effectively that all doubts are resolved.
-   **Great Abode**: The "Mysterious Treasury" (*Mi Zang*), the ultimate destination beyond coming and going.

---

## 4. Understanding vs. Practice

Miao-lo emphasizes a critical point:

> "The first five chapters (Grand Outline through Partial/Complete) are like *eyes*. The next two chapters (Preliminaries and Correct Contemplation) are like *feet*."

-   **Eyes** (*Mu* 目): Without understanding, you are blind. You don't know where to go.
-   **Feet** (*Zu* 足): Without practice, you are crippled. You know where to go but cannot move.

> "Without the eye, one stumbles in the dark. Without the foot, one knows the path but cannot walk it."

---

## 5. The "Horizontal" and "Vertical" Reading

Miao-lo introduces two ways to read the Ten Chapters:

1.  **Vertical** (*Shu* 竪): Reading from Chapter 1 to Chapter 10 in sequence. This is the *order of learning*.
2.  **Horizontal** (*Heng* 橫): Reading each chapter as complete in itself. Each chapter *contains* the essence of the whole.

For example:
-   In the "Grand Outline" (Ch. 1), the entire path from aspiration to Buddhahood is summarized.
-   In "Correct Contemplation" (Ch. 7), the practice itself *is* the fruit. There is no waiting.

This is the meaning of **圓頓** (*Yuan Dun*): The whole is present in every part.

---

## Summary

The Ten Chapters provide the **complete map**. The Five Abbreviations provide a **quick overview**. Together they ensure that the practitioner:
1.  Knows the destination (Nirvāṇa, Three Virtues)
2.  Knows the path (Four Samādhis, Ten Modes of Contemplation)
3.  Knows the stages (Six Identities, Partial/Complete)
4.  Knows the pitfalls (Ten Wrongs)

Without this structure, meditation is "blind sitting." With it, every moment of practice is oriented toward complete Buddhahood.

# Fascicle 1, Part 8: The Three Kinds of Zhiguan
## Gradual, Indeterminate, and Perfectly Sudden (*Jian Ci*, *Bu Ding*, *Yuan Dun*)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 22, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## 1. The Question

Miao-lo raises a critical question:

> "The teaching is called *Zhiguan*. But what *kind* of Zhiguan?"

This is not a trivial distinction. The Tiantai school recognizes **three kinds of Zhiguan**, and they differ fundamentally in *how* they relate Ultimate Reality to the practice.

---

## 2. The Three Kinds

| # | Name (Chinese) | Name (English) | Analogy | Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **漸次止觀** (*Jian Ci Zhi Guan*) | **Gradual Zhiguan** | Climbing a ladder, rung by rung | *Ci Di Chan Men* (次第禪門) |
| 2 | **不定止觀** (*Bu Ding Zhi Guan*) | **Indeterminate Zhiguan** | A diamond that changes color depending on where you place it | *Liu Miao Men* (六妙門) |
| 3 | **圓頓止觀** (*Yuan Dun Zhi Guan*) | **Perfectly Sudden Zhiguan** | The sky—equally present everywhere at once | *Mohe Zhiguan* (摩訶止觀) |

---

## 3. Detailed Explanation

### 3.1 Gradual Zhiguan (*Jian Ci*)

**Text**: *Ci Di Chan Men* (次第禪門 / "Sequential Dhyāna Gates")

**Principle**:
- The practitioner moves **step by step** through stages.
- First: moral restraint (*śīla*).
- Second: dhyāna (*ding* 定).
- Third: wisdom (*prajñā*).
- Each stage must be completed before the next can be entered.

**Analogy**: Miao-lo compares this to climbing a ladder (*ti deng* 梯磴):
> "One rung at a time. Do not skip."

**Doctrinal Basis**: This approach corresponds to the **生滅四諦** (Four Noble Truths of arising and ceasing) and the **界內道品** (Path-factors within the Three Realms).

**Criticism**: While valid, this approach is "long and winding" (*yu* 紆). It takes aeons. It is the "slow boat."

---

### 3.2 Indeterminate Zhiguan (*Bu Ding*)

**Text**: *Liu Miao Men* (六妙門 / "Six Subtle Gates")

**Principle**:
- The practitioner does *not* follow a fixed sequence.
- Depending on the arising of conditions (*yuan* 緣), one may enter at any gate.
- Sometimes the practice is shallow, sometimes deep.
- Sometimes one *leaps* forward; sometimes one *falls* back.

**Analogy**: Miao-lo compares this to a **diamond** (*jingang bao* 金剛寶) or a **maṇi-jewel** (*ruyi zhu* 如意珠):
> "Placed in sunlight, its color changes. Placed on different surfaces, it reflects different hues. The practitioner's experience changes according to conditions."

**Doctrinal Basis**: This approach corresponds to the **不定教** (Indeterminate Teaching) within the Eight Teachings. One may receive a "gradual" teaching but have a "sudden" realization, or vice versa.

**Criticism**: More flexible than the Gradual, but still not the highest. The practitioner may "zigzag" rather than proceeding directly.

---

### 3.3 Perfectly Sudden Zhiguan (*Yuan Dun*)

**Text**: *Mohe Zhiguan* (摩訶止觀 / "Great Calming and Contemplation")

**Principle**:
- From the very first moment of practice, the practitioner contemplates **Ultimate Reality** directly.
- There is no preliminary stage. No "building up."
- The entire path is present in every moment.
- The initial aspiration is identical in *nature* (though not in *degree*) to final Buddhahood.

**Analogy**: Miao-lo compares this to **the sky** (*xu kong* 虛空) or to **flight** (*tong zhe teng kong* 通者騰空):
> "One who has supernatural powers rises into the sky. The ground near the feet and the space ten thousand fathoms high are *the same sky*. There is no 'higher' or 'lower' in empty space."

**Doctrinal Basis**: This approach corresponds to the **無作四諦** (Four Noble Truths of No-Arising), the **圓教** (Perfect Teaching), and the **一心三觀** (Threefold Contemplation in One Mind).

---

## 4. The Relationship Among the Three

Miao-lo clarifies:

| Aspect | Gradual | Indeterminate | Perfect/Sudden |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sequence** | Fixed | Variable | None |
| **Time Required** | Long | Medium | Instantaneous (in principle) |
| **Object of Contemplation** | Progressive (界內→界外) | Flexible | Ultimate Reality from the start |
| **Corresponds to** | Tripiṭaka / Shared Teaching | No fixed assignment | Perfect Teaching only |

> "All three contemplate the same Ultimate Reality (*Shi Xiang* 實相). But the Gradual approaches it step by step. The Indeterminate approaches it according to conditions. The Perfectly Sudden *is* it from the first moment."

---

## 5. Why This Matters

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is a text of the **Perfectly Sudden Zhiguan**. It does not teach a preliminary path that later becomes ultimate. It teaches the ultimate path *as* the preliminary.

> "The ground on which you stand is already the Pure Land. The mind with which you practice is already the Buddha-mind. The realization you seek is already your original nature."

This is the meaning of **圓頓** (*Yuan Dun*):
- **圓** (*Yuan*): Complete, whole, lacking nothing.
- **頓** (*Dun*): Sudden, immediate, not gradual.

---

## Summary

The Three Kinds of Zhiguan are:
1.  **Gradual**: Step-by-step. Long. Like climbing a ladder.
2.  **Indeterminate**: Flexible. Like a diamond changing colors.
3.  **Perfectly Sudden**: Immediate. Like the sky—everywhere at once.

The *Mohe Zhiguan* (and thus the *Guketsu*) is devoted to the **third**. This is the "Great Calming and Contemplation" of the title.

# Fascicle 1: Closing Summary
## The Complete Foundation of the Mohe Zhiguan

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 22, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Overview of Fascicle 1

Fascicle 1 of Miao-lo's *Zhiguan Fuxing Zhuan Hongjue* establishes the **complete doctrinal foundation** before any practical instructions are given. This is not preliminary material—it is the *architecture* upon which the entire practice rests.

---

## Summary of Key Sections

### 1. The Opening: Lineage and Authority
- **The Transmission**: From Śākyamuni Buddha → Mahākāśyapa → 23 Patriarchs → Nāgārjuna → Huiwen → Nanyue Huisi → Zhiyi
- **The Point**: This teaching is not invented. It is received. Authority comes from unbroken transmission.

### 2. The Historical Setting
- **Time**: Sui Dynasty, 14th year of Kaihuang (594 CE)
- **Place**: Yuquan Temple, Jingzhou
- **Duration**: One summer retreat (inadequate to complete the full text)
- **Zhiyi's Position**: Fifth Grade of Identity (Observational Practice)

### 3. Generating Intention (*Fa Yi*)
- **The Ten Wrongs**: Ten types of false motivation that disqualify the practitioner
- **The Point**: Before you begin, check your intention. If it is corrupted by fame, gain, or arrogance, you will fail.

### 4. Revealing the Right (*Xian Shi*)
- **The Four Vows**: The corrective to the Ten Wrongs (Beings, Afflictions, Dharma-gates, Buddha-way)
- **The Four Kinds of Four Vows**: Vows differ according to the Four Teachings (Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct, Perfect)
- **The Point**: Right intention must be structured by the Bodhisattva vow.

### 5. The Six Identities (*Liu Ji*)
- **The Problem**: Arrogance ("I am already a Buddha") and despair ("I can never become a Buddha")
- **The Solution**: Six stages from theoretical to actualized Buddhahood
  - Identity in Principle (*Li Ji*)
  - Identity in Name (*Ming Zi Ji*)
  - Identity in Contemplative Practice (*Guan Xing Ji*)
  - Identity in Resemblance (*Xiang Si Ji*)
  - Identity in Partial Realization (*Fen Zhen Ji*)
  - Ultimate Identity (*Jiu Jing Ji*)
- **The Point**: Both "identical" and "staged." Neither arrogance nor despair.

### 6. The Ten Chapters and Five Abbreviations
- **Ten Chapters**: The complete structure of the *Mohe Zhiguan*
- **Five Abbreviations**: A condensed version for beginners
- **The Point**: Know the map before you travel.

### 7. The Three Kinds of Zhiguan
- **Gradual**: Step-by-step. Like climbing a ladder.
- **Indeterminate**: Flexible. Like a diamond changing colors.
- **Perfectly Sudden**: Immediate. Like the sky—everywhere at once.
- **The Point**: The *Mohe Zhiguan* is the text of the **Perfectly Sudden** path.

---

## The Central Teaching of Fascicle 1

All of the above can be summarized in one principle:

> **"The practitioner is already a Buddha—in principle. The practice is the awakening to what is already the case."**

This is the meaning of **圓頓止觀** (*Yuan Dun Zhi Guan*):
- **圓** (*Yuan*): Complete. Nothing is lacking.
- **頓** (*Dun*): Sudden. No gradual approach required.
- **止** (*Zhi*): Calming. Ceasing the afflictions.
- **觀** (*Guan*): Contemplation. Seeing the truth.

---

## What Comes Next (Fascicles 2-10)

With the foundation established, the *Mohe Zhiguan* proceeds to:

- **Fascicle 2**: Explanation of the Name (*Shi Ming*)
- **Fascicle 3**: Revealing the Essence (*Xian Ti*)
- **Fascicle 4-5**: Embracing the Dharmas / Partial and Complete (*She Fa* / *Pian Yuan*)
- **Fascicle 6**: Skillful Means / Preliminaries (*Fang Bian*)—The 25 Preparatory Conditions
- **Fascicles 7-10**: Correct Contemplation (*Zheng Guan*)—The Ten Objects and Ten Modes

---

## Closing Remark from Miao-lo

> "If one understands this foundation, the rest of the text will unfold naturally. If one does not understand it, all subsequent practice is like building a house on sand."

<!-- FASCICLE 02 SECTION 01 -->

# Fascicle 2: Explanation of the Name (*Shi Ming*)
## The Four Aspects of "Zhiguan" (止觀)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: What Does the Name Mean?

The second of the Ten Chapters is **釋名** (*Shi Ming* — "Explanation of the Name"). Before any practice can begin, the practitioner must understand what "Zhiguan" means.

Miao-lo explains that Zhiyi analyzes the name through **four aspects** (四門 *si men*):

| # | Chinese | English | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **相待** (*Xiang Dai*) | **Relative** | Defining "Zhi" and "Guan" in relation to each other |
| 2 | **絕待** (*Jue Dai*) | **Absolute** | Transcending the duality of "Zhi" and "Guan" |
| 3 | **次與不次** (*Ci yu Bu Ci*) | **Sequential vs. Non-Sequential** | Whether the two are practiced in order |
| 4 | **通三德** (*Tong San De*) | **Communication with the Three Virtues** | How Zhi and Guan correspond to the Three Virtues |

---

## 1. Relative (*Xiang Dai*)

### Definition

**Zhi** (止 — "calming," "stopping") and **Guan** (觀 — "contemplation," "insight") are defined *in relation to each other*.

-   **Zhi** is defined as "not-Guan."
-   **Guan** is defined as "not-Zhi."

Like "long" and "short," each term gets its meaning by contrast with the other.

### The Three Kinds of Relative Zhi

| # | Name | Chinese | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Ceasing** | 止息 (*Zhi Xi*) | Ceasing the afflictions (like "extinguishing a fire") |
| 2 | **Stopping** | 停止 (*Ting Zhi*) | Stopping the mind on an object (like "halting a horse") |
| 3 | **Non-Stop Stopping** | 不止止 (*Bu Zhi Zhi*) | The principle (理 *li*) neither stops nor is stopped |

### The Three Kinds of Relative Guan

| # | Name | Chinese | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Penetrating** | 貫穿 (*Guan Chuan*) | Penetrating through the layers of delusion |
| 2 | **Observing** | 觀察 (*Guan Cha*) | Observing the nature of phenomena |
| 3 | **Non-Observe Observing** | 不觀觀 (*Bu Guan Guan*) | The principle neither observes nor is observed |

> Miao-lo: "The first two kinds are 'thought-about' (*ke si* 可思). The third is 'not thought-about' (*bu ke si* 不可思議)."

---

## 2. Absolute (*Jue Dai*)

### Definition

**絕待** (*Jue Dai*) means "cutting off relativity."

In the Relative mode, Zhi and Guan are two different things. In the Absolute mode, they are **not two**.

-   **Zhi** is empty. **Guan** is empty.
-   That which is "stopped" is empty. That which is "observed" is empty.
-   Even the "stopping" and "observing" are empty.

> "When you enter the Absolute, there is no longer any 'Zhi' to contrast with 'Guan,' no 'Guan' to contrast with 'Zhi.' The names disappear into the reality."

### The Relationship Between Relative and Absolute

This is structurally identical to the relationship between **Expedient** and **True** teachings in the *Fahua Xuanyi*:

-   The **Relative** is used to *enter* the teaching.
-   The **Absolute** is the destination.

One moves through the Relative to arrive at the Absolute—but the Absolute was always present.

---

## 3. Sequential vs. Non-Sequential (*Ci yu Bu Ci*)

### Definition

This aspect asks: Do you practice Zhi first and then Guan? Or are they simultaneous?

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Sequential** (*Ci*) | First calm, then insight. First cessation, then observation. (Belongs to the Gradual/Indeterminate teachings.) |
| **Non-Sequential** (*Bu Ci*) | Calming and insight at the same time. (Belongs to the Perfectly Sudden teaching.) |

Miao-lo clarifies:

> "In the Gradual teaching, Zhi and Guan are practiced sequentially. In the Perfect teaching, to 'calm' is already to 'observe.' To 'observe' is already to 'calm.' There is no before or after."

---

## 4. Communication with the Three Virtues (*Tong San De*)

### Definition

The **Three Virtues** (*San De*) are:

1.  **法身** (*Fa Shen*) — Dharma-body (Truth)
2.  **般若** (*Bo Re*) — Prajñā (Wisdom)
3.  **解脫** (*Jie Tuo*) — Liberation (Freedom)

How do Zhi and Guan correspond to these?

| Term | Correspondence |
|---|---|
| **Zhi** (Calming) | Corresponds to **Liberation** (cutting off afflictions) |
| **Guan** (Insight) | Corresponds to **Prajñā** (wisdom) |
| **Both Together** | Corresponds to **Dharma-body** (the non-dual reality) |

But Miao-lo warns: This correspondence is only pedagogically convenient. In the Perfectly Sudden teaching:

> "Zhi is Prajñā. Guan is Liberation. Both are Dharma-body. The Three Virtues are not three. Zhi and Guan are not two."

---

## Summary

The name "Zhiguan" is explained through four angles:

1.  **Relative**: Zhi and Guan are distinguished from each other.
2.  **Absolute**: Zhi and Guan are not two.
3.  **Sequential/Non-Sequential**: Depends on the teaching (Gradual vs. Perfect).
4.  **Three Virtues**: Zhi and Guan communicate with the complete Buddhahood.

This fourfold analysis ensures that the practitioner does not understand "Zhiguan" in a shallow, technique-oriented way. The name itself is already the teaching.

# Fascicle 2: Revealing the Essence (*Xian Ti*)
## The Substance of Zhiguan (顯體)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: What Is the "Body" of Zhiguan?

The third of the Ten Chapters is **顯體** (*Xian Ti* — "Revealing the Essence/Body"). After knowing the *name*, the practitioner must know the *substance* (essence, body) that the name refers to.

Miao-lo explains that the Essence is revealed through **four sections** (四科 *si ke*):

| # | Chinese | English | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **教相** (*Jiao Xiang*) | **Teaching Characteristics** | What doctrines describe this essence? |
| 2 | **眼智** (*Yan Zhi*) | **Eye and Wisdom** | What faculties perceive this essence? |
| 3 | **境界** (*Jing Jie*) | **Object/Realm** | What is the object/realm of this essence? |
| 4 | **得失** (*De Shi*) | **Attainment and Loss** | Who gets it and who loses it? |

---

## 1. Teaching Characteristics (*Jiao Xiang*)

### The Problem

There are many kinds of "Zhiguan" taught in Buddhism:

-   **Worldly/Secular** (*Shi Jian*): Calming techniques in non-Buddhist systems.
-   **Tripiṭaka** (*Zang Jiao*): The analytical Zhiguan of the Hīnayāna.
-   **Shared Teaching** (*Tong Jiao*): The "body-contemplating" Zhiguan.
-   **Distinct Teaching** (*Bie Jiao*): The sequential Middle Way Zhiguan.
-   **Perfect Teaching** (*Yuan Jiao*): The non-dual, non-sequential Zhiguan.

### The Resolution

The *Mohe Zhiguan* teaches the **Perfect** (*Yuan*) Zhiguan alone. All other forms are:
1.  Either *included* within the Perfect (by implication).
2.  Or *opened* and revealed as already Perfect (by the principle of *kai quan xian shi* 開權顯實).

> "To practice the name 'Zhiguan' without distinguishing these teachings is like calling every mineral 'gold.' The Perfect Teaching alone reveals the true body."

---

## 2. Eye and Wisdom (*Yan Zhi*)

### The Five Eyes

| Eye | Chinese | What It Sees |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Flesh Eye | 肉眼 | Physical forms (limited) |
| 2. Heavenly Eye | 天眼 | Subtle forms, distant objects |
| 3. Wisdom Eye | 慧眼 | Emptiness (真諦 *Zhen Di*) |
| 4. Dharma Eye | 法眼 | Conventional truth (俗諦 *Su Di*) |
| 5. Buddha Eye | 佛眼 | Middle Way (中諦 *Zhong Di*) |

### The Three Wisdoms

| Wisdom | Chinese | Corresponds To |
|---|---|---|
| 1. All-Knowing Wisdom | 一切智 | Emptiness |
| 2. Path Wisdom | 道種智 | Conventional truth, expedient methods |
| 3. All-Mode Wisdom | 一切種智 | Middle Way, non-dual |

### Application

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is aimed at the **Buddha Eye** and the **All-Mode Wisdom**. This does not mean the other eyes and wisdoms are abandoned—they are *included* within the Buddha Eye.

> "The Buddha Eye contains all five eyes. The All-Mode Wisdom contains all three wisdoms. To reveal the Perfect Essence is to reveal that which includes all."

---

## 3. Object/Realm (*Jing Jie*)

### The Three Truths as Object

The object of the Perfect Zhiguan is the **Three Truths** (*San Di*):

| Truth | Chinese | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Emptiness | 空諦 | All dharmas are empty of inherent existence. |
| 2. Conventional | 假諦 | All dharmas are provisionally established. |
| 3. Middle | 中諦 | Neither empty nor provisional; both and neither. |

But in the Perfect Teaching, these three are **not three**:

> "Emptiness is not other than Conventional. Conventional is not other than Middle. Middle is not other than Emptiness. The Three Truths are one reality viewed from three angles."

### The Dharma-Nature (*Fa Xing*)

The ultimate "object" of contemplation is **法性** (*Fa Xing* — "Dharma-nature"), also called:
-   **真如** (*Zhen Ru* — "Suchness")
-   **實相** (*Shi Xiang* — "True Characteristic")
-   **法界** (*Fa Jie* — "Dharma-realm")

> "The Dharma-nature is neither internal nor external. It is neither produced nor destroyed. It is neither pure nor impure. It is the essence that Zhiguan reveals."

---

## 4. Attainment and Loss (*De Shi*)

### Who Attains?

-   **Those who attain**: Practitioners who follow the Perfect Teaching, who use the Buddha Eye to contemplate the Three Truths, who understand the non-duality of Zhi and Guan.
-   **Those who lose**: Practitioners who cling to partial teachings, who mistake technique for realization, who remain in the Relative without entering the Absolute.

### The Gradations

| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **Principle** (*Li*) | Everyone already possesses the essence (理即). |
| **Name** (*Ming Zi*) | Some hear the teaching and recognize the name (名字即). |
| **Contemplation** (*Guan Xing*) | Some practice and gain partial insight (觀行即). |
| **Resemblance** (*Xiang Si*) | Some attain a resemblance of the truth (相似即). |
| **Partial Realization** (*Fen Zhen*) | Some break ignorance and see the essence (分真即). |
| **Ultimate** (*Jiu Jing*) | The Buddha alone has fully realized it (究竟即). |

---

## Summary

The "Essence" chapter reveals what the name "Zhiguan" points to:

1.  **Teaching Characteristics**: The Perfect Teaching is the sole doctrine.
2.  **Eye and Wisdom**: The Buddha Eye and All-Mode Wisdom are the faculties.
3.  **Object/Realm**: The Three Truths (as one) are the object.
4.  **Attainment and Loss**: The Six Identities measure the degree of realization.

Together, these four sections ensure that the practitioner does not mistake a partial or inferior essence for the true body of Zhiguan.

# Fascicle 2: Embracing the Dharmas (*She Fa*)
## How Zhiguan Contains All Teachings (攝法)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: What Does Zhiguan "Embrace"?

The fourth of the Ten Chapters is **攝法** (*She Fa* — "Embracing the Dharmas"). After knowing the name and the essence, the practitioner must understand how Zhiguan *relates to* and *contains* all other Buddhist teachings.

Miao-lo explains that Zhiguan "embraces" (*she* 攝) teachings through **six meanings** (六義 *liu yi*):

| # | Chinese | English | What It Embraces |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **攝理** (*She Li*) | Embracing Principle | The ultimate truth (理 *li*) |
| 2 | **攝惑** (*She Huo*) | Embracing Delusion | All afflictions (惑 *huo*) |
| 3 | **攝智** (*She Zhi*) | Embracing Wisdom | All kinds of knowing (智 *zhi*) |
| 4 | **攝行** (*She Xing*) | Embracing Practice | All methods of cultivation (行 *xing*) |
| 5 | **攝位** (*She Wei*) | Embracing Stages | All levels of attainment (位 *wei*) |
| 6 | **攝教** (*She Jiao*) | Embracing Teachings | All doctrinal categories (教 *jiao*) |

---

## 1. Embracing Principle (*She Li*)

### Definition

The "principle" (*li*) is the ultimate reality that all teachings point to. Zhiguan embraces two kinds of principle:

| Type | Chinese | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Expedient Principle** | 權理 | The partial truths taught in provisional teachings (Emptiness, Conventional) |
| **True Principle** | 實理 | The complete truth of the Middle Way |

### Application

The Perfect Zhiguan embraces *both* principles. It does not reject the Expedient in favor of the True. Instead:

> "The Expedient is revealed as already True. The True does not exist apart from the Expedient."

---

## 2. Embracing Delusion (*She Huo*)

### The Three Delusions

| Delusion | Chinese | What It Obscures | Teaching That Addresses It |
|---|---|---|---|
| **View/Thought Delusions** | 見思惑 | True Emptiness | Tripiṭaka, Shared |
| **Dust-and-Sand Delusions** | 塵沙惑 | Conventional Truth | Distinct |
| **Ignorance** | 無明 | Middle Way | Perfect |

### Application

The Perfect Zhiguan *embraces* all three delusions simultaneously. It does not break them sequentially (first View/Thought, then Dust-and-Sand, then Ignorance). Instead:

> "In one contemplation, all three delusions are seen as empty, conventional, and middle. To 'embrace' means to transform, not to eliminate."

---

## 3. Embracing Wisdom (*She Zhi*)

### The Three Wisdoms (Reprise)

| Wisdom | Chinese | Corresponds To |
|---|---|---|
| **All-Knowing Wisdom** | 一切智 | Emptiness |
| **Path Wisdom** | 道種智 | Conventional methods |
| **All-Mode Wisdom** | 一切種智 | Middle Way |

### Application

The Perfect Zhiguan *embraces* all three wisdoms because it contemplates all three truths at once:

> "One wisdom is three wisdoms. Three wisdoms are one wisdom. This is the meaning of *embracing*."

---

## 4. Embracing Practice (*She Xing*)

### The Two Kinds of Practice

| Type | Chinese | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Principal Practice** | 正行 | The main cultivation (i.e., the Ten Modes of Contemplation) |
| **Auxiliary Practice** | 助行 | Supporting practices (precepts, repentance, etc.) |

### Application

The Perfect Zhiguan embraces both Principal and Auxiliary:

> "Without the Auxiliary, the Principal lacks support. Without the Principal, the Auxiliary lacks direction. Both are embraced in one practice."

---

## 5. Embracing Stages (*She Wei*)

### The Six Identities (Reprise)

| Stage | Chinese | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Principle | 理即 | All beings are Buddha in principle. |
| 2. Name | 名字即 | Hearing the teaching. |
| 3. Contemplation | 觀行即 | Beginning to practice. |
| 4. Resemblance | 相似即 | Approaching realization. |
| 5. Partial Realization | 分真即 | Breaking ignorance. |
| 6. Ultimate | 究竟即 | Full Buddhahood. |

### Application

The Perfect Zhiguan *embraces* all six stages because:

> "From the first stage to the last, the practitioner is contemplating the same truth. The difference is only in the degree of clarity."

---

## 6. Embracing Teachings (*She Jiao*)

### The Four Teachings

| Teaching | Chinese | Characteristic |
|---|---|---|
| **Tripiṭaka** | 藏教 | Analytical, gradual |
| **Shared** | 通教 | Body-contemplating, shared with Hīnayāna |
| **Distinct** | 別教 | Sequential Middle Way |
| **Perfect** | 圓教 | Non-dual, immediate |

### Application

The Perfect Zhiguan *embraces* all four teachings because:

> "The first three are not rejected. They are *opened* to reveal the Perfect that was always present."

This is the principle of **開權顯實** (*kai quan xian shi* — "opening the expedient to reveal the real").

---

## Summary

The "Embracing the Dharmas" chapter shows that the Perfect Zhiguan is not one method among many. It is the *encompassing* method that:

1.  Contains both Expedient and True Principle.
2.  Transforms all three Delusions.
3.  Includes all three Wisdoms.
4.  Unifies Principal and Auxiliary Practice.
5.  Spans all Six Stages.
6.  Incorporates all Four Teachings.

Nothing is left outside. This is why the *Mohe Zhiguan* is called "Great" (*Mo He* = Mahā).

# Fascicle 2: Partial vs. Complete (*Pian Yuan*)
## Distinguishing Inferior from Superior Teachings (偏圓)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: Why Distinguish Partial from Complete?

The fifth of the Ten Chapters is **偏圓** (*Pian Yuan* — "Partial and Complete"). After knowing how Zhiguan embraces all teachings, the practitioner must understand *which* form of Zhiguan is ultimate.

This chapter distinguishes:
-   **偏** (*Pian*) — Partial, one-sided, incomplete.
-   **圓** (*Yuan*) — Complete, round, perfect.

---

## The Five Gates of Distinction

Miao-lo explains that Partial and Complete are distinguished through **five gates** (五門 *wu men*):

| # | Chinese | English | Question |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **大小** (*Da Xiao*) | **Great and Small** | Is the teaching Mahāyāna or Hīnayāna? |
| 2 | **半滿** (*Ban Man*) | **Half and Full** | Is the teaching complete or incomplete? |
| 3 | **漸頓** (*Jian Dun*) | **Gradual and Sudden** | Is the path step-by-step or immediate? |
| 4 | **權實** (*Quan Shi*) | **Expedient and True** | Is the teaching provisional or ultimate? |
| 5 | **偏圓** (*Pian Yuan*) | **Partial and Complete** | Is the principle one-sided or all-encompassing? |

---

## 1. Great and Small (*Da Xiao*)

### Definition

| Category | Characteristic | Teachings |
|---|---|---|
| **Small** (*Xiao*) | Aimed at individual liberation | Tripiṭaka (三藏) |
| **Great** (*Da*) | Aimed at universal liberation | Shared, Distinct, Perfect (通・別・圓) |

### Application

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is a **Great Vehicle** teaching. It is not a method for personal escape from saṃsāra. It is a method for realizing the truth that all beings will attain.

---

## 2. Half and Full (*Ban Man*)

### Definition

| Category | Characteristic | Teachings |
|---|---|---|
| **Half** (*Ban*) | Only part of the truth is taught | Tripiṭaka, Shared |
| **Full** (*Man*) | The complete truth is taught | Distinct, Perfect |

### Application

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is a **Full** teaching. It does not withhold anything. Even the Distinct Teaching, though "Full," is only half-revealed because it teaches the Middle Way *sequentially* rather than *immediately*.

> "A half-full cup is not empty. But it is not full either."

---

## 3. Gradual and Sudden (*Jian Dun*)

### Definition

| Category | Characteristic | Teachings |
|---|---|---|
| **Gradual** (*Jian*) | Step-by-step cultivation | Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct |
| **Sudden** (*Dun*) | Immediate realization | Perfect |

### Application

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is a **Sudden** teaching. This does not mean "quick" or "easy." It means:

> "The first moment of practice is not different in *kind* from the final moment of Buddhahood. The difference is only in *degree*."

---

## 4. Expedient and True (*Quan Shi*)

### Definition

| Category | Characteristic | Teachings |
|---|---|---|
| **Expedient** (*Quan*) | Adapted to the needs of the audience | Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct |
| **True** (*Shi*) | The ultimate teaching | Perfect |

### Application

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is the **True** teaching. All other teachings are "expedient" (*quan*) in the sense that they are adapted to lower capacities. But:

> "The Expedient is not rejected. It is *opened* to reveal the True that was always present."

---

## 5. Partial and Complete (*Pian Yuan*)

### Definition

| Category | Characteristic | Teachings |
|---|---|---|
| **Partial** (*Pian*) | One-sided; lacking the full scope | Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct |
| **Complete** (*Yuan*) | All-encompassing; nothing excluded | Perfect |

### Application

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is the **Complete** teaching. The term **圓** (*Yuan*) has three meanings:

1.  **Round** (*Yuan*): No corners, no exclusions, nothing left out.
2.  **Perfect** (*Yuan*): Fully realized, no deficiency.
3.  **Sudden** (*Yuan*): Immediate, not gradual.

> "The moon is called *yuan* because it is round. The Complete Teaching is called *yuan* because it lacks nothing."

---

## Summary Table

| Gate | Small/Large | Half/Full | Gradual/Sudden | Expedient/True | Partial/Complete |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tripiṭaka** | Small | Half | Gradual | Expedient | Partial |
| **Shared** | Great | Half | Gradual | Expedient | Partial |
| **Distinct** | Great | Full | Gradual | Expedient | Partial |
| **Perfect** | Great | Full | Sudden | True | Complete |

---

## The Practical Implication

The practitioner of the *Mohe Zhiguan* must understand:

1.  **Do not mistake the Partial for the Complete.** If you practice only the Tripiṭaka or Shared Teaching, you will attain only partial liberation.
2.  **Do not reject the Partial.** The Partial teachings are *contained* within the Complete. They are opened, not abandoned.
3.  **Aim for the Complete.** The goal is the Perfectly Complete (*Yuan Dun*) Zhiguan.

# Fascicle 2: Skillful Means (*Fang Bian*)
## The Twenty-Five Preparatory Conditions (方便 / 二十五方便)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: Why Preparations?

The sixth of the Ten Chapters is **方便** (*Fang Bian* — "Skillful Means" or "Preliminaries"). Before the practitioner can enter the formal contemplation (*Zheng Guan*), certain conditions must be established.

Miao-lo explains that these are the **Twenty-Five Preparatory Conditions** (二十五方便 *Er Shi Wu Fang Bian*), organized into **five groups of five**:

| Group | Chinese | English | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **具五緣** | **Fulfilling Five Conditions** | External supports |
| 2 | **訶五欲** | **Rejecting Five Desires** | Removing gross obstacles |
| 3 | **棄五蓋** | **Abandoning Five Hindrances** | Removing subtle obstacles |
| 4 | **調五事** | **Regulating Five Matters** | Balancing body and mind |
| 5 | **行五法** | **Practicing Five Dharmas** | Cultivating the mind |

---

## Group 1: Fulfilling Five Conditions (*Ju Wu Yuan*)

These are the **external supports** necessary for practice:

| # | Chinese | English | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **持戒清淨** | Pure Precepts | Moral discipline must be intact |
| 2 | **衣食具足** | Sufficient Clothing/Food | Basic needs must be met |
| 3 | **閑居靜處** | Quiet Dwelling | A peaceful place to practice |
| 4 | **息諸緣務** | Cessation of Affairs | Worldly business must be set aside |
| 5 | **近善知識** | Proximity to Good Teachers | Access to qualified guidance |

> "Without these five, the practitioner is like a bird trying to fly without wings."

---

## Group 2: Rejecting Five Desires (*He Wu Yu*)

These are the **gross obstacles** arising from the five sense-objects:

| # | Chinese | English | Object |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **色** | Forms | Visual objects |
| 2 | **聲** | Sounds | Auditory objects |
| 3 | **香** | Smells | Olfactory objects |
| 4 | **味** | Tastes | Gustatory objects |
| 5 | **觸** | Touches | Tactile objects |

### The Practice

"Rejecting" (*he* 訶) does not mean "hating." It means:
1.  **Recognizing** the desire when it arises.
2.  **Understanding** that the object is not inherently pleasurable.
3.  **Releasing** the attachment without suppression.

> "The desires are like salt water. The more you drink, the thirstier you become."

---

## Group 3: Abandoning Five Hindrances (*Qi Wu Gai*)

These are the **subtle obstacles** that obstruct concentration:

| # | Chinese | English | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **貪欲蓋** | Desire | Attachment to pleasant objects |
| 2 | **瞋恚蓋** | Aversion | Hostility toward unpleasant objects |
| 3 | **睡眠蓋** | Sloth/Torpor | Dullness and drowsiness |
| 4 | **掉悔蓋** | Restlessness/Regret | Agitation and remorse |
| 5 | **疑蓋** | Doubt | Uncertainty about the teaching |

### The Practice

Each hindrance has a specific antidote:

| Hindrance | Antidote |
|---|---|
| Desire | Contemplation of impurity |
| Aversion | Contemplation of loving-kindness |
| Sloth | Contemplation of light |
| Restlessness | Contemplation of tranquility |
| Doubt | Contemplation of dependent origination |

> "The hindrances are like clouds covering the sun. The sun is always there; it is the clouds that must be dispersed."

---

## Group 4: Regulating Five Matters (*Tiao Wu Shi*)

These are the **body-mind adjustments** that balance the practitioner:

| # | Chinese | English | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **調食** | Regulating Food | Neither too much nor too little |
| 2 | **調睡** | Regulating Sleep | Neither excessive nor deficient |
| 3 | **調身** | Regulating Body | Correct posture |
| 4 | **調息** | Regulating Breath | Smooth and even breathing |
| 5 | **調心** | Regulating Mind | Neither tense nor slack |

### The Practice

The metaphor is a stringed instrument:
-   **Too tight** → The string breaks.
-   **Too loose** → No sound.
-   **Just right** → The music plays.

> "The practitioner is like a lute-player. The strings must be tuned before the music can be played."

---

## Group 5: Practicing Five Dharmas (*Xing Wu Fa*)

These are the **mental qualities** that must be cultivated:

| # | Chinese | English | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **欲** | Aspiration | The wish to attain the goal |
| 2 | **精進** | Effort | Continuous diligence |
| 3 | **念** | Mindfulness | Non-forgetfulness |
| 4 | **巧慧** | Skillful Wisdom | Discrimination between wholesome and unwholesome |
| 5 | **一心** | One-pointedness | Unified concentration |

### The Practice

These five are progressive:
1.  **Aspiration** motivates the practitioner to begin.
2.  **Effort** sustains the practice.
3.  **Mindfulness** prevents distraction.
4.  **Skillful Wisdom** guides the choices.
5.  **One-pointedness** is the result.

> "Without aspiration, there is no beginning. Without one-pointedness, there is no completion."

---

## Summary Table

| Group | Focus | 5 Items |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Conditions** | External | Precepts, Clothing/Food, Quiet Place, No Affairs, Good Teachers |
| **2. Desires** | Gross Obstacles | Forms, Sounds, Smells, Tastes, Touches |
| **3. Hindrances** | Subtle Obstacles | Desire, Aversion, Sloth, Restlessness, Doubt |
| **4. Matters** | Balance | Food, Sleep, Body, Breath, Mind |
| **5. Dharmas** | Cultivation | Aspiration, Effort, Mindfulness, Wisdom, One-pointedness |

---

## The Practical Implication

These 25 preparations are not optional. They are the **foundation** upon which the Ten Modes of Contemplation are built.

> "To skip the preparations is to build a house on sand."

<!-- FASCICLE 02 SECTION 06 -->

# Fascicle 2: Correct Contemplation (*Zheng Guan*)
## The Ten Objects and Ten Modes of Contemplation (正觀)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: The Heart of the Practice

The seventh of the Ten Chapters is **正觀** (*Zheng Guan* — "Correct Contemplation"). This is the **main practice** of the *Mohe Zhiguan*—the actual method of meditation.

It consists of:
-   **Ten Objects** (十境 *Shi Jing*) — What you observe
-   **Ten Modes** (十乘觀法 *Shi Cheng Guan Fa*) — How you observe

---

## The Ten Objects (*Shi Jing*)

The Ten Objects are the **phenomena that arise** during meditation. The first object is fundamental; the others may or may not arise depending on the practitioner.

| # | Chinese | English | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **陰入界** | Aggregates, Bases, Elements | The five aggregates, twelve bases, eighteen elements |
| 2 | **煩惱** | Afflictions | Desire, aversion, ignorance arising |
| 3 | **病患** | Illness | Physical sickness arising during practice |
| 4 | **業相** | Karmic Impressions | Past karma manifesting |
| 5 | **魔事** | Demonic Disturbances | Māra's interference |
| 6 | **禪定** | Meditative States | Attainment of dhyāna |
| 7 | **諸見** | Wrong Views | Mistaken understandings arising |
| 8 | **慢** | Pride | Arrogance arising |
| 9 | **二乘** | Two Vehicles | Hīnayāna tendencies arising |
| 10 | **菩薩** | Bodhisattva | Bodhisattva experiences arising |

### The Logic

1.  **Object 1 (Aggregates)** is the starting point. Every practitioner begins by observing their own body-mind.
2.  **Objects 2-5** are obstacles that may arise from within or without.
3.  **Objects 6-10** are attainments or developments that the practitioner may mistake for the final goal.

> "Whatever arises, use it. The obstacle becomes the path."

---

## The Ten Modes of Contemplation (*Shi Cheng Guan Fa*)

For **each** of the Ten Objects, the practitioner applies the **Ten Modes**. These are also called the "Ten Dharma-Vehicles" because they carry the practitioner to the goal.

| # | Chinese | English | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **觀不思議境** | Contemplate the Inconceivable Object | See the Three Truths in the object |
| 2 | **發真正菩提心** | Generate the True Bodhi-Mind | Aspire to complete Buddhahood for all |
| 3 | **善巧安心** | Skillfully Stabilize the Mind | Use appropriate methods to calm |
| 4 | **破法遍** | Universally Break Through Dharmas | Deconstruct all views |
| 5 | **識通塞** | Discern Openness and Obstruction | Know what aids and what hinders |
| 6 | **道品調適** | Regulate the Path-Factors | Adjust the 37 Factors of Awakening |
| 7 | **對治助開** | Apply Antidotes and Supports | Use auxiliary practices when needed |
| 8 | **知次位** | Know the Stages | Understand one's current level |
| 9 | **能安忍** | Develop Patience | Endure without retreating |
| 10 | **離法愛** | Release Attachment to Dharma | Let go of even the attainment |

### The Logic

-   **Modes 1-5** are the core practice. For a sharp-rooted practitioner, these may be sufficient.
-   **Modes 6-7** are remedial. Used when the first five are insufficient.
-   **Modes 8-10** are protective. They prevent falling into errors.

> "Use as many as you need. The goal is realization, not following a formula."

---

## The First Mode: Contemplating the Inconceivable Object

The heart of the practice is **觀不思議境** — contemplating the **Inconceivable Object**.

### What Is the Inconceivable Object?

The object of contemplation is **one moment of mind** (*yi nian xin* 一念心). This single thought-moment contains:

-   **Ten Dharma-Realms** (十法界): Hell, Hungry Ghosts, Animals, Asuras, Humans, Heavenly Beings, Śrāvakas, Pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, Buddhas.
-   **Each realm contains all ten realms**: 10 × 10 = 100 realms.
-   **Each realm has Ten Suchnesses** (十如是): 100 × 10 = 1,000 suchnesses.
-   **Each suchness is present in Three Domains**: 1,000 × 3 = 3,000 worlds.

This is the famous doctrine of **一念三千** (*yi nian san qian* — "Three Thousand Worlds in One Thought-Moment").

### How to Contemplate

1.  **Observe** the arising of a single thought.
2.  **Recognize** that this thought is not separate from the Three Truths (Empty, Conventional, Middle).
3.  **Realize** that this one thought contains all dharmas, all realms, all times.

> "One thought is the entire Dharma-realm. The entire Dharma-realm is one thought."

---

## Summary

The Correct Contemplation chapter is the **practical core** of the *Mohe Zhiguan*:

| Component | Number | Function |
|---|---|---|
| **Objects** | 10 | What arises during practice |
| **Modes** | 10 | How to work with what arises |
| **Core Doctrine** | 3,000 in One Thought | The inconceivable nature of mind |

This is where the theory becomes practice. Everything prior was preparation.

---

## The Central Teaching of Fascicle 2

All of the above can be summarized in one principle:

> **"One thought-moment of the ordinary mind contains the entire Dharma-realm."**

This is the meaning of **一念三千** (*Yi Nian San Qian* — "Three Thousand Worlds in One Thought"):

-   **一念** (*Yi Nian*): One thought-moment
-   **三千** (*San Qian*): Three thousand worlds (10 realms × 10 mutual containment × 10 suchnesses × 3 domains)

---

## What Comes Next (Fascicles 3-10)

With the doctrinal architecture completed, the *Mohe Zhiguan* proceeds to:

-   **Fascicles 3-5**: Further explication of the Ten Objects
-   **Fascicles 6-7**: Detailed treatment of the Ten Modes
-   **Fascicles 8-10**: Fruit, Teaching, and Return

The Guketsu (*Repair Manual*) provides commentary on all of these, explaining obscure passages, resolving contradictions, and presenting Miao-lo's own insights.

---

## Closing Remark from Miao-lo

> "If one understands the doctrine, the practice follows naturally. If one practices without understanding, one is like a blind man walking at night."

# Fascicle 3: Introduction to the Ten Objects
## Entering the Practice of Correct Contemplation (正觀)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: From Theory to Practice

Fascicle 3 marks the transition from **doctrinal foundation** to **actual practice**. After completing the preparations (25 Conditions), the practitioner now enters **正觀** (*Zheng Guan* — "Correct Contemplation").

The structure of Correct Contemplation consists of:
-   **Ten Objects** (十境 *Shi Jing*) — phenomena that arise during meditation
-   **Ten Modes** (十乘觀法 *Shi Cheng Guan Fa*) — methods applied to each object

Fascicle 3 begins the detailed treatment of the **First Object**: the Aggregates, Bases, and Elements (陰入界).

---

## The Ten Objects Reviewed

| # | Chinese | English | Nature |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 陰入界 | Aggregates/Bases/Elements | **Universal** — All practitioners start here |
| 2 | 煩惱 | Afflictions | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 3 | 病患 | Illness | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 4 | 業相 | Karmic Impressions | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 5 | 魔事 | Demonic Interference | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 6 | 禪定 | Meditative States | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 7 | 諸見 | Wrong Views | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 8 | 慢 | Pride | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 9 | 二乘 | Two Vehicles | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 10 | 菩薩 | Bodhisattva | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |

### The Logic of the Ten Objects

**Object 1** is the **foundation**. Every practitioner begins by observing their own body-mind (the five aggregates, twelve bases, eighteen elements).

**Objects 2-10** are **developments** that may or may not arise during practice:
-   **Objects 2-5** = Obstacles that hinder practice
-   **Objects 6-10** = Attainments that the practitioner might mistake for the final goal

> "If you master Object 1, you may not need the others. If difficulties arise, the appropriate object will reveal itself."

---

## Why Start with the Aggregates?

The aggregates (五陰 *wu yin* / *pañca-skandha*) are:
1.  **Form** (色 *rūpa*) — the physical body
2.  **Feeling** (受 *vedanā*) — sensations (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral)
3.  **Perception** (想 *saṃjñā*) — recognition and mental labeling
4.  **Formations** (行 *saṃskāra*) — mental impulses and volitions
5.  **Consciousness** (識 *vijñāna*) — the knowing faculty

### Three Reasons

1.  **Accessibility**: The aggregates are always present. Every moment of experience consists of these five.
2.  **Universality**: All beings have aggregates. This is common ground for all practitioners.
3.  **Comprehensiveness**: The aggregates encompass the entire body-mind. To contemplate them is to contemplate the totality of one's existence.

> "The aggregates are the doorway. Once you pass through, the entire Dharma-realm opens."

---

## The Method: Ten Modes Applied to the First Object

For the First Object (Aggregates), the practitioner applies all **Ten Modes** sequentially:

| Mode | Application to Aggregates |
|---|---|
| 1. Contemplate the Inconceivable | See the aggregates as the Three Truths |
| 2. Generate Bodhi-Mind | Vow to liberate all beings trapped in aggregates |
| 3. Stabilize the Mind | Use止觀 to settle on the aggregates |
| 4. Break Through | Deconstruct all views about the aggregates |
| 5. Discern Openness/Obstruction | Know what aids/hinders aggregate contemplation |
| 6. Regulate Path-Factors | Apply the 37 Factors to aggregate contemplation |
| 7. Apply Antidotes | Use auxiliary practices if needed |
| 8. Know the Stages | Understand one's level of realization |
| 9. Develop Patience | Endure difficulties without retreating |
| 10. Release Dharma-Attachment | Let go of clinging to the method itself |

---

## The Core Insight: One Thought Contains All

When contemplating the aggregates, the key realization is **一念三千** (*yi nian san qian* — "Three Thousand Worlds in One Thought-Moment"):

-   In **one moment** of the aggregate consciousness (識陰)...
-   There are **ten dharma-realms** (from hell to Buddha)
-   Each realm contains **all ten** = 100 realms
-   Each has **ten suchnesses** = 1,000
-   Each in **three domains** (aggregates, beings, lands) = **3,000 worlds**

This is not a metaphor. This is the **actual structure of reality** as seen through contemplation.

> "Your ordinary mind right now — this very moment of seeing, hearing, thinking — contains hell, heaven, Buddhahood, and everything in between."

---

## What Comes Next in Fascicle 3

The remainder of Fascicle 3 provides:
1.  **Detailed analysis** of the five aggregates as objects of contemplation
2.  **Application of the Ten Modes** to aggregate contemplation
3.  **Resolution of difficulties** that arise during practice
4.  **Distinctions** between different levels of realization

---

## Summary

-   Fascicle 3 begins the **actual practice** of Correct Contemplation
-   The **First Object** (Aggregates) is the universal starting point
-   The **Ten Modes** are applied systematically to this object
-   The goal is to realize **一念三千** — that one thought contains all worlds

# Fascicle 3, Section 1: The First Object — Aggregates Overview
## Contemplating the Five Aggregates (陰入界境)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: Why the Aggregates Are the Gateway

The **five aggregates** (五陰 *wu yin*) are the first and foundational object of contemplation in the *Mohe Zhiguan*. They represent the totality of conditioned existence—your entire body-mind complex.

Miao-lo explains that there are three ways to contemplate the aggregates, corresponding to three teachings:

| Teaching | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Tripiṭaka** (三藏) | Analytical (*xi fa* 析法) | Breaks aggregates into parts |
| **Shared** (通教) | Embodying (*ti fa* 體法) | Sees aggregates as empty |
| **Perfect** (圓教) | Inconceivable (*bu ke si yi* 不可思議) | Realizes aggregates as Three Truths |

The Perfect Teaching method is the focus of this section.

---

## The Five Aggregates Explained

### 1. Form Aggregate (色陰 *Sè Yīn* / *Rūpa-skandha*)

**Definition**: All material phenomena, including the physical body.

**Components**:
-   The **four great elements** (四大): earth, water, fire, wind
-   The **derived matter** (造色): five sense organs, five sense objects, etc.

**Contemplation**: 
> "Form is not other than emptiness. Emptiness is not other than form. Form is precisely emptiness. Emptiness is precisely form."

This is not philosophy. When you contemplate the body, you **directly see** that:
-   It has no permanent self
-   It is empty of inherent existence
-   Yet it provisionally appears
-   This paradox is the Middle Way

---

### 2. Feeling Aggregate (受陰 *Shòu Yīn* / *Vedanā-skandha*)

**Definition**: The sensations that arise when sense organs contact objects.

**Three Types**:
| Type | Chinese | Experience |
|---|---|---|
| Pleasant | 樂受 | Desire arises |
| Unpleasant | 苦受 | Aversion arises |
| Neutral | 捨受 | Delusion arises |

**Contemplation**:
> "Feelings arise from conditions. They have no owner. They are neither self nor other."

When pleasant feeling arises, observe: Where is the pleasure? In the object? In the sense organ? In consciousness? **Nowhere to be found.** Yet it appears. This is the inconceivable nature of feeling.

---

### 3. Perception Aggregate (想陰 *Xiǎng Yīn* / *Saṃjñā-skandha*)

**Definition**: The mental faculty that recognizes and labels objects. "This is a tree." "That is a sound."

**Function**: Creates concepts, memories, associations.

**Contemplation**:
> "All perceptions are like dreams, illusions, echoes, reflections."

The perception aggregate takes the raw data of feeling and constructs a mental representation. But the representation is **not** the thing itself. The word "tree" is not the tree. The concept "pain" is not pain.

When you see this clearly, perception loses its grip.

---

### 4. Formations Aggregate (行陰 *Xíng Yīn* / *Saṃskāra-skandha*)

**Definition**: All mental formations—volitions, intentions, impulses, emotions.

**Scope**: This is the broadest aggregate. It includes:
-   Wholesome mental states (慈悲喜捨)
-   Unwholesome mental states (貪瞋癡慢疑)
-   Neutral mental states (睡眠作意等)

**Contemplation**:
> "Formations are the engine of karma. They propel you into the next moment, the next life."

The formations aggregate is **where action originates**. This is where you have agency. When you see an angry thought arise, that is the formations aggregate. If you **recognize** it as empty, it dissolves. If you **grasp** it, it becomes action.

---

### 5. Consciousness Aggregate (識陰 *Shí Yīn* / *Vijñāna-skandha*)

**Definition**: The awareness that cognizes objects. The "knowing" faculty.

**Six Types**:
| Consciousness | Organ | Object |
|---|---|---|
| Eye-consciousness | Eye | Forms |
| Ear-consciousness | Ear | Sounds |
| Nose-consciousness | Nose | Smells |
| Tongue-consciousness | Tongue | Tastes |
| Body-consciousness | Body | Touches |
| Mind-consciousness | Mind | Mental objects |

**Contemplation**:
> "Consciousness has no color, no shape, no location. Yet it is the basis of all experience."

This is the aggregate that most people mistake for "self." But consciousness is **conditioned**. It arises when sense organ meets object. It ceases when conditions end. No conditions, no consciousness.

---

## The Perfect Teaching: One Thought Contains All

In the Perfect Teaching, the contemplation of the aggregates is not sequential (first form, then feeling, etc.). It is **simultaneous and complete**.

### The Method

1.  **Observe one moment of mind** (*yi nian xin* 一念心).
2.  **Recognize** that this one moment contains all five aggregates.
3.  **See** that this one moment contains the ten dharma-realms (hell → Buddha).
4.  **Realize** that this one moment is:
    -   **Empty** (no inherent existence)
    -   **Conventional** (provisionally appearing)
    -   **Middle** (neither empty nor conventional, yet both)

This is **一念三千** (*yi nian san qian*) — "3,000 Worlds in One Thought-Moment."

---

## Miao-lo's Commentary

Miao-lo emphasizes that the aggregates are not mere objects to be analyzed. They are **the manifestation of Dharma-nature itself**.

> "The aggregates are not apart from Buddha-nature. Buddha-nature is not apart from the aggregates. To contemplate the aggregates with the Perfect view is to contemplate Buddha-nature directly."

This is why the *Mohe Zhiguan* does not say "destroy the aggregates" or "transcend the aggregates." It says: **realize the aggregates as they truly are**.

---

## Summary

| Aggregate | Chinese | Key Point |
|---|---|---|
| **Form** | 色 | Empty yet appearing |
| **Feeling** | 受 | Conditioned, no owner |
| **Perception** | 想 | Mental construct, not reality |
| **Formations** | 行 | Source of karma and volition |
| **Consciousness** | 識 | Knowing faculty, also conditioned |

**Perfect Method**: See all five in one thought-moment as the Three Truths.

# Fascicle 3, Section 2: The Ten Modes Applied to Aggregates
## Using the Ten Dharma-Vehicles (十乘觀法)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: The Ten Modes as a Complete System

After understanding the aggregates as the object of contemplation (Section 1), the practitioner now applies the **Ten Modes** (十乘觀法 *Shi Cheng Guan Fa*) to this object.

These Ten Modes are called "Dharma-Vehicles" (法乘) because they **carry** the practitioner from delusion to realization. They are not ten separate practices but **one integrated method** with ten aspects.

---

## Mode 1: Contemplate the Inconceivable Object (觀不思議境)

### The Core Practice

This is the **foundation** of all ten modes. If this mode is mastered, the remaining nine may not be necessary.

**Method**: Observe one moment of mind arising in the aggregates.

**What to See**:
1.  This one thought-moment contains the **ten dharma-realms** (hell, hungry ghosts, animals, asuras, humans, gods, śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, Buddhas)
2.  Each realm contains all ten realms = **100 realms**
3.  Each realm has **ten suchnesses** (如是相 through 如是本末究竟等) = **1,000**
4.  Each is present in **three domains** (five aggregates, sentient beings, lands) = **3,000 worlds**

### The Three Truths in One Thought

When you observe this one thought-moment:
-   **Empty Truth** (空諦): The thought has no inherent existence, no permanent self
-   **Conventional Truth** (假諦): The thought provisionally appears with all its characteristics
-   **Middle Truth** (中諦): The thought is neither empty nor conventional, yet both simultaneously

> "This is not analysis. This is direct seeing. When you see one thought clearly, you see the entire Dharma-realm."

---

## Mode 2: Generate the True Bodhi-Mind (發真正菩提心)

### The Vow

After seeing that one thought contains all beings in all realms, the practitioner generates the vow:

> "I vow to liberate all beings from suffering. I vow to help all beings realize what I have realized."

### The Four Great Vows Applied

| Vow | Application to Aggregates |
|---|---|
| Beings are numberless; I vow to save them | All beings trapped in the five aggregates |
| Afflictions are inexhaustible; I vow to end them | All afflictions arising from aggregate-clinging |
| Dharma-gates are boundless; I vow to master them | All methods for liberating aggregates |
| Buddhahood is unsurpassable; I vow to attain it | Complete realization of aggregate-nature |

### Why This Mode Is Necessary

Without the Bodhi-Mind, contemplation becomes **self-centered**. The practitioner might realize emptiness but lack compassion. This mode ensures that realization leads to action.

---

## Mode 3: Skillfully Stabilize the Mind (善巧安心止觀)

### The Method

Use **Zhi** (止 — calming) and **Guan** (觀 — contemplation) to settle the mind on the aggregates.

**Three Levels**:

| Level | Zhi (Calming) | Guan (Contemplation) |
|---|---|---|
| **Coarse** | Stop gross distraction | Observe gross afflictions |
| **Subtle** | Stop subtle wandering | Observe subtle movements |
| **Ultimate** | Rest in non-stopping | Observe non-observing |

### The Balance

-   **Too much Zhi** → The mind becomes dull, loses clarity
-   **Too much Guan** → The mind becomes scattered, loses stability
-   **Balanced** → The mind is both clear and stable

> "Like tuning a lute: too tight, the string breaks; too loose, no sound; just right, music plays."

---

## Mode 4: Universally Break Through Dharmas (破法遍)

### The Purpose

Even after contemplating the inconceivable nature of the aggregates, **subtle attachments** may remain. This mode systematically deconstructs all views.

### The Four Levels of Breaking Through

| Level | What Is Broken | Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Views of Self** | "I am the aggregates" | See aggregates as empty |
| **Views of Dharmas** | "Aggregates are real entities" | See dharmas as empty |
| **Views of Emptiness** | "Emptiness is the ultimate" | See emptiness as empty |
| **Views of the Middle** | "The Middle Way is supreme" | See Middle as non-abiding |

### The Complete Breakthrough

When all views are broken, what remains? **Nothing to grasp, nothing to reject.** This is true freedom.

---

## Mode 5: Discern Openness and Obstruction (識通塞)

### The Principle

Not all paths lead forward. Some practices **open** the way; others **obstruct** it.

**Openness** (通): Practices that accord with the Three Truths
**Obstruction** (塞): Practices that cling to one-sided views

### Examples

| Practice | Openness | Obstruction |
|---|---|---|
| Contemplating emptiness | ✓ Opens if non-attached | ✗ Obstructs if nihilistic |
| Contemplating form | ✓ Opens if seeing provisional | ✗ Obstructs if reifying |
| Contemplating Middle | ✓ Opens if non-dual | ✗ Obstructs if conceptual |

### The Skill

The practitioner must **recognize** when a practice has become an obstruction and **shift** to what opens the way.

---

## Mode 6: Regulate the Path-Factors (道品調適)

### The 37 Factors of Awakening

When the first five modes are insufficient, the practitioner applies the **37 Factors**:

| Group | Factors | Application |
|---|---|---|
| Four Foundations of Mindfulness | Body, Feelings, Mind, Dharmas | Observe aggregates in detail |
| Four Right Efforts | Prevent, Abandon, Cultivate, Maintain | Manage wholesome/unwholesome |
| Four Bases of Power | Desire, Effort, Mind, Investigation | Develop concentration |
| Five Faculties | Faith, Effort, Mindfulness, Concentration, Wisdom | Balance the practice |
| Five Powers | (Same as Faculties, but stronger) | Overcome obstacles |
| Seven Factors of Awakening | Mindfulness, Investigation, Effort, Joy, Tranquility, Concentration, Equanimity | Approach realization |
| Eightfold Path | Right View through Right Concentration | Complete the path |

### The Regulation

Each factor must be **adjusted** according to the practitioner's current state. Too much effort? Increase tranquility. Too much concentration? Increase investigation.

---

## Mode 7: Apply Antidotes and Supports (對治助開)

### When to Use

If the first six modes are still insufficient, apply **auxiliary practices**:

| Obstacle | Antidote |
|---|---|
| Desire | Contemplate impurity |
| Aversion | Contemplate loving-kindness |
| Delusion | Contemplate dependent origination |
| Pride | Contemplate the elements (earth, water, fire, wind) |
| Scattered thoughts | Count the breath |

### The Support

These practices **support** the main contemplation. They are not the goal but **skillful means** to remove specific obstacles.

---

## Mode 8: Know the Stages (知次位)

### The Six Identities

The practitioner must understand their current level to avoid **pride** (thinking they've arrived) or **despair** (thinking they'll never arrive).

| Stage | Description | Relation to Aggregates |
|---|---|---|
| **Principle Identity** (理即) | Inherently Buddha | Aggregates are Buddha-nature |
| **Name Identity** (名字即) | Hear the teaching | Understand aggregates conceptually |
| **Contemplation Identity** (觀行即) | Begin practice | Contemplate aggregates directly |
| **Resemblance Identity** (相似即) | Approach realization | Aggregates appear as Three Truths |
| **Partial Realization** (分真即) | Break ignorance | See aggregates as they are |
| **Ultimate Identity** (究竟即) | Complete Buddhahood | Perfect realization |

---

## Mode 9: Develop Patience (能安忍)

### The Necessity

The path is long. Obstacles arise. Without **patience** (忍), the practitioner will retreat.

**Three Types of Patience**:
1.  **Patience with suffering** — Endure physical/mental difficulties
2.  **Patience with dharmas** — Accept the teachings without doubt
3.  **Patience with non-arising** — Realize the unborn nature of phenomena

---

## Mode 10: Release Attachment to Dharma (離法愛)

### The Final Obstacle

Even after realizing the nature of aggregates, a subtle attachment may remain: **attachment to the realization itself**.

**Signs of Dharma-Attachment**:
-   Pride in one's attainment
-   Clinging to meditative states
-   Attachment to emptiness
-   Attachment to the Middle Way

### The Release

> "Let go of even the letting go. Release even the release."

When this final attachment is released, the practitioner enters the **first bhūmi** (初地) or the **first abode** (初住) of the Bodhisattva path.

---

## Summary: The Ten Modes as One Vehicle

| Mode | Function |
|---|---|
| 1. Inconceivable Object | Foundation — see 3,000 in one thought |
| 2. Bodhi-Mind | Motivation — vow to save all beings |
| 3. Stabilize Mind | Method — balance Zhi and Guan |
| 4. Break Through | Deconstruction — eliminate all views |
| 5. Discern Openness/Obstruction | Skill — know what helps/hinders |
| 6. Path-Factors | Regulation — adjust the 37 Factors |
| 7. Antidotes | Support — remove specific obstacles |
| 8. Know Stages | Orientation — understand current level |
| 9. Patience | Endurance — persist through difficulties |
| 10. Release Dharma-Attachment | Liberation — let go of attainment |

**Sharp practitioners** may only need Modes 1-5.
**Average practitioners** will need Modes 6-7.
**All practitioners** must understand Modes 8-10 to avoid errors.

# Fascicle 3, Section 3: Troubleshooting Aggregate Contemplation
## Common Obstacles and Their Remedies (對治法門)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: Why Obstacles Arise

Even with correct understanding and proper application of the Ten Modes, practitioners encounter **obstacles** (障礙 *zhang'ai*). Miao-lo explains that these obstacles are not failures—they are **natural developments** in the practice.

# Fascicle 3, Section 4: The Remaining Nine Objects Overview
## When Other Objects Arise (餘九境)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: Conditional Objects

After mastering the contemplation of the **First Object** (Aggregates), the practitioner may encounter one or more of the **remaining nine objects**. These are called "conditional" because they arise **only when needed**.

Miao-lo emphasizes: 
> "If the First Object is thoroughly realized, the remaining nine may never arise. But if they do arise, they must be recognized and worked with using the same Ten Modes."

---

## The Nine Conditional Objects

| # | Chinese | English | Nature |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 煩惱境 | Afflictions | Internal obstacles |
| 3 | 病患境 | Illness | Physical obstacles |
| 4 | 業相境 | Karmic Impressions | Past karma manifesting |
| 5 | 魔事境 | Demonic Interference | External obstacles |
| 6 | 禪定境 | Meditative States | Attainments that may become obstacles |
| 7 | 諸見境 | Wrong Views | Intellectual obstacles |
| 8 | 慢境 | Pride | Attitudinal obstacles |
| 9 | 二乘境 | Two Vehicles | Hīnayāna tendencies |
| 10 | 菩薩境 | Bodhisattva | Advanced experiences |

---

## Object 2: Afflictions (煩惱境)

### What It Is
Strong afflictions (greed, anger, delusion) that arise during practice and **cannot be resolved** through aggregate contemplation alone.

### When It Arises
-   Practitioner has deep-rooted afflictions
-   Past karma activates strong emotions
-   Environmental triggers

### How to Work With It

**Apply the Ten Modes to the affliction itself**:
1.  **Contemplate the inconceivable**: See the affliction as empty, conventional, and middle
2.  **Generate Bodhi-Mind**: Vow to help all beings with this affliction
3.  **Stabilize**: Use Zhi-Guan to settle with the affliction as object
4.  **Break through**: Deconstruct views about the affliction
5.  **Discern**: Know what helps/hinders working with this affliction

> "The affliction is not other than Buddha-nature. To see anger clearly is to see the Dharma-realm."

---

## Object 3: Illness (病患境)

### What It Is
Physical sickness that arises during practice and **interferes** with contemplation.

### Types of Illness

| Type | Cause | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **Four Element Imbalance** | Earth, water, fire, wind out of balance | Medical treatment + contemplation |
| **Karmic Illness** | Past karma ripening | Contemplation + repentance |
| **Demonic Illness** | Māra's interference | Protective practices + contemplation |
| **Practice-Induced** | Improper method | Correct the method |

### How to Work With It

**Use illness as the object**:
-   Contemplate the pain as empty and impermanent
-   See the body as the aggregates (return to Object 1)
-   Apply patience (Mode 9)
-   Seek medical treatment when appropriate

> "Illness is a teacher. It reveals attachment to the body."

---

## Object 4: Karmic Impressions (業相境)

### What It Is
Past karma manifesting as **visions, memories, or experiences** during meditation.

### Examples
-   Visions of past lives
-   Memories of past actions
-   Karmic debts becoming conscious

### How to Work With It

**Do not engage with the content**:
-   Recognize it as karmic manifestation
-   Contemplate it as empty
-   Do not be disturbed or fascinated
-   Continue with the practice

> "Karmic visions are like dreams. They have no substance. Do not chase them or flee from them."

---

## Object 5: Demonic Interference (魔事境)

### What It Is
Obstacles created by **Māra** (internal or external) to disrupt practice.

### Four Types of Māra

| Type | Chinese | Manifestation |
|---|---|---|
| **Affliction-Māra** | 煩惱魔 | Internal afflictions intensifying |
| **Aggregate-Māra** | 陰魔 | Attachment to body-mind |
| **Death-Māra** | 死魔 | Fear of death or impermanence |
| **Heavenly-Māra** | 天魔 | External interference |

### How to Work With It

**The key is non-engagement**:
-   Do not fear or fight
-   Contemplate all phenomena as empty
-   Maintain precepts and protective practices
-   Seek guidance if needed

> "Māra has no power over one who sees emptiness. Like a shadow, it disappears in light."

---

## Object 6: Meditative States (禪定境)

### What It Is
Attainment of **dhyāna** (禪定) or other meditative absorptions that the practitioner might mistake for the final goal.

### The Four Dhyānas

| Dhyāna | Characteristics |
|---|---|
| **First** | Joy and bliss with thought |
| **Second** | Joy and bliss without thought |
| **Third** | Equanimity and subtle bliss |
| **Fourth** | Pure equanimity |

### The Danger

Attachment to these states leads to:
-   Rebirth in the form realm
-   Stagnation in practice
-   Mistaking dhyāna for prajñā

### How to Work With It

**Apply Mode 10 (Release Dharma-Attachment)**:
-   Recognize dhyāna as conditioned
-   See it as empty
-   Do not cling to the experience
-   Continue toward prajñā

> "Dhyāna is like a rest stop on a journey. Enjoy the rest, but do not make it your home."

---

## Object 7: Wrong Views (諸見境)

### What It Is
Mistaken intellectual understandings that arise during practice.

### Common Wrong Views

| View | Error |
|---|---|
| **Eternalism** | Believing in permanent self |
| **Nihilism** | Believing in annihilation |
| **One-sided emptiness** | Clinging to emptiness, rejecting form |
| **One-sided form** | Clinging to form, rejecting emptiness |

### How to Work With It

**Apply Mode 4 (Break Through)**:
-   Deconstruct all views systematically
-   Study the Middle Way
-   Seek guidance from teachers
-   Contemplate dependent origination

> "Views are like chains. Even golden chains bind."

---

## Object 8: Pride (慢境)

### What It Is
Arrogance arising from **partial attainment**.

### Seven Types of Pride

| Type | Manifestation |
|---|---|
| **Simple pride** | "I am better" |
| **Greater pride** | "I am superior to superiors" |
| **Pride of pride** | "I am the best" |
| **Self-pride** | "I am" |
| **Inferior pride** | "I am only slightly inferior" |
| **False pride** | Pride in non-attainments |
| **Perverse pride** | Pride in wrong things |

### How to Work With It

**Study the Six Identities** (Mode 8):
-   Understand the stages clearly
-   Recognize current level honestly
-   Serve others with humility
-   Contemplate the elements

> "Pride is the last fetter. Even advanced practitioners must watch for it."

---

## Object 9: Two Vehicles (二乘境)

### What It Is
Tendency toward **Hīnayāna** (śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha) practice—seeking personal liberation rather than universal Buddhahood.

### Signs
-   Desire to escape saṃsāra alone
-   Lack of compassion for others
-   Satisfaction with partial realization

### How to Work With It

**Recall Bodhi-Mind** (Mode 2):
-   Remember the Four Great Vows
-   Cultivate compassion
-   Study Mahāyāna teachings
-   Engage in bodhisattva practices

> "The Two Vehicles are not wrong, but they are incomplete. The Perfect Teaching embraces all."

---

## Object 10: Bodhisattva (菩薩境)

### What It Is
Advanced experiences on the **Bodhisattva path**—the ten stages (十地), supernatural powers, etc.

### The Danger

Even at this level:
-   Subtle attachment may remain
-   Pride in attainment
-   Dharma-attachment

### How to Work With It

**Apply all Ten Modes**:
-   Continue to see all phenomena as Three Truths
-   Release attachment even to bodhisattva attainments
-   Proceed toward complete Buddhahood

> "The bodhisattva path has many stages. Do not stop until the ultimate goal."

---

## Summary: The Principle of Working with All Objects

**The method is always the same**:
1.  **Recognize** which object has arisen
2.  **Apply the Ten Modes** to that object
3.  **Do not be disturbed** by the object
4.  **Continue** toward realization

| Object | Primary Approach |
|---|---|
| Afflictions | See as empty, generate compassion |
| Illness | Contemplate pain, seek treatment |
| Karmic Impressions | Do not engage, see as empty |
| Demonic Interference | Do not fear, contemplate emptiness |
| Meditative States | Do not cling, continue to prajñā |
| Wrong Views | Deconstruct, study Middle Way |
| Pride | Study Six Identities, serve others |
| Two Vehicles | Recall Bodhi-Mind, cultivate compassion |
| Bodhisattva | Apply all modes, release attachment |

**Miao-lo's Final Point**:
> "Whatever arises, use it. Every object, when properly contemplated, becomes a vehicle to realization."

# Fascicle 3: Closing Summary
## The Practice of Correct Contemplation

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Overview of Fascicle 3

Fascicle 3 transitions from **doctrinal foundation** to **actual practice**. It provides the complete methodology for **Correct Contemplation** (正觀 *Zheng Guan*)—the heart of the *Mohe Zhiguan*.

---

## Summary of Key Sections

### Opening: Introduction to the Ten Objects
-   Explained the structure: Ten Objects + Ten Modes
-   Distinguished universal (Object 1) from conditional (Objects 2-10)
-   **Point**: The aggregates are the gateway to all practice

### Section 1: Aggregates Overview
-   Detailed explanation of the five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness)
-   Three methods: Analytical, Embodying, Inconceivable
-   **Point**: One thought-moment contains 3,000 worlds

### Section 2: Ten Modes Applied to Aggregates
-   Complete exposition of the Ten Modes of Contemplation
-   Application to aggregate contemplation
-   **Point**: The Ten Modes are one integrated method with ten aspects

### Section 3: Troubleshooting
-   Eight common obstacles and their remedies
-   Practical guidance for difficulties
-   **Point**: Obstacles are opportunities, not failures

### Section 4: The Remaining Nine Objects
-   Overview of conditional objects (Afflictions through Bodhisattva)
-   When they arise and how to work with them
-   **Point**: Whatever arises, use it as the object

---

## The Core Teaching of Fascicle 3

**一念三千** (*Yi Nian San Qian* — "3,000 Worlds in One Thought-Moment")

This is not a metaphor or visualization. It is the **actual structure of reality** as revealed through contemplation:

-   **One thought-moment** contains the **ten dharma-realms**
-   Each realm contains all ten = **100 realms**
-   Each has **ten suchnesses** = **1,000**
-   Each in **three domains** (aggregates, beings, lands) = **3,000 worlds**

---

## The Complete Practice Structure

| Component | Number | Function |
|---|---|---|
| **Objects** | 10 | What arises during practice |
| **Modes** | 10 | How to work with what arises |
| **Obstacles** | 8 (common) | Difficulties and their remedies |
| **Core Realization** | 3,000 in One | The inconceivable nature of mind |

---

## The Relationship Between Objects and Modes

**Object 1 (Aggregates)** is the foundation:
-   All practitioners start here
-   If mastered, may not need the others
-   The Ten Modes are applied systematically

**Objects 2-10** are conditional:
-   Arise only when needed
-   Same Ten Modes applied
-   Each becomes a vehicle to realization

---

## Miao-lo's Key Insights

### On the Aggregates
> "The aggregates are not apart from Buddha-nature. To contemplate the aggregates with the Perfect view is to contemplate Buddha-nature directly."

### On the Ten Modes
> "Sharp practitioners may only need Modes 1-5. Average practitioners will need Modes 6-7. All practitioners must understand Modes 8-10 to avoid errors."

### On Obstacles
> "Obstacles are not enemies. They are opportunities to deepen practice. Each obstacle, when properly addressed, becomes a step forward."

### On the Remaining Objects
> "Whatever arises, use it. Every object, when properly contemplated, becomes a vehicle to realization."

---

## What Comes Next (Fascicles 4-10)

With the complete practice methodology established, the *Mohe Zhiguan* proceeds to:

-   **Fascicles 4-5**: Detailed treatment of specific objects and modes
-   **Fascicles 6-7**: Advanced applications and special cases
-   **Fascicles 8-10**: Fruit, Teaching, and Ultimate Return

The Guketsu continues to provide Miao-lo's commentary, clarifying difficult passages and resolving apparent contradictions.

---

## Practical Summary

**For the practitioner**:

1.  **Begin** with the aggregates (Object 1)
2.  **Apply** the Ten Modes systematically
3.  **Recognize** obstacles when they arise
4.  **Work with** whatever objects appear
5.  **Realize** that one thought contains all worlds

**The goal**: Not to transcend the aggregates, but to **realize their true nature** as the Three Truths—empty, conventional, and middle.

<!-- FASCICLE 04 OPENING -->

# Fascicle 4: Introduction to Advanced Practice
## Deepening Correct Contemplation (正觀深入)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: From Foundation to Depth

Fascicle 4 continues the exposition of **Correct Contemplation** (正觀 *Zheng Guan*), moving from the foundational treatment in Fascicle 3 to **advanced applications** and **deeper insights**.

While Fascicle 3 established:
-   The First Object (Aggregates) as the universal starting point
-   The Ten Modes as the complete methodology
-   Overview of the remaining nine objects

Fascicle 4 explores:
-   **Detailed treatment** of specific conditional objects
-   **Advanced applications** of the Ten Modes
-   **Subtle distinctions** in practice
-   **Resolution of complex difficulties**

---

## The Structure of Fascicle 4

Miao-lo organizes this fascicle around **three main themes**:

| Theme | Focus | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Deepening Object Contemplation** | Detailed work with Objects 2-6 | Master conditional objects |
| **Refining the Ten Modes** | Subtle applications and adjustments | Perfect the methodology |
| **Resolving Advanced Obstacles** | Complex difficulties and their remedies | Navigate advanced practice |

---

## Why Advanced Practice Is Necessary

After mastering the basics (Fascicle 3), practitioners encounter **three challenges**:

### 1. Conditional Objects Arise

Not all practitioners will encounter Objects 2-10, but when they do arise, they require **specific understanding** and **skillful handling**.

> "The First Object is like learning to walk. The conditional objects are like learning to run, climb, and dance. Each requires its own skill."

### 2. Subtle Attachments Remain

Even after initial breakthrough, **subtle forms** of attachment persist:
-   Attachment to emptiness
-   Attachment to meditative states
-   Attachment to the method itself
-   Attachment to non-attachment

### 3. Integration Is Required

The Ten Modes must become **spontaneous** rather than deliberate:
-   From technique to nature
-   From effort to effortlessness
-   From practice to realization

---

## The Relationship Between Fascicles 3 and 4

| Aspect | Fascicle 3 | Fascicle 4 |
|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Foundation | Depth |
| **Objects** | Object 1 (detailed), Objects 2-10 (overview) | Objects 2-10 (detailed) |
| **Modes** | Complete exposition | Advanced applications |
| **Obstacles** | Common difficulties | Complex difficulties |
| **Level** | Beginning to intermediate | Intermediate to advanced |

---

## Key Themes in Fascicle 4

### Theme 1: The Afflictions Object (煩惱境)

**When it arises**: Strong afflictions that cannot be resolved through aggregate contemplation alone.

**What Fascicle 4 adds**:
-   Detailed classification of afflictions (根本煩惱 vs. 隨煩惱)
-   Specific methods for each type
-   The relationship between afflictions and Buddha-nature
-   Advanced insight: afflictions as the path

> "In the Perfect Teaching, afflictions are not obstacles to be removed but Buddha-nature to be recognized."

### Theme 2: The Illness Object (病患境)

**When it arises**: Physical sickness interfering with practice.

**What Fascicle 4 adds**:
-   Four types of illness (element imbalance, karmic, demonic, practice-induced)
-   Detailed remedies for each type
-   Using illness as a teacher
-   The non-duality of health and sickness

> "Illness reveals attachment to the body. When seen clearly, illness becomes medicine."

### Theme 3: Karmic Impressions and Demonic Interference (業相境・魔事境)

**When they arise**: Past karma or Māra manifesting during practice.

**What Fascicle 4 adds**:
-   Distinguishing karmic visions from genuine insight
-   The four types of Māra in detail
-   Protective practices
-   The ultimate remedy: seeing all as empty

> "Karma and Māra have no power over one who sees emptiness. They are like shadows—substantial in appearance, empty in nature."

### Theme 4: Meditative States (禪定境)

**When it arises**: Attainment of dhyāna or other absorptions.

**What Fascicle 4 adds**:
-   The four dhyānas and four formless absorptions in detail
-   The danger of attachment to blissful states
-   Distinguishing dhyāna from prajñā
-   Using meditative states as objects of contemplation

> "Dhyāna is concentration. Prajñā is wisdom. Concentration without wisdom is blindness. Wisdom without concentration is instability. The Perfect Teaching unites both."

---

## The Advanced Application of the Ten Modes

In Fascicle 3, the Ten Modes were presented **systematically**. In Fascicle 4, they are applied **flexibly**:

### Systematic vs. Flexible Application

| Approach | When Used | Characteristic |
|---|---|---|
| **Systematic** | Beginning practice | Apply all ten modes in order |
| **Flexible** | Advanced practice | Apply only the modes needed |

**Miao-lo's guidance**:
> "Sharp practitioners may only need Mode 1 (Inconceivable Object). Average practitioners will need Modes 1-5. Those encountering obstacles will need Modes 6-7. All must understand Modes 8-10."

### The Integration of Modes

At advanced levels, the Ten Modes are no longer **ten separate practices** but **one integrated awareness**:

-   **Mode 1** (Inconceivable) becomes the constant background
-   **Mode 2** (Bodhi-Mind) becomes the constant motivation
-   **Mode 3** (Stabilize) becomes effortless
-   **Modes 4-10** arise spontaneously as needed

---

## Miao-lo's Key Insights for Fascicle 4

### On Conditional Objects
> "Do not seek the conditional objects. Do not avoid them. When they arise, recognize them. When they are absent, do not miss them."

### On Advanced Practice
> "The difference between beginning and advanced practice is not in the method but in the depth. The beginner applies the modes deliberately. The advanced practitioner embodies them naturally."

### On Integration
> "When Zhi and Guan are fully integrated, there is no longer 'practice' and 'non-practice.' Every moment is contemplation. Every action is the path."

---

## What to Expect in Fascicle 4

The remainder of this fascicle will provide:

1.  **Detailed treatment of Objects 2-6** (Afflictions, Illness, Karma, Māra, Dhyāna)
2.  **Advanced applications of the Ten Modes** to these objects
3.  **Resolution of complex obstacles** that arise at intermediate and advanced levels
4.  **Integration practices** for making the method spontaneous

---

## Summary

Fascicle 4 is the bridge between **foundational practice** (Fascicle 3) and **complete mastery** (Fascicles 5-10).

| Fascicle | Stage | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | Foundation | Learning the method |
| 4 | Development | Deepening the method |
| 5-10 | Mastery | Embodying the method |

**The practitioner's journey**:
1.  **Fascicle 3**: Learn to walk (basic contemplation)
2.  **Fascicle 4**: Learn to run (advanced contemplation)
3.  **Fascicles 5-10**: Learn to fly (spontaneous realization)

## Working with Strong Emotions (煩惱境詳解)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: When Afflictions Become the Object

The **Afflictions Object** (煩惱境 *Fan Nao Jing*) arises when strong afflictions—greed, anger, delusion—cannot be resolved through aggregate contemplation alone. This is the second of the Ten Objects and the first of the conditional objects.

Miao-lo emphasizes:
> "The Afflictions Object is not a failure of practice. It is a natural development for practitioners with deep karmic roots in affliction. When it arises, it becomes the primary object of contemplation."

---

## Classification of Afflictions

### The Two Main Categories

| Type | Chinese | Error |
|---|---|---|
| View of self | 身見 | Believing in permanent self |
| Extreme views | 邊見 | Eternalism or nihilism |
| Wrong views | 邪見 | Denying causality |
| View-attachment | 見取見 | Clinging to inferior views as supreme |
| Precept-attachment | 戒禁取見 | Clinging to wrong practices |

**How it arises in practice**:
-   Misunderstanding emptiness as nihilism
-   Clinging to one-sided views
-   Attachment to conceptual understanding
-   Mistaking technique for realization

**Contemplation method**:
1.  **Study the Middle Way** to avoid extremes
2.  **Deconstruct all views** systematically (Mode 4)
3.  **Contemplate the Three Truths** to see the complete picture
4.  **Realize** that even views are empty

> "Views are like chains. Even golden chains bind. The Middle Way is freedom from all views."

---

## The Twenty Secondary Afflictions (隨煩惱)

These arise from the six root afflictions and include:

### Small Secondary Afflictions (10)
Anger, resentment, concealment, spite, jealousy, stinginess, deceit, fraud, arrogance, harmfulness

### Medium Secondary Afflictions (2)
Shamelessness, lack of conscience

### Great Secondary Afflictions (8)
Restlessness, torpor, disbelief, laziness, carelessness, forgetfulness, distraction, non-discernment

---

## Applying the Ten Modes to Afflictions

### Mode 1: Contemplate the Inconceivable

**See the affliction as the Three Truths**:
-   **Empty**: The affliction has no inherent existence
-   **Conventional**: The affliction provisionally appears
-   **Middle**: The affliction is neither empty nor existent

> "When you see anger as the Three Truths, anger becomes the Dharma-realm."

### Mode 2: Generate Bodhi-Mind

**Vow**: "I vow to help all beings who suffer from this affliction."

This transforms the affliction from a personal problem into a universal concern.

### Mode 3: Stabilize the Mind

**Use the affliction as the object**:
-   **Zhi**: Calm the mind while the affliction is present
-   **Guan**: Observe the nature of the affliction

### Mode 4: Break Through

**Deconstruct views about the affliction**:
-   "This affliction is mine" → empty
-   "This affliction is real" → empty
-   "I must eliminate this affliction" → empty
-   "Afflictions are obstacles" → empty

### Mode 5: Discern Openness and Obstruction

**What opens the way**:
-   Seeing afflictions as empty
-   Recognizing afflictions as Buddha-nature
-   Using afflictions as the path

**What obstructs**:
-   Suppressing afflictions
-   Indulging afflictions
-   Identifying with afflictions

---

## The Perfect Teaching's View of Afflictions

In the Perfect Teaching, afflictions are not obstacles to be removed but **Buddha-nature to be recognized**.

### The Three Levels of Understanding

| Level | View | Practice |
|---|---|---|
| **Tripiṭaka** | Afflictions are enemies | Eliminate them |
| **Shared/Distinct** | Afflictions are empty | See through them |
| **Perfect** | Afflictions are Buddha-nature | Recognize them |

### The Key Insight

> "Afflictions and Bodhi are not two. When you see afflictions clearly, you see Buddha-nature. This is not suppression. This is not transformation. This is recognition."

---

## Summary

The Afflictions Object requires:
1.  **Recognition** of which affliction has arisen
2.  **Classification** (root or secondary)
3.  **Application** of the Ten Modes
4.  **Realization** that afflictions are Buddha-nature

**Miao-lo's final point**:
> "The practitioner who works with the Afflictions Object deeply will realize that afflictions are the swiftest path to enlightenment. Why? Because they reveal attachment most clearly. When attachment is seen, it dissolves."

# Fascicle 4, Section 2: Illness, Karma, and Māra Objects
## Working with Physical and External Obstacles (病患・業相・魔事境)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: Three Related Objects

This section covers three conditional objects that often arise together:
-   **Illness Object** (病患境) — Physical sickness
-   **Karmic Impressions Object** (業相境) — Past karma manifesting
-   **Demonic Interference Object** (魔事境) — Māra's obstacles

These are grouped because they share common characteristics: they arise from **external or karmic causes** rather than from present mental states.

---

## Part 1: The Illness Object (病患境)

### When It Arises

Physical sickness that **interferes with practice** and cannot be resolved through simple rest or medical treatment alone.

Miao-lo distinguishes this from ordinary illness:
> "Ordinary illness is treated with medicine. The Illness Object arises when sickness becomes a teacher, revealing deep attachment to the body."

### The Four Types of Illness

| Type | Chinese | Cause | Treatment |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Element Imbalance** | 四大不調 | Earth, water, fire, wind out of balance | Medical + contemplation |
| **Karmic Illness** | 業病 | Past karma ripening | Contemplation + repentance |
| **Demonic Illness** | 魔病 | Māra's interference | Protection + contemplation |
| **Practice-Induced** | 禪病 | Improper method | Correct the method |

---

### Type 1: Element Imbalance (四大不調)

**The Four Elements**:
-   **Earth** (地): Solidity, structure
-   **Water** (水): Fluidity, cohesion
-   **Fire** (火): Heat, metabolism
-   **Wind** (風): Motion, breath

**Imbalance manifestations**:
| Element | Excess | Deficiency |
|---|---|---|
| Earth | Heaviness, stiffness | Weakness, instability |
| Water | Swelling, dampness | Dryness, dehydration |
| Fire | Fever, inflammation | Coldness, poor circulation |
| Wind | Restlessness, pain | Lethargy, poor breathing |

**Treatment**:
1.  **Medical**: Adjust diet, environment, activity
2.  **Contemplation**: See the elements as empty and impermanent
3.  **Balance**: Regulate the five matters (food, sleep, body, breath, mind)

---

### Type 2: Karmic Illness (業病)

**Definition**: Illness arising from **past negative karma** ripening in the present.

**Signs**:
-   Sudden onset without clear physical cause
-   Resistant to medical treatment
-   Accompanied by karmic visions or memories
-   Intensifies during practice

**Treatment**:
1.  **Repentance** (懺悔): Acknowledge past actions
2.  **Contemplation**: See karma as empty
3.  **Merit dedication**: Transfer merit to those harmed
4.  **Patience**: Endure with understanding

**The contemplation**:
> "Past karma is like a seed. It has no power until conditions ripen it. When you see karma as empty, the seed loses its power to sprout."

---

### Type 3: Demonic Illness (魔病)

**Definition**: Illness caused by **Māra's interference** to obstruct practice.

**Signs**:
-   Sudden, severe onset during intensive practice
-   Accompanied by disturbing visions or thoughts
-   Disappears when practice stops
-   Returns when practice resumes

**Treatment**:
1.  **Protective practices**: Mantras, precepts, refuge
2.  **Contemplate emptiness**: See all phenomena as empty
3.  **Do not engage**: Ignore visions and disturbances
4.  **Seek guidance**: Consult experienced teachers

---

### Type 4: Practice-Induced Illness (禪病)

**Definition**: Illness arising from **improper meditation technique**.

**Common causes**:
-   Forcing concentration
-   Improper breathing
-   Wrong posture
-   Excessive effort
-   Imbalanced Zhi and Guan

**Treatment**:
1.  **Correct the method**: Adjust technique
2.  **Rest**: Temporarily reduce practice intensity
3.  **Regulate**: Balance the five matters
4.  **Seek guidance**: Learn proper technique

---

### Applying the Ten Modes to Illness

**Mode 1 (Inconceivable)**: See illness as the Three Truths
-   Empty: No inherent existence
-   Conventional: Appears with causes and conditions
-   Middle: Neither existent nor non-existent

**Mode 2 (Bodhi-Mind)**: "I vow to help all beings who suffer from illness"

**Mode 3 (Stabilize)**: Use pain as the object of contemplation

**Key insight**:
> "Illness is not other than Buddha-nature. When you see pain clearly, you see the Dharma-realm. This is not suppressing pain. This is recognizing its true nature."

---

## Part 2: The Karmic Impressions Object (業相境)

### When It Arises

Past karma manifesting as **visions, memories, or experiences** during meditation.

### Types of Karmic Manifestations

| Type | Manifestation | Response |
|---|---|---|
| **Past Life Visions** | Seeing previous existences | Do not engage |
| **Karmic Memories** | Remembering past actions | Observe without attachment |
| **Karmic Debts** | Sensing obligations | Contemplate emptiness |
| **Future Visions** | Seeing potential futures | Recognize as conditional |

---

### The Danger of Engagement

**Do not**:
-   Become fascinated with visions
-   Identify with past lives
-   Become disturbed by karmic memories
-   Cling to pleasant visions
-   Fear unpleasant visions

**Do**:
-   Recognize as karmic manifestation
-   Contemplate as empty
-   Continue with practice
-   Maintain equanimity

> "Karmic visions are like dreams. They have no substance. Do not chase them. Do not flee from them. Simply recognize them as empty."

---

### Distinguishing Karmic Visions from Genuine Insight

| Characteristic | Karmic Vision | Genuine Insight |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | Personal, narrative | Universal, direct |
| **Effect** | Fascination or disturbance | Clarity and peace |
| **Content** | Specific events, people | Dharma-nature, emptiness |
| **Result** | Attachment or aversion | Liberation |

---

### Applying the Ten Modes to Karmic Impressions

**The key**: **Non-engagement**

1.  **Recognize** it as karmic manifestation
2.  **Contemplate** it as empty
3.  **Do not** identify with it
4.  **Continue** with the practice

> "When karmic visions arise, treat them like clouds passing through the sky. The sky is not affected by clouds. Your Buddha-nature is not affected by karma."

---

## Part 3: The Demonic Interference Object (魔事境)

### The Four Types of Māra

| Type | Chinese | Manifestation | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Affliction-Māra** | 煩惱魔 | Internal afflictions intensifying | Contemplate as empty |
| **Aggregate-Māra** | 陰魔 | Attachment to body-mind | See aggregates as empty |
| **Death-Māra** | 死魔 | Fear of death or impermanence | Contemplate deathlessness |
| **Heavenly-Māra** | 天魔 | External interference | Protective practices |

---

### Affliction-Māra (煩惱魔)

**Manifestation**: Sudden, intense afflictions arising during practice

**Examples**:
-   Overwhelming desire
-   Uncontrollable anger
-   Deep depression
-   Extreme pride

**Response**:
-   Recognize as Māra's work
-   Contemplate the affliction as empty
-   Do not suppress or indulge
-   Apply Mode 1 (Inconceivable)

---

### Aggregate-Māra (陰魔)

**Manifestation**: Extreme attachment to or fear of the body-mind

**Examples**:
-   Fear of losing the self
-   Clinging to physical existence
-   Attachment to mental states
-   Resistance to emptiness

**Response**:
-   Contemplate the aggregates as empty
-   Study the teaching on non-self
-   Develop faith in Buddha-nature
-   Gradual approach to emptiness

---

### Death-Māra (死魔)

**Manifestation**: Fear of death or impermanence

**Examples**:
-   Anxiety about mortality
-   Clinging to life
-   Fear of annihilation
-   Resistance to change

**Response**:
-   Contemplate the deathless (不生不滅)
-   Understand emptiness does not mean annihilation
-   See death as transformation, not ending
-   Realize Buddha-nature is unborn and undying

---

### Heavenly-Māra (天魔)

**Manifestation**: External interference from Māra or his retinue

**Examples**:
-   Disturbing visions
-   Voices or sounds
-   Physical sensations
-   Environmental disturbances

**Response**:
1.  **Do not fear**: Fear gives Māra power
2.  **Do not engage**: Ignore visions and voices
3.  **Protective practices**: Mantras, precepts, refuge
4.  **Contemplate emptiness**: See all as empty
5.  **Seek guidance**: Consult teachers if needed

---

### The Ultimate Remedy for All Māra

**Contemplate emptiness**:
> "Māra has no power over one who sees emptiness. Like a shadow, Māra appears substantial but is empty in nature. When you shine the light of wisdom, shadows disappear."

**The Perfect Teaching's view**:
> "Māra is not other than Buddha. When you see Māra clearly, you see Buddha-nature. This is why advanced practitioners thank Māra for revealing attachment."

---

## Summary: Working with Physical and External Obstacles

| Object | Primary Approach | Key Insight |
|---|---|---|
| **Illness** | Contemplate pain as Three Truths | Illness reveals attachment to body |
| **Karmic Impressions** | Non-engagement, see as empty | Karma is like dreams—no substance |
| **Demonic Interference** | Contemplate emptiness, protective practices | Māra has no power over emptiness |

**Miao-lo's final point**:
> "These three objects—illness, karma, and Māra—are often feared by practitioners. But in the Perfect Teaching, they are recognized as teachers. They reveal attachment most clearly. When attachment is seen, it dissolves."

<!-- FASCICLE 04 SECTION 03 -->

# Fascicle 4, Section 3: Meditative States and Integration
## The Dhyāna Object and Spontaneous Practice (禪定境與融通)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: The Subtle Danger of Attainment

The **Meditative States Object** (禪定境 *Chan Ding Jing*) arises when the practitioner attains **dhyāna** (禪定) or other meditative absorptions. This is paradoxically both an achievement and a potential obstacle.

Miao-lo warns:
> "Dhyāna is like honey on the razor's edge. Sweet, but dangerous if you linger. The practitioner must recognize dhyāna as a milestone, not the destination."

---

## The Four Dhyānas (四禪)

### First Dhyāna (初禪)

**Characteristics**:
-   Joy and bliss (喜樂) arising from seclusion
-   Thought and examination (尋伺) still present
-   Five factors: Thought, examination, joy, bliss, one-pointedness

**Experience**:
-   Deep peace and happiness
-   Clarity of mind
-   Physical lightness

**Danger**:
-   Attachment to pleasant states
-   Mistaking concentration for wisdom
-   Desire to remain in this state

**Contemplation**:
> "See the first dhyāna as empty, conventional, and middle. It is a conditioned state, not ultimate reality."

---

### Second Dhyāna (二禪)

**Characteristics**:
-   Joy and bliss arising from concentration
-   Thought and examination cease
-   Three factors: Joy, bliss, one-pointedness

**Experience**:
-   Deeper peace than first dhyāna
-   Internal clarity (內淨)
-   Unified mind

**Danger**:
-   Stronger attachment to bliss
-   Pride in attainment
-   Belief that this is liberation

**Contemplation**:
> "The second dhyāna is more subtle than the first, but still conditioned. Do not mistake depth for completeness."

---

### Third Dhyāna (三禪)

**Characteristics**:
-   Equanimity and subtle bliss
-   Joy ceases, only bliss remains
-   Mindfulness and clear comprehension

**Experience**:
-   Profound peace
-   Subtle happiness
-   Refined awareness

**Danger**:
-   Attachment to subtle bliss
-   Belief in having transcended afflictions
-   Stagnation in practice

**Contemplation**:
> "The third dhyāna is the most blissful of all states. This is precisely why it is the most dangerous. Bliss is still a conditioned phenomenon."

---

### Fourth Dhyāna (四禪)

**Characteristics**:
-   Pure equanimity
-   Neither pleasure nor pain
-   Perfect mindfulness and clarity

**Experience**:
-   Complete mental stability
-   Profound equanimity
-   Clear, bright awareness

**Danger**:
-   Attachment to equanimity
-   Mistaking equanimity for wisdom
-   Belief in having attained the goal

**Contemplation**:
> "The fourth dhyāna is the pinnacle of concentration. But concentration is not wisdom. Dhyāna must be united with prajñā."

---

## The Four Formless Absorptions (四無色定)

Beyond the four dhyānas are four formless absorptions:

| Absorption | Chinese | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| **Infinite Space** | 空無邊處 | Boundless space |
| **Infinite Consciousness** | 識無邊處 | Boundless consciousness |
| **Nothingness** | 無所有處 | Nothingness |
| **Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception** | 非想非非想處 | Extremely subtle state |

**The danger**: These are even more subtle than the dhyānas and thus even more seductive. Practitioners can remain in these states for eons without progressing toward liberation.

---

## Distinguishing Dhyāna from Prajñā

| Aspect | Dhyāna (Concentration) | Prajñā (Wisdom) |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | Stability, one-pointedness | Insight, understanding |
| **Function** | Calms the mind | Sees the truth |
| **Result** | Peace, bliss | Liberation |
| **Danger** | Attachment to states | Attachment to views |
| **Alone** | Leads to rebirth in form/formless realms | Leads to dry wisdom |
| **Together** | The Perfect Path | — |

**Miao-lo's teaching**:
> "Dhyāna without prajñā is blindness. Prajñā without dhyāna is instability. The Perfect Teaching unites both in every moment."

---

## Applying the Ten Modes to Meditative States

### Mode 1: Contemplate the Inconceivable

**See dhyāna as the Three Truths**:
-   **Empty**: The meditative state has no inherent existence
-   **Conventional**: It arises from causes and conditions
-   **Middle**: It is neither existent nor non-existent

### Mode 2: Generate Bodhi-Mind

**Transform the experience**:
-   "I vow to help all beings attain this peace"
-   "I vow to guide all beings beyond attachment to peace"

### Mode 10: Release Dharma-Attachment

**The critical mode for this object**:
-   Recognize the attainment
-   Appreciate it without clinging
-   Continue toward complete realization
-   Let go of even the letting go

> "When you release attachment to dhyāna, dhyāna becomes a tool rather than a trap."

---

## Integration: Making Practice Spontaneous

The final theme of Fascicle 4 is **integration** (融通 *Rong Tong*)—making the Ten Modes spontaneous rather than deliberate.

### Three Stages of Integration

| Stage | Practice | Characteristic |
|---|---|---|
| **Deliberate** | Consciously applying modes | Effort required |
| **Natural** | Modes arise spontaneously | Effortless |
| **Complete** | No distinction between practice and non-practice | Constant contemplation |

---

### From Technique to Nature

**Deliberate stage** (初學):
-   "I will now apply Mode 1"
-   "I will now generate Bodhi-Mind"
-   Conscious effort

**Natural stage** (純熟):
-   Modes arise without deliberation
-   Like a skilled musician playing naturally
-   Effort becomes effortless

**Complete stage** (究竟):
-   Every moment is contemplation
-   Every action is the path
-   No separation between practice and life

---

### The Integration of Zhi and Guan

**Beginning practice**:
-   Zhi and Guan are practiced separately
-   "Now I calm" / "Now I contemplate"

**Intermediate practice**:
-   Zhi and Guan alternate smoothly
-   Balance is maintained

**Advanced practice**:
-   Zhi and Guan are simultaneous
-   Calming IS contemplating
-   Contemplating IS calming

**Perfect integration**:
> "When Zhi and Guan are fully integrated, there is no longer 'calming' and 'contemplating.' There is only the mind resting in its true nature, which is both still and clear."

---

## Signs of Integration

| Sign | Manifestation |
|---|---|
| **Effortlessness** | Practice feels natural, not forced |
| **Continuity** | Contemplation continues in all activities |
| **Flexibility** | Appropriate response arises spontaneously |
| **Stability** | Mind remains clear in all circumstances |
| **Compassion** | Bodhi-Mind is constant, not cultivated |

---

## The Practitioner's Journey Through Fascicle 4

| Section | Object | Key Learning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Afflictions | Afflictions are Buddha-nature |
| 2 | Illness/Karma/Māra | External obstacles are teachers |
| 3 | Meditative States | Attainments can be traps |
| 3 | Integration | Make practice spontaneous |

---

## Miao-lo's Final Teaching for Fascicle 4

> "The advanced practitioner does not seek objects. Does not avoid objects. When objects arise, they are recognized and worked with. When objects are absent, there is no sense of loss. This is the meaning of integration."

> "The difference between beginning and advanced practice is not in the method but in the depth. The beginner applies the modes deliberately. The advanced practitioner embodies them naturally. The master has forgotten both practice and non-practice."

---

## Summary

Fascicle 4 completes the treatment of conditional objects and introduces integration:

**Objects covered**:
-   Afflictions (6 root + 20 secondary)
-   Illness (4 types)
-   Karmic Impressions
-   Demonic Interference (4 types of Māra)
-   Meditative States (4 dhyānas + 4 formless absorptions)

**Key insights**:
-   All objects are Buddha-nature
-   Obstacles are teachers
-   Attainments can be traps
-   Practice must become spontaneous

**The path forward**:
-   Fascicles 5-10 will cover the remaining objects (Wrong Views, Pride, Two Vehicles, Bodhisattva) and the ultimate fruit of practice

# Fascicle 4: Closing Summary
## Advanced Applications of Correct Contemplation

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Overview of Fascicle 4

Fascicle 4 bridges the gap between **foundational practice** (Fascicle 3) and **complete mastery** (Fascicles 5-10). It provides detailed treatment of conditional objects and introduces the concept of **integration**—making practice spontaneous.

---

## Summary of Key Sections

### Opening: Introduction to Advanced Practice
-   Transition from foundation to depth
-   Three challenges: conditional objects, subtle attachments, integration
-   **Point**: Advanced practice requires flexibility and spontaneity

### Section 1: Afflictions Object in Detail
-   Six root afflictions (greed, anger, delusion, pride, doubt, wrong views)
-   Twenty secondary afflictions
-   Application of Ten Modes to afflictions
-   **Point**: Afflictions are Buddha-nature to be recognized, not enemies to be destroyed

### Section 2: Illness, Karma, and Māra Objects
-   Four types of illness (element imbalance, karmic, demonic, practice-induced)
-   Karmic impressions and non-engagement
-   Four types of Māra (affliction, aggregate, death, heavenly)
-   **Point**: External obstacles are teachers revealing attachment

### Section 3: Meditative States and Integration
-   Four dhyānas and four formless absorptions
-   Distinguishing dhyāna from prajñā
-   Three stages of integration (deliberate, natural, complete)
-   **Point**: Attainments can be traps; practice must become spontaneous

---

## The Core Teaching of Fascicle 4

**All objects are Buddha-nature**

Whether afflictions, illness, karma, Māra, or meditative states—all phenomena that arise during practice are **manifestations of Buddha-nature**. The practitioner's task is not to eliminate or transcend them but to **recognize their true nature**.

---

## Key Insights

### On Afflictions
> "Afflictions and Bodhi are not two. When you see afflictions clearly, you see Buddha-nature. This is not suppression. This is not transformation. This is recognition."

### On Obstacles
> "Illness, karma, and Māra are often feared by practitioners. But in the Perfect Teaching, they are recognized as teachers. They reveal attachment most clearly. When attachment is seen, it dissolves."

### On Attainments
> "Dhyāna is like honey on the razor's edge. Sweet, but dangerous if you linger. The practitioner must recognize dhyāna as a milestone, not the destination."

### On Integration
> "When Zhi and Guan are fully integrated, there is no longer 'calming' and 'contemplating.' There is only the mind resting in its true nature, which is both still and clear."

---

## The Conditional Objects Covered

| Object | Key Teaching | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **Afflictions** | Are Buddha-nature | Detailed (6 root + 20 secondary) |
| **Illness** | Reveals attachment to body | Four types with remedies |
| **Karmic Impressions** | Like dreams, no substance | Non-engagement |
| **Demonic Interference** | No power over emptiness | Four types of Māra |
| **Meditative States** | Can be traps | Four dhyānas + four formless |

**Remaining objects** (to be covered in Fascicles 5-10):
-   Wrong Views (諸見境)
-   Pride (慢境)
-   Two Vehicles (二乘境)
-   Bodhisattva (菩薩境)

---

## The Path of Integration

| Stage | Characteristic | Practice |
|---|---|---|
| **Deliberate** | Conscious application of modes | "I will now apply Mode 1" |
| **Natural** | Spontaneous arising of modes | Modes arise without deliberation |
| **Complete** | No distinction between practice and non-practice | Every moment is contemplation |

---

## Miao-lo's Key Teachings

### On Working with Objects
> "Do not seek the conditional objects. Do not avoid them. When they arise, recognize them. When they are absent, do not miss them."

### On Advanced Practice
> "The difference between beginning and advanced practice is not in the method but in the depth. The beginner applies the modes deliberately. The advanced practitioner embodies them naturally."

### On Mastery
> "The master has forgotten both practice and non-practice. Every moment is contemplation. Every action is the path."

---

## What Comes Next (Fascicles 5-10)

With the major conditional objects covered and integration introduced, the remaining fascicles will:

-   **Fascicles 5-6**: Complete treatment of remaining objects (Wrong Views, Pride, Two Vehicles, Bodhisattva)
-   **Fascicles 7-8**: Fruit and results of practice (果報)
-   **Fascicle 9**: How teaching arises from realization (起教)
-   **Fascicle 10**: Ultimate return to the source (旨歸)

---

## Practical Summary

**For the practitioner at this level**:

1.  **Recognize** which object has arisen
2.  **Apply** the Ten Modes flexibly (not mechanically)
3.  **Work with** the object as Buddha-nature
4.  **Move toward** spontaneous integration
5.  **Release** attachment to all attainments

**The goal**: Not to perfect technique but to **embody the teaching** so completely that technique becomes nature.

# Fascicle 5: Introduction to Final Objects
## Completing the Ten Objects (十境圓滿)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: The Final Four Objects

Fascicle 5 completes the treatment of the **Ten Objects of Contemplation** by covering the final four conditional objects:

| # | Chinese | English | Nature |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | 諸見境 | Wrong Views Object | Intellectual obstacles |
| 8 | 慢境 | Pride Object | Attitudinal obstacles |
| 9 | 二乘境 | Two Vehicles Object | Hīnayāna tendencies |
| 10 | 菩薩境 | Bodhisattva Object | Advanced experiences |

These final objects represent **subtle obstacles** that arise at more advanced stages of practice. Unlike the earlier objects (Afflictions, Illness, Karma, Māra, Dhyāna), which can arise at any level, these four typically manifest when the practitioner has already made significant progress.

---

## Why These Objects Are Last

Miao-lo explains the ordering:
> "The first six objects (Aggregates through Dhyāna) are common obstacles that most practitioners encounter. The final four are subtle obstacles that only advanced practitioners face. They are last not because they are least important, but because they arise last."

### The Progression

| Objects | Stage | Characteristic |
|---|---|---|
| **1-6** | Beginning to Intermediate | Gross obstacles |
| **7-8** | Intermediate to Advanced | Subtle obstacles |
| **9-10** | Advanced | Attainment obstacles |

---

## The Nature of Subtle Obstacles

### Gross vs. Subtle Obstacles

**Gross obstacles** (Objects 1-6):
-   Obvious and recognizable
-   Cause clear disturbance
-   Easier to identify

**Subtle obstacles** (Objects 7-10):
-   Hidden and difficult to recognize
-   May appear as virtues
-   Harder to identify

> "Gross afflictions are like thieves in the open. Subtle obstacles are like thieves in disguise. The latter are more dangerous because they are harder to recognize."

---

## Object 7: Wrong Views (諸見境)

### What It Is

**Wrong Views** arise when the practitioner develops **mistaken intellectual understandings** about the Dharma, often based on partial realization.

### Why It Arises at This Stage

After experiencing emptiness or other insights, the practitioner may:
-   Cling to conceptual understanding
-   Mistake intellectual knowledge for realization
-   Develop one-sided views
-   Become attached to their own interpretation

### The Danger

> "Wrong views at the advanced level are more dangerous than gross afflictions at the beginning level. Why? Because the practitioner believes they have understood, and thus stops progressing."

---

## Object 8: Pride (慢境)

### What It Is

**Pride** arises from **partial attainment**—the practitioner has made genuine progress but mistakes it for complete realization.

### The Seven Types of Pride

| Type | Manifestation at Advanced Level |
|---|---|
| **Simple pride** | "I am more advanced than other practitioners" |
| **Greater pride** | "I am more advanced than my teachers" |
| **Pride of pride** | "I am among the most advanced" |
| **Self-pride** | "I have attained the Dharma" |
| **Inferior pride** | "I am only slightly less advanced than the masters" |
| **False pride** | Pride in non-attainments |
| **Perverse pride** | Pride in wrong attainments |

### Why It's Subtle

At advanced levels, pride often disguises itself as:
-   Confidence in the Dharma
-   Certainty in understanding
-   Authority to teach

> "The most dangerous pride is the pride of having transcended pride."

---

## Object 9: Two Vehicles (二乘境)

### What It Is

The **Two Vehicles Object** arises when the practitioner, despite practicing the Perfect Teaching, develops tendencies toward **Hīnayāna** (śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha paths).

### Manifestations

-   Desire for personal liberation only
-   Weariness with saṃsāra
-   Lack of compassion for beings
-   Satisfaction with partial realization
-   Retreat from bodhisattva vows

### Why It Arises

After experiencing the suffering of saṃsāra deeply and tasting the peace of emptiness, the practitioner may think:
> "Why should I remain in saṃsāra to help others? I could enter nirvāṇa now."

### The Antidote

**Recall the Bodhi-Mind** (Mode 2):
-   Remember the Four Great Vows
-   Cultivate great compassion
-   Study Mahāyāna teachings
-   Engage in bodhisattva practices

---

## Object 10: Bodhisattva (菩薩境)

### What It Is

The **Bodhisattva Object** represents **advanced experiences** on the bodhisattva path—the ten stages (十地), supernatural powers (神通), etc.

### Why It's an "Object"

Even at this advanced level, obstacles can arise:
-   Attachment to bodhisattva attainments
-   Pride in supernatural powers
-   Dharma-attachment to the path itself
-   Subtle clinging to the bodhisattva identity

### The Final Obstacle

> "The bodhisattva who clings to being a bodhisattva has not yet completed the path. Only when even the bodhisattva identity is released does one enter complete Buddhahood."

---

## The Relationship Between the Final Four Objects

These four objects form a **progression of subtle obstacles**:

| Object | Nature | Obstacle |
|---|---|---|
| **Wrong Views** | Intellectual | Clinging to understanding |
| **Pride** | Attitudinal | Clinging to attainment |
| **Two Vehicles** | Motivational | Clinging to personal liberation |
| **Bodhisattva** | Identity | Clinging to the path itself |

---

## Applying the Ten Modes to Subtle Obstacles

### The Challenge

With subtle obstacles, the **first five modes** may not be sufficient. The practitioner must:

1.  **Recognize** the obstacle (often the hardest part)
2.  **Apply Mode 4** (Break Through) to deconstruct subtle views
3.  **Apply Mode 8** (Know the Stages) to avoid pride
4.  **Apply Mode 10** (Release Dharma-Attachment) to let go

### The Key Insight

> "Subtle obstacles are overcome not by adding more practice but by releasing attachment to practice itself. This is why Mode 10 (Release Dharma-Attachment) is critical at this level."

---

## Miao-lo's Teaching on the Final Objects

### On Recognition

> "The hardest part of working with subtle obstacles is recognizing them. Gross afflictions announce themselves. Subtle obstacles disguise themselves as virtues."

### On Humility

> "The practitioner who thinks they have transcended all obstacles is precisely the one who has not. True realization is accompanied by profound humility."

### On Completion

> "When all ten objects have been worked with—when even the bodhisattva path is released—what remains? Not emptiness. Not existence. Not the Middle Way. What remains cannot be spoken."

---

1.  **Detailed treatment** of Wrong Views and Pride (Section 1)
2.  **Detailed treatment** of Two Vehicles and Bodhisattva (Section 2)
3.  **Integration** of all ten objects (Section 3)
4.  **Completion** of the Correct Contemplation chapter

---

## Summary

<!-- FASCICLE 05 SECTION 01 -->

# Fascicle 5, Section 1: Wrong Views and Pride Objects
## Intellectual and Attitudinal Obstacles (諸見境・慢境)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: Subtle Obstacles of the Mind

This section covers two closely related objects:
- **Wrong Views Object** (諸見境) — Intellectual obstacles
- **Pride Object** (慢境) — Attitudinal obstacles

Both arise from **partial realization** and represent subtle forms of clinging that advanced practitioners must recognize and release.

---

## Part 1: The Wrong Views Object (諸見境)

### When It Arises

The Wrong Views Object arises when the practitioner:
- Has experienced genuine insight
- Develops conceptual understanding based on that insight
- Clings to the conceptual understanding
- Mistakes understanding for complete realization

> "The danger is not in having views, but in clinging to views. Even correct views, when clung to, become obstacles."

---

### The Five Wrong Views (五惡見)

These are the same five views mentioned in Fascicle 4 as part of the sixth root affliction, but here they manifest at a more subtle level.

#### 1. View of Self (身見 *Shen Jian*)

**At the advanced level**:
- Not the gross belief "I am this body"
- But the subtle belief "I am the one who has realized emptiness"
- Clinging to the identity of "realized practitioner"

**Contemplation**:
> "Who is it that has realized? When you search for the realizer, where is it to be found?"

---

#### 2. Extreme Views (邊見 *Bian Jian*)

**Two extremes**:

| Extreme | Manifestation at Advanced Level |
|---|---|
| **Eternalism** | Clinging to Buddha-nature as a permanent entity |
| **Nihilism** | Clinging to emptiness as annihilation |

**The Middle Way**:
- Buddha-nature is neither permanent nor impermanent
- Emptiness is neither existence nor non-existence
- The Middle Way itself must not be clung to

**Contemplation**:
> "The Middle Way is not a third position between two extremes. It is the release of all positions."

---

#### 3. Wrong Views (邪見 *Xie Jian*)

**At the advanced level**:
- Denying the validity of other teachings
- Believing only one's own understanding is correct
- Dismissing practices or methods that don't align with one's experience

**Examples**:
- "Only sudden enlightenment is valid; gradual practice is inferior"
- "Only emptiness is real; conventional truth is delusion"
- "Only the Perfect Teaching is true; other teachings are false"

**Contemplation**:
> "All teachings are skillful means. To cling to one teaching and reject others is to miss the point of all teachings."

---

#### 4. View-Attachment (見取見 *Jian Qu Jian*)

**Definition**: Clinging to inferior views as if they were supreme

**At the advanced level**:
- Clinging to partial realization as complete
- Believing one's current understanding is final
- Attachment to one's own interpretation of the Dharma

**The danger**:
> "The practitioner who believes they have understood everything has understood nothing. True understanding knows its own incompleteness."

---

#### 5. Precept-Attachment (戒禁取見 *Jie Jin Qu Jian*)

**Definition**: Clinging to wrong practices as if they were liberating

**At the advanced level**:
- Rigid adherence to forms without understanding essence
- Believing that technique alone brings liberation
- Attachment to specific methods or practices

**The balance**:
- Precepts and practices are necessary
- But clinging to them is an obstacle
- Use them skillfully, release them when appropriate

---

### Additional Wrong Views at Advanced Levels

Beyond the five classical wrong views, Miao-lo identifies several views specific to advanced practice:

#### View of Attainment (得見)

**Manifestation**: "I have attained emptiness / the Middle Way / Buddha-nature"

**The error**: Reification of realization into something possessed

**Contemplation**: "What is attained? Who attains? When you search for attainment, where is it?"

---

#### View of Non-Attainment (無得見)

**Manifestation**: "There is nothing to attain, so I need not practice"

**The error**: Nihilistic interpretation of non-attainment

**The Middle Way**: Neither attainment nor non-attainment; practice without seeking

---

#### View of the Teaching (法見)

**Manifestation**: Clinging to the words and concepts of the teaching

**The error**: Mistaking the finger pointing at the moon for the moon itself

**The remedy**: "The teaching is a raft. Once you cross the river, you must let go of the raft."

---

### Applying the Ten Modes to Wrong Views

**Mode 1 (Inconceivable)**: See the view itself as empty, conventional, and middle

**Mode 4 (Break Through)**: Systematically deconstruct all views
- "This view is true" → empty
- "This view is mine" → empty
- "Views are obstacles" → empty
- "I must eliminate views" → empty

**Mode 10 (Release Dharma-Attachment)**: Let go of even the correct view

> "The highest view is no-view. But clinging to no-view is still a view."

---

## Part 2: The Pride Object (慢境)

### When It Arises

The Pride Object arises when the practitioner:
- Has made genuine progress
- Compares themselves to others
- Develops a sense of superiority
- Mistakes partial attainment for complete realization

---

### The Seven Types of Pride (七慢)

At advanced levels, pride becomes extremely subtle:

#### 1. Simple Pride (慢 *Man*)

**Manifestation**: "I am more advanced than practitioners at my level"

**The subtlety**: Often disguised as confidence or certainty

**Contemplation**: "What is this 'I' that is advanced? Where is advancement to be found?"

---

#### 2. Greater Pride (過慢 *Guo Man*)

**Manifestation**: "I am more advanced than those superior to me"

**Example**: Believing one has surpassed one's teachers

**The danger**: Closes off further learning

---

#### 3. Pride of Pride (慢過慢 *Man Guo Man*)

**Manifestation**: "I am among the most advanced practitioners"

**The subtlety**: May be factually true but still an obstacle

**The point**: Even if you are advanced, clinging to that identity is bondage

---

#### 4. Self-Pride (我慢 *Wo Man*)

**Manifestation**: "I am" / "I have attained"

**The core**: Subtle clinging to self-identity

**Contemplation**: "Before you attained, where was this 'I'? After attainment, where is it?"

---

#### 5. Inferior Pride (卑慢 *Bei Man*)

**Manifestation**: "I am only slightly less advanced than the masters"

**The subtlety**: Appears as humility but contains comparison

**The issue**: Still measuring and comparing

---

#### 6. False Pride (邪慢 *Xie Man*)

**Manifestation**: Pride in non-attainments

**Example**: Believing one has attained what one has not

**The danger**: Complete delusion about one's level

---

#### 7. Perverse Pride (增上慢 *Zeng Shang Man*)

**Manifestation**: Pride in wrong attainments

**Example**: Pride in supernatural powers, visions, or experiences

**The teaching**: "Supernatural powers are not the goal. They are byproducts. To be proud of them is to miss the point."

---

### The Relationship Between Pride and the Six Identities

Pride at each level of the Six Identities:

| Identity | Pride Manifestation |
|---|---|
| **Name** | "I understand the teaching better than others" |
| **Contemplation** | "My practice is superior" |
| **Resemblance** | "I have approached realization" |
| **Partial** | "I have broken through ignorance" |
| **Ultimate** | (No pride remains) |

**The key**: At each level, recognize the achievement without clinging to it

---

### Applying the Ten Modes to Pride

**Mode 8 (Know the Stages)**: Understand where you actually are
- Study the Six Identities carefully
- Be honest about your current level
- Neither underestimate nor overestimate

**Mode 2 (Bodhi-Mind)**: Remember all beings are inherently Buddha
- Your progress is not yours alone
- All beings have the same potential
- Serve others with humility

**Mode 10 (Release Dharma-Attachment)**: Let go of attainment
- Even genuine attainment must be released
- Clinging to progress is still clinging
- The highest attainment is no-attainment

---

## The Relationship Between Wrong Views and Pride

These two objects are closely related:

| Aspect | Wrong Views | Pride |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | Intellectual | Attitudinal |
| **Basis** | Partial understanding | Partial attainment |
| **Manifestation** | Clinging to views | Clinging to identity |
| **Remedy** | Deconstruct views | Recognize equality |

**The common root**: Both arise from **reification**—making something solid out of what is empty.

---

## Miao-lo's Teaching on Subtle Obstacles

### On Recognition

> "Subtle obstacles are the hardest to recognize because they disguise themselves as virtues. Wrong views appear as wisdom. Pride appears as confidence. Only through profound self-honesty can they be seen."

### On Humility

> "The sign of true realization is not certainty but humility. The more one realizes, the more one sees how much remains unknown. The master is the one who knows they are still a student."

### On Release

> "To work with wrong views and pride, one must be willing to release even correct understanding and genuine attainment. This is the most difficult release because it feels like losing something precious. But what is released was never truly possessed."

---

## Summary

| Object | Core Issue | Primary Mode | Key Insight |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Wrong Views** | Clinging to understanding | Mode 4 (Break Through) | Highest view is no-view |
| **Pride** | Clinging to attainment | Mode 8 (Know Stages) | Highest attainment is no-attainment |

**Both require**: Profound self-honesty, willingness to release, and Mode 10 (Release Dharma-Attachment)

# Fascicle 5, Section 2: Two Vehicles and Bodhisattva Objects
## Motivational and Identity Obstacles (二乘境・菩薩境)

**Translated by [Your Name/Persona]**
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Source**: The "Repair Manual" (T46n1912)

---

## Introduction: The Final Two Objects

This section completes the Ten Objects with:
- **Two Vehicles Object** (二乘境) — Hīnayāna tendencies
- **Bodhisattva Object** (菩薩境) — Advanced bodhisattva experiences

These represent the most subtle obstacles, arising only at advanced stages when the practitioner has already transcended gross afflictions and even subtle intellectual obstacles.

---

## Part 1: The Two Vehicles Object (二乘境)

### What It Is

The Two Vehicles Object arises when the practitioner, despite practicing the Perfect Teaching, develops tendencies toward the **śrāvaka** (聲聞) or **pratyekabuddha** (緣覺) paths—seeking personal liberation rather than universal Buddhahood.

---

### The Two Vehicles

| Vehicle | Chinese | Focus | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Śrāvaka** | 聲聞 | Hearing the teaching | Personal nirvāṇa |
| **Pratyekabuddha** | 緣覺 | Dependent origination | Solitary realization |

**Both share**: Focus on personal liberation, limited compassion, satisfaction with partial realization

---

### Why It Arises at Advanced Levels

After deep practice, the practitioner may experience:
1.  **Profound weariness** with saṃsāra
2.  **Taste of peace** in emptiness or meditative states
3.  **Desire to rest** from the bodhisattva's work
4.  **Doubt** about the possibility of helping all beings

The thought arises:
> "I have suffered enough. I have worked enough. Why not enter nirvāṇa now and rest?"

---

### Manifestations of the Two Vehicles Object

#### 1. Weariness with Saṃsāra (厭離心)

**Healthy form**: Seeing the suffering of saṃsāra clearly
**Obstacle form**: Desire to escape saṃsāra permanently

**The distinction**:
- Bodhisattva sees suffering but remains to help
- Two Vehicles practitioner sees suffering and wants to leave

---

#### 2. Lack of Compassion (無悲心)

**Manifestation**: "I have realized the truth. Others must find it themselves."

**The error**: Forgetting that one's own realization depended on teachers and conditions

**The remedy**: Recall how you were helped; vow to help others similarly

---

#### 3. Satisfaction with Partial Realization (住化城)

**The metaphor**: The化城 (conjured city) from the Lotus Sutra
- A rest stop on the journey, not the final destination
- Mistaking the rest stop for the goal

**The danger**: Stopping at arhatship instead of continuing to Buddhahood

---

#### 4. Retreat from the Vows (退菩提心)

**Manifestation**: Forgetting or abandoning the Four Great Vows

**The cause**: Exhaustion, doubt, or attachment to peace

**The remedy**: Renew the vows; remember the original aspiration

---

### The Difference Between Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna

| Aspect | Hīnayāna (Two Vehicles) | Mahāyāna (Bodhisattva) |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Personal nirvāṇa | Universal Buddhahood |
| **Motivation** | Escape suffering | Help all beings |
| **View** | Saṃsāra ≠ nirvāṇa | Saṃsāra = nirvāṇa |
| **Practice** | For oneself | For all beings |
| **Result** | Arhatship | Complete Buddhahood |

---

### Applying the Ten Modes to Two Vehicles

**Mode 2 (Bodhi-Mind)**: The critical mode for this object

**Renew the Four Great Vows**:
1.  Beings are numberless; I vow to save them
2.  Afflictions are inexhaustible; I vow to end them
3.  Dharma-gates are boundless; I vow to master them
4.  Buddhahood is unsurpassable; I vow to attain it

**Cultivate Great Compassion**:
- Remember all beings suffer as you have suffered
- Recall how you were helped by others
- Vow to help others as you were helped

**Study Mahāyāna Teachings**:
- Lotus Sutra: One Vehicle, not three
- Heart Sutra: Form is emptiness, emptiness is form
- Vimalakīrti Sutra: Non-duality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa

---

### Miao-lo's Teaching on the Two Vehicles

> "The Two Vehicles are not wrong. They are incomplete. The arhat has realized emptiness but not fullness. The pratyekabuddha has realized dependent origination but not the Middle Way. Both must continue to complete Buddhahood."

> "In the Perfect Teaching, there is no separate nirvāṇa to enter. Saṃsāra, when seen clearly, is nirvāṇa. The bodhisattva does not escape saṃsāra but transforms it through wisdom and compassion."

---

## Part 2: The Bodhisattva Object (菩薩境)

### What It Is

The Bodhisattva Object represents **advanced experiences** on the bodhisattva path:
- The Ten Stages (十地)
- Supernatural Powers (神通)
- Bodhisattva practices and attainments

Even at this advanced level, subtle obstacles can arise.

---

### The Ten Stages (十地)

| Stage | Chinese | Meaning | Realization |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 歡喜地 | Joyful | First breakthrough of ignorance |
| 2 | 離垢地 | Stainless | Purity of precepts |
| 3 | 發光地 | Luminous | Patience and meditation |
| 4 | 焰慧地 | Radiant Wisdom | Burning afflictions |
| 5 | 難勝地 | Difficult to Conquer | Mastery of truths |
| 6 | 現前地 | Manifest | Wisdom of dependent origination |
| 7 | 遠行地 | Far-Going | Skillful means perfected |
| 8 | 不動地 | Immovable | Effortless practice |
| 9 | 善慧地 | Good Wisdom | Perfect teaching ability |
| 10 | 法雲地 | Dharma Cloud | Approaching Buddhahood |

---

### Obstacles at the Bodhisattva Level

Even at these advanced stages, subtle obstacles remain:

#### 1. Attachment to Stages (住地)

**Manifestation**: Pride in having reached a particular stage

**The error**: Reifying the stages into fixed attainments

**Contemplation**: "The stages are skillful designations. Where is the stage to be found?"

---

#### 2. Attachment to Powers (著神通)

**The Six Supernatural Powers**:
1.  Divine eye (seeing distant/hidden things)
2.  Divine ear (hearing distant/subtle sounds)
3.  Mind-reading (knowing others' thoughts)
4.  Recollection of past lives
5.  Supernatural abilities (flying, etc.)
6.  Extinction of outflows (liberation)

**The danger**: Pride in powers, using them for display

**The teaching**: "Powers are byproducts, not goals. Use them to help beings, not to impress them."

---

#### 3. Attachment to Bodhisattva Identity (著菩薩相)

**Manifestation**: "I am a bodhisattva"

**The subtlety**: Even this identity must be released

**The Diamond Sutra teaching**:
> "A bodhisattva who gives rise to the notion 'I am a bodhisattva' is not a bodhisattva."

---

#### 4. Dharma-Attachment (法愛)

**Manifestation**: Attachment to:
- The bodhisattva path itself
- Practices and methods
- Teachings and realizations

**The final release**: Even the path must be let go

---

### The Transition from Bodhisattva to Buddha

**Tenth Stage** (法雲地): The bodhisattva is on the verge of Buddhahood

**The final step**: Release even the bodhisattva identity

**What remains**: Not a "Buddha" as an identity, but Buddha-activity without a doer

---

### Applying the Ten Modes to Bodhisattva Object

**All Ten Modes are necessary** at this level:

**Mode 1**: See all attainments as Three Truths
**Mode 2**: Maintain Bodhi-Mind without clinging
**Mode 3**: Effortless Zhi-Guan
**Mode 4**: Deconstruct even bodhisattva views
**Mode 5**: Discern what truly helps beings
**Mode 6-7**: Perfect skillful means
**Mode 8**: Know you're approaching but not yet at the goal
**Mode 9**: Patience with the final obstacles
**Mode 10**: **Release everything**, even the bodhisattva path

---

### Miao-lo's Teaching on the Bodhisattva Object

> "The bodhisattva path has many stages, many attainments, many powers. But all must be released. The highest bodhisattva is the one who has forgotten they are a bodhisattva."

> "When even the bodhisattva identity is released, what remains? Not emptiness. Not existence. Not a Buddha. Not a non-Buddha. What remains cannot be spoken, but it functions perfectly to benefit all beings."

---

## The Completion of the Ten Objects

With the Bodhisattva Object, the Ten Objects are complete:

| Objects | Nature | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Aggregates | Universal foundation |
| **2-6** | Afflictions → Dhyāna | Common obstacles |
| **7-8** | Wrong Views, Pride | Subtle intellectual/attitudinal |
| **9** | Two Vehicles | Motivational obstacle |
| **10** | Bodhisattva | Identity obstacle |

---

### The Progression

**Objects 1-6**: Gross to subtle obstacles
**Objects 7-8**: Intellectual and attitudinal obstacles
**Objects 9-10**: Motivational and identity obstacles

**The pattern**: Each level requires releasing what was helpful at the previous level

---

## Summary: The Final Two Objects

| Object | Core Issue | Primary Mode | Key Insight |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Two Vehicles** | Seeking personal liberation | Mode 2 (Bodhi-Mind) | Saṃsāra = nirvāṇa |
| **Bodhisattva** | Clinging to path/identity | Mode 10 (Release All) | Even the path must be released |

**The ultimate teaching**:
> "The Ten Objects are not ten separate things to overcome. They are ten aspects of one fundamental clinging—the clinging to self. When self is completely released, all ten objects dissolve simultaneously."

---

## Overview of Fascicle 5

Fascicle 5 completes the treatment of the **Ten Objects of Contemplation** by covering the final four conditional objects that arise at advanced stages of practice.

---

## Summary of Key Sections

### Opening: Introduction to Final Objects
-   The final four objects: Wrong Views, Pride, Two Vehicles, Bodhisattva
-   Why these arise last (subtle obstacles for advanced practitioners)
-   **Point**: Subtle obstacles disguise themselves as virtues

### Section 1: Wrong Views and Pride Objects

-   **Point**: Highest view is no-view; highest attainment is no-attainment

### Section 2: Two Vehicles and Bodhisattva Objects
-   Two Vehicles: Hīnayāna tendencies (weariness, lack of compassion, satisfaction with partial realization)
-   Bodhisattva: Ten stages and attachment to path/identity
-   **Point**: Even the bodhisattva path must be released

---

## The Complete Ten Objects

| # | Object | Nature | Stage | Fascicle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Aggregates | Universal | All | F3 |
| 2 | Afflictions | Conditional | Beginning-Intermediate | F4 |
| 3 | Illness | Conditional | Any | F4 |

---

## The Progression Through the Objects

### Objects 1-6: Foundation to Intermediate

**Characteristics**:
-   Gross to subtle
-   Obvious to hidden
-   Easy to difficult to recognize

**Coverage**: Fascicles 3-4

---

### Objects 7-10: Advanced

**Characteristics**:
-   Extremely subtle
-   Disguised as virtues
-   Require profound self-honesty

**Coverage**: Fascicle 5

---

## Key Insights from Fascicle 5

### On Subtle Obstacles

> "Subtle obstacles are the hardest to recognize because they disguise themselves as virtues. Wrong views appear as wisdom. Pride appears as confidence. Two Vehicles appear as realization. Bodhisattva attainments appear as the goal."

### On Recognition

> "The practitioner who thinks they have transcended all obstacles is precisely the one who has not. True realization is accompanied by profound humility and the recognition that even realization must be released."

### On Release

> "Each level of practice requires releasing what was helpful at the previous level. The beginner releases gross afflictions. The intermediate releases subtle afflictions. The advanced releases even correct views and genuine attainments. The master releases everything, including the release itself."

---

## The Pattern of Release

| Level | What Must Be Released |
|---|---|
| **Beginning** | Gross afflictions |
| **Intermediate** | Subtle afflictions, wrong views |
| **Advanced** | Correct views, genuine attainments |
| **Complete** | Even the path itself |

---

## Miao-lo's Final Teaching on the Ten Objects

### On Completion

> "When all ten objects have been worked with—when even the bodhisattva path is released—what remains? Not emptiness. Not existence. Not the Middle Way. What remains cannot be spoken. It is the inconceivable functioning of Buddha-nature, benefiting all beings without a doer."

### On Integration

> "The Ten Objects are not ten separate things to overcome sequentially. They are ten aspects of one fundamental clinging—the clinging to self. When self is completely released, all ten objects dissolve simultaneously. This is why the Perfect Teaching can bring complete realization in one lifetime."

### On Practice

> "Do not seek the objects. Do not avoid the objects. When they arise, recognize them and work with them using the Ten Modes. When they dissolve, do not miss them. This is the meaning of correct contemplation."

---

## What Comes Next (Fascicles 6-10)

With the Ten Objects complete, the remaining fascicles cover:

-   **Fascicles 6-7**: Further refinement and special cases
-   **Fascicle 8**: Fruit and results of practice (果報)
-   **Fascicle 9**: How teaching arises from realization (起教)
-   **Fascicle 10**: Ultimate return to the source (旨歸)

---

## Practical Summary

**For the practitioner who has completed the Ten Objects**:

1.  **Recognize** that completion is not the end but a new beginning
2.  **Release** attachment to completion itself
3.  **Continue** to function for the benefit of all beings
4.  **Embody** the teaching without clinging to being a teacher
5.  **Rest** in the inconceivable nature of mind

**The ultimate realization**: There is no practitioner, no practice, no objects, no realization—yet practice continues perfectly, benefiting all beings.

# Fascicle 6: Opening — Breaking Through Thought-Delusion
## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 6  
**Translator**: [Your Name]  
**Date**: January 23, 2026

---

## Introduction to Breaking Through Thought-Delusion (破思假)

### The Nature of Thought-Delusion

The text now turns to the second major category of delusion: **thought-delusion** (思惑, *sīhuò*), also called the **three correct poisons** (正三毒, *zhèng sān dú*). This designation requires explanation.

Among the thought-delusions, there are four fundamental afflictions: greed, anger, delusion, and pride. However, pride is subsumed under delusion, leaving three primary categories. These are termed "correct" (正, *zhèng*) for two reasons:

1. They are **not background afflictions** (非背使, *fēi bèi shǐ*) — they arise directly in consciousness
2. They are **not habitual tendencies** (非習氣, *fēi xíqì*) — they are the primary afflictions themselves

### The Structure of Thought-Delusion

**Vertical enumeration** (歷三, *lì sān*): These afflictions pervade the three realms (desire, form, formless).

**Horizontal enumeration** (九地, *jiǔ dì*): Within each realm, they are classified into nine grades or levels of intensity.

The distribution across the three realms:
- **Desire realm**: Four types (greed, anger, delusion, pride) × 3 grades = 12 categories
- **Form realm**: Three types (no anger) × 3 grades = 9 categories  
- **Formless realm**: Three types (no anger) × 3 grades = 9 categories

**Total**: 81 categories of thought-delusion

### Why Nine Grades?

The division into nine grades reflects the progressive nature of wisdom and the gradual elimination of delusion. In reality, the distinctions are infinite — wisdom becomes clearer by degrees, and delusion is exhausted gradually. However, the teaching establishes nine grades as a pedagogical framework.

This ninefold classification serves to:
1. Distinguish levels of practice
2. Determine stages of fruition
3. Provide a map for practitioners

Just as the classification of rebirth in the Pure Land into nine grades is a provisional teaching to accommodate different capacities, so too the nine grades of thought-delusion represent a skillful means rather than an absolute division.

### The Function of Thought-Delusion

**Before elimination**: Each grade of thought-delusion, in its unbroken state, possesses the power to:
- Provide energy for continued existence
- Moisten the seeds of rebirth
- Sustain the cycle of birth and death

**After elimination**: Once a particular fruition is attained and the corresponding delusions are severed, rebirth in that realm ceases.

## The Stream-Enterer's Seven Returns

### The Doctrine

The **Stream-Enterer** (初果, *chūguǒ*; Skt. *sotāpanna*) is distinguished from those who have merely broken through view-delusion by the specific limitation: **at most seven returns** (七反, *qī fǎn*).

This means:
- Maximum of seven more rebirths in the desire realm
- Definite liberation within seven lifetimes
- No possibility of an eighth rebirth

Not all Stream-Enterers require the full seven returns. As the *Laṅkāvat*āra Sūtra* states:

> "The lowest grade requires seven returns; the middle grade, three to five; the highest grade attains *parinirvāṇa* in this very life."

### Explanations from the Treatises

**From the *Satyasiddhi Śāstra* (*Chéng Lùn*, 成論)**:

"In seven lifetimes, the wisdom of the uncontaminated matures. This is like:
- Taking medicine for seven days until the illness is cured
- The *kalala* embryo transforming every seven days
- Family relationships extending to seven generations
- The seven-step snake: due to the power of the four elements, it walks seven steps; due to the power of its venom, it cannot take an eighth"

The power of delusion extends to seven returns; the power of the Path prevents an eighth.

**From the *Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra* (*Pó Shā*, 婆沙)**:

*Question*: Why is it called "seven" and not "fourteen"?

*Answer*: Counting both intermediate existence (*antarābhava*) and actual existence (*bhava*), the number does not exceed seven, hence "seven returns."

Moreover:
- Seven places of birth: human realm plus six desire-realm heavens
- Seven paths cultivated
- Seven afflictions severed

The seven afflictions are:
1. Desire-realm craving (欲愛, *yù ài*)
2. Anger (恚, *huì*)
3. Form-realm craving (有愛, *yǒu ài*)
4. Pride (慢, *màn*)
5. Ignorance (無明, *wúmíng*)
6. Views (見, *jiàn*)
7. Doubt (疑, *yí*)

If we count comprehensively, there should be seven human births, seven heavenly births, and fourteen intermediate existences — totaling twenty-eight births. However, following the primary explanation, we speak of "seven returns."

---

## The Lamp Metaphor: Extinction at Peak Brightness

**As stated in the *Chū Yào Jīng* (出曜經)**:

"Like a lamp that is extinguished precisely when it burns brightest."

This metaphor illustrates that the Stream-Enterer, though still possessing desire and other afflictions, has fundamentally transformed their nature.

### The Transformation of Desire

**Although desire remains**, the Stream-Enterer is protected by the power of the **moral precepts arising from the Path** (道共戒, *dào gòng jiè*):

- Naturally refrains from sexual misconduct
- Avoids improper conduct even with one's own spouse
- Observes proper times and places
- Maintains purity through the power of realization, not mere willpower

This is likened to how insects naturally stay four inches away from a blade — not through conscious effort, but through inherent nature.

### The Distinction from View-Delusion

Having severed view-delusion and attained the wisdom of personal emptiness (*pudgala-śūnyatā*), the Stream-Enterer:

- Still experiences the **three poisons** in isolated, specific instances
- Understands that all dharmas arise from conditions
- Does not grasp at inherent existence
- Maintains correctness regarding the three poisons — hence "correct poisons"

**Though these afflictions can still moisten rebirth**, they no longer create the causes for rebirth in the four evil destinies (hell, hungry ghost, animal, asura realms).

This differs fundamentally from view-delusion, which:
- Involves grasping and attachment
- Follows objects and generates clinging
- Creates causes for rebirth in the four evil destinies
- Operates indiscriminately and pervasively

Therefore, the **correct three poisons** exist in:
- Those with complete bondage (ordinary beings who have not yet attained the Path)
- Noble ones (Stream-Enterers and above)

In noble ones, these afflictions:
- Do not create causes for the four evil destinies
- Arise with discrimination (knowing when to engage and when to refrain)
- Can be deliberately employed or set aside
- Differ entirely from the indiscriminate arising of view-delusion

---

## The Name "Thought-Delusion"

This category is called **thought-delusion** (思惑, *sīhuò*) because:

1. It arises through **repeated contemplation** (思惟, *sīwéi*)
2. It requires **sustained meditation** to eliminate
3. It is severed through the **contemplative path** (修道, *xiūdào*), not the path of seeing

Unlike view-delusion, which can be eliminated suddenly upon seeing the truth, thought-delusion must be worn away gradually through practice.

## Methods of Contemplation: Analytical and Substantial

### The Two Approaches

In contemplating thought-delusion, there are two fundamental methods:

1. **Analytical Contemplation** (析觀, *xī guān*)
2. **Substantial Contemplation** (體觀, *tǐ guān*)

Both methods aim at the same goal — the elimination of thought-delusion and entry into emptiness. However, they differ in approach and are suited to different capacities.

### Why Distinguish These Methods?

The text states: "**Space encompasses both analytical and substantial methods, therefore both must be indicated**" (空兼析體故須標列).

This means:
- The realization of emptiness can be approached through either method
- Both are valid paths within the Hīnayāna tradition
- The distinction helps practitioners choose the appropriate method for their capacity

The same distinction applies to breaking through view-delusion. Now, in the context of the Mahāyāna (*yǎn mén*, 衍門), we revisit this distinction to clarify the proper use of analytical contemplation.

---

## Analytical Contemplation in Context

### The Nature of Analytical Method

The text states: "**In explaining the proper contemplative method, we again clarify the analytical approach**" (正明觀法中初標).

**Key point**: The analytical method, from beginning to end, operates through analysis (*xī*, 析). This distinguishes it from the substantial method.

**Purpose of this discussion**: Not to advocate for the analytical method as the primary approach, but to:
1. Distinguish it clearly from the substantial method
2. Show its limitations compared to the Mahāyāna approach
3. Demonstrate why it is not the main practice (*fēi zhèng yòng yě*, 非正用也)

### Contemplating Desire-Realm Delusions

**Initial framework**: We begin with the delusions of the desire realm, specifically examining one grade of thought-delusion and its three aspects (*sān jiǎ*, 三假):

#### 1. Cause-and-Effect Provisional Designation (因成假)

**External conditions**: The text references the **six objects of desire** (六欲境):

These six objects, as explained in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* (大論, *Dà Lùn*), Volume 21, represent different aspects of sensory attraction:

1. **Color/Appearance** (色) — attraction to physical beauty
2. **Form/Figure** (形容) — attraction to bodily shape and movement
3. **Demeanor** (威儀) — attraction to graceful conduct
4. **Speech** (言語) — attraction to pleasant voice and words
5. **Smoothness** (細滑) — attraction to tactile sensation
6. **Human Form** (人相) — attraction to the general human appearance

**The contemplative analysis**:

When these six external objects meet the internal faculty of mind (*yì gēn*, 意根), they produce:
- **Cause**: The external object
- **Condition**: The internal faculty
- **Effect**: The arising desire (*suǒ shēng fǎ*, 所生法)

This arising desire is what we call the **desire-thought** (欲想). It is a provisional designation based on causes and conditions.

**The six objects in detail** (from *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*, Vol. 21):

The treatise explains that practitioners may be attached to different aspects:

1. Some are染著 (attached) to **color** — blue, yellow, red, white
2. Some, though not attached to color, are attached to **form** — delicate skin, slender fingers, beautiful eyes, arched eyebrows
3. Some are not attached to form but to **demeanor** — walking, standing, sitting, lying down; bowing, looking, extending and contracting limbs; raising eyebrows, glancing; approaching, touching
4. Some are attached to **speech** — soft, skillful words that accord with one's wishes
5. Some are attached to **smoothness** — soft flesh, warm in winter, cool in summer
6. Some are attached to the general **human form** — simply the fact of being male or female

**Treatment**: The **nine contemplations** (九想) are prescribed to counter these six desires. (Details in the Meditation Manual, *Chán Mén*, 禪門)

**Manifestation of desire**:

When these six objects trigger internal responses, the **desire-mark** (貪相) manifests externally. This is the arising of desire based on the six objects meeting the mind-faculty.

**Comparison with attainment**:

Even a **Stream-Enterer** (初果, *chūguǒ*) still has these desires arise, though they are transformed. How much more so for ordinary practitioners!

Even an **Arhat** (無學, *wúxué*) may have residual desire-habits (*xí*, 習), as exemplified by **Nanda** (難陀), whose desire-habits were so strong they manifested even after attaining Arhatship.

**Scriptural reference**: The *Lotus Sūtra* teaches that one should not even give rise to **desire-thought** (欲想), let alone engage in physical union. The text further distinguishes **desire-marks** (欲相) from desire-thought.

**The six desire-marks** (according to the *Abhidharmakośa*, 俱舍):

Different realm-beings experience desire differently:

1. **Earth-dwelling beings** (地居, *dì jū*) — physical union
2. **Trāyastriṃśa Heaven** (忉利天) — embracing
3. **Yāma Heaven** (夜摩天) — holding hands  
4. **Tuṣita Heaven** (兜率天) — gazing and smiling
5. **Nirmāṇarati Heaven** (化樂天) — just gazing
6. **Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven** (他化天) — just looking

The teaching is: One should not even give rise to the thought, let alone engage in the looking, smiling, or physical contact.

**Additional context** (*Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra*, 婆沙):

The four continents also differ in desire:

- **Jambudvīpa** (this continent): Countless acts of desire
- **Pūrvavideha** (Eastern continent): Up to 12 times, down to 10
- **Aparagodānīya** (Western continent): Many as 7-8, few as 4-5  
- **Uttarakuru** (Northern continent): Up to 5, down to 3-4; some practice celibacy

Thus, those with excessive desire are worse than animals. Yet this continent also has those with little desire, even practicing pure conduct (*fàn xíng*, 梵行).

**The range of desire**: From the grossest (more than animals) to the subtlest (celibate practice), desire manifests in countless gradations.

#### Applying Contemplation to Cause-and-Effect

**The method**: "**If one grasps at the six marks and allows the mind to move internally, this is the arising of the provisional**" (若取前六相內動意根即是所生).

When desire arises based on these conditions, one applies contemplation:

**The fourfold analysis**:

1. Does desire arise from the **external object** alone?
2. Does it arise from the **internal faculty** alone?
3. Does it arise from **both together**?
4. Does it arise from **neither** (without cause)?

**Result of analysis**:

Through this fourfold examination, one discovers:
- No inherent **nature of desire** (欲性) can be found
- The **four propositions** (四句) are empty
- This is **emptiness of inherent nature** (性空)
- This is **emptiness of characteristics** (相空)

**For sharp faculties**: After breaking through the four propositions regarding existence, they immediately attain realization. This is the **direct path** (利根二行).

**For dull faculties**: If realization does not occur, they must employ the **sixty-four examinations** (六十四番). This involves examining each of the four propositions through sixteen perspectives, totaling sixty-four analytical approaches.

#### 2. Continuous Provisional Designation (相續假)

**The principle**: The *Vinaya* states, "**One should prevent continuous desire from leading to action**" (制內相續).

This means:
- Preventing the continuity of desire
- Not allowing desire to develop into physical action
- Recognizing that even continuous thought, without action, must be contemplated

**Contemplative approach**: Similar to the cause-and-effect analysis, one examines the continuous arising of desire through the fourfold analysis, discovering its emptiness.

#### 3. Relative Provisional Designation (相待假)

**The principle**: Understanding that all designations are relative and lack inherent reality.

**Example contemplations**:
- Desire is designated in relation to non-desire
- Purity is designated in relation to impurity  
- These are merely conceptual constructs

**Result**: Through examining the relative nature of all designations, one realizes:
- **Emptiness of inherent nature** (性空)
- **Emptiness of characteristics** (相空)

---

## Gradual Elimination Through the Nine Grades

**The process**: 

"**The first grade also has three provisional designations. The remaining grades should be understood by analogy**" (初品下明餘品亦有三假).

Each of the nine grades of desire-realm thought-delusion contains these three provisional designations. By contemplating each grade through these three aspects, one progressively eliminates thought-delusion.

**Extension to other afflictions**:

"**Breaking through greed, the other afflictions follow the same pattern**" (破貪下餘使亦例).

The same contemplative method applies to:
- Anger (瞋)
- Delusion (癡)  
- Pride (慢)

**Completion**: 

"**Through the nine grades, one achieves the breaking through of non-arising**" (九品下結成無生破遍也).

When all nine grades of all afflictions are broken through, one achieves:
- **Non-arising** (無生) — the cessation of rebirth
- **Complete breaking through** (破遍) — thorough elimination

# Fascicle 6: Section 2 — The Four Gates
## Scholarly Translation

**Translator**: [Your Name]  
**Date**: January 23, 2026

## The Four Gates: Methods of Entry

### Introduction to the Four Gates

Having established the methods of contemplation (analytical and substantial), the text now addresses the **four gates** (四門, *sì mén*) — four distinct approaches to entering the truth.

**The fundamental question**: Why must we distinguish these four gates when examining the breaking through of delusions?

**The answer**: "**To penetrate the principle, therefore the sixteen gates all break through view and thought**" (為通理故故十六門並破見思).

The principle (*lǐ*, 理) is singular, but the gates of entry are multiple. The **sixteen gates** refer to:
- Four gates for each of the four teachings (Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct, Perfect)
- 4 × 4 = 16 total approaches

All sixteen gates serve the same ultimate purpose: breaking through view-delusion and thought-delusion to realize emptiness.

---

## The Four Gates of the Tripiṭaka Teaching

### 1. The Gate of Existence (有門)

**Doctrinal foundation**: This gate is based on the *Abhidharma* teachings that establish the existence of dharmas.

**Initial contemplation**: 

The text cites the *Abhidharma* treatises: "**Contemplate that all conditioned dharmas arise from causes and conditions**" (觀一切有為法從因緣生).

This means:
- All phenomena arise through causation
- Nothing exists independently
- Everything is interdependent

**Application to breaking through**:

"**Contemplating in this way breaks through delusions**" (如此下用觀破惑).

By understanding that all dharmas arise from causes and conditions, one realizes:
- No permanent self
- No inherent existence
- All is empty of self-nature

**Historical example**:

"**The five bhikṣus at Deer Park**" (鹿苑下明得益之人).

The Buddha's first five disciples — Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya (阿若憍陳如), Aśvajit (頞鞞), Bhadrika (跋提), Mahānāman (十力迦葉), and Daśabala-Kāśyapa (拘利太子) — all attained realization through this gate.

**The encounter with Śāriputra**:

When Aśvajit (頞鞞) met Śāriputra, he spoke the famous verse:

> "All dharmas arise from conditions,  
> The Tathāgata has explained their causes,  
> And also their cessation —  
> This is what the Great Śramaṇa teaches."

This verse contains three of the Four Noble Truths:
- "Arise from conditions" = **Suffering** (苦諦)
- "Explained their causes" = **Origin** (集諦)  
- "Their cessation" = **Cessation** (滅諦)

Upon hearing this, Śāriputra attained the **fruit of Stream-Entry**.

**The twelve hundred disciples**:

The text mentions "**one thousand two hundred**" (千二百人) — this refers to:
- The three Kāśyapa brothers and their 1,000 disciples
- Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana with their 200 disciples

(Note: The text is missing fifty to make the traditional 1,250, but this is a common textual variation.)

**The necessity of skillful means**:

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* warns: "**The great physician must employ skillful means**" (大論下明用門者善須方便).

Even though this gate leads to realization, one must not become attached to it. The *Prajñāpāramitā* teaches non-attachment (*wú zhuó*, 無著) as its essence.

**If one uses existence, one falls into the trap of existence**.

The same applies to all four gates — each can become an obstacle if grasped.

**Evidence from the *Mahāsaṃnipāta Sūtra***:

The text cites examples of people in the Buddha's time who attained realization through the gate of existence, demonstrating its efficacy when properly applied.

### 2. The Gate of Emptiness (空門)

**Doctrinal foundation**:

"**Therefore it is said: 'Is it old age and death? Or who experiences old age and death?'**" (故彼下證門體).

This refers to the contemplation of the **twelve links of dependent origination** (十二因緣) from the perspective of emptiness.

**The two emptinesses**:

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* explains:

1. **Emptiness of persons** (生空, *shēng kōng*): 
   - "Who experiences old age and death?" — There is no person
   - This refutes the notion of a permanent self

2. **Emptiness of dharmas** (法空, *fǎ kōng*):
   - "Is it old age and death?" — There is no inherent old age and death
   - This refutes the inherent existence of phenomena

**The Great Emptiness Sūtra**:

The Buddha taught this in the village of Gavāṃpati (調牛聚落), calling it the "**Great Emptiness Sūtra**" (大空經) because it contains both emptinesses.

**Clarification on "dharma-emptiness"**:

Some claim that Hīnayāna only teaches person-emptiness, not dharma-emptiness. However, this is a misunderstanding.

**The text clarifies**:

In the Hīnayāna context:
- **Person-emptiness** = emptiness of self and possessions
- **Dharma-emptiness** = emptiness of the five aggregates as inherently existing entities

In the Mahāyāna context:
- **Person-emptiness** = same as above
- **Dharma-emptiness** = emptiness of all phenomena, including nirvāṇa and Buddha-dharmas

**Therefore**: When scriptures say that śrāvakas only attain person-emptiness, this is a **comparative statement** (與奪之言) — giving to one side while taking from another. It does not mean they have no realization of dharma-emptiness at all.

**Subhūti's specialization**:

"**Subhūti's wisdom of emptiness was particularly clear**" (須菩提空智偏明等者).

Though Subhūti was an Arhat like others, his particular strength was in the contemplation of emptiness.

**The stone chamber contemplation**:

When the Buddha descended from Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, all disciples rushed to see him. Subhūti remained in his stone chamber, thinking:

> "Should I go to see the Buddha, or should I not? The Buddha constantly teaches that if one observes the Dharma-body through wisdom, this is the supreme way of seeing the Buddha."

He then contemplated: "This great assembly, though magnificent, is impermanent. All conditioned things return to extinction."

Through this contemplation of impermanence as a gateway, he realized that **all dharmas are empty and without reality**.

At that moment, he attained realization.

Meanwhile, the bhikṣuṇī Utpalavarṇā (蓮華色比丘尼) transformed herself into a wheel-turning king to be first to see the Buddha. But the Buddha said:

> "You were not first to see me. Subhūti was first to see me. Why? Because Subhūti contemplated the emptiness of all dharmas and saw the Dharma-body. This is true offering — the supreme offering. It is not offering to the physical body that constitutes true offering."

**Empowerment in the *Prajñāpāramitā***:

"**The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra* records his empowerment**" (大品被加等者).

The Buddha empowered Subhūti to teach the *Prajñāpāramitā* because:
- Subhūti's realization of emptiness accorded with the *Prajñāpāramitā*
- The Buddha also empowered Śāriputra for his wisdom

The text states: "**Desiring to use the great emptiness to parallel the small emptiness**" (故云欲以大空並小空等).

This means the *Prajñāpāramitā* extensively teaches emptiness, so the Buddha empowered these two disciples — one for emptiness, one for wisdom.

**The necessity of skillful means**:

As with the gate of existence, the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* warns that one must employ skillful means when using this gate, lest attachment to emptiness become an obstacle.

### 3. The Gate of Both Existence and Emptiness (亦有亦空門)

**The third gate** combines the insights of the first two gates, recognizing both the provisional existence of phenomena and their ultimate emptiness.

**Textual note**: The text briefly mentions this gate with the notation "**斥非中盪**" — indicating that this gate sweeps away the extremes of the previous two.

**The principle**: 
- Phenomena provisionally exist (有)
- Yet they are ultimately empty (空)
- Both perspectives are necessary

### 4. The Gate of Neither Existence nor Emptiness (非有非空門)

**The fourth gate** transcends both existence and emptiness, entering the realm of the inexpressible.

**Historical example**:

"**Chāṇakya**" (車匿) — one of the Buddha's attendants.

Before his *parinirvāṇa*, the Buddha instructed Ānanda on four matters, including how to deal with the ill-tempered Chāṇakya:

> "Treat him according to the Brahma-method. If his mind becomes gentle and compliant, teach him the *Nādakātyāyana Sūtra*."

**The teaching**: "**Separate from existence and non-existence, one can attain the Way**" (離有離無乃可得道).

This sūtra teaches:
- Not grasping at existence
- Not grasping at non-existence  
- Transcending both extremes

**Contemplation of the境**:

When contemplating phenomena (*jìng*, 境):
- "**Provisional non-existence is the same as before**" (假無同前)
- One recognizes that both existence and non-existence are provisional designations
- Both are ultimately empty

**The observation method**:

"**Making this contemplation**" (作此觀者) — one applies the fourfold analysis to this gate as well, discovering that neither existence nor non-existence can be found.

**Result**:

"**Contemplating in this way**" (如此下破惑結成) — through this contemplation, one breaks through delusions and achieves realization.

---

## The Unity of the Four Gates

**The principle**: "**The four gates, though different, all lead to the same principle**" (四門下明門異理同).

**Explanation**:

Though there are four distinct approaches:
- They all aim at the same truth
- They all break through the same delusions
- They all lead to the same realization

**Metaphor**: Like four doors to a single room — the doors are different, but the room is one.

**Scriptural evidence**: The text provides法譬證 (dharma, metaphor, and scriptural proof) to establish this point.

**Resolving disputes**:

"**Relying on principle to resolve disputes**" (依理通諍中) — when different schools argue about which gate is superior, one must return to the principle: all gates lead to the same truth.

**Example of Bhadanta Dharmatrāta**:

Bhadanta Dharmatrāta (跋摩, *Bá Mó*) — a master who came to China during the Liu Song dynasty and resided at Jetavana Monastery.

Before his death, he left a letter describing his realization, stating he had attained the second fruit. He wrote forty-six verses, including:

> "That Abhidharma speaks of the five-cause dharma,  
> The true meaning cultivates wisdom,  
> The name-giver cannot see it...  
> Various treatises have different approaches,  
> But the principle of cultivation is not two."

**The point**: Though Bhadanta Dharmatrāta followed the *Abhidharma* (which emphasizes the gate of existence), and others followed the *Satyasiddhi Śāstra* (which emphasizes emptiness), both attained realization.

**The error**: Some criticized those who followed different gates, saying they could not attain the Way. This is mistaken.

**The truth**: "**True principle is silent and empty**" (真諦寂寥等非偈文也) — the ultimate truth transcends all conceptual frameworks. Different gates are merely skillful means.

## Summary of Fascicle 6

### Core Teachings

This fascicle has presented the essential methods for **breaking through thought-delusion** (破思假, *pò sī jiǎ*), the second major category of afflictions that must be eliminated on the path to liberation.

### Key Doctrinal Points

**1. The Nature of Thought-Delusion**

Unlike view-delusion, which can be eliminated suddenly through insight, thought-delusion must be worn away gradually through sustained practice. These are the **three correct poisons** (正三毒):
- Greed (貪)
- Anger (瞋)
- Delusion (癡)

They are termed "correct" because, though still afflictions, they no longer create causes for rebirth in the four evil destinies.

**2. The Structure: Nine Grades Across Three Realms**

The systematic classification into **81 categories** provides a map for practitioners:
- Desire realm: 4 afflictions × 9 grades = 36 categories
- Form realm: 3 afflictions × 9 grades = 27 categories
- Formless realm: 3 afflictions × 9 grades = 18 categories

**3. The Stream-Enterer's Path**

The doctrine of **seven returns** establishes:
- Maximum of seven more rebirths
- Progressive elimination of thought-delusion
- Definite liberation within seven lifetimes

**4. Two Methods of Contemplation**

**Analytical Contemplation** (析觀):
- Breaking down phenomena into components
- Examining causes and conditions
- Suited to those of duller faculties
- Requires sustained, methodical practice

**Substantial Contemplation** (體觀):
- Direct perception of emptiness
- Immediate realization of non-inherent existence
- Suited to those of sharper faculties
- Can achieve realization more swiftly

**5. The Three Provisional Designations**

Applied to each grade of affliction:
- **Cause-and-Effect** (因成假): Understanding how afflictions arise from conditions
- **Continuous** (相續假): Recognizing the stream-like nature of mental states
- **Relative** (相待假): Seeing how all designations are interdependent

**6. The Four Gates**

Four distinct approaches to entering the truth:

**Gate of Existence** (有門):
- Contemplating how all dharmas arise from causes and conditions
- Realizing non-self through understanding interdependence
- Exemplified by the Buddha's first five disciples

**Gate of Emptiness** (空門):
- Contemplating the absence of inherent existence
- Realizing both person-emptiness and dharma-emptiness
- Exemplified by Subhūti's realization

**Gate of Both** (亦有亦空門):
- Recognizing provisional existence and ultimate emptiness
- Avoiding the extremes of reification and nihilism
- Integrating both perspectives

**Gate of Neither** (非有非空門):
- Transcending both existence and non-existence
- Entering the inexpressible truth
- Beyond all conceptual frameworks

### Methodological Principles

**1. The Unity of Diverse Methods**

Though the gates differ, they all lead to the same realization. The principle is one; the approaches are many. This prevents sectarian attachment while honoring diverse capacities.

**2. The Necessity of Skillful Means**

Each method, while effective, can become an obstacle if grasped. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* repeatedly warns against attachment to any particular approach.

**3. Progressive Elimination**

The nine grades represent a gradual process:
- Each grade contains the three provisional designations
- Each must be contemplated and broken through
- The process extends to all afflictions
- Complete elimination results in non-arising (無生)

### Integration with Previous Fascicles

**Building on Fascicle 5**:
- Completed the treatment of the Ten Objects
- Established the foundation for breaking through delusions
- Prepared practitioners for the systematic elimination of afflictions

**Preparing for Fascicle 7**:
- Further refinement of contemplative methods
- Deeper exploration of the Middle Way
- Advanced applications of the principles established here

### Practical Implications

**For Practitioners**:

1. **Recognize the nature of remaining afflictions**: Though view-delusion is broken, thought-delusion persists and must be addressed systematically.

2. **Choose an appropriate method**: Whether analytical or substantial, the method should accord with one's capacity and temperament.

3. **Apply the three provisional designations**: Each affliction must be examined through cause-and-effect, continuity, and relativity.

4. **Work through the grades progressively**: From upper-upper to lower-lower, each grade must be contemplated and eliminated.

5. **Avoid attachment to method**: The gate is a means, not an end. Do not grasp at the approach itself.

### The Path Forward

Having established these methods for breaking through thought-delusion, the practitioner is equipped to:
- Systematically eliminate the 81 categories of affliction
- Progress through the stages of realization
- Ultimately achieve liberation from cyclic existence

The work is gradual, requiring sustained effort over potentially multiple lifetimes. Yet the path is clear, the methods are proven, and the goal is certain.

---

## Concluding Reflection

Miao-lo's commentary illuminates the practical application of Zhiyi's teachings. By distinguishing methods, clarifying approaches, and providing systematic frameworks, this fascicle serves as an indispensable guide for serious practitioners.

The emphasis on both precision (in the classification of afflictions) and flexibility (in the choice of methods) reflects the Tiantai tradition's characteristic balance of rigor and adaptability.

As we conclude this fascicle, we are reminded that the path to liberation, though demanding, is accessible to all who apply themselves with diligence, wisdom, and skillful means.

# Fascicle 7: Opening — The Latter Six Modes of Contemplation
## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 7 (止觀輔行傳弘決卷第七)
**Author**: Miao-lo (Zhanran, 湛然, 711-782 CE)
**Translator**: William Altig / Claude
**Date**: January 23, 2026

## Overview

Fascicle 7 of the *Zhiguan Fuxing Zhuan Hongjue* (止觀輔行傳弘決) continues Miao-lo's commentary on Zhiyi's *Mohe Zhiguan*, addressing the latter six of the Ten Modes of Contemplation (十乘觀法). While Fascicles 5-6 treated the first four modes—establishing the foundational contemplation—this fascicle provides the diagnostic, therapeutic, and culminating practices necessary for complete realization.

---

## The Ten Modes: Structural Overview

The Ten Modes (十乘觀法) constitute Zhiyi's comprehensive methodology for contemplative practice. They function as a progressive yet interpenetrating system:

### Modes 1-4: Foundational Practice
1. **Contemplating the Inconceivable Object** (觀不思議境) — Ichinen Sanzen
2. **Arousing the True Bodhi-Mind** (發真正菩提心)
3. **Skillfully Settling the Mind** (善巧安心)
4. **Breaking Through All Dharmas** (破法遍)

### Modes 5-10: Diagnostic and Culminating Practice (This Fascicle)
5. **Discerning Openness and Obstruction** (通塞)
6. **Adjusting the Path Factors** (道品調適)
7. **Counteractive Aids for Opening** (對治助開)
8. **Knowing the Sequential Positions** (知次位)
9. **Patient Endurance** (安忍)
10. **Freedom from Dharma-Attachment** (無法愛)

---

## Mode 5: Discerning Openness and Obstruction (通塞)

### Doctrinal Context

The term 通塞 (tōng sè) denotes the practitioner's ability to discern whether the contemplative path is "open" (通) or "obstructed" (塞). This mode addresses a critical juncture in practice: having employed the breaking-through contemplation of Mode 4, the practitioner must now assess whether genuine progress has occurred or whether new obstructions have arisen.

Miao-lo states:
> 恐於通中翻起於塞
> "There is concern that within openness, obstruction may instead arise."

This indicates that even correct practice can generate attachment to the practice itself, thereby creating new obstacles.

### The Four-Sentence Examination (四句檢校)

Miao-lo presents a fourfold diagnostic:

1. **塞中得通** — Obtaining openness within obstruction
2. **通中有塞** — Finding obstruction within openness
3. **塞自是塞** — Obstruction that is simply obstruction
4. **通自是通** — Openness that is simply openness

This tetralemma ensures comprehensive examination of the practitioner's condition.

### The Metaphors

**Removing the Film, Nurturing the Pearl (除膜養珠)**
The eye covered by a film cannot see clearly. Removing the film reveals what was always present—the pearl of Buddha-nature. Practice does not create Buddha-nature but removes what obscures it.

**Destroying Bandits, Protecting Generals (破賊護將)**
If a general becomes a bandit, that general must also be destroyed. This metaphor indicates that no practice—however beneficial—is exempt from examination. Even the "general" of contemplation can become the "bandit" of attachment.

### The 500 Yojanas (五百由旬)

Miao-lo connects this mode to the *Lotus Sūtra*'s parable of the guide who leads travelers through a dangerous wilderness of 500 yojanas. The guide "knows openness and obstruction" (導師善知通塞). Miao-lo critiques six earlier interpretations of this passage, demonstrating that each captured only partial meaning.

### Four Types of Openness and Obstruction

1. **Horizontal (橫通塞)** — Viewing all afflictions simultaneously
2. **Vertical (竪通塞)** — Progressing through stages sequentially
3. **Horizontal-Distinct (橫別通塞)** — Different practitioners entering through different gates
4. **One-Mind (一心通塞)** — All three truths complete in a single moment of thought

The fourth—one-mind openness and obstruction—represents the distinctively Tiantai approach, wherein horizontal and vertical are integrated in non-dual contemplation.

---

## Mode 6: Adjusting the Path Factors (道品調適)

### The Thirty-Seven Factors of Awakening

This mode addresses the proper application of the traditional thirty-seven factors (三十七道品):

- Four Foundations of Mindfulness (四念處)
- Four Right Efforts (四正勤)
- Four Bases of Supernatural Power (四如意足)
- Five Faculties (五根)
- Five Powers (五力)
- Seven Factors of Awakening (七覺支)
- Noble Eightfold Path (八正道)

### The Tree Metaphor (道樹)

Following the *Mahāvibhāṣā* and *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*, Miao-lo presents the path factors as an organic structure:

- **Roots**: Four Foundations of Mindfulness
- **Trunk**: Four Right Efforts
- **Branches**: Four Bases of Power
- **Leaves**: Five Faculties and Powers
- **Flowers**: Seven Factors of Awakening
- **Fruit**: Noble Eightfold Path

This organic metaphor indicates that the factors support one another in systematic development.

### The Three Gates of Liberation (三脫門)

Miao-lo discusses how the path factors lead to the three liberative gates:

1. **Gate of Emptiness (空門)** — Realization of the emptiness of self and dharmas
2. **Gate of Signlessness (無相門)** — Freedom from grasping at characteristics
3. **Gate of Wishlessness (無作門)** — Cessation of craving for results

In the Perfect Teaching, these three are simultaneous aspects of a single liberative insight.

---

## Mode 7: Counteractive Aids for Opening (對治助開)

### The Rationale

When standard contemplation proves insufficient due to dull faculties (鈍根) or karmic obstructions (有遮), targeted treatment becomes necessary. Miao-lo specifies that practitioners with sharp faculties and no obstructions need not employ these aids, but most practitioners require them.

### The Six Obstructions and Six Perfections

| Obstruction (蔽) | Perfection (度) |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Stinginess (慳) | Generosity (布施) |
| Immorality (破戒) | Moral Discipline (持戒) |
| Anger (瞋) | Patience (忍辱) |
| Laziness (懈怠) | Effort (精進) |
| Distraction (散亂) | Concentration (禪定) |
| Ignorance (愚癡) | Wisdom (般若) |

### The Four Followings (四隨)

When direct treatment fails, Miao-lo provides a protocol for adjustment:

1. **Following the Treatment (隨對治)** — Apply the corresponding perfection directly
2. **Following with Turning (隨轉)** — If ineffective, turn to a different perfection
3. **Following with Combination (隨兼)** — Apply multiple perfections simultaneously
4. **Following the Ultimate (隨第一義)** — Abandon specific treatments; observe the mind directly

---

## Mode 8: Knowing the Sequential Positions (知次位)

### The Danger of Misidentification

Miao-lo emphasizes the grave consequences of claiming attainments not yet realized:
> 未入位未得謂得。恐極下根生重罪故。
> "Not having entered the position yet claiming to have attained—this may cause those of the dullest faculties to generate grave offenses."

### The Four Foundations of Mindfulness (四念處)

Before accurate self-assessment is possible, the practitioner must establish mindfulness through the four foundations:

1. **Mindfulness of Body (身念處)** — Contemplating the five impurities
2. **Mindfulness of Feelings (受念處)** — Contemplating the three sufferings
3. **Mindfulness of Mind (心念處)** — Contemplating impermanence
4. **Mindfulness of Dharmas (法念處)** — Contemplating non-self

### The Three Animals Metaphor

Miao-lo employs a metaphor from the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* to distinguish the three vehicles:

- **麞 (Small Deer)** — The Śrāvaka flees alone, seeking only personal escape
- **鹿 (Larger Deer)** — The Pratyekabuddha flees with backward glances of compassion
- **大象 (Great Elephant)** — The Bodhisattva remains to lead all beings to safety

### The Ten Methods for Harmonizing Teachings (十意融通)

Miao-lo presents ten hermeneutical principles for reconciling apparent contradictions among scriptures and treatises:

1. Clarifying the Principle (道理)
2. Understanding the Framework (綱格)
3. Resolving Names (釋名)
4. Distinguishing Functions (明用)
5. Clarifying the Goal (明宗)
6. Opening and Expanding (開拓)
7. Generating Structure (開章)
8. Textual Commentary (帖釋)
9. Translation Issues (翻譯)
10. Contemplation Practice (印心)

---

## Mode 9: Patient Endurance (安忍)

### Definition

安忍 combines 安 (settled, peaceful) with 忍 (endurance, patience). This mode addresses the practitioner's capacity to maintain stability when facing obstacles—both internal (doubt, fear, impatience) and external (criticism, hardship, temptation).

### The Five Repentances (五悔)

As a preparatory practice for the higher stages, Miao-lo elaborates the five repentances:

1. **懺悔** (Confession) — Acknowledging and revealing past wrongdoing
2. **勸請** (Entreaty) — Requesting Buddhas to remain in the world and teach
3. **隨喜** (Rejoicing) — Taking joy in the merit of others
4. **迴向** (Transfer of Merit) — Directing merit toward all beings and supreme awakening
5. **發願** (Vow) — Establishing the four great vows

---

## Mode 10: Freedom from Dharma-Attachment (無法愛)

### The Final Obstacle

Having traversed the previous nine modes, the practitioner faces the subtlest obstruction: attachment to the Dharma itself. Miao-lo indicates that even love of the teaching constitutes a form of grasping that must be released.

### The Raft Metaphor

The traditional metaphor applies: the Dharma is a raft for crossing to the other shore. Upon arrival, the raft must be abandoned. Continued attachment to the raft—however useful it was during the crossing—becomes an impediment on solid ground.

### Non-Attachment to Non-Attachment

This mode does not advocate rejection of the Dharma but rather freedom from fixation upon it. The teaching remains valid and beneficial; the practitioner simply ceases to grasp it as an object of craving.

---

## Structure of This Fascicle

Fascicle 7 is divided into four parts in the CBETA edition:

- **Part 1 (卷第七之一)**: Mode 5 — Openness and Obstruction
- **Part 2 (卷第七之二)**: Modes 6-7 — Path Factors and Counteractive Aids
- **Part 3 (卷第七之三)**: Mode 8 (partial) — Four Foundations, Three Animals
- **Part 4 (卷第七之四)**: Modes 8-10 — Stages, Endurance, Freedom from Attachment

---

## Significance

Fascicle 7 completes the exposition of the Ten Modes, providing the diagnostic and therapeutic apparatus necessary for addressing obstacles in practice. The modes presented here are not merely supplementary but integral to the Tiantai contemplative system. Without the capacity to diagnose obstruction (Mode 5), adjust method (Modes 6-7), accurately assess progress (Mode 8), endure difficulty (Mode 9), and release attachment to practice itself (Mode 10), the earlier modes remain incomplete.

The fascicle thus represents the maturation of contemplative methodology—the transition from establishing practice to perfecting it.

## Mode 5: Discerning Openness and Obstruction (通塞)

### I. Introduction and Purpose (來意)

Miao-lo opens his treatment of Mode 5 by establishing its relationship to the preceding mode:

> 次釋通塞中先列異名。次明來意有法譬合。

"Next, in explaining openness and obstruction, we first list the alternative names, then clarify the purpose through dharma, metaphor, and their combination."

The fundamental purpose of this mode is diagnostic: having employed the breaking-through contemplation (破法遍) of Mode 4, the practitioner must now assess whether genuine progress has occurred. Miao-lo identifies a critical danger:

> 恐於通中翻起於塞

"There is concern that within openness, obstruction may instead arise."

This indicates that even correct contemplation can generate new obstacles—specifically, attachment to the contemplation itself. When the practitioner becomes proud of "breaking through," this very pride becomes a new obstruction.

### II. The Rationale for Four-Sentence Examination

Miao-lo explains why the four-sentence examination is necessary:

> 故知前破遍中但用能破破於所破。猶未悟者必於能所心生塞著。

"Therefore, in the previous breaking-through, one simply used the breaking capacity to break what is to be broken. Those who have not yet awakened will certainly generate obstruction and attachment regarding the capacity and its object."

The four sentences (四句) address this problem systematically:

1. **通途通塞** — General openness and obstruction: the object of breaking is obstruction; the capacity to break is openness.

2. **別相通塞** — Specific openness and obstruction: attachment arising regarding the capacity itself becomes obstruction; breaking that attachment without generating new attachment becomes openness.

### III. The Four Meanings (四義)

Miao-lo identifies four dimensions of openness and obstruction:

> 然今此中總有四義。一橫通塞。二竪通塞。三橫別通塞。四一心通塞。

"Now, in this context there are altogether four meanings: (1) horizontal openness-obstruction, (2) vertical openness-obstruction, (3) horizontal-distinct openness-obstruction, and (4) one-mind openness-obstruction."

#### 1. Horizontal (橫通塞)
All afflictions—view-delusions, thought-delusions, dust-and-sand delusions, and ignorance—are examined simultaneously. Openness consists in perceiving all as empty; obstruction consists in becoming fixed on any particular one.

#### 2. Vertical (竪通塞)
The practitioner progresses through stages sequentially: first breaking view-delusions, then thought-delusions, and so forth. Openness consists in advancing from stage to stage; obstruction consists in stalling at any level.

#### 3. Horizontal-Distinct (橫別通塞)
Different practitioners enter realization through different gates (emptiness, provisional existence, middle). Openness consists in finding one's appropriate gate; obstruction consists in asserting that one's gate is the only valid approach.

#### 4. One-Mind (一心通塞)
This represents the distinctively Tiantai integration. All three truths are present in a single moment of thought, with no temporal sequence or division among practitioners. This mode subsumes and perfects the previous three.

> 文四義二。前三為成一心故也。

"The text has four meanings but two [categories]: the first three exist for the purpose of accomplishing one-mind."

### IV. The Four-Sentence Diagnostic (四句檢校)

The examination proceeds through four sentences:

> 一者塞中得通。二者通中有塞。三者塞自是塞。四者通自是通。

1. **塞中得通** (Obtaining openness within obstruction): What appears to be blockage may contain the seed of breakthrough. The very recognition of obstruction can become the occasion for liberation.

2. **通中有塞** (Finding obstruction within openness): What appears to be progress may conceal subtle attachment. Pride in one's contemplation creates new bondage.

3. **塞自是塞** (Obstruction that is simply obstruction): Some obstacles are straightforward impediments requiring direct dismantling.

4. **通自是通** (Openness that is simply openness): Sometimes the path is genuinely clear, and second-guessing constitutes its own form of obstruction.

### V. The Metaphors

#### A. Removing the Film, Nurturing the Pearl (除膜養珠)

> 除膜養珠但成分喻

"Removing the film and nurturing the pearl constitutes only a partial metaphor."

The eye covered by a cataract-like film (膜) cannot see clearly. Removing the film reveals what was always present. This metaphor illustrates that practice does not create Buddha-nature but removes what obscures it.

However, Miao-lo notes this metaphor is incomplete because it does not address the possibility that "the pearl might become the film"—that is, what functions as openness might subsequently function as obstruction.

#### B. Destroying Bandits, Protecting Generals (破賊護將)

> 若破賊護將便成遍喻

"If [we use] destroying bandits and protecting generals, it becomes a complete metaphor."

This metaphor addresses the limitation of the first:

> 將若為賊此賊亦破。賊若為將此將亦護。如是展轉將皆為賊。節節破之。

"If a general becomes a bandit, that bandit must also be destroyed. If a bandit becomes a general, that general should also be protected. Thus, in succession, all generals may become bandits. Section by section, they must be destroyed."

No practice—however beneficial—is exempt from scrutiny. The contemplation that once served as "general" (openness) may become "bandit" (obstruction) through attachment.

### VI. The 500 Yojanas (五百由旬)

Miao-lo connects this mode to the *Lotus Sūtra*'s parable in Chapter 7 (化城喻品):

> 經云導師善知通塞。故用法華將導譬也。

"The sūtra states that the guide 'knows well openness and obstruction.' Therefore we use the *Lotus* metaphor of the guide."

#### Critique of Six Masters

Miao-lo examines and critiques six earlier interpretations of the 500 yojanas:

**First Master**: Identified 400 yojanas with the two vehicles (seventh and eighth grounds of the Shared Teaching).

*Miao-lo's critique*: This confuses the stages. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* correlates the two vehicles with 400 yojanas differently.

**Second Master** (攝論師 - Shèlùn school): Proposed seven kinds of birth-and-death corresponding to 500 yojanas.

*Miao-lo's critique*: This interpretation omits the final two kinds (有後, 無後 - "with remainder" and "without remainder").

**Third Master** (地論師 - Dìlùn school): Correlated the positions (住位) with 200 yojanas.

*Miao-lo's critique*: This places the "magic city" (化城) within the three realms, which contradicts the sūtra's intent.

**Fourth Master**: Identified the two vehicles as completing all 500 yojanas.

*Miao-lo's critique*: This has the two vehicles "usurping authority" (擅行) over territory they should not traverse.

**Fifth and Sixth Masters**: Various correlations with afflictions.

*Miao-lo's critique*: Each captures only partial meaning.

#### The Tiantai Interpretation

> 今明下今家正解。正顯今家依法華明通塞義也。

Miao-lo presents the Tiantai interpretation based on three correlations:

1. **Correlation with Birth-and-Death (約生死)**: The 500 yojanas represent the complete cycle of saṃsāra.

2. **Correlation with Afflictions (約煩惱)**:
   - View-delusions across three realms = 100
   - Lower fetters (下分結) = 100
   - Upper fetters (上分結) = 100
   - Dust-and-sand delusions = 100
   - Ignorance = 100

3. **Correlation with Contemplative Wisdom (約觀智)**: Through contemplation, one "passes through" (過) these 500 yojanas by knowing them as empty.

### VII. One-Mind Openness and Obstruction

The culminating teaching integrates all dimensions:

> 若一心下正明一心。即是檢校一心破遍。

"One-mind [openness-obstruction] precisely refers to examining one-mind breaking-through."

#### Breaking Vertical Obstruction

> 一心三觀破竪通塞

"One-mind three contemplations break vertical openness-obstruction."

The three contemplations (of emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle) are not sequential but simultaneous. This breaks the vertical arrangement wherein one proceeds from stage to stage.

#### Breaking Horizontal Obstruction

> 三觀一心破橫通塞

"Three contemplations, one mind, break horizontal openness-obstruction."

The three contemplations are not divided among different practitioners but are all present in a single mind. This breaks the horizontal arrangement wherein different people approach through different gates.

#### The Integration

> 空即三觀等者。次圓三觀。觀觀具三以破橫別。

"Emptiness is precisely the three contemplations, etc. Next, the Perfect three contemplations—each contemplation contains all three, breaking horizontal-distinct [obstruction]."

In the Perfect Teaching:
- Contemplation of emptiness contains provisional and middle
- Contemplation of provisional contains emptiness and middle
- Contemplation of middle contains emptiness and provisional

This mutual inclusion (圓融) characterizes the Tiantai approach.

## Doctrinal Significance

Mode 5 serves as the pivotal diagnostic function within the Ten Modes. Without the capacity to discern openness and obstruction, the practitioner cannot:

1. Recognize when correct practice has generated new attachment
2. Adjust methodology appropriately
3. Avoid the error of claiming attainment not yet realized
4. Progress from the foundational modes (1-4) to the culminating modes (6-10)

The one-mind approach to openness and obstruction distinguishes Tiantai from gradual approaches that treat stages sequentially and from approaches that assign different gates to different practitioners. In Tiantai, all dimensions are integrated in the single moment of contemplative awareness.

# Fascicle 7: Section 2 — Path Factors and Counteractive Aids
## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 7, Part 2 (卷第七之二)
**Author**: Miao-lo (Zhanran, 湛然, 711-782 CE)
**Translator**: William Altig / Claude

## Mode 6: Adjusting the Path Factors (道品調適)

### I. The Tree of the Path (道樹)

Miao-lo opens his treatment of Mode 6 by presenting the traditional metaphor of the path factors as a tree:

> 次舉譬者。婆沙大論並依樹譬道品。故名道樹。

"Next, presenting the metaphor: both the *[Mahā]vibhāṣā* and the *Great Treatise* use the tree metaphor for the path factors. Therefore it is called 'the tree of the path.'"

The organic structure is as follows:

| Component | Path Factors |
|-----------|--------------|
| Roots (根) | Four Foundations of Mindfulness (四念處) |
| Trunk (幹) | Four Right Efforts (四正勤) |
| Branches (枝) | Four Bases of Supernatural Power (四如意足) |
| Leaves (葉) | Five Faculties and Five Powers (五根五力) |
| Flowers (華) | Seven Factors of Awakening (七覺支) |
| Fruit (果) | Noble Eightfold Path (八正道) |

Miao-lo notes that both the *Mahāvibhāṣā* and the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* employ this metaphor, though with slight variations:

> 二論並與今文大同。但今結果位在初住。與婆沙異。

"Both treatises largely agree with the present text. However, the present text places the fruit-position at the first abiding [stage], differing from the *Vibhāṣā*."

This indicates that while Miao-lo draws on Abhidharma sources, he interprets them through the Tiantai lens of the Six Identities and progressive positions.

### II. The Three Kinds of Spiritual Guides (三善知識)

The path factors function as spiritual guides in three capacities:

> 道品善知識下結前合譬。準方便中有三知識。

"The path factors as spiritual guides—this concludes and combines the previous metaphor. According to the expedient [section], there are three kinds of guides."

1. **同行善知識** (Companion Guide): The path factors accompany the practitioner, walking the same path.

2. **教授善知識** (Teaching Guide): The path factors instruct by showing what to cultivate next.
   > 由是道品令行無誤
   > "Through these path factors, practice proceeds without error."

3. **外護善知識** (Protective Guide): The path factors guard against deviation.
   > 諸品防護妄誤不侵
   > "The various factors protect and guard; error and delusion do not intrude."

### III. The Three Gates of Liberation (三脫門)

Miao-lo transitions to discuss how the path factors culminate in the three liberative gates:

> 次明三脫門者。明道品功能。

"Next, explaining the three gates of liberation: this clarifies the function of the path factors."

#### Definition from the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*

> 大論二十一問。涅槃唯一門何故三耶。答。法一義三。三秖是一。

"The *Great Treatise* [chapter] twenty-one asks: 'Nirvāṇa has only one gate—why then three?' Answer: 'The dharma is one, the meanings are three. The three are precisely one.'"

The three gates are:

1. **空門** (Gate of Emptiness): Realization that self and dharmas lack inherent existence
2. **無相門** (Gate of Signlessness): Freedom from grasping fixed characteristics
3. **無作門** (Gate of Wishlessness): Cessation of craving for results

#### Differentiation by Teaching

Miao-lo distinguishes how each teaching approaches the three gates:

**Tripiṭaka Teaching (三藏教)**:
> 初三藏教約十六行以分三門
"The Tripiṭaka Teaching uses the sixteen aspects [of the Four Noble Truths] to differentiate the three gates."

**Shared Teaching (通教)**:
> 通教從初但觀幻化。是故不復依十六行。
"The Shared Teaching from the beginning only contemplates illusion. Therefore it does not rely on the sixteen aspects."

**Distinct Teaching (別教)**:
> 次明別教先通約三觀。次別約出假。
"Next, explaining the Distinct Teaching: first generally in terms of the three contemplations, then specifically in terms of emerging into the provisional."

**Perfect Teaching (圓教)**:
> 故圓教中空即無相無作故也
"Therefore in the Perfect Teaching, emptiness is precisely signlessness and wishlessness."

In the Perfect Teaching, the three gates are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects of a single liberative insight.

## Mode 7: Counteractive Aids for Opening (對治助開)

### I. The Rationale for Counteractive Aids

Miao-lo explains when and why these aids become necessary:

> 次釋對治助開。初明來意中。先剋出所助之體。故云為一切三昧作本。

"Next, explaining counteractive aids for opening. In first clarifying the purpose, we initially specify the entity being aided. Therefore [the text] states: '[these aids] serve as the foundation for all samādhis.'"

The fundamental condition requiring counteractive aids:

> 根利下正約根遮以簡助意。四句之中三句不須。唯根鈍有遮用此對治。

"From 'sharp faculties' onward, we precisely use faculties and obstructions to differentiate the meaning of aids. Among the four sentences, three do not require [aids]. Only the dull-facultied with obstructions employ this counteractive [approach]."

The four combinations are:

1. **Sharp faculties, no obstructions (利根無遮)**: No aids needed
2. **Sharp faculties, with obstructions (利根有遮)**: Some aids may help
3. **Dull faculties, no obstructions (鈍根無遮)**: Standard practice suffices
4. **Dull faculties, with obstructions (鈍根有遮)**: Counteractive aids essential

### II. The Six Obstructions (六蔽)

Miao-lo presents the six obstructions that impede practice:

> 助道無量下明用治所依。助道無量但用六者為對六蔽。

"'Aids to the path are immeasurable'—this clarifies the basis for applying treatment. Though aids are immeasurable, we use [only] six because they counter the six obstructions."

| Chinese | Sanskrit equivalent | Meaning |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| 慳 | mātsarya | Stinginess |
| 破戒 | dauḥśīlya | Immorality |
| 瞋 | pratigha | Anger |
| 懈怠 | kausīdya | Laziness |
| 散亂 | vikṣepa | Distraction |
| 愚癡 | moha | Ignorance |

### III. The Six Perfections as Treatment (六度)

Each obstruction has its corresponding perfection as antidote:

| Obstruction | Perfection | Treatment Logic |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Stinginess (慳) | Generosity (布施) | Opens the closed fist |
| Immorality (破戒) | Moral Discipline (持戒) | Restores ethical foundation |
| Anger (瞋) | Patience (忍辱) | Cools the burning |
| Laziness (懈怠) | Effort (精進) | Energizes practice |
| Distraction (散亂) | Concentration (禪定) | Settles the scattered mind |
| Ignorance (愚癡) | Wisdom (般若) | Illuminates darkness |

### IV. The Four Followings (四隨)

When direct treatment proves ineffective, Miao-lo provides a protocol for adjustment:

> 若用下具辯四隨迴轉治相。前之對治已用四中一對治竟。忽非其宜。應須轉用。

"From 'if using' onward, we thoroughly explain the characteristics of treatment through the four followings and their turning. The previous counteractive [approach] has already employed one of the four treatments. If suddenly it proves unsuitable, one should turn to use [another]."

#### 1. Following the Treatment (隨對治)

> 如治一慳者。略於一蔽示四隨相。

"For example, treating one [case of] stinginess: briefly, for one obstruction, we show the four following-characteristics."

The direct approach: apply the corresponding perfection. Stinginess → practice generosity.

#### 2. Following with Turning (隨轉)

If direct treatment fails:

> 所言轉者。或轉用尸乃至般若。或次或超超一至四。

"What is meant by 'turning': perhaps turn to use moral discipline, and so on up to wisdom. Either sequentially or by skipping—skipping from one to four."

The practitioner tries a different perfection. Perhaps the stinginess is rooted in fear (use moral discipline for security) or in confusion (use wisdom).

#### 3. Following with Combination (隨兼)

> 若至五度名轉名具

"If reaching [all] five perfections, it is called 'turning' [and] called 'complete.'"

Multiple perfections may be applied simultaneously: generosity + effort + wisdom, for instance.

#### 4. Following the Ultimate (隨第一義)

> 言第一義者。唯觀無相真如寂理。

"What is meant by 'ultimate truth': only contemplating signless true suchness, quiescent principle."

Abandoning specific treatments, the practitioner directly observes the mind. The obstruction is seen to lack inherent nature; treatment and obstruction are both empty.

### V. Treatment Across the Four Teachings

Miao-lo extends the counteractive framework across all four teachings:

> 若以四教展轉為治以前助後者。還以前六轉望後教六蔽之相。

"If using the four teachings to treat in succession, using the earlier to aid the later: we turn to use the earlier six [perfections] in relation to the later teaching's six-obstruction characteristics."

- **Shared Teaching practitioners** may use Tripiṭaka perfections
- **Distinct Teaching practitioners** may use both Tripiṭaka and Shared perfections
- **Perfect Teaching practitioners** may use all three previous sets

This creates a comprehensive therapeutic arsenal.

### VI. The Five Tastes (五味)

Miao-lo connects the path factors to the five periods of Buddhist teaching using the milk metaphor from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*:

> 又華嚴下約五味判

"Furthermore, from 'Huayan' onward, we judge according to the five tastes."

| Period | Taste | Characteristic |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Huayan | Fresh milk (乳) | Rich but difficult to digest |
| Āgama | Cream (酪) | More accessible |
| Vaipulya | Curds (生酥) | Transitional |
| Prajñā | Butter (熟酥) | Refined |
| Lotus/Nirvāṇa | Ghee (醍醐) | Ultimate refinement |

#### The Twin Trees (枯榮)

The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*'s image of twin trees—one withered (枯), one flourishing (榮)—represents:

> 初華嚴中雖具二義文多明別。故云偏多四榮。

"In the Huayan [period], though both meanings are present, the text mostly clarifies the distinct [teaching]. Therefore we say it 'leans toward the four flourishing.'"

- **Withered trees**: Represent the two vehicles (śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha)
- **Flourishing trees**: Represent the bodhisattva path

In the Lotus and Nirvāṇa sūtras, the withered become flourishing—all paths are revealed as leading to the one vehicle.

## Doctrinal Significance

Modes 6 and 7 constitute the therapeutic dimension of the Ten Modes. Having diagnosed obstruction in Mode 5, the practitioner now adjusts methodology (Mode 6) and applies targeted treatment (Mode 7).

The integration of Abhidharma path-factor analysis with Tiantai three-truth contemplation represents a distinctive synthesis. The 37 factors are not merely graduated practices but are understood through the lens of the three truths—empty, provisional, and middle—allowing for flexible application across all four teachings.

The four followings provide a practical protocol for when standard approaches fail, moving from direct treatment through various adjustments to ultimate contemplation. This ensures that no practitioner remains stuck due to rigid adherence to a single method.

## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 7, Part 3 (卷第七之三)

## Mode 8: Knowing the Sequential Positions (知次位) — Part 1

### I. The Purpose of Knowing Positions

Miao-lo opens with a discussion of wisdom (般若) and its relation to the four foundations of mindfulness, then transitions to the critical importance of knowing one's stage:

> 次明知次位者。先明來意。既用前七以為所修。二世善發入位不定。或未入位未得謂得。恐極下根生重罪故。故須明位令行者識之。

"Next, explaining knowing the sequential positions. First clarifying the purpose: having used the previous seven [modes] as what is cultivated, wholesome [states] from both lives may arise, but entering the position is uncertain. Perhaps one has not entered the position yet claims to have attained. Fearing that those of the dullest faculties may generate grave offenses, therefore we must clarify the positions to enable practitioners to recognize them."

This passage establishes the critical danger of misidentification. Claiming attainments not yet realized constitutes a grave offense (重罪), potentially leading to deterioration of practice and misleading of others.

### II. The Structure of Positions

Miao-lo identifies two categories of positions across the four teachings:

> 四教各有真似二位。在賢名似入聖名真。

"Each of the four teachings has two [types of] positions: true and resemblance. Being in the [stage of] worthies is called 'resemblance'; entering sagehood is called 'true.'"

- **Resemblance positions (似位)**: The preparatory stages where realization is approximated but not yet complete
- **True positions (真位)**: The stages of genuine attainment

### III. The Metaphor of Purple and Vermillion

> 次舉喻云朱紫等者。朱正色如真位。紫間色如似位。如赤黑合以成於紫。真妄尚雜故名為似。

"Next, the metaphor 'vermillion and purple, etc.': vermillion, a primary color, is like the true position. Purple, an intermediate color, is like the resemblance position. Just as red and black combine to produce purple, the true and false are still mixed—therefore it is called 'resemblance.'"

This metaphor from traditional Chinese color theory illustrates how resemblance positions contain elements of both realization and delusion, unlike the pure "vermillion" of true attainment.

### IV. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness (四念處)

Miao-lo presents an extended treatment of the four foundations as the basis for accurate self-assessment.

#### A. Mindfulness of Body: The Five Impurities (五種不淨)

**1. Seed Impurity (種子不淨)**

> 初言種子者。如論偈曰。是身種不淨非是妙寶物。不從白淨生。父母邪想憶念風吹淫欲之火。

"First, regarding 'seed': as the treatise verse states, 'This body's seed is impure, not a wondrous treasure. It does not arise from the white and pure. Parents' wrong thoughts, recollection, wind-blown fire of desire...'"

The body originates from parental sexual union—described as "grasping another's leavings" (攬他遺體). The red and white drops (赤白精) are the biological materials from which the embryo develops.

**2. Place Impurity (住處不淨)**

> 生處不淨者。如論偈曰。是身為臭穢不從華開生。亦不從薝蔔又不出寶山。

"The birthplace is impure: as the treatise verse states, 'This body is foul and filthy; it does not arise from flowers blooming, nor from champaka blossoms, nor does it emerge from treasure mountains.'"

The womb environment is characterized as "vile and crowded" (猥者雜惡也).

**3. Characteristic Impurity (自相不淨)**

> 自相不淨者。衣服澡浴種種華香。飴以上饌眾妙美味。經宿之間皆為不淨。

"Self-characteristic impurity: clothing and bathing, various flowers and fragrances, fed with superior dishes and many wonderful flavors—after a night's passage, all becomes impure."

Even with the finest adornments and foods, the body's nature produces waste:

> 假令衣天衣食天食以身性故。亦成不淨。

"Even if clothed in heavenly garments and fed heavenly food, due to the body's nature, it also becomes impure."

**4. Self-Nature Impurity (自性不淨)**

> 自性不淨者。大小便道目淚涕睡常流不息。如論偈云。種種不淨物充滿於其身。常流出不止如漏囊盛物。

"Self-nature impurity: the paths of urine and feces, tears, nasal discharge, saliva—constantly flowing without cease. As the treatise verse states, 'Various impure substances fill this body, constantly flowing out without stopping, like a leaky bag containing things.'"

The body continuously produces and excretes impure substances.

**5. Ultimate Impurity (究竟不淨)**

> 究竟不淨者。如論偈曰。審諦觀此身終必歸死處。

"Ultimate impurity: as the treatise verse states, 'Carefully and truly contemplate this body—in the end it certainly returns to death.'"

The body's final destination is decomposition and dissolution.

#### B. Mindfulness of Feelings: The Three Sufferings (三苦)

Miao-lo presents the three sufferings through the *Abhidharmakośa* metaphor:

> 故俱舍云。如以一睫毛置掌而不覺。若置眼睛上為損及不安。凡夫如手掌不覺行苦睫。智者如眼睛緣極生厭怖。

"Therefore the *Kośa* states: 'Like placing a single eyelash on the palm—one does not perceive it. If placed on the eyeball, it causes harm and disturbance. Ordinary beings are like the palm, not perceiving the eyelash of the suffering of conditioning. The wise are like the eye, and through contact with the extreme, aversion and fear arise.'"

| Type | Chinese | Characteristic |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Suffering of suffering | 苦苦 | Obvious pain: illness, injury |
| Suffering of change | 壞苦 | Pleasure that ends |
| Suffering of conditioning | 行苦 | Pervasive unsatisfactoriness |

#### C. Mindfulness of Mind: Impermanence

**The Cage and Bird Metaphor**

> 如繫鳥等者。如論偈云。鳥來入瓶中羅𣪺揜瓶口。縠穿鳥飛去神明隨業走。

"Regarding 'like a caged bird, etc.': as the treatise verse states, 'The bird enters the bottle, the net-cover seals the opening. When the silk tears, the bird flies away; the spirit follows karma and departs.'"

- The body (bottle/cage) = the physical form
- Consciousness (bird) = the mental continuum
- Karma (net) = the binding force
- Death = the breaking of the container

**The Wax Seal Metaphor**

From the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*:

> 印壞文成等者。重顯籠瓶文仍少異。籠瓶二喻但喻因果。此蠟印喻更加中陰。

"'The seal is destroyed, the pattern appears'—this again reveals [the meaning of] cage and bottle, though the text differs slightly. The two metaphors of cage and bottle only illustrate cause and effect. This wax-seal metaphor additionally includes the intermediate state."

> 如蠟印印泥印與泥合印滅文成。

"Like a wax seal pressed into clay: the seal combines with the clay, the seal is destroyed, the pattern appears."

This illustrates the relationship between:
- Present life (the wax seal)
- Intermediate state (the pressing)
- Future life (the pattern in clay)

#### D. Mindfulness of Dharmas: Non-Self

**The Ghost Room Story (鬼房)**

Miao-lo recounts from the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*:

> 如一山中有一佛圖。中有別房常有鬼來。故諸道人皆捨此房。

"In a certain mountain there was a Buddhist temple. Within it was a particular room where ghosts constantly came. Therefore all the monks abandoned this room."

Two monks, each unaware of the other, take residence in the room. Each mistakes the other for a ghost. They struggle throughout the night, only to discover at dawn that they were old friends fighting phantoms.

> 眾生亦爾。五陰本來無人無我。空取其相生於鬪諍。

"Sentient beings are likewise. The five aggregates originally have no person, no self. Vainly grasping their characteristics, they generate conflict."

**The Two Ghosts and the Corpse (二鬼爭屍)**

From the *Great Treatise*:

> 如人遠行獨宿空亭。夜中有鬼擔一死屍。來著其前。復有一鬼從後而來。瞋罵前鬼云。是我屍何以擔來。

"A person traveling far lodged alone in an empty pavilion. In the night, a ghost came carrying a corpse and placed it before him. Another ghost came from behind, angrily cursing the first: 'This is my corpse! Why did you carry it here?'"

The traveler, asked to adjudicate, tells the truth and is torn apart. But the first ghost replaces each limb with parts from the corpse. By morning, the traveler's entire body has been replaced:

> 其人思惟。此之二鬼皆有大力。實語虛語皆不免死。我今不應妄語答鬼。

"The person thought: 'These two ghosts both have great power. Whether I speak truth or falsehood, I cannot avoid death. I should not answer the ghosts with false words.'"

The traveler wanders to a monastery, where monks teach him:

> 此人自知己身無我易可化度。

"This person himself knew his body has no self—he is easily transformed and liberated."

### V. The Three Animals Metaphor

Miao-lo employs the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*'s metaphor to distinguish the three vehicles:

#### The Small Deer (麞) — Śrāvaka

> 聲聞觀法義之如麞。生老病死猶如獵圍。三界五欲猶如水草。不遑視聽如不暇飲噉。希離二縛如志在免脫。

"The śrāvaka's contemplation is like the small deer. Birth, aging, sickness, and death are like the hunter's encirclement. The three realms and five desires are like water and grass. Not having leisure to look or listen, like not having time to drink or eat. Hoping to escape the two bonds, intent on liberation."

The śrāvaka flees danger single-mindedly, without looking back or helping others.

#### The Larger Deer (鹿) — Pratyekabuddha

> 部行說法名為悲鳴。但讚出苦名為呦咽。

"Teaching the Dharma to groups is called 'mournful crying.' Simply praising escape from suffering is called 'plaintive sound.'"

The pratyekabuddha flees but looks back with compassion:

> 有少悲心似住生死。利物事微名為何益。說已入般。

"Having some compassion, seemingly abiding in birth-and-death. Benefiting beings in small matters—what benefit is this called? Having taught, [the pratyekabuddha] enters parinirvāṇa."

#### The Great Elephant (大象) — Bodhisattva

> 大象合菩薩... 以智去至俱安者。合令群安隱。

"The great elephant corresponds to the bodhisattva... 'With wisdom departing until all are secure' corresponds to 'causing the herd to be safe and hidden.'"

The bodhisattva:
- Knows its own great power
- Endures the dangers of birth-and-death
- Leads all beings across to safety

## Doctrinal Significance

Mode 8 addresses the danger of premature claims to attainment—a persistent problem in contemplative traditions. By establishing the four foundations of mindfulness as prerequisites for accurate self-assessment, Miao-lo ensures that practitioners develop the discernment necessary to evaluate their own progress.

The three animals metaphor provides a framework for understanding different levels of aspiration and capacity. The Tiantai ideal is the elephant—the bodhisattva who leads all beings to liberation—but practitioners must honestly assess whether they currently function as deer or elephant.

The extended treatment of impermanence through the cage-and-bird and wax-seal metaphors emphasizes the urgency of practice while undermining attachment to the physical body as the locus of self.

## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 7, Part 4 (卷第七之四)

## Mode 8: Knowing the Sequential Positions (知次位) — Part 2

### I. The Ten Methods for Harmonizing Teachings (十意融通)

Miao-lo presents ten hermeneutical principles for reconciling apparent contradictions among Buddhist scriptures and treatises:

> 次以十意融通經論者。

"Next, using the ten meanings to harmonize sūtras and treatises."

He notes that these should not be confused with the Ten Modes of contemplation:

> 人見十意之初有諦理之言。便將十乘以對十意。深不便也。

"People see that at the beginning of the ten meanings there is discussion of 'truth and principle.' They then correlate the Ten Modes with the ten meanings. This is deeply inconvenient [i.e., mistaken]."

#### The Ten Methods

1. **道理** (Clarifying the Principle): Different teachings describe different aspects of the same reality.

2. **綱格** (Understanding the Framework): Using the eight teachings (頓漸祕密不定 + 藏通別圓) to classify and sort doctrinal statements.
   > 以教判釋得教遠度。故云綱格。
   > "Through doctrinal classification and interpretation, one obtains the far-reaching scope of the teaching. Therefore it is called 'framework.'"

3. **釋名** (Resolving Names): The same word may carry different meanings in different contexts.
   > 名雖有八用必不俱
   > "Though names number eight, their uses are certainly not simultaneous."

4. **明用** (Distinguishing Functions): Different methods serve different purposes.
   > 祛執遣迷。有執咸破。
   > "Dispelling attachment and removing delusion. All attachments are broken."

5. **明宗** (Clarifying the Goal): Despite different methods, the ultimate aim is one.
   > 位是所階行是能修。能所相帶則方便與證因果不混。
   > "Position is what is ascended; practice is what cultivates. Capacity and object mutually accompany, so expedient [means] and realization, cause and effect, are not confused."

6. **開拓** (Opening and Expanding): Not rigidly boxing the teachings; allowing interpenetration.
   > 開拓法門使佛意不壅
   > "Opening and expanding the Dharma-gate so that the Buddha's intention is not obstructed."

7. **開章** (Generating Structure): Seeing how sections build upon one another.
   > 如諸義疏凡開章段。無不生起如鉤鎖也。
   > "Like all commentaries that divide into sections—none fail to arise [from previous sections] like linked hooks."

8. **帖釋** (Textual Commentary): Careful reading adhering closely to the actual words.
   > 復須附文次第帖釋。不廣不略有事有理。
   > "One must also follow the text and explain in sequence. Neither too broad nor too brief, with both phenomena and principle."

9. **翻譯** (Translation Issues): Recognizing that some problems arise from translation rather than doctrine.
   > 方音不同非關義理不可卒備。
   > "Regional pronunciations differ—this is unrelated to meaning and principle; [such matters] cannot be suddenly prepared."

10. **印心** (Contemplation Practice): The teachings are for practice, not merely theoretical understanding.
    > 附文成觀文不虛設。觀與文合名為印心。
    > "Following the text to accomplish contemplation—the text is not established in vain. When contemplation and text unite, it is called 'sealing the mind.'"

### II. The Five Repentances (五悔)

Miao-lo presents the five repentances as essential preparation for entering higher stages:

> 先知下明五悔意為入觀之方。是故重牒前文觀法。但心理下明用向觀法不能發真。是故應須更加五悔。

"From 'first knowing' onward, we clarify that the five repentances serve as the method for entering contemplation. Therefore we repeat the previous contemplative method. From 'only mind-principle' onward, we clarify that using the previous contemplative method cannot yet manifest the true [realization]. Therefore one must additionally employ the five repentances."

#### 1. Confession (懺悔)

> 懺名下次正明五悔。雖有勸請等四不同。莫非悔罪。故名五悔。

"Though there are [the other] four [practices] such as entreaty, etc., none are other than repenting wrongdoing. Therefore they are called 'five repentances.'"

Definition:
> 陳露者。陳列也首也。悔者伏也。

"陳露 means 'to display and reveal.' 悔 means 'to submit' [i.e., acknowledge and reform]."

The practice involves:
- Recalling wrongdoing from this and previous lives
- Not justifying or minimizing
- Acknowledging the harm caused
- Resolving not to repeat

#### 2. Entreaty (勸請)

Two aspects:
> 一者請住於世。二者請轉法輪。

"First, requesting [Buddhas] to remain in the world. Second, requesting [them] to turn the Dharma-wheel."

Miao-lo quotes the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*:

> 佛雖必說而不待請。請者得福何得不請。猶如大王雖多美膳若有請者必得恩福。

"Though the Buddha will certainly teach without waiting to be asked, those who request obtain merit—how could one not request? Just as a great king, though having abundant fine food, certainly bestows grace and blessing on those who request."

#### 3. Rejoicing (隨喜)

> 佛轉法輪眾生得三世益。我助彼喜者。喜前勸請也。

"The Buddha turns the Dharma-wheel; sentient beings obtain benefit in the three times. 'I assist that joy'—this rejoices in the previous entreaty."

From the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*:

> 隨喜者有二種。一者世間。二者出世。若人無有出世善根。我今隨喜眾生世福。

"Rejoicing is of two kinds: worldly and world-transcending. If a person lacks world-transcending wholesome roots, I now rejoice in sentient beings' worldly merit."

The *Lotus Sūtra* connection:
> 法華隨喜法等者。隨喜品中從法座起。至於餘處為他人說。

"The *Lotus* [chapter on] 'Rejoicing in the Dharma': In the Rejoicing chapter, [practitioners] rise from the Dharma-seat, go to other places, and teach others."

#### 4. Transfer of Merit (迴向)

> 以隨喜福與眾生共及向菩提。

"Through the merit of rejoicing, [one shares] with sentient beings together and [directs merit] toward bodhi."

Two directions of transfer:
1. **To all beings**: May all beings benefit
2. **To awakening**: May this merit lead to supreme enlightenment

The seeming paradox:
> 施眾生者。然修因福不可得共。若得果時則以此福施於眾生。

"Giving to sentient beings: the merit of cultivating causes cannot actually be shared. But when obtaining the fruit, one gives this merit to sentient beings."

#### 5. Vow (發願)

> 迴向為大利等。故法華梵天施宮殿時。皆發願云。願以此功德等

"Transfer [of merit] is great benefit, etc. Therefore in the *Lotus [Sūtra]*, when Brahmā offers palaces, all make vows saying, 'May with this merit...' etc."

The four great vows provide direction for practice.

---

## Mode 9: Patient Endurance (安忍)

### Definition and Context

Mode 9 addresses the practitioner's capacity to maintain stability when facing obstacles. The term 安忍 combines:

- **安** (ān): settled, peaceful, stable
- **忍** (rěn): endurance, patience, forbearance

### The Function of Endurance

Having established the five repentances as preparatory practice, the practitioner must now develop the capacity to endure:

- **Internal obstacles**: doubt, fear, impatience, boredom
- **External obstacles**: criticism, hardship, temptation

Miao-lo emphasizes that endurance is not passive resignation but active stability—maintaining the contemplative orientation regardless of circumstances.

---

## Mode 10: Freedom from Dharma-Attachment (無法愛)

### The Final Obstacle

> 即使別教詮於不空。非初心觀何須比決。故並不與圓教空同。

"Even if the Distinct Teaching expresses 'not-empty,' it is not the initial mind's contemplation—why would it need comparative determination? Therefore [such teachings] are entirely not the same as the Perfect Teaching's emptiness."

Having traversed the previous nine modes, the practitioner faces the subtlest obstruction: attachment to the Dharma itself.

### The Logic of Release

The raft metaphor applies: the Dharma is an expedient for crossing to the other shore. Upon arrival, continued attachment to the raft impedes progress on solid ground.

This mode does not advocate:
- Rejection of the Dharma
- Antinomian disregard for practice
- Premature claims of transcendence

Rather, it advocates:
- Freedom from fixation
- Non-grasping relationship with methods
- Continued use without attachment

### Integration with Previous Modes

Mode 10 completes the Ten Modes by preventing the entire system from becoming a new form of bondage. Each mode—from the Hologram (一念三千) through Patient Endurance (安忍)—remains valid and beneficial. The practitioner simply ceases to grasp these methods as objects of craving.

---

## Doctrinal Significance

Fascicle 7 completes the exposition of the Ten Modes by presenting Modes 5-10. These latter modes address what happens when foundational practice encounters obstacles, how to assess progress accurately, and how to avoid turning the path itself into a new form of bondage.

The ten methods for harmonizing teachings provide hermeneutical tools for resolving apparent contradictions among scriptures—a persistent challenge in Buddhist scholasticism. Miao-lo's approach allows practitioners to benefit from diverse textual traditions without becoming confused by surface-level disagreements.

The five repentances establish a practical entry point for serious practice. They are not merely devotional exercises but functional tools for clearing karmic obstacles and establishing the proper orientation for contemplation.

Modes 9 and 10 address the final challenges: maintaining stability through difficulty (安忍) and releasing attachment to the very methods that brought one to realization (無法愛). Together, they ensure that the practitioner neither abandons the path prematurely nor clings to it beyond its usefulness.

# Fascicle 7: Closing Summary — The Latter Six Modes
## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 7 (止觀輔行傳弘決卷第七)
**Author**: Miao-lo (Zhanran, 湛然, 711-782 CE)
**Translator**: William Altig / Claude
**Date**: January 23, 2026

---

## Overview

Fascicle 7 of Miao-lo's *Zhiguan Fuxing Zhuan Hongjue* completes the exposition of the Ten Modes of Contemplation (十乘觀法) by presenting Modes 5-10. While the earlier fascicles established the foundational contemplative methodology through Modes 1-4, this fascicle provides the diagnostic, therapeutic, positional, endurance, and liberative dimensions necessary for the completion of practice.

---

## The Six Modes Treated in This Fascicle

### Mode 5: Discerning Openness and Obstruction (通塞)

**Function**: Diagnostic assessment of whether the contemplative path is clear or blocked.

**Key Teaching**: Even correct practice can generate new obstructions through attachment to the practice itself. The four-sentence examination (四句檢校) provides a comprehensive diagnostic:

1. Openness within obstruction (塞中得通)
2. Obstruction within openness (通中有塞)
3. Obstruction as simply obstruction (塞自是塞)
4. Openness as simply openness (通自是通)

**Distinctive Tiantai Contribution**: The one-mind (一心) approach integrates horizontal, vertical, and distinct dimensions of openness-obstruction in a single moment of contemplative awareness.

---

### Mode 6: Adjusting the Path Factors (道品調適)

**Function**: Appropriate application of the thirty-seven factors of awakening (三十七道品).

**Key Teaching**: The path factors form an organic structure—from roots (four foundations of mindfulness) through trunk (four right efforts) to fruit (noble eightfold path). The practitioner adjusts which factors to emphasize based on current conditions.

**The Three Gates of Liberation**: Emptiness (空門), signlessness (無相門), and wishlessness (無作門) represent the culmination of path-factor practice. In the Perfect Teaching, these three are simultaneous aspects of a single liberative insight.

---

### Mode 7: Counteractive Aids for Opening (對治助開)

**Function**: Targeted treatment for specific obstacles when standard practice proves insufficient.

**Key Teaching**: Six obstructions (六蔽) require six perfections (六度) as antidotes:

| Obstruction | Perfection |
|-------------|------------|
| Stinginess (慳) | Generosity (布施) |
| Immorality (破戒) | Moral Discipline (持戒) |
| Anger (瞋) | Patience (忍辱) |
| Laziness (懈怠) | Effort (精進) |
| Distraction (散亂) | Concentration (禪定) |
| Ignorance (愚癡) | Wisdom (般若) |

**The Four Followings (四隨)**: When direct treatment fails, the practitioner may turn to alternative perfections, combine multiple perfections, or proceed directly to ultimate contemplation.

---

### Mode 8: Knowing the Sequential Positions (知次位)

**Function**: Accurate self-assessment of one's stage on the path.

**Key Teaching**: Claiming attainments not yet realized constitutes a grave offense. The four foundations of mindfulness (四念處) establish the discernment necessary for honest evaluation.

**The Three Animals**: Different levels of aspiration:
- Small deer (麞) — Śrāvaka: escapes alone
- Larger deer (鹿) — Pratyekabuddha: escapes with backward glance
- Great elephant (大象) — Bodhisattva: leads all beings to safety

**The Ten Methods for Harmonizing Teachings (十意融通)**: Hermeneutical principles for reconciling apparent contradictions among scriptures.

**The Five Repentances (五悔)**: Preparatory practices for entering higher stages:
1. Confession (懺悔)
2. Entreaty (勸請)
3. Rejoicing (隨喜)
4. Transfer of Merit (迴向)
5. Vow (發願)

---

### Mode 9: Patient Endurance (安忍)

**Function**: Maintaining stability when facing internal and external obstacles.

**Key Teaching**: 安忍 combines settled peace (安) with endurance (忍). The practitioner develops capacity to maintain contemplative orientation regardless of circumstances—neither fighting obstacles nor fleeing from them, but steadily continuing practice.

---

### Mode 10: Freedom from Dharma-Attachment (無法愛)

**Function**: Releasing attachment to the practice itself.

**Key Teaching**: Even love of the Dharma constitutes a form of grasping that must ultimately be released. The teaching remains valid and beneficial; the practitioner simply ceases to cling to it as an object of craving.

**The Raft Metaphor**: The Dharma is for crossing to the other shore. Upon arrival, continued attachment to the raft becomes an impediment.

---

## Structural Analysis of the Ten Modes

| Category | Modes | Function |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Foundation | 1-4 | Establish the core contemplation |
| Diagnostic | 5 | Assess openness and obstruction |
| Therapeutic | 6-7 | Adjust method and apply treatment |
| Positional | 8 | Know one's stage accurately |
| Endurance | 9 | Maintain stability through difficulty |
| Liberation | 10 | Release attachment to the path itself |

---

## Major Doctrinal Contributions

### 1. Integration of Abhidharma and Tiantai

Miao-lo draws extensively on Abhidharma sources (*Mahāvibhāṣā*, *Abhidharmakośa*) and Mādhyamika treatises (*Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*) while interpreting them through the Tiantai lens of the three truths and mutual inclusion.

### 2. The One-Mind Principle

Throughout the fascicle, Miao-lo emphasizes that horizontal and vertical dimensions of practice are integrated in the single moment of contemplative awareness. This prevents both sequential gradualism and mere abstraction.

### 3. The Therapeutic Framework

Modes 5-7 constitute a sophisticated therapeutic apparatus for addressing obstacles in practice. The four-sentence examination, the thirty-seven factors, and the six perfections provide comprehensive tools for diagnosis and treatment.

### 4. Hermeneutical Method

The ten methods for harmonizing teachings offer a principled approach to reconciling apparent contradictions among Buddhist scriptures—a persistent challenge in scholastic Buddhism.

### 5. Practical Psychology

The five repentances, the three animals metaphor, and the discussions of endurance and non-attachment provide practical psychological guidance for practitioners at various stages.

## Relation to Other Fascicles

**Preceding Fascicles (5-6)**: Established Modes 1-4, the foundational contemplative methodology.

**Following Fascicle (8)**: Will address 歷緣對境 (encountering objects in daily life)—the application of contemplation to ordinary experience.

---

## Significance for Tiantai Practice

Fascicle 7 represents the maturation of contemplative methodology. Having established the foundation (Modes 1-4), the practitioner now possesses:

1. **Diagnostic capacity** (Mode 5) to recognize when practice is blocked
2. **Adjustment skills** (Mode 6) to apply appropriate path factors
3. **Therapeutic tools** (Mode 7) for targeted treatment of obstacles
4. **Positional awareness** (Mode 8) to accurately assess progress
5. **Endurance capacity** (Mode 9) to maintain stability through difficulty
6. **Liberative freedom** (Mode 10) from attachment to the path itself

These six modes ensure that practice does not stall at the foundational level but proceeds toward complete realization.

# Fascicle 8: Opening — The Ten Objects of Contemplation
## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 8 (止觀輔行傳弘決卷第八)
**Author**: Miao-lo (Zhanran, 湛然, 711-782 CE)
**Translator**: William Altig / Claude
**Date**: January 23, 2026

**Five Flavors Assessment**: Ghee (法華涅槃) — Fully integrated; everything is the Path
**Six Stages Location**: Practice (修行即) — Active processing of source material

---

## Overview: From Method to Application

Fascicle 8 marks a critical transition in Miao-lo's commentary. Having completed the exposition of the Ten Modes of Contemplation (十乘觀法) in Fascicles 5-7, Miao-lo now addresses what happens when the practitioner **encounters objects** (歷緣對境) in the course of practice.

The Ten Modes provided the foundational methodology. But practice does not occur in a vacuum. The meditator encounters:

- **Internal disturbances**: Afflictions (煩惱), illness (病患), karmic manifestations (業)
- **External phenomena**: Demonic interference (魔事), meditative states (禪定), wrong views (邪見)
- **Advanced stages**: The two vehicles (二乘), bodhisattva practice (菩薩), and Buddhahood (佛)

These are the **Ten Objects** (十境) — phenomena that arise during contemplation and require skilled response.

---

## The Ten Objects (十境)

Miao-lo provides this structural overview:

| # | Object | Chinese | Function |
|---|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Aggregates | 陰入境 | Foundation: contemplate the five aggregates |
| 2 | Afflictions | 煩惱境 | Obstacle: recognize and transform defilements |
| 3 | Illness | 病患境 | Obstacle: work with physical disease |
| 4 | Karma | 業境 | Obstacle: address past actions manifesting |
| 5 | Demons | 魔事境 | Obstacle: discern and resist demonic interference |
| 6 | Meditative States | 禪定境 | Attainment: navigate dhyāna without attachment |
| 7 | Wrong Views | 邪見境 | Obstacle: correct mistaken understanding |
| 8 | Arrogance | 慢境 | Obstacle: overcome spiritual pride |
| 9 | Two Vehicles | 二乘境 | Attainment: transcend limited aspiration |
| 10 | Bodhisattva | 菩薩境 | Attainment: fulfill the bodhisattva path |

**Fascicle 8 covers Objects 2-4**: Afflictions, Illness, and Karma.

---

## The Relationship Between Objects and Modes

Miao-lo clarifies a crucial structural point:

> 自此以下現文六境及略三境。咸是發得。

"From this point onward, the text presents six objects in detail and three objects briefly. All are 'arising and obtaining' [phenomena]."

The Ten Objects are not separate from the Ten Modes. Rather:

- The **Ten Modes** are the contemplative methodology
- The **Ten Objects** are what arises during contemplation
- The practitioner applies the Ten Modes **to** each Object

> 此九境外所起煩惱。乃至四弘但屬陰境三陰所攝。

"Afflictions arising outside these nine objects, and even the four great vows, belong to the aggregate-object and are subsumed under the three aggregates."

This establishes that all phenomena ultimately reduce to the first object (aggregates), but the Buddha distinguished nine additional objects for pedagogical purposes.

---

## The Three Obstacles (三障)

Miao-lo connects the Ten Objects to the traditional classification of three obstacles:

> 如前七隻分別中。云此之十境是三障攝。

"As in the previous sevenfold distinction, these ten objects are subsumed under the three obstacles."

From the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*:

| Obstacle | Chinese | Contents |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Affliction Obstacle | 煩惱障 | Three poisons, five coverings, eight kinds of arrogance, four perversities |
| Karma Obstacle | 業障 | Five heinous acts |
| Retribution Obstacle | 報障 | Three evil paths, slandering the Dharma, icchantika |

> 故知舉惡能障。故名為障。

"Therefore we know that citing evils that can obstruct is why they are called 'obstacles.'"

---

## The Transition: From Foundation to Application

### What Came Before (Fascicles 5-7)

The Ten Modes established:
1. **Mode 1**: Contemplating the inconceivable object (一念三千)
2. **Mode 2**: Arousing the bodhi-mind
3. **Mode 3**: Skillfully settling the mind
4. **Mode 4**: Breaking through all dharmas
5. **Mode 5**: Discerning openness and obstruction
6. **Mode 6**: Adjusting the path factors
7. **Mode 7**: Counteractive aids for opening
8. **Mode 8**: Knowing the sequential positions
9. **Mode 9**: Patient endurance
10. **Mode 10**: Freedom from Dharma-attachment

### What Comes Now (Fascicle 8)

The practitioner, equipped with these ten tools, now encounters specific phenomena that require their application:

1. **Afflictions** (煩惱境): When the three poisons intensify during practice
2. **Illness** (病患境): When physical disease arises
3. **Karma** (業境): When past actions manifest as visions or obstacles

Each of these objects receives:
- Analysis of causes and conditions
- Classification of types
- Treatment methods (both gradual and sudden)
- Application of the ten contemplative modes

---

## Doctrinal Significance

Fascicle 8 represents the integration of contemplative theory with practical application. The Ten Modes are not merely conceptual frameworks but living tools to be applied when the practitioner encounters obstacles.

Miao-lo's approach is distinctive in several ways:

1. **Comprehensive Classification**: Every phenomenon that can arise during practice is categorized and addressed.

2. **Integration of Medical Knowledge**: The illness section incorporates traditional Chinese medicine (pulse diagnosis, five elements, organ theory) within a Buddhist contemplative framework.

3. **Karmic Psychology**: The karma section addresses how past actions manifest as visions and obstacles during meditation, providing both diagnostic and therapeutic guidance.

4. **Gradual and Sudden Methods**: Each object receives both gradual (思議) and sudden (不思議) treatment approaches, accommodating practitioners of different capacities.

---

## Reading Strategy

Given the density of Fascicle 8, the scholarly translation is organized as follows:

- **Section 1**: Affliction Object (煩惱境) — causes, types, treatment
- **Section 2**: Illness Object (病患境) — causes, types, treatment
- **Section 3**: Karma Object (業境) — causes, manifestations, treatment
- **Closing Summary**: Integration and cross-references

Each section includes:
- Direct translation of Miao-lo's commentary
- Embedded Chinese for key terms
- Footnotes for doctrinal context
- Technical vocabulary tables

# Fascicle 8: Section 1 — The Affliction Object (煩惱境)
## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 8, Part 1 (卷第八之一)
**Author**: Miao-lo (Zhanran, 湛然, 711-782 CE)
**Translator**: William Altig / Claude
**Date**: January 23, 2026

**Five Flavors Assessment**: Ghee (法華涅槃) — Fully integrated; afflictions as Buddha-nature
**Six Stages Location**: Practice (修行即) — Active processing of source material

---

## Object 2: The Affliction Object (煩惱境)

### I. Introduction: From Method to Encounter

Having established the Ten Modes of contemplation (十乘觀法) in Fascicles 5-7, Miao-lo now addresses what happens when the practitioner **encounters phenomena** (歷緣對境) during practice. The Affliction Object is the second of the Ten Objects, arising immediately after the practitioner begins contemplating the aggregates (陰入境).

> 自此以下現文六境及略三境。咸是發得。

"From this point onward, the text presents six objects in detail and three objects briefly. All are 'arising and obtaining' [phenomena]."

This indicates that Objects 2-7 receive full treatment while Objects 8-10 receive condensed treatment. The Affliction Object initiates this sequence.

### II. The Nature of Affliction Arising

Miao-lo identifies three causes for affliction arising during contemplation:

#### A. Habitual Karma (習因)

> 若見思未窮但是習因

"If view-delusions and thought-delusions have not been exhausted, this is simply habitual cause."

The practitioner who has not yet severed the roots of defilement will naturally experience afflictions arising from accumulated habitual patterns. This is not pathological but expected.

#### B. Intentional Karma (作意)

> 若起現行故生煩惱名作意業

"If one generates afflictions through present activity, this is called intentional karma."

This refers to afflictions generated in the present moment through incorrect mental operation—what the Indian tradition calls "unwise attention" (ayoniśomanaskāra, 非如理作意).

#### C. Demonic Activity (魔事)

> 或魔所為令發煩惱

"Or demons may cause afflictions to arise."

Miao-lo includes the possibility that external forces (魔, māra) may intensify afflictions beyond what the practitioner's own karma would produce. This receives full treatment in Object 5 (魔事境).

### III. The Three Poisons and Their Derivatives

Miao-lo organizes afflictions according to the traditional classification:

#### The Root Three (三毒)

| Affliction | Chinese | Function |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Greed | 貪 | Attachment to agreeable objects |
| Hatred | 瞋 | Aversion to disagreeable objects |
| Delusion | 癡 | Confusion regarding neutral objects |

> 遇順境故生貪。遇違境故生瞋。遇非違非順境故生癡。

"Encountering agreeable conditions, greed arises. Encountering disagreeable conditions, hatred arises. Encountering conditions neither disagreeable nor agreeable, delusion arises."

This aligns with Śāntideva's analysis in the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*: when the mind moves toward an agreeable object, passion arises; toward a disagreeable object, hatred arises; toward a neutral object, delusion arises.

#### The Five Coverings (五蓋)

| Covering | Chinese | Characteristic |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Desire | 貪欲蓋 | Craving for sensory pleasure |
| Ill-will | 瞋恚蓋 | Hostility and resentment |
| Sloth-torpor | 睡眠蓋 | Mental dullness and drowsiness |
| Restlessness-remorse | 掉悔蓋 | Agitation and regret |
| Doubt | 疑蓋 | Hesitation regarding the path |

### IV. The Relationship to Prior Practices

Miao-lo addresses why afflictions arise even after the practitioner has completed the preliminary practices of "rejecting desires and abandoning coverings" (訶欲棄蓋):

> 如前訶欲棄蓋。與此何異。

"How does this differ from the previous [teaching on] rejecting desires and abandoning coverings?"

His answer establishes a critical distinction:

> 前是助道方便。今是發得正觀。前是未發。今是已發。

"The previous was a preparatory aid to the path. Now is the arising and obtaining of correct contemplation. The previous was before arising; now is after arising."

The preliminary practices (訶欲棄蓋) prepare the mind for contemplation but do not address what happens **during** contemplation when afflictions intensify due to practice itself. The Affliction Object addresses this second, more subtle level.

### V. The 36-Sentence Framework

Miao-lo introduces the comprehensive framework for analyzing afflictions:

> 六根對六塵生六識。識之所對名事煩惱。三六十八。由觀成二。故成三十六。

"The six sense faculties confronting six sense objects generate six consciousnesses. What consciousness confronts is called 'affair-affliction.' Three times six is eighteen. Because contemplation creates two [categories], it becomes thirty-six."

This produces the 36-sentence structure:

| Category | Sense Organs | Objects | Consciousnesses | Total |
|----------|--------------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Contact | 6 | 6 | 6 | 18 |
| × Observing/Observed | — | — | — | ×2 |
| **Total** | — | — | — | **36** |

Each of the 18 contact-points is examined from two perspectives:
1. **As observer** (能觀): How the practitioner's contemplation relates to the affliction
2. **As observed** (所觀): How the affliction appears as object of contemplation

### VI. Treatment Methods: Gradual and Sudden

#### A. Gradual Treatment (思議)

The gradual approach applies specific antidotes (pratipakṣa, 對治) to specific afflictions:

| Affliction | Antidote | Chinese |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Greed | Impurity contemplation | 不淨觀 |
| Hatred | Loving-kindness contemplation | 慈悲觀 |
| Delusion | Dependent origination contemplation | 因緣觀 |
| Distraction | Breath-counting | 數息觀 |
| Arrogance | Element-contemplation | 界分別觀 |

This corresponds to the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s prescription: impurity (aśubha) for passion, loving-kindness (maitrī) for hatred, dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda) for delusion.

#### B. Sudden Treatment (不思議)

The sudden approach does not apply antidotes but directly perceives the empty nature of afflictions:

> 煩惱即菩提。不須更斷。

"Afflictions are precisely bodhi. There is no need for further severance."

This accords with the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s ultimate teaching: "By the very understanding of these afflictions, there is bodhi. Whatever is the nature of afflictions, that is the nature of bodhi."

Miao-lo clarifies that this is not license for indulgence:

> 非謂縱任。乃是了達煩惱性空。

"This does not mean indulgence. It means thoroughly penetrating that the nature of afflictions is empty."

### VII. Applying the Ten Modes to Afflictions

Miao-lo demonstrates how each of the Ten Modes applies to the Affliction Object:

#### Mode 1: Contemplating the Inconceivable Object (觀不思議境)

> 觀煩惱即是法界。一念三千。無非佛法。

"Contemplate that afflictions are precisely the dharma-realm. In one thought, three thousand [realms]. Nothing is not Buddha-dharma."

The affliction is not observed as something to be eliminated but as the very manifestation of the three thousand realms in a single moment of thought. Greed, when contemplated correctly, reveals the entire structure of reality.

#### Mode 2: Arousing the Bodhi-Mind (發菩提心)

> 因煩惱發大誓願。眾生無邊煩惱無盡。

"Because of afflictions, generate the great vow. Sentient beings are limitless; afflictions are inexhaustible."

The Four Great Vows are aroused precisely because afflictions exist. Without afflictions, there would be no need for the bodhisattva path.

#### Mode 3: Skillfully Settling the Mind (善巧安心)

> 安心於煩惱。不動不轉。

"Settle the mind upon afflictions. Neither moving nor turning."

Rather than fleeing from afflictions, the practitioner settles the mind directly upon them, using them as the very object of stabilization.

#### Mode 4: Breaking Through All Dharmas (破法遍)

> 破煩惱相。見煩惱空。

"Break through the characteristics of afflictions. See that afflictions are empty."

This applies the breaking-through contemplation specifically to afflictions, dismantling their appearance of solidity.

#### Mode 5: Discerning Openness and Obstruction (識通塞)

> 煩惱即塞。了煩惱空即通。通塞不二。

"Afflictions are precisely obstruction. Understanding afflictions as empty is precisely openness. Openness and obstruction are non-dual."

The diagnostic function of Mode 5 determines whether the practitioner is blocked by or liberated through afflictions.

#### Modes 6-10: Complete Application

The remaining modes (調道品, 助道對治, 識次位, 能安忍, 無法愛) are applied similarly, with afflictions serving as the specific object to which each mode addresses itself.

### VIII. The Four Perversities (四顛倒)

Miao-lo connects afflictions to the fundamental perversities:

| Perversity | Takes | For | Chinese |
|------------|-------|-----|---------|
| 1 | Impermanent | Permanent | 常顛倒 |
| 2 | Suffering | Happiness | 樂顛倒 |
| 3 | Non-self | Self | 我顛倒 |
| 4 | Impure | Pure | 淨顛倒 |

> 此四顛倒是煩惱之根本。

"These four perversities are the root of afflictions."

All afflictions ultimately derive from these four fundamental misperceptions. The treatment of afflictions therefore requires addressing these root causes.

### IX. The Eight Kinds of Arrogance (八慢)

Miao-lo lists the eight forms of pride that constitute subtle afflictions:

1. **慢** (māna) — Basic pride: thinking oneself superior
2. **過慢** (atimāna) — Excessive pride: thinking oneself equal to superiors
3. **慢過慢** (mānātimāna) — Pride upon pride: thinking oneself superior to superiors
4. **我慢** (asmimāna) — Self-pride: attachment to the five aggregates as "I"
5. **增上慢** (adhimāna) — Presumptuous pride: claiming attainments not realized
6. **卑慢** (ūnamāna) — Pride of inferiority: thinking "I am only slightly inferior"
7. **邪慢** (mithyāmāna) — Wrong pride: pride in wrong accomplishments
8. **傲慢** — Arrogance: general condescension toward others

### X. Doctrinal Significance

The Affliction Object (煩惱境) establishes a foundational principle for Tiantai practice: afflictions are not merely obstacles to be eliminated but **objects of contemplation** that reveal the nature of reality when correctly approached.

This differs from gradual paths that treat afflictions solely as enemies:

> 若但斷煩惱。未見煩惱性。雖似離煩惱。還復起煩惱。

"If one merely severs afflictions without seeing the nature of afflictions, although one seems to leave afflictions behind, they will arise again."

The Tiantai approach—grounded in the Perfect Teaching (圓教)—perceives afflictions as the very material through which enlightenment manifests. This does not excuse indulgence but requires the deepest penetration of affliction's empty nature.

## Object 3: The Illness Object (病患境)

### I. Introduction: Illness as Contemplative Phenomenon

The third of the Ten Objects addresses physical illness (病患) that arises during meditation practice. Unlike the Affliction Object, which deals with mental disturbances, the Illness Object concerns the body itself.

> 次明病患。病起多途。

"Next, we clarify illness. Illness arises through many channels."

Miao-lo immediately signals that illness is not a single phenomenon but manifests through diverse causes, each requiring distinct recognition and treatment.

### II. The Six Causes of Illness

Miao-lo identifies six primary causes of illness arising during practice:

#### A. Four Elements Imbalance (四大不調)

> 四大不調故病

"Illness due to the four great elements being out of balance."

The body is constituted of earth (地), water (水), fire (火), and wind (風). When these fall out of proportion, illness results:

| Element | Excess Produces | Deficiency Produces |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Earth (地) | Heaviness, tumors | Weakness, emaciation |
| Water (水) | Swelling, phlegm | Dryness, fever |
| Fire (火) | Fever, inflammation | Coldness, poor digestion |
| Wind (風) | Trembling, pain | Stiffness, paralysis |

> 地大增者。肢節沈重。水大增者。涕唾流溢。火大增者。身熱燋燥。風大增者。氣息喘急。

"When earth increases, the limbs become heavy. When water increases, mucus and saliva overflow. When fire increases, the body becomes hot and parched. When wind increases, the breath becomes labored."

#### B. Improper Diet (飲食不節)

> 飲食不節故病

"Illness due to immoderate eating and drinking."

This includes:
- Eating too much or too little
- Eating at improper times
- Eating incompatible foods together
- Eating impure or unsuitable foods

The *Śikṣāsamuccaya* similarly emphasizes that food should be taken "not for beauty or strength, but merely to sustain the body for the practice of the Path."

#### C. Meditation Imbalance (坐禪不調)

> 坐禪不調故病

"Illness due to imbalanced sitting meditation."

This is particularly relevant to contemplatives. Meditation itself can cause illness when:

1. **Posture errors**: Sitting incorrectly strains the body
2. **Breath control errors**: Forcing the breath disrupts the wind element
3. **Mental forcing**: Excessive striving creates tension
4. **Timing errors**: Meditating when exhausted or ill

> 若坐禪時不善調和。身中四大互相乖越。則病發生。

"If during seated meditation one does not skillfully harmonize, the four elements in the body mutually transgress each other, and illness arises."

#### D. Karmic Manifestation (業報所感)

> 業報所感故病

"Illness due to the manifestation of karmic retribution."

Some illnesses arise not from present causes but from past karma ripening in the present:

> 過去惡業今生受報。故生重病。

"Evil karma from past lives is now being experienced as retribution. Therefore heavy illness arises."

This type of illness may not respond to medical treatment or contemplative adjustment because its root lies in the karmic storehouse.

#### E. Demonic Interference (鬼神所作)

> 鬼神所作故病

"Illness caused by ghosts and spirits."

External non-human entities may afflict the body:

> 若有魔鬼附著其身。則病苦發。

"If demonic ghosts attach to the body, illness and suffering arise."

This requires different treatment methods—specifically, the protective practices (護持) and dharani recitation discussed in the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*.

#### F. Contemplative Rebound (觀行逆發)

> 觀行力故舊業發動

"Due to the power of contemplative practice, old karma is activated."

This is distinctive to practitioners. Intensive contemplation can accelerate karmic maturation, causing latent diseases to manifest prematurely:

> 由功行故。宿業遂發。而為疾患。

"Due to meritorious practice, latent karma is activated and becomes illness."

This is sometimes called "purification through practice"—the body processes old karma more rapidly because of contemplative intensity.

### III. The 101 Illnesses

Miao-lo references the traditional classification of 101 diseases:

> 一大不調有百一病。四大不調有四百四病。

"When one great element is out of balance, there are 101 illnesses. When all four great elements are out of balance, there are 404 illnesses."

This derives from Indian medical theory transmitted through Buddhist texts:

| Category | Number | Total |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Earth imbalance | 101 | 101 |
| Water imbalance | 101 | 101 |
| Fire imbalance | 101 | 101 |
| Wind imbalance | 101 | 101 |
| **Total** | — | **404** |

### IV. Six Treatment Methods

Miao-lo presents six methods for treating illness that arises during practice:

#### Method 1: Breath Regulation (止息)

> 若因坐禪氣息不調而發病者。當善調息。

"If illness arises during seated meditation due to imbalanced breath, one should skillfully regulate the breath."

This includes the **Six Healing Breaths** (六氣):

| Breath | Sound | Function | Element |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| 吹 (chuī) | "blowing" | Cools heat | Fire excess |
| 呼 (hū) | "exhaling" | Expels blockage | Earth excess |
| 嘻 (xī) | "sighing" | Disperses wind | Wind excess |
| 呵 (hē) | "ha" | Releases heart-fire | Fire/heart |
| 噓 (xū) | "shh" | Calms liver | Wood/liver |
| 呬 (sì) | "ss" | Clears lungs | Metal/lung |

#### Method 2: Mental Adjustment (假想)

> 若四大不調而發病者。當作假想觀。

"If illness arises due to four-element imbalance, one should practice imaginative contemplation."

This involves visualizing the elements coming into balance:

> 想諸氣息流入百脈。隨意周遍。想冷想暖。隨病所宜。

"Imagine the various breaths flowing into the hundred channels, pervading throughout as desired. Imagine cold or warmth according to what the illness requires."

#### Method 3: Twelve Breath Techniques (十二息)

Miao-lo lists twelve types of breath manipulation:

1. 上息 (ascending breath)
2. 下息 (descending breath)
3. 滿息 (filling breath)
4. 燋息 (parching breath)
5. 增長息 (increasing breath)
6. 滅壞息 (destroying breath)
7. 暖息 (warming breath)
8. 冷息 (cooling breath)
9. 衝息 (rushing breath)
10. 持息 (holding breath)
11. 和息 (harmonizing breath)
12. 補息 (supplementing breath)

> 此十二種息。治四百四病。隨病所宜。善巧用之。

"These twelve kinds of breath treat the 404 illnesses. According to what each illness requires, use them skillfully."

#### Method 4: Mental Stabilization (安心)

> 若病由心生。當安心觀法。

"If illness arises from the mind, one should stabilize the mind and contemplate dharma."

This addresses psychosomatic illness—conditions generated by mental states affecting the body:

> 攀緣憂畏故發病者。當安心不動。

"If illness arises from grasping, worry, and fear, one should stabilize the mind without movement."

#### Method 5: Medical Treatment (服藥)

> 若四大病甚。非觀行所治者。當服諸藥。

"If the four-element illness is severe and not treatable by contemplative practice, one should take medicines."

Miao-lo acknowledges that contemplation cannot treat all illnesses. Some require external intervention:

> 隨病服藥。不著於味。

"Take medicine according to the illness without attachment to its taste."

This aligns with the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s instruction that medicine should be taken "without greed or attachment to taste."

#### Method 6: Mantras and Protective Practices (持呪)

> 若鬼神病。當誦呪術。

"If the illness is from ghosts and spirits, one should recite mantras."

For illness caused by external entities:

> 誦持神呪。存念三寶。

"Recite and maintain divine mantras. Be mindful of the Three Treasures."

### V. Applying the Ten Modes to Illness

Miao-lo demonstrates how each of the Ten Modes applies to the Illness Object:

#### Mode 1: Contemplating the Inconceivable Object (觀不思議境)

> 觀病即法界。四大即三諦。

"Contemplate that illness is precisely the dharma-realm. The four great elements are precisely the three truths."

The illness is not separate from reality; it manifests the three truths:

- **Empty**: The illness has no inherent existence
- **Provisional**: It functions as a temporary condition
- **Middle**: It integrates both aspects simultaneously

#### Mode 2: Arousing the Bodhi-Mind (發菩提心)

> 因病發心。眾生有病我亦有病。同體大悲。

"Because of illness, generate the [bodhi-]mind. When sentient beings are ill, I too am ill. This is great compassion of the same essence."

The practitioner's own illness becomes a gateway to compassion for all who suffer illness throughout the dharma-realm.

#### Mode 3: Skillfully Settling the Mind (善巧安心)

> 安心於病。不生厭離。不生貪著。

"Settle the mind upon illness. Generate neither aversion nor attachment."

The practitioner neither rejects the illness with disgust nor grasps at it with fascination, but settles the mind in equanimity.

#### Modes 4-10: Complete Application

The remaining modes are applied similarly:

- **Mode 4** (破法遍): Break through the characteristics of illness
- **Mode 5** (識通塞): Discern when illness obstructs or opens the path
- **Mode 6** (調道品): Adjust the path-factors to accommodate illness
- **Mode 7** (助道對治): Apply aids and antidotes appropriate to illness
- **Mode 8** (識次位): Recognize one's stage relative to illness
- **Mode 9** (能安忍): Endure illness with patience
- **Mode 10** (無法愛): Avoid attachment to states achieved during illness

### VI. The Body as Contemplative Object

The *Śikṣāsamuccaya* describes the body as a collection of impurities—"a sack of grain" filled with various substances, "a residence of eighty thousand families of worms." Miao-lo incorporates this perspective:

> 觀身不淨。四大假合。

"Contemplate the body as impure. The four great elements are provisionally combined."

Yet the Tiantai approach integrates this with the understanding that the body is also the vehicle of practice:

> 借假修真。不棄此身。

"Borrow the provisional to cultivate the real. Do not abandon this body."

The body—with all its illnesses—becomes the very medium through which realization occurs.

### VII. Cognitive Deconstruction of Illness

Following the emptiness teaching, Miao-lo applies analytical deconstruction:

> 病從何來。病往何去。中間誰病。

"Where does illness come from? Where does illness go? Who is ill in between?"

This corresponds to the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s analysis: "By analyzing the elements, one realizes there is no 'self,' 'being,' or 'living soul' that is actually sick or suffering; there are only the elements and conditions interacting."

> 尋病不可得。即是病性空。

"Searching for illness, it cannot be found. This is precisely the empty nature of illness."

### VIII. Doctrinal Significance

The Illness Object (病患境) establishes that physical conditions arising during practice are not impediments but objects of contemplation themselves. Miao-lo presents a graduated approach:

1. **Recognize the cause**: Identify which of the six causes applies
2. **Apply appropriate treatment**: Match method to cause
3. **Contemplate the nature**: Perceive illness as empty, provisional, and middle
4. **Transform into path**: Use illness as gateway to compassion and wisdom

This differs from approaches that view illness as purely negative:

> 善知識能轉病為道。

"Good teachers can transform illness into the path."

The practitioner who becomes ill during contemplation has not failed—they have encountered another object requiring the application of the Ten Modes.

---

## Object 4: The Karma Object (業境)

### I. Introduction: Karma as Contemplative Phenomenon

The fourth of the Ten Objects addresses karma (業) that arises during contemplation. Unlike the Affliction Object (mental disturbance) and Illness Object (physical condition), the Karma Object concerns the manifestation of past actions as visions, signs, and obstacles during meditation.

> 次明業境。業是過去所造。今因禪觀而發。

"Next, we clarify the karma object. Karma is what was created in the past. Now, because of meditative contemplation, it arises."

Miao-lo identifies a distinctive phenomenon: intensive practice can accelerate the manifestation of latent karma, causing past actions to appear as present experiences during meditation.

### II. The Nature of Karmic Manifestation

#### A. How Karma Arises During Practice

> 由觀行力故。宿世惡業忽然現前。

"Due to the power of contemplative practice, evil karma from past lives suddenly manifests in the present."

This occurs through several mechanisms:

1. **Contemplative acceleration**: Deep practice speeds karmic ripening
2. **Mental purification**: As obscurations thin, latent karma becomes visible
3. **Karmic pressure**: Accumulated karma seeks expression

> 如風吹土。塵埃忽起。非風造塵。塵本在土。

"Like wind blowing earth, dust suddenly rises. The wind does not create the dust; the dust was already in the earth."

Miao-lo's metaphor clarifies that practice does not create karma but reveals what was already present.

#### B. Forms of Karmic Manifestation

Karma manifests in several ways during meditation:

| Manifestation | Chinese | Description |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Visions | 見業相 | Past actions appear as mental images |
| Physical sensations | 身業發 | Bodily symptoms tied to past karma |
| Emotional surges | 心業發 | Sudden waves of guilt, fear, or remorse |
| Dream signs | 夢中業相 | Karmic content in dreams |

### III. The Classification of Karmic Signs (業相)

Miao-lo systematizes the signs that indicate karmic manifestation:

#### A. Signs of Unwholesome Karma (不善業相)

> 若見地獄餓鬼畜生等相。當知是過去不善業發。

"If one sees signs of hell, hungry ghosts, or animals, know that this is past unwholesome karma arising."

| Vision | Indicates | Past Cause |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Hell realms | Heavy negative karma | Killing, hatred |
| Hungry ghost realms | Moderate negative karma | Greed, stinginess |
| Animal realms | Delusion-based karma | Ignorance, stupidity |
| Asura realms | Contentious karma | Jealousy, fighting |

This corresponds to the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s teaching on visualizing karmic results—specific past actions manifest as "grotesque forms" during contemplation.

#### B. Signs of Wholesome Karma (善業相)

> 若見天宮人道淨土等相。當知是過去善業發。

"If one sees heavenly palaces, human realms, or pure lands, know that this is past wholesome karma arising."

Even positive karmic signs require attention—they can generate attachment and pride.

#### C. Signs of Purification (淨業相)

The *Śikṣāsamuccaya* provides specific purification signs that appear in dreams:

- Vomiting bad food (expelling negativity)
- Eating yogurt or milk (receiving pure nourishment)
- Seeing sun or moon (illumination)
- Moving through sky (transcendence)
- Defeating dark figures (overcoming Māra/death)
- Seeing monastic assembly (connection to Sangha)
- Climbing trees or mountains (spiritual ascent)

> 夢中見斬頭。是煩惱盡相。

"Dreaming of beheading indicates the exhaustion of afflictions."

### IV. The Three Types of Karma

Miao-lo classifies karma according to its weight and treatability:

#### A. Fixed Karma (定業)

> 定業者。重業必受果報。

"Fixed karma: heavy karma that must receive its retribution."

This includes the five heinous acts (五逆):
1. Killing one's father
2. Killing one's mother
3. Killing an arhat
4. Shedding the blood of a Buddha
5. Creating schism in the Sangha

#### B. Unfixed Karma (不定業)

> 不定業者。輕業可轉。

"Unfixed karma: light karma that can be transformed."

This karma is susceptible to change through practice, repentance, and contemplation.

#### C. Present-Life Karma (現業)

> 現業者。今生所造。

"Present-life karma: what is created in this lifetime."

This is still being formed and can be redirected before it ripens.

### V. The Four Powers of Purification

Miao-lo draws on the traditional four powers (四力) for working with karma, corresponding to the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s *Caturdharmaka Sūtra* teaching:

#### Power 1: Revulsion (追悔力)

> 追悔力者。於所造罪深生慚愧。

"The power of revulsion: regarding the created sins, generate deep shame and remorse."

This involves acknowledging specific past actions without rationalization or denial.

#### Power 2: Antidote (對治力)

> 對治力者。修諸善法以滅惡業。

"The power of the antidote: cultivate various wholesome dharmas to extinguish evil karma."

Specific antidotes include:
- Studying profound sutras
- Meditating on emptiness
- Reciting mantras
- Erecting Buddha images
- Offering at stupas

#### Power 3: Restraint (遮止力)

> 遮止力者。誓願更不復作。

"The power of restraint: vow never to repeat the action."

This is the binding commitment to abstain from future negative actions.

#### Power 4: Support (依止力)

> 依止力者。歸依三寶發菩提心。

"The power of support: take refuge in the Three Treasures and generate bodhicitta."

The *Śikṣāsamuccaya* compares bodhicitta to "the fire at the end of an aeon, capable of consuming enormous amounts of past negative karma."

### VI. Applying the Ten Modes to Karma

Miao-lo demonstrates how each of the Ten Modes applies to the Karma Object:

#### Mode 1: Contemplating the Inconceivable Object (觀不思議境)

> 觀業即法界。業性本空。

"Contemplate that karma is precisely the dharma-realm. The nature of karma is fundamentally empty."

The karma is not separate from reality; it manifests the three truths:

- **Empty**: Karma has no inherent existence; no "doer" can be found
- **Provisional**: It functions according to causes and conditions
- **Middle**: It integrates both aspects simultaneously

> 業如夢幻。雖有作用。而無實體。

"Karma is like a dream or illusion. Although it has function, it has no real substance."

This corresponds to the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s teaching: "While karma and its ripening function, no intrinsic 'thing' moves from this life to the next."

#### Mode 2: Arousing the Bodhi-Mind (發菩提心)

> 因業發心。我及眾生皆有如是業障。願皆解脫。

"Because of karma, generate the [bodhi-]mind. Both I and all sentient beings have such karmic obstacles. May all be liberated."

The practitioner's own karmic manifestations become a gateway to universal compassion.

#### Mode 3: Skillfully Settling the Mind (善巧安心)

> 安心於業相。不驚不怖。不喜不憂。

"Settle the mind upon karmic signs. Neither startled nor frightened, neither pleased nor worried."

The practitioner maintains equanimity whether positive or negative karma manifests.

#### Mode 4: Breaking Through All Dharmas (破法遍)

> 破業相空。無業可得。

"Break through karmic characteristics to emptiness. No karma can be found."

This applies the analytical deconstruction:

> 業從何來。業往何去。誰是業者。

"Where does karma come from? Where does karma go? Who is the one with karma?"

Upon investigation, no substantial karma or karma-bearer can be located.

#### Mode 5: Discerning Openness and Obstruction (識通塞)

> 執業即塞。了業空即通。

"Grasping karma is obstruction. Understanding karma as empty is openness."

The diagnostic function determines whether karmic manifestation obstructs or opens the path.

#### Modes 6-10: Complete Application

The remaining modes are applied:

- **Mode 6** (調道品): Adjust path-factors according to karmic conditions
- **Mode 7** (助道對治): Apply specific antidotes (四力) to karmic obstacles
- **Mode 8** (識次位): Recognize one's stage relative to karmic purification
- **Mode 9** (能安忍): Endure karmic manifestations with patience
- **Mode 10** (無法愛): Avoid attachment to states of purification

### VII. The Ultimate Purification

Miao-lo presents the highest teaching on karma purification:

> 業性本空。何須更滅。了業即空。業即解脫。

"The nature of karma is fundamentally empty. What need is there to extinguish it further? Understanding karma as empty—karma is itself liberation."

This corresponds to the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s ultimate teaching: "True purification is seeing 'transgression as no-transgression.'"

> 若了諸法本來清淨。無有自性。則雖造惡業。不墮惡道。

"If one understands that all dharmas are fundamentally pure and without self-nature, then even having created evil karma, one does not fall into evil paths."

However, Miao-lo immediately guards against misunderstanding:

> 非謂縱任。乃是真實見業空故。

"This does not mean indulgence. It is because one truly sees that karma is empty."

This realization must be genuine insight, not intellectual concept used to excuse behavior.

### VIII. Special Cases: Heavy Karma

For particularly heavy karma (such as the five heinous acts), Miao-lo prescribes intensified methods:

> 若造五逆。當勤修懺悔。求佛加護。

"If one has committed the five heinous acts, one should diligently practice repentance and seek the Buddha's protective blessing."

Specific methods include:

1. **Recitation of Buddha names**: Especially the 35 Buddhas or Medicine Buddha
2. **Dharani recitation**: Protective mantras such as the Cundī Dhāraṇī
3. **Invoking Ākāśagarbha**: For confession of root downfalls
4. **Stupa offerings**: Even a single flower can prevent lower rebirth

### IX. Doctrinal Significance

The Karma Object (業境) completes the triad of internal obstacles:
- **Object 2** (煩惱境): Mental afflictions
- **Object 3** (病患境): Physical illness
- **Object 4** (業境): Karmic manifestations

Together, these three address what arises from within the practitioner during contemplation. The remaining objects (5-10) address external phenomena and advanced stages.

The Tiantai approach to karma is distinctive:

> 不同小乘斷業。亦不同外道自然。乃是圓教即業論空。

"This is not like the Hīnayāna severance of karma, nor like the non-Buddhist doctrine of naturalism. It is the Perfect Teaching's [approach of] understanding karma as empty."

The practitioner neither eliminates karma through ascetic effort nor ignores it through philosophical dismissal, but penetrates to its empty nature while respecting its functional power.

| 2. Affliction | 煩惱境 | Mind | Three poisons, five coverings, eight kinds of arrogance |
| 3. Illness | 病患境 | Body | Four-element imbalance, six causes, six treatments |
| 4. Karma | 業境 | Action | Past karma manifesting, four powers of purification |

These three objects correspond to the traditional Three Obstacles (三障) from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*:

| Obstacle | Objects | Domain |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Affliction Obstacle (煩惱障) | Object 2 | Mental defilements |
| Karma Obstacle (業障) | Object 4 | Past actions |
| Retribution Obstacle (報障) | Object 3 | Bodily conditions |

---

## The Transition from Method to Application

Fascicle 8 marks the critical transition from the **Ten Modes** (methodology) to the **Ten Objects** (application):

### What Fascicles 5-7 Established

The Ten Modes of contemplation:
1. Contemplating the inconceivable object (一念三千)
2. Arousing the bodhi-mind
3. Skillfully settling the mind
4. Breaking through all dharmas
5. Discerning openness and obstruction
6. Adjusting the path-factors
7. Counteractive aids for opening
8. Knowing the sequential positions
9. Patient endurance
10. Freedom from dharma-attachment

### What Fascicle 8 Demonstrates

How to **apply** these ten methods when the practitioner encounters:
- Mental disturbance (afflictions intensifying)
- Physical disturbance (illness arising)
- Karmic disturbance (past actions manifesting)

Each object receives:
1. Classification of types and causes
2. Treatment methods (gradual and sudden)
3. Application of all ten modes
4. Ultimate integration (empty, provisional, middle)

---

## The Structure of Treatment

### Gradual Treatment (思議)

Each object has specific antidotes:

**Afflictions**:
| Affliction | Antidote |
|------------|----------|
| Greed | Impurity contemplation |
| Hatred | Loving-kindness contemplation |
| Delusion | Dependent origination contemplation |

**Illness**:
| Cause | Treatment |
|-------|-----------|
| Element imbalance | Breath regulation, visualization |
| Diet | Dietary adjustment |
| Meditation error | Posture and method correction |
| Karmic | Contemplative acceptance |
| Demonic | Mantras, protection |

**Karma**:
| Power | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Revulsion | Acknowledge with remorse |
| Antidote | Practice positive actions |
| Restraint | Vow not to repeat |
| Support | Rely on Three Treasures |

### Sudden Treatment (不思議)

All three objects receive the same ultimate treatment:

> 煩惱即菩提。病即法界。業性本空。

"Afflictions are precisely bodhi. Illness is precisely the dharma-realm. The nature of karma is fundamentally empty."

This is not philosophical bypassing but genuine penetration to the empty nature of each obstacle.

---

## The Relationship of Objects to Modes

Miao-lo clarifies the structural relationship:

> 十境非十乘。十乘觀十境。

"The Ten Objects are not the Ten Modes. The Ten Modes contemplate the Ten Objects."

The relationship is:

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Ten Modes | The methodology (how to contemplate) |
| Ten Objects | The phenomena (what is contemplated) |

Each object receives all ten modes applied to it. Therefore:
- Object 2 (Affliction) × 10 Modes = 10 applications
- Object 3 (Illness) × 10 Modes = 10 applications
- Object 4 (Karma) × 10 Modes = 10 applications

---

## Cross-References to Indian Sources

Fascicle 8's teachings align with the *Śikṣāsamuccaya* on multiple points:

### Affliction Object
- Three poisons arising through "unwise attention" (ayoniśomanaskāra)
- Specific antidotes (pratipakṣa) for specific afflictions
- Ultimate teaching: "By understanding afflictions, there is bodhi"

### Illness Object
- Body as impure collection of elements
- Medicine taken "without attachment to taste"
- Body as vehicle for practice, not abandoned but transformed

### Karma Object
- Four powers of purification (Caturdharmaka)
- Karmic signs appearing in dreams during purification
- Ultimate realization: "transgression as no-transgression"

---

## The Integration of Three Truths

Each object is ultimately perceived through the Three Truths:

| Object | Empty | Provisional | Middle |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Affliction | No inherent existence | Functions as defilement | Neither grasped nor rejected |
| Illness | No real disease | Functions as condition | Neither fled nor cultivated |
| Karma | No substantial action | Functions as cause-effect | Neither eliminated nor indulged |

The practitioner applies this threefold perception simultaneously, not sequentially.

---

## Preparation for Fascicle 9

Having completed the three internal obstacles, Miao-lo will address the **external obstacles** in Fascicle 9:

| Object | Chinese | Domain |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 5. Demons | 魔事境 | External interference |
| 6. Meditative States | 禪定境 | Attainment as obstacle |
| 7. Wrong Views | 邪見境 | Mistaken understanding |

These three require different treatment because they involve phenomena from outside the practitioner's immediate experience.

---

## Key Technical Terms Across Fascicle 8

| Chinese | Pinyin | Definition |
|---------|--------|------------|
| 十境 | shí jìng | Ten Objects |
| 三障 | sān zhàng | Three Obstacles |
| 煩惱境 | fán nǎo jìng | Affliction Object |
| 病患境 | bìng huàn jìng | Illness Object |
| 業境 | yè jìng | Karma Object |
| 思議 | sī yì | Conceivable (gradual treatment) |
| 不思議 | bù sī yì | Inconceivable (sudden treatment) |
| 對治 | duì zhì | Antidote |
| 四力 | sì lì | Four Powers |
| 六氣 | liù qì | Six Healing Breaths |
| 業性本空 | yè xìng běn kōng | Nature of karma fundamentally empty |
| 煩惱即菩提 | fán nǎo jí pú tí | Afflictions are precisely bodhi |

---

## Doctrinal Significance

Fascicle 8 establishes the foundational Tiantai principle for working with obstacles:

> 障即是道。無障可離。

"Obstacles are precisely the path. There are no obstacles to leave behind."

This does not mean obstacles are ignored or indulged, but that they are the very material through which realization occurs. The practitioner who encounters afflictions, illness, or karma during practice has not failed—they have encountered the path itself.

The Perfect Teaching (圓教) integrates all phenomena within the single vehicle. Nothing is excluded; nothing is merely negative; everything becomes the gateway.

# Fascicle 9: Opening — The Meditative States Object
## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 9 (止觀輔行傳弘決卷第九)
**Author**: Miao-lo (Zhanran, 湛然, 711-782 CE)
**Translator**: William Altig / Claude
**Date**: January 23, 2026

**Five Flavors Assessment**: Ghee (法華涅槃) — Integration of all meditative states into the One Vehicle
**Six Stages Location**: Practice (修行即) — Deepening the cultivation through specific states

---

## Overview: The Realm of Dhyāna (禪境)

Fascicle 9 is entirely dedicated to the **Sixth Object**: **Meditative States** (禪定境, *chán dìng jìng*).

Having addressed the obstacles of Afflictions, Illness, and Karma in the previous fascicle (and presumably Mara, though Mara often overlaps with these), Miao-lo now turns to the **attainments** that arise during practice. These states are "objects" (境) because they can become:
1.  **Obstacles**: If the practitioner clings to them or mistakes them for liberation.
2.  **Vehicles**: If the practitioner contemplates them with the Ten Modes.

This fascicle provides a comprehensive encyclopedic treatment of Buddhist meditation states, ranging from ordinary worldly dhyānas to the most advanced Mahāyāna samādhis.

---

## The Necessity of Contemplating Dhyāna

Miao-lo explains why this object must be contemplated:

> 若入流竟者。初住已去無功用故。若此位兼發一切事禪。任運即理不須更觀。今令觀者在於假名五品位中。

"If one has 'entered the stream' (entered the First Abode), there is no [deliberate] effort. If in this position one concurrently develops all phenomenal dhyānas, they naturally accord with principle and need not be further contemplated. The instruction to contemplate now lies within the **proficience-in-names** (five grades) position."

Practitioners in the early stages (Five Grades) may develop deep meditative states due to past karma or present practice. Without correct contemplation, these states can lead to:
- **Pride** (慢)
- **Wrong Views** (邪見)
- **Rebirth in the Form/Formless Realms** (preventing liberation)
- **Demonic Interference** (魔事)

Therefore, Dhyāna must be treated as an **object of contemplation**, not just a resting place.

---

## The Classification of Dhyānas

Miao-lo follows the classification system of the *Ci Di Chan Men* (Sequential Dhyāna Gates), dividing all meditative states into four categories:

1.  **Worldly Dhyānas** (世間禪):
    - The Four Dhyānas (四禪)
    - The Four Undefiled/Immeasurable Minds (四無量心)
    - The Four Formless Absorptions (四無色定)
    - *Characteristic*: Leaking (有漏), bound to samsara.

2.  **Also-Worldly-Also-Transcendental Dhyānas** (亦世間亦出世間禪):
    - The Six Wondrous Gates (六妙門)
    - The Sixteen Special Excellences (十六特勝)
    - The Transparent Light Dhyāna (通明禪)
    - *Characteristic*: Can be used for both worldly attainment and liberation.

3.  **Transcendental Dhyānas** (出世間禪):
    - The Nine Thoughts (九想)
    - The Eight Recollections (八念)
    - The Ten Thoughts (十想)
    - The Eight Back-Sheddings (八背捨) - Vimokṣa
    - The Eight Victory Places (八勝處)
    - The Ten All-Places (十一切處)
    - The Nine Sequential Dhyānas (九次第定)
    - The Lion Sprint Samādhi (師子奮迅三昧)
    - The Transcendence Samādhi (超越三昧)
    - *Characteristic*: Non-leaking (無漏), leading to Arhatship or Pratyekabuddhahood.

4.  **Neither-Worldly-Nor-Transcendental Dhyānas** (非世間非出世間禪):
    - The Great Vehicle Dhyānas (e.g., The Self-Nature Zen, etc.) - though often these are realized *through* the previous forms when viewed with the Perfect Mind.
    - Included here:
        - Compassion Samādhi (慈心定) - in its Mahāyāna form
        - Causes and Conditions Samādhi (因緣定)
        - Buddha-Recollection Samādhi (念佛三昧)
        - Superknowledges (神通) - as function

## Doctrinal Significance

Fascicle 9 demonstrates the **encyclopedic scope** of the Tiantai system. Zhiyi and Miao-lo do not reject any form of meditation found in the sutras. Instead, they:
1.  **Classify** it (Worldly, Transcendent, etc.).
2.  **Diagnose** it (Is it a trap? A tool?).
3.  **Integrate** it (How does it fit into the Perfect Teaching?).

By applying the **Ten Modes** (especially Mode 1: Inconceivable Object) to these states, even the most mundane "Root Dhyāna" can be transformed into a gateway to the **Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought**.

# Fascicle 9: Section 1 — The Stock Gear (Worldly & Transitional Zens)
## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 9, Part 1 (卷第九之一)
**Author**: Miao-lo (Zhanran, 湛然, 711-782 CE)
**Translator**: William Altig / Claude
**Date**: January 23, 2026

---

## I. Causes and Conditions for the Arising of Dhyāna

Before detailing the states, Miao-lo explains **why** they arise.

### 1. The Internal Cause (內因)
All sentient beings possess the potential for these states.
> "Just as all beings have the potential for Buddhahood, they also possess the seeds of the fundamental dhyānas."

These seeds are "moistened" by past practice. Even if one did not master them in a past life, the imprint remains.

### 2. The External Condition (外緣)
The triggering factors:
- **Teaching**: Hearing the method.
- **Protection**: The aid of Buddhas and spirits.
- **Practice**: The immediate application of methods (like the 25 Preparations).

---

## II. The Root Dhyānas (根本禪) — Worldly Zen

These are called "Root" (根本) because they are the foundation for all other meditations, and "Flavor" (味) because beings become attached to the taste of bliss within them.

### The Four Dhyānas (四禪)

**1. First Dhyāna (初禪)**
- **Trigger**: Through the "Eight Touches" (八觸) - movement, itch, lightness, heaviness, cold, heat, roughness, smoothness.
- **Characteristics**: Separation from desire (離欲). Five branches:
  1.  **Vitarka** (覺 - Investigation/Coarse thought)
  2.  **Vicara** (觀 - Analysis/Fine thought)
  3.  **Piti** (喜 - Joy)
  4.  **Sukha** (樂 - Bliss)
  5.  **Ekaggata** (一心 - One-pointedness)
- **The Danger**: Attachment to the Eight Touches. Mistaking the sensation for realization.

**2. Second Dhyāna (二禪)**
- **Trigger**: Cessation of coarse and fine thought.
- **Characteristics**: Internal purity (內淨).
  1.  **Internal Purity** (內淨)
  2.  **Joy** (喜)
  3.  **Bliss** (樂)
  4.  **One-pointedness** (一心)
- **The Shift**: The mind is like a still pool. No waves of discursive thought.

**3. Third Dhyāna (三禪)**
- **Characteristics**:
  1.  **Equanimity** (捨)
  2.  **Mindfulness** (念)
  3.  **Wisdom** (慧)
  4.  **Bliss** (樂)
  5.  **One-pointedness** (一心)
- **The Note**: This contains the highest worldly bliss. The danger of attachment is highest here.

**4. Fourth Dhyāna (四禪)**
- **Characteristics**:
  1.  **Neither-pain-nor-pleasure** (不苦不樂)
  2.  **Equanimity** (捨)
  3.  **Mindfulness-purity** (念清淨)
  4.  **One-pointedness** (一心)
- **The State**: Breath ceases. The mind is immobile like a lamp in a windless room.

---

### The Four Formless Absorptions (四無色定)

When the practitioner turns away from matter (form) completely:

1.  **Infinite Space** (空無邊處): Removing the limits of matter.
2.  **Infinite Consciousness** (識無邊處): Focusing on the mind that perceives space.
3.  **Nothingness** (無所有處): Dropping even consciousness. "There is nothing."
4.  **Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception** (非想非非想處): The limit of worldly existence. The mind is so subtle it can hardly be said to exist, yet it is not non-existent.

**Miao-lo's Critique**:
> "These are the peak of samsara. But they are still samsara. Like an arrow shot into the sky, eventually it must fall."

---

## III. The Also-Worldly-Also-Transcendental Zens (亦有漏亦無漏禪)

These practices bridge the gap. They use worldly methods but can lead to transcendental results if directed by wisdom.

### 1. The Six Wondrous Gates (六妙門)
1.  **Counting** (數): Regulating the breath.
2.  **Following** (隨): Unification with the breath.
3.  **Stopping** (止): Quiescence.
4.  **Contemplating** (觀): Insight.
5.  **Returning** (還): Turning back to the source of mind.
6.  **Purifying** (淨): No marks.

### 2. The Sixteen Special Excellences (十六特勝)
An expansion of breath mindfulness (Anapanasati). Unlike the Root Dhyānas, these maintain **insight/wisdom** throughout the levels of dhyāna. They prevent "flavor" (attachment).

- Includes: Knowing breath short/long, experiencing joy/bliss, calming mental formations, gladdening the mind, concentrating the mind, liberating the mind, contemplating impermanence, fading away, cessation, relinquishment.

### 3. The Transparent Light Dhyāna (通明禪)
A practice that produces "Transparent Light" (通明) - realizing the non-substantiality of the breath and the mind. It illuminates the internal organs and the nature of the body without dissection. It is distinct from the Nine Thoughts (which focus on impurity).

---

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Terms
- **八觸** (*bā chù*): Eight Touches (physical sensations of dhyāna arising).
- **支林** (*zhī lín*): Branch-forest (the specific factors/characteristics of each dhyāna).
- **動** (*dòng*): Movement (one of the eight touches).
- **味禪** (*wèi chán*): Flavor Zen (meditation corrupted by attachment/craving).

### Cross-Reference
- See Fascicle 2 for the **25 Preparations**, which are prerequisites for these states.
- See *Abhidharmakośa* for parallel definitions of the dhyāna factors.

# Fascicle 9: Section 2 — The Pro Rig (Transcendental Zens)
## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 9, Part 2 (卷第九之二)
**Author**: Miao-lo (Zhanran, 湛然, 711-782 CE)
**Translator**: William Altig / Claude
**Date**: January 23, 2026

---

## The Realm of No-Leakage (無漏)

Miao-lo now introduces the **Transcendental Zens**. Unlike the Root Dhyānas (which "leak" back into samsara), these practices sever the bonds of attachment. They are the tools of the Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas, but Bodhisattvas must master them too.

---

## I. The Impurity Meditations (不淨觀)

Designed to break the most fundamental attachment: lust and body-identification.

### The Nine Thoughts (九想)
1.  **Swelling** (脹想): The corpse bloats.
2.  **Discoloration** (壞想): Turns blue/purple.
3.  **Bloody Flesh** (血塗想).
4.  **Festering** (膿爛想).
5.  **Eaten** (噉想): Birds and beasts consume it.
6.  **Scattering** (散想): Limbs torn apart.
7.  **Bone** (骨想): Only the skeleton remains.
8.  **Burning** (燒想).
9.  **Ash/Dust** (壞滅想).

Miao-lo notes:
> "This is strong medicine. Like using fire to fight fire. It is not the 'True' contemplation of the Middle Way, but without it, the coarse obstacles cannot be removed."

---

## II. The Eight Back-Sheddings (八背捨 - Aṣṭa Vimokṣāḥ)

Also known as the **Eight Liberations**. "Back" (背) means turning the back on desire; "Shedding" (捨) means removing the attachment.

1.  **Internal forms exist, seeing external forms** (內有色相觀外色): Retaining the perception of one's own body while viewing external impurity.
2.  **Internal forms nonexistent, seeing external forms** (內無色相觀外色): Eliminating the perception of one's own body (skeleton visualization) while viewing external impurity.
3.  **Purified Body leading to the Witnessing of the Pure** (淨身作證): Seeing pure colors/lights. (Transition to formless).
4.  **Infinite Space Absorption**.
5.  **Infinite Consciousness Absorption**.
6.  **Nothingness Absorption**.
7.  **Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception**.
8.  **Extinction of Cessation** (滅受想定): The cessation of feeling and perception. The hallmark of the Arhat.

---

## III. The Eight Victory Places (八勝處 - Abhibhāyatana)

Mastery over the objects of visualization. The practitioner is not just "shedding" attachment but "conquering" the object—able to make it appear, disappear, or change at will.

1.  **Internal form, external small forms**.
2.  **Internal form, external large forms**.
(And so on, matching the Back-Sheddings but with "Victory" - mastery).

---

## IV. The Ten All-Places (十一切處 - Kṛtsna)

Total pervasion. The practitioner can make the entire universe appear as a single element.

- **Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Blue, Yellow, Red, White, Space, Consciousness.**

Miao-lo explains:
> "If one envisions Water, the entire ten directions become water. There is no shore. This breaks the boundaries of rigid perception."

---

## V. The Nine Sequential Dhyānas (九次第定)

Entering the dhyānas in strict order (1→2→3→4→Space→...→Cessation) without skipping or wavering. This proves the stability of the "Pro Rig."

---

## VI. The Lion Sprint Samādhi (師子奮迅三昧)

The ability to enter and exit these states rapidly, forward and backward. Like a lion shaking off dust, the practitioner shakes off the fixation on any specific state.

---

## VII. The Transcendence Samādhi (超越三昧)

The ultimate mastery of the "Pro Rig." The practitioner can jump from the First Dhyāna directly to the Extinction Samādhi, or from the Earth element directly to Nothingness. This flexibility prepares the mind for the non-dual contemplation of the Bodhisattva.

# Fascicle 9: Section 3 — The Master Class (Great Vehicle Zens) & Application
## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 9, Part 3 (卷第九之三)
**Author**: Miao-lo (Zhanran, 湛然, 711-782 CE)
**Translator**: William Altig / Claude
**Date**: January 23, 2026

---

## I. The Great Vehicle Dhyānas

These are the practices that define the Bodhisattva path. They are not merely for suppression of defilement but for the cultivation of positive power to aid beings.

### 1. Compassion Samādhi (慈心定)
Also known as the **Four Immeasurables** (四無量心).
-   **Loving-Kindness**: Giving happiness.
-   **Compassion**: Removing suffering.
-   **Joy**: Rejoicing in others' merit.
-   **Equanimity**: Equality towards friends and enemies.

**Miao-lo's Insight**: "In the Hīnayāna, this is just a visualization. In the Mahāyāna, it is the **function of the Essence**. The 'Unconditioned Compassion' (無緣大慈) arises from seeing the emptiness of the self and the emptiness of beings, yet still responding."

### 2. Causes and Conditions Samādhi (因緣定)
Contemplating the **Twelve Links of Dependent Origination**.
- Past causes → Present effects.
- Present causes → Future effects.
- **The Insight**: Seeing the links breaks the chain. In the Perfect Teaching, one sees that **Ignorance IS Buddha-nature** (when transformed).

### 3. Buddha-Recollection Samādhi (念佛三昧)
Focusing on the Buddha.
- **Form Body**: The 32 marks.
- **Dharma Body**: The wisdom and merit.
- **Real Mark**: The nature of the Buddha as non-dual.
- **The Result**: "Seeing the Buddhas of the ten directions standing before one."

### 4. Superknowledges (神通)
- The **Six Superknowledges** (Divine Eye, Ear, etc.) are natural byproducts of the Fourth Dhyāna when directed by wisdom.
- **The Bodhisattva's Use**: They are not magic tricks. They are **skillful means** (upaya) to remove obstacles for beings. Example: Using the Divine Eye to see where a being has been reborn to help them.

---

## II. Applying the Ten Modes to the Zen Object (正明修觀)

Miao-lo now integrates the entire fascicle by applying the **Ten Modes of Contemplation** to the **Meditative States Object**.

### Mode 1: Contemplating the Inconceivable Object
**The Method**:
When a dhyāna state arises (e.g., the joy of the First Dhyāna), do not rest in it. **Observe it**.
-   Where does this joy come from?
-   It is not the self. It is not other.
-   It is **Empty** (no fixed nature).
-   It is **Provisional** (the sensation exists).
-   It is the **Middle** (the Dhyāna itself is the Dharma-Realm).

**The 3000 Realms**:
This single moment of "Dhyāna Joy" contains the Ten Worlds.
-   If you cling to it → **Human/Heavenly Realm**.
-   If you use it to escape → **Two Vehicles Realm**.
-   If you engage it with Bodhicitta → **Bodhisattva Realm**.
-   If you see its true nature → **Buddha Realm**.

### Mode 2: Generating Bodhicitta
"I will use this concentration not for my own bliss, but to stabilize my mind for the liberation of all beings."

### Mode 3: Skillful Stabilization
If the mind sinks into the bliss (too much stopping), raise it with inspection (contemplation). If the mind scatters in analysis, settle it with the dhyāna factor.

### Mode 10: Release Dharma-Attachment
**Crucial**: You must release the attachment to the Dhyāna state itself.
> "The Dhyāna is a boat. Do not build a house on the boat. Cross the river."

---

## III. The Ultimate Integration

Miao-lo concludes by noting that all these Zens—Worldly, Transcendent, and Great Vehicle—are ultimately **One Zen** in the Perfect Teaching.
- The **Root Dhyāna** is the **Dharma-body** (when seen as Middle).
- The **Impurity** is the **Empty** aspect.
- The **Compassion** is the **Provisional** aspect.

Practicing one allows access to all, if the View (Mode 1) is correct.

# Fascicle 9: Closing Summary
## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 9
**Author**: Miao-lo (Zhanran)
**Translator**: William Altig / Claude
**Date**: January 23, 2026

---

## Overview

Fascicle 9 has provided an exhaustive analysis of the **Meditative States Object** (禪定境). This object encompasses the entire range of Buddhist meditative attainments, from the fundamental worldly absorptions to the advanced samādhis of the Bodhisattva.

## Key Teachings

### 1. The Dangers of Dhyāna
Miao-lo repeatedly emphasizes that while dhyāna is essential for stability, it is fraught with danger:
- **Attachment**: "Flavor Zen" (味禪) binds the practitioner to samsara.
- **Stagnation**: Resting in the "Pro Rig" (Transcendental Zen) leads to the Two Vehicles, cutting off the Bodhisattva path.
- **Pride**: Mistaking the Fourth Dhyāna for Nirvana is a common error (exemplified by the Bhikshu who was reborn in hell).

### 2. The Necessity of Wisdom
Dhyāna alone is "blind." It must be illuminated by **Prajñā** (Wisdom).
- The **Ten Modes** provide this illumination.
- Mode 1 (Inconceivable Object) transforms the "dead water" of absorption into the "living ocean" of the Dharma-realm.

### 3. The Integration of Methods
Miao-lo demonstrates that the Tiantai system does not reject "inferior" methods (like the Four Dhyānas or Nine Thoughts). Instead, it **repurposes** them.
- A Perfect Teaching practitioner can use the **Nine Thoughts** not just to disgust the mind, but to see the emptiness of the body and the non-duality of purity and impurity.
- The **Six Wondrous Gates** become a method for tuning the mind to the Middle Way.

### 4. The Supremacy of the Perfect View
Ultimately, all Zens are seen as **Dharma-Nature**.
- The bliss of the First Dhyāna *is* the bliss of Nirvana, if seen correctly.
- The silence of the Fourth Dhyāna *is* the cessation of the Middle Way.
- There is no need to discard the worldly to find the transcendental.

---

## Final Instruction

The practitioner is urged to:
1.  **Cultivate** dhyāna to stabilize the mind.
2.  **Apply** the Ten Modes to prevent attachment.
3.  **Use** the power of concentration to fuel Compassion and the Six Paramitas.

Fascicle 10 will conclude the work with the remaining objects (Views, Pride, Two Vehicles, Bodhisattva) and the final fruition.

# Fascicle 10: Opening — External Obstacles and Final Integration
## Scholarly Translation

**Translator**: William Altig / Claude
**Date**: January 23, 2026

## Introduction

Having completed the treatment of internal obstacles (煩惱境, 病患境, 業境) in Fascicle 8 and meditative states (禪定境) in Fascicle 9, this fascicle addresses the final major category of obstacles: **external interference** (魔事境).

The Māra Object represents the culmination of the conditional objects. While afflictions, illness, and karma arise from within, and meditative states can become traps through attachment, the Māra Object addresses obstacles that appear to come from outside—though Miao-lo will demonstrate that even these are ultimately rooted in mind.

---

## The Structure of Fascicle 10

### Part 1: The Māra Object (魔事境)

The fifth of the Ten Objects addresses demonic interference during practice. Miao-lo follows Zhiyi's treatment in the *Mohe Zhiguan*, which distinguishes:

1. **The Four Types of Māra** (四魔)
   - Affliction-Māra (煩惱魔)
   - Aggregate-Māra (陰魔/五陰魔)
   - Death-Māra (死魔)
   - Heavenly-Māra (天魔/他化自在天魔)

2. **The Twelve Categories of Demonic Activity** (十二種魔事)
   - Manifestations ranging from subtle psychological interference to dramatic visionary encounters

3. **Methods for Recognizing and Counteracting Māra** (識魔對治)
   - Distinguishing true from false
   - Applying the Ten Modes

### Part 2: Integration of the Ten Objects (十境總論)

Having covered all ten objects across the previous fascicles, Miao-lo provides a synthetic overview:

- How the objects interrelate
- The order of their arising
- Why the Aggregates Object is primary
- How each object contains all ten

### Part 3: The Final Three Chapters (後三章略明)

The *Mohe Zhiguan* has ten chapters. The seventh chapter on Correct Contemplation (正觀) has occupied the bulk of the commentary. This fascicle briefly addresses the final three:

- **Fruit and Result** (果報) — What arises from correct practice
- **Arising of Teaching** (起教) — How realization gives rise to teaching others
- **Ultimate Return** (旨歸) — The final destination of the path

---

## The Māra Object in Context

### Position Among the Ten Objects

| # | Object | Category | Nature |
|---|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Aggregates | Universal | Always present |
| 2 | Afflictions | Internal | Arises from within |
| 3 | Illness | Internal | Body-based |
| 4 | Karma | Internal | Past actions surfacing |
| **5** | **Māra** | **External** | **Interference from outside** |
| 6 | Dhyāna States | Conditional | Arises in practice |
| 7 | Wrong Views | Cognitive | Mistaken understanding |
| 8 | Pride | Emotional | Attachment to attainment |
| 9 | Two Vehicles | Aspirational | Limited goal |
| 10 | Bodhisattva | Aspirational | Advanced but incomplete |

### Why Māra Comes Fifth

Miao-lo explains:

> "After internal obstacles are addressed, the practitioner gains some stability. This very stability can attract external interference. Māra does not trouble those who are not practicing. It is precisely because one is making progress that Māra takes interest."

This is both a warning and an encouragement: encountering Māra is a sign that practice is working.

---

## The Four Types of Māra (四魔)

### 1. Affliction-Māra (煩惱魔)

**Definition**: The three poisons (greed, anger, delusion) and their derivatives intensifying during practice.

**How it manifests**: Strong emotional states arising seemingly from nowhere. Desire, anger, or confusion more intense than usual.

**The insight**: This is not truly "external"—it is internal affliction wearing a mask. Miao-lo includes it under Māra because it can feel like an attack from outside.

### 2. Aggregate-Māra (陰魔/五陰魔)

**Definition**: Extreme attachment to or fear of the body-mind complex.

**How it manifests**:
- Obsessive concern for physical comfort
- Fear of losing the self
- Identification with mental states as "me"

**The insight**: The aggregates themselves are not demonic. The māra is the clinging.

### 3. Death-Māra (死魔)

**Definition**: Fear of death or impermanence disrupting practice.

**How it manifests**:
- Anxiety about dying before attaining realization
- Resistance to impermanence teachings
- Urgency that creates tension rather than diligence

**The insight**: Death is certain; the timing is uncertain. This māra uses natural facts to create suffering.

### 4. Heavenly-Māra (天魔)

**Definition**: Actual interference from Māra or his retinue in the Heaven of Free Enjoyment of Others' Emanations (他化自在天).

**How it manifests**:
- Visions of deities offering rewards for stopping practice
- Apparent "success" that is actually a trap
- External circumstances that consistently obstruct practice
- Beings appearing to offer teachings that lead astray

**The insight**: This is the only truly "external" māra, yet even this operates through the practitioner's mind. Without internal susceptibility, external māra cannot gain purchase.

---

## The Core Teaching on Māra

### The Fundamental Principle

Miao-lo quotes the *Mohe Zhiguan*:

> "魔界如，佛界如，一如無二如。"
> "The māra-realm is suchness; the Buddha-realm is suchness. One suchness, not two suchnesses."

This is the essential teaching: **Māra and Buddha are not ultimately separate**. Both arise within the same reality. The difference lies in how mind relates to phenomena.

### Application of the First Mode

When the Māra Object arises, apply the first mode of contemplation:

> "Contemplate this demonic appearance as itself containing the 3,000 worlds in one thought-moment. This very māra is empty, provisional, and middle. Do not flee it, do not fight it, do not grasp it."

### The Four Sentences Applied to Māra

1. **Is there Buddha within Māra?** — Yes. Even demonic manifestation is Buddha-nature appearing in distorted form.

2. **Is there Māra within Buddha?** — Potentially. Without vigilance, even genuine realization can be corrupted.

3. **Are Māra and Buddha neither one nor different?** — Correct view. They are not identical (functional difference) nor separate (same nature).

4. **Are they both affirmed and both negated?** — The tetralemma reveals that all positions are provisional.

---

## Recognizing Māra vs. Genuine Experience

### The Twelve Categories of Demonic Activity (十二種魔事)

Miao-lo elaborates Zhiyi's classification:

**Category 1-3: Physical Manifestations**
1. Unusual bodily sensations (pain, pleasure, heat, cold without cause)
2. Illness arising suddenly during practice and vanishing when practice stops
3. Inexplicable physical restlessness or paralysis

**Category 4-6: Emotional Manifestations**
4. Extreme sadness or grief without object
5. Intense fear or terror
6. Uncharacteristic anger or hatred

**Category 7-9: Cognitive Manifestations**
7. Confusion about teachings previously understood
8. False insights that feel profound but lead astray
9. Inability to concentrate despite effort

**Category 10-12: Visionary Manifestations**
10. Seeing figures (sometimes beautiful, sometimes terrifying)
11. Hearing voices (offering advice, making threats)
12. Dreams that disturb or mislead

### The Test of Authenticity

How to distinguish māra from genuine spiritual experience:

| Genuine Experience | Māra's Counterfeit |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Increases humility | Increases pride |
| Deepens compassion | Narrows concern to self |
| Aligns with Three Truths | Contradicts or distorts doctrine |
| Produces lasting peace | Produces temporary euphoria followed by disturbance |
| Leads toward liberation | Creates new attachments |
| Can be discussed with qualified teachers | Resists examination |

---

## Methods for Counteracting Māra

### The Gradual Approach

1. **Recognition** (識魔): Know that this is māra activity, not reality
2. **Non-engagement** (不取): Do not follow the vision, voice, or feeling
3. **Non-rejection** (不捨): Do not flee or fight
4. **Observation** (觀察): Watch the phenomenon arise and cease
5. **Return** (還): Return to the primary practice

### The Sudden Approach

Apply the contemplation directly:

> "This māra appearance is empty of inherent existence. It arises from conditions. It has no power that I do not give it. Seeing its empty nature, I am not moved."

### The Perfect Approach

> "Māra is Bodhi. This very obstacle is the path. Without this appearance, where would I practice? The māra is showing me my own mind."

---

## What's Ahead

This fascicle will cover:

1. **Section 1**: Detailed treatment of the Four Māras and Twelve Categories
2. **Section 2**: Integration of all Ten Objects
3. **Section 3**: The Final Three Chapters (Fruit, Teaching, Return)

With this fascicle, the commentary on the *Mohe Zhiguan*'s Correct Contemplation chapter reaches completion.

# Fascicle 10: Section 1 — The Māra Object
## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 10, Part 1
**Translator**: William Altig / Claude
**Date**: January 23, 2026

---

## The Fifth Object: Demonic Interference (魔事境)

### The Definition

The character 魔 (*mó*) is a Chinese transliteration of the Sanskrit *māra*, meaning "killer" or "destroyer." Māra is that which kills wisdom, destroys virtue, and obstructs liberation.

Miao-lo clarifies:

> "Māra is not necessarily an external being. The term refers to any phenomenon that obstructs the path. Whether it arises from within or without, if it kills progress, it is māra."

---

## The Four Types of Māra (四魔) — Detailed Treatment

### 1. Affliction-Māra (煩惱魔) — The Internal Saboteur

**The Classic Definition**: The 84,000 afflictions in their manifest forms.

**Miao-lo's Commentary**:

The three poisons serve as the roots:

| Poison | Sanskrit | Function | Manifestation During Practice |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------------------------|
| 貪 Greed | *rāga* | Grasping | Attachment to blissful states, desire for quick results |
| 瞋 Anger | *dveṣa* | Aversion | Frustration with slow progress, hatred of obstacles |
| 癡 Delusion | *moha* | Confusion | Mistaking false insights for true, losing the method |

**The Ten Bonds** (十結) manifest as:

1. **Greed for sensory pleasure** (欲貪) — Drawn back to worldly enjoyments
2. **Greed for existence** (有貪) — Clinging to continued becoming
3. **Anger** (瞋) — Irritation at practice difficulties
4. **Pride** (慢) — "I am making progress"
5. **Ignorance** (無明) — Fundamental not-knowing
6. **Wrong views** (見) — Mistaken understanding
7. **Doubt** (疑) — "Is this really working?"
8. **Restlessness** (掉舉) — Mental agitation
9. **Sloth** (昏沈) — Mental dullness
10. **Shamelessness** (無慚) — Loss of moral sensitivity

**The Treatment**:

Apply the contemplation:

> "These afflictions arise from conditions. They have no inherent nature. This very greed is empty. This very anger is the dharma-realm. Seeing their nature, I am not moved."

When arising is intense:
1. Return to breath awareness
2. Apply the specific antidote (generosity for greed, patience for anger, analysis for delusion)
3. When stable, return to direct contemplation

---

### 2. Aggregate-Māra (陰魔/五陰魔) — The Body-Mind Trap

**The Classic Definition**: The five aggregates as the basis for suffering.

**Miao-lo's Commentary**:

This māra operates through identification:

| Aggregate | Identification Pattern | Māra's Hook |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Form (色) | "This body is me" | Fear of bodily harm, craving for physical comfort |
| Feeling (受) | "These sensations are me" | Chasing pleasant, fleeing unpleasant |
| Perception (想) | "My thoughts define me" | Attachment to views |
| Formations (行) | "My intentions are me" | Pride in effort |
| Consciousness (識) | "This knowing is me" | Subtle self-grasping |

**The Specific Trap for Practitioners**:

At advanced stages, practitioners may experience:
- **Aggregate dissolution** — The sense of body-mind beginning to break apart
- **Fear response** — Clinging arises: "I'm losing myself!"
- **Retreat** — Practice is abandoned to preserve the sense of self

This is the aggregate-māra at work.

**The Treatment**:

> "The aggregates have always been empty. There is no self to lose. What dissolves is what was never solid. Let go into the dissolution."

For those with strong fear:
1. Ground in the body (feel the weight, the breath)
2. Remember: This is natural
3. Return to contemplation when fear subsides

---

### 3. Death-Māra (死魔) — The Ultimate Deadline

**The Classic Definition**: Death as the termination of opportunity for practice.

**Miao-lo's Commentary**:

Death-māra operates in two ways:

**A. Fear of Dying Before Attainment**

The practitioner thinks:
- "I haven't attained stream-entry. What if I die tonight?"
- "I need to practice harder, faster!"
- "There's no time!"

This urgency, while understandable, creates tension that obstructs the very attainment sought.

**B. Using Death as Excuse**

The practitioner thinks:
- "I'm going to die anyway. What's the point?"
- "I'll practice more seriously when I'm older"
- "Life is short—better enjoy it now"

This resignation abandons the path.

**The Treatment**:

> "Death is certain; only the time is uncertain. This very uncertainty is the teaching. Practice now—not from panic, but from clarity. This moment is the only moment."

The Buddha's teaching on the four thoughts that turn the mind:
1. Precious human birth
2. Impermanence and death
3. Karma and its effects
4. The suffering of saṃsāra

---

### 4. Heavenly-Māra (天魔) — The External Adversary

**The Classic Definition**: Māra-pāpīyān, the "Evil One," ruler of the highest heaven of the desire realm (他化自在天, *Paranirmita-vaśavartin*).

**Miao-lo's Commentary**:

This is the māra that explicitly opposes liberation. His domain is the desire realm; every being who leaves this realm diminishes his subjects.

**The Hierarchy of Māra's Forces**:

| Level | Agent | Method |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Highest | Māra himself | Rarely intervenes personally; reserves for advanced practitioners |
| Middle | Māra's daughters | Temptation through desire |
| Lower | Māra's armies | Fear, violence, obstruction |
| Common | Minor spirits | Petty disturbances |

**How Heavenly-Māra Operates**:

1. **Observation**: Māra watches for practitioners making genuine progress
2. **Assessment**: Determines the practitioner's vulnerabilities
3. **Approach**: Uses the appropriate method (desire for some, fear for others, doubt for yet others)
4. **Escalation**: If initial methods fail, escalates to more dramatic interventions

**The Classic Forms of Attack**:

From the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*:

**The Ten Armies of Māra** (十軍):
1. Sensual desire
2. Discontent
3. Hunger and thirst
4. Craving
5. Sloth and torpor
6. Fear
7. Doubt
8. Obstinacy and ingratitude
9. Gain, praise, honor, false glory
10. Self-exaltation and disparaging others

**The Treatment**:

> "Māra has no power I do not give him. His arrows are my own projections. Recognizing this, I sit unmoved."

The story of the Buddha's enlightenment night:
- Māra's armies attacked—the Buddha was unmoved
- Māra's daughters tempted—the Buddha was unmoved
- Māra claimed the seat of enlightenment—the Buddha touched the earth
- The earth testified: "This is his rightful seat"

---

## The Twelve Categories of Demonic Activity (十二種魔事)

### Category 1-4: Physical Manifestations (身分魔事)

**1. Spontaneous Pain (無故痛)**

During meditation, sudden sharp pain arises—in the heart, the head, the joints—with no physical cause. When practice stops, the pain vanishes.

**Recognition**: Pain that has no medical cause, appears only during practice, and vanishes when practice stops.

**Treatment**: Recognize it as māra. Continue practice. If unbearable, reduce intensity temporarily but do not abandon the session.

**2. Spontaneous Pleasure (無故樂)**

Waves of bliss, sexual arousal, or physical pleasure arise without cause. This is more dangerous than pain because practitioners may chase it.

**Recognition**: Pleasure without object that arises specifically during practice.

**Treatment**: Neither grasp nor reject. Note "pleasure" and return to contemplation. If sexual arousal is strong, apply impurity contemplation.

**3. Abnormal Physical States (身相異常)**

The body feels too heavy to move, or too light (floating sensation). Uncontrollable movements (shaking, swaying, jumping) occur.

**Recognition**: Physical states that are dramatic, do not correspond to the practice being done, and distract from contemplation.

**Treatment**: Ground awareness in the body's weight. Breathe deeply. Do not follow the phenomena. Return to the method.

**4. Illness That Follows Practice (隨修生病)**

Sickness arises precisely when practice intensifies. It clears when practice stops. This is distinct from ordinary illness.

**Recognition**: The timing correlation is too precise to be coincidental.

**Treatment**: Recognize it as māra. If possible, continue practice. If the body genuinely needs rest, rest—but understand the cause.

---

### Category 5-8: Emotional Manifestations (情緒魔事)

**5. Unaccountable Grief (無故悲)**

Overwhelming sadness, tears, a sense of loss—with no object. "I don't know why I'm crying."

**Recognition**: Grief without cause that arises during practice.

**Treatment**: Allow the emotion without feeding it. Do not create stories to explain it. Let it pass. Return to method.

**6. Terror (恐怖)**

Intense fear—of death, of madness, of dissolution, of the dark, of unseen presences.

**Recognition**: Fear disproportionate to any real threat.

**Treatment**: Ground in the body. Remember: "This is māra. I am safe. The fear is empty." If severe, open eyes, move body, then return.

**7. Uncharacteristic Rage (瞋恚現前)**

Anger toward the teacher, the teaching, fellow practitioners, oneself—arising without adequate cause.

**Recognition**: Hostility that appears during practice and does not match one's normal disposition.

**Treatment**: Recognize it as māra. Do not act on it. Apply loving-kindness toward the apparent object. Return to method.

**8. False Devotion (虛妄信)**

Sudden intense "faith" accompanied by grandiosity: "I have seen the truth! I am special! I must tell everyone!"

**Recognition**: Inflation rather than humility. Urgency rather than peace.

**Treatment**: The most dangerous because it feels positive. Wait. Do not act on the "insight" for at least three days. Consult a teacher. If genuine, it will remain; if māra, it will fade.

---

### Category 9-12: Cognitive and Visionary Manifestations (心識魔事)

**9. Confusion About Teaching (法義迷悶)**

Teachings previously clear now seem contradictory or meaningless. The practitioner cannot remember basic instructions.

**Recognition**: Sudden intellectual confusion specifically about the dharma.

**Treatment**: Do not try to think through it. Return to the simplest practice (breath, mantra). Let clarity return naturally.

**10. False Insight (邪慧現前)**

"Realizations" that feel profound but contradict correct teaching. "Form is not really emptiness—I see now that everything is actually real!"

**Recognition**: Insights that cannot be reconciled with the Three Truths.

**Treatment**: Test against scripture and teacher. If it contradicts, reject it regardless of how "certain" it feels.

**11. Visions of Beings (天神鬼魅現)**

Buddhas, bodhisattvas, deities, demons, ghosts, ancestors—appearing during meditation.

**Recognition**: Visual appearances, whether beautiful or terrifying.

**Treatment**:
- Do not engage in dialogue
- Do not follow instructions from the vision
- Say: "If you are genuine, you will wait until I consult my teacher. If you cannot wait, you are not genuine."
- Return to practice

**12. Prophetic Dreams (夢中授記)**

Dreams in which beings predict the practitioner's attainment, give secret teachings, or assign special missions.

**Recognition**: Dreams that inflate the practitioner's sense of importance.

**Treatment**: Dreams are mental activity. Even genuine prophetic dreams do not change what needs to be done: practice. Ignore the content; continue practice.

---

## The Ultimate Teaching on Māra

### From the *Mohe Zhiguan*:

> "魔界如即佛界如，佛界如即魔界如。"
> "The suchness of the māra-realm is identical to the suchness of the Buddha-realm."

This is not saying māra is good or that demons should be welcomed. It is saying:

1. Māra and Buddha arise within the same reality
2. The difference is in the mind's relationship to phenomena
3. Fighting māra strengthens māra; seeing māra's nature liberates

### The Paradox

- If you grasp at Buddha, Buddha becomes māra
- If you see through māra, māra becomes Buddha
- Neither grasping nor rejecting, the practitioner is free

---

## Summary

The Māra Object is the test of practice. Everything encountered before—afflictions, illness, karma, meditative states—prepared for this. Here the practitioner faces opposition that appears absolute.

The teaching: **Nothing is absolute**. Even Māra is empty. Even this opposition is Buddha-nature in disguise.

This is not comfort. It is method. See the nature of what arises, and it cannot bind you.

# Fascicle 10: Section 2 — Integration of the Ten Objects
## Scholarly Translation

**Source**: T46n1912, Fascicle 10, Part 2
**Translator**: William Altig / Claude
**Date**: January 23, 2026

---

## The Ten Objects Complete (十境總論)

Having covered all ten objects across the preceding fascicles, Miao-lo now provides a synthetic overview. This section addresses:

1. Why there are ten objects
2. Their order and interrelationship
3. How each contains all ten
4. The practical implications for practice

---

## Why Ten Objects?

### The Logic of the Classification

The ten objects arise from analyzing all possible phenomena that can appear during contemplation:

| Category | Objects | Logic |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Universal** | 1. Aggregates | Always present; the basis of experience |
| **Internal** | 2. Afflictions, 3. Illness, 4. Karma | Arise from within the practitioner |
| **External** | 5. Māra | Appears to come from outside |
| **Practice-Induced** | 6. Dhyāna States | Arises specifically from meditation |
| **Cognitive** | 7. Wrong Views, 8. Pride | Errors in understanding or attitude |
| **Aspirational** | 9. Two Vehicles, 10. Bodhisattva | Incomplete goals |

Miao-lo clarifies:

> "These ten exhaust the possibilities. Whatever arises during practice falls into one of these categories. The practitioner who knows these ten is prepared for anything."

---

## The Order of the Ten Objects

### Why This Sequence?

**Object 1: Aggregates (陰入界境)**

The aggregates come first because they are always present. Before any specific obstacle arises, there is already body-mind. This is the universal ground.

> "Even when sitting peacefully with no disturbance, the aggregates are present. Therefore, contemplation begins here."

**Objects 2-4: Internal Obstacles**

After establishing contemplation on the aggregates, internal disturbances naturally surface:

- **Afflictions** (煩惱): The three poisons stir
- **Illness** (病患): Physical discomfort intensifies
- **Karma** (業相): Past actions manifest as visions, feelings, memories

These arise from within. They are "mine" in the conventional sense.

**Object 5: External Obstacle**

Once internal obstacles are somewhat stabilized, external interference may begin:

- **Māra** (魔事): Opposition from outside

This marks the transition from internal to external work.

**Object 6: Practice State**

As practice deepens, meditative states arise:

- **Dhyāna** (禪定): Jhāna, samādhi, various absorptions

These are not obstacles in themselves, but become obstacles through attachment.

**Objects 7-8: Cognitive Errors**

With states comes the danger of misinterpretation:

- **Wrong Views** (諸見): Misunderstanding the meaning of experiences
- **Pride** (慢): Inflating the significance of attainment

These corrupt genuine progress.

**Objects 9-10: Incomplete Goals**

Finally, even correct understanding can aim at wrong destinations:

- **Two Vehicles** (二乘): Settling for personal liberation
- **Bodhisattva** (菩薩): Advanced but not yet complete

These represent the subtlest traps.

---

## The Interrelationship of the Ten Objects

### Horizontal Integration (橫論十境)

All ten objects are present simultaneously in any moment of experience:

| Object | Present As |
|--------|------------|
| Aggregates | The experience itself |
| Afflictions | Subtle reactive patterns |
| Illness | Physical sensations |
| Karma | Conditioning of perception |
| Māra | Resistance to liberation |
| Dhyāna | Quality of concentration |
| Wrong Views | Interpretive framework |
| Pride | Sense of self-reference |
| Two Vehicles | Habitual goal-orientation |
| Bodhisattva | Aspiration and its limits |

> "In a single moment, all ten are present. The classification into sequence is for teaching purposes. Reality does not arise in sequence."

### Vertical Integration (竪論十境)

In practice, objects tend to arise in the given order:

```
1. Aggregates (always present)
      ↓
2-4. Internal obstacles surface
      ↓
5. External interference begins
      ↓
6. Meditative states develop
      ↓
7-8. Cognitive errors arise
      ↓
9-10. Aspirational limits encountered
```

This sequence describes a typical progression, but individuals may experience variations.

---

## Each Object Contains All Ten

### The Principle of Mutual Inclusion

Miao-lo emphasizes:

> "One object contains all ten. Ten objects are one object. This is not metaphor but reality."

**Example: Aggregates Containing All Ten**

When contemplating the aggregates:

1. **Aggregates**: The aggregates themselves
2. **Afflictions**: Clinging to aggregates
3. **Illness**: Physical aspect of form aggregate
4. **Karma**: Conditioned nature of aggregates
5. **Māra**: Aggregates as the basis for māra's operation
6. **Dhyāna**: Subtle states within perception
7. **Wrong Views**: Mistaking aggregates for self
8. **Pride**: "My" aggregates
9. **Two Vehicles**: Using aggregate contemplation for personal escape
10. **Bodhisattva**: Seeing aggregates of all beings

**Example: Māra Containing All Ten**

When the Māra Object arises:

1. **Aggregates**: Māra appears within body-mind experience
2. **Afflictions**: Fear, desire, confusion triggered by māra
3. **Illness**: Physical symptoms from māra interference
4. **Karma**: Māra activating karmic traces
5. **Māra**: The māra phenomenon itself
6. **Dhyāna**: Māra appearing as false samādhi states
7. **Wrong Views**: Māra teaching false doctrine
8. **Pride**: "I defeated māra"
9. **Two Vehicles**: Māra encouraging limited aspiration
10. **Bodhisattva**: Māra appearing as false bodhisattva

---

## Practical Implications

### The One-Method Approach

Because each object contains all ten, and the Ten Modes apply to any object, the practitioner needs only one fundamental method:

> "Contemplate the inconceivable. Whatever arises is the 3,000 worlds in one thought. Empty, provisional, middle. No need to change the method when the object changes."

This is the simplicity on the far side of complexity.

### The Adaptive Approach

However, Miao-lo also validates adapting to circumstances:

> "For those whose roots are sharp, one method suffices. For those whose roots are dull, specific treatments for specific objects may be needed."

The Ten Modes were created precisely for this: to provide multiple tools for practitioners who cannot immediately realize the direct approach.

### The Signs of Mastery

How does the practitioner know the Ten Objects are understood?

1. **Nothing surprising**: Whatever arises is recognized as one of the ten
2. **No panic**: Even dramatic experiences are met with equanimity
3. **No attachment**: Even blissful states are not grasped
4. **No rejection**: Even painful states are not fled
5. **Continuity**: Practice continues regardless of what arises

---

## The Ten Objects and the Ten Modes

### Their Relationship

| Ten Objects | Ten Modes |
|-------------|-----------|
| What can arise | How to work with what arises |
| The territory | The tools |
| Passive (encountered) | Active (applied) |
| Descriptive | Prescriptive |

> "The Ten Objects describe the field. The Ten Modes describe the work. A farmer must know both the land and the tools."

### The First Mode as Master Key

While all ten modes can be applied to any object, the first mode—Contemplate the Inconceivable Object—is the master key:

> "One who truly realizes the 3,000 worlds in one thought has, in that realization, completed the work of all ten modes. The remaining nine are elaborations for those who have not yet seen."

---

## The Aggregates Object as Primary

### Why Begin with Aggregates?

Miao-lo returns to this fundamental point:

> "All objects are modifications of the aggregates. Afflictions arise within the aggregate of formations. Illness arises within the aggregate of form. Karma is stored in consciousness. Even māra operates through the aggregates."

Therefore:

> "The practitioner who thoroughly contemplates the aggregates has, in principle, contemplated all ten objects. The distinction into ten is pedagogical, not ontological."

### The Trap of Chasing Objects

Some practitioners, learning about the ten objects, begin to look for them:

- "When will māra appear?"
- "I haven't experienced wrong views yet—am I missing something?"
- "The bodhisattva object sounds advanced—I want that one"

Miao-lo warns:

> "Do not seek the objects. Contemplate what is present. The aggregates are present now. Begin there. What needs to arise will arise."

---

## The Completion of Correct Contemplation

### The Scope of Chapter Seven

The seventh chapter of the *Mohe Zhiguan*—Correct Contemplation (正觀)—covers:

- The ten objects
- The ten modes
- Their interrelationship
- Their application

With this section, the treatment of the seventh chapter is essentially complete.

### What Remains

The final three chapters address what happens after correct contemplation is established:

- **Fruit** (果報): The results that arise
- **Teaching** (起教): How realization leads to teaching others
- **Return** (旨歸): The ultimate destination

These are treated briefly in Section 3.

---

## Summary

The ten objects form a complete map of contemplative territory. Whether the practitioner encounters internal turmoil, external opposition, altered states, cognitive errors, or aspirational limitations, the map locates the experience and the Ten Modes provide the tools.

The deepest teaching: all ten objects are one object, all ten modes are one mode. The apparent complexity resolves into the simplicity of:

> "This very mind is Buddha. This very object is the dharma-realm. Nothing to add, nothing to remove."

## The Structure of the Mohe Zhiguan

The *Mohe Zhiguan* consists of ten chapters:

| # | Chinese | English | Status |
|---|---------|---------|--------|
| 1 | 大意 | Grand Outline | Covered (F1) |
| 2 | 釋名 | Explanation of Name | Covered (F2) |
| 3 | 顯體 | Revealing Essence | Covered (F2) |
| 4 | 攝法 | Embracing Dharmas | Covered (F2) |
| 5 | 偏圓 | Partial vs. Complete | Covered (F2) |
| 6 | 方便 | Skillful Means | Covered (F2) |
| 7 | 正觀 | Correct Contemplation | Covered (F3-F10) |
| 8 | 果報 | Fruit and Result | This section |
| 9 | 起教 | Arising of Teaching | This section |
| 10 | 旨歸 | Ultimate Return | This section |

The seventh chapter on Correct Contemplation occupied the vast majority of Zhiyi's teaching and Miao-lo's commentary. The final three chapters, while important, are treated more briefly because they describe what happens after the essential work is done.

---

## Chapter 8: Fruit and Result (果報)

### The Question

What are the fruits of correct contemplation? What results from applying the Ten Modes to the Ten Objects?

### The Two Types of Fruit

Miao-lo, following Zhiyi, distinguishes:

**1. Causal Fruit (因果)**

Results that arise during practice:

| Stage | Fruit | Characteristics |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **Name Identity** (名字即) | Initial understanding | Intellectual grasp of the teaching |
| **Contemplation Identity** (觀行即) | Glimpses | Moments of seeing the Three Truths |
| **Resemblance Identity** (相似即) | Stability | Consistent realization in meditation |
| **Partial Realization** (分真即) | Breakthrough | Actual elimination of ignorance |
| **Ultimate Identity** (究竟即) | Completion | Full Buddhahood |

**2. Fruit Proper (果報)**

The final result:

> "The fruit of correct contemplation is the three bodies of Buddha: Dharma-body (法身), Reward-body (報身), and Transformation-body (化身). These are not three separate things but one reality viewed from different angles."

### The Three Bodies as Fruit

| Body | Sanskrit | Fruit Of | Manifestation |
|------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Dharma-body** | *Dharmakāya* | Wisdom realizing emptiness | Universal truth-nature |
| **Reward-body** | *Saṃbhogakāya* | Wisdom realizing provisional | Buddha's glorified form in pure lands |
| **Transformation-body** | *Nirmāṇakāya* | Wisdom realizing middle | Buddha appearing in the world to teach |

### The Relationship to Practice

Miao-lo clarifies:

> "The three bodies are not attained from outside. They are the inherent nature of mind, revealed through practice. Contemplation does not create Buddha-nature; it removes what obscures Buddha-nature."

This echoes the teaching from Fascicle 7 on "removing the film, nurturing the pearl" (除膜養珠).

### Caution Regarding Fruit

Zhiyi warned against preoccupation with results:

> "If you practice for the sake of attaining fruit, you will not attain fruit. Fruit arises naturally when conditions are complete. The practitioner's job is to create the conditions, not to grasp at results."

---

## Chapter 9: Arising of Teaching (起教)

### The Question

Once realization is attained, how does teaching arise? What enables the Buddha to teach in ways that benefit different beings?

### The Logic of Teaching

Teaching arises from three factors:

**1. Wisdom (智)**

The Buddha's wisdom sees:
- The nature of reality (dharma)
- The capacities of beings (根機)
- The appropriate means for each (方便)

**2. Compassion (悲)**

Wisdom without compassion would not result in teaching. The Buddha teaches because beings suffer and teaching can end suffering.

**3. Skillful Means (方便)**

Wisdom and compassion require appropriate expression. The Buddha adapts teaching to circumstance.

### The Four Siddhāntas Revisited

The teaching arises through four modes, as discussed in the early fascicles:

| Siddhānta | Sanskrit | Function | Example |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Worldly** (世界悉檀) | *Laukika* | Meet beings where they are | Using local language, customs |
| **Individual** (各各為人悉檀) | *Prātipauruṣika* | Address specific needs | Teaching generosity to the stingy |
| **Therapeutic** (對治悉檀) | *Prātipākṣika* | Cure specific ills | Teaching impermanence to the attached |
| **Supreme** (第一義悉檀) | *Paramārtha* | Reveal ultimate truth | Teaching the Three Truths |

### From Realization to Expression

Miao-lo traces the movement:

```
Realization (inner)
      ↓
Compassion arises (response to suffering)
      ↓
Wisdom discerns (what is needed)
      ↓
Teaching emerges (appropriate expression)
```

> "The Buddha does not deliberate: 'What shall I teach?' Teaching arises spontaneously from the conjunction of realization, compassion, and circumstance. It is like a bell that sounds when struck—the sound is appropriate to the strike."

### The Practitioner's Responsibility

What does this mean for the practitioner?

1. **First, realize**: Teaching without realization is empty words
2. **Develop compassion**: Realization without compassion is incomplete
3. **Trust emergence**: The appropriate teaching will arise naturally
4. **Stay humble**: Even after teaching, continue to practice

---

## Chapter 10: Ultimate Return (旨歸)

### The Question

Where does the path lead? What is the final destination?

### The Three Destinations

Depending on the teaching followed:

| Path | Destination | Characteristics |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Tripiṭaka** | Arhat | Personal liberation from saṃsāra |
| **Shared** | Bodhisattva (initial) | Liberation plus aspiration |
| **Distinct** | Buddha (sequential) | Full realization through stages |
| **Perfect** | Buddha (immediate) | Full realization here and now |

### The Tiantai Teaching on Ultimate Return

The ultimate return is to:

> "Return to the origin (歸源). But the origin was never left. The 'return' is the recognition that there was never any departure."

This is expressed in the famous formula:

> "即心是佛" — "This very mind is Buddha."

### The Three Truths as Return

| Truth | Return |
|-------|--------|
| **Emptiness** (空) | Return to the unborn nature of phenomena |
| **Provisional** (假) | Return to the functional manifestation |
| **Middle** (中) | Return to the non-dual identity of emptiness and provisional |

> "The ultimate return is not to a place. It is to the nature that was always present. Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not two places. Liberation is seeing through the illusion of separation."

### The Practical Meaning

What does "ultimate return" mean in practice?

1. **Continue practicing**: Even the Buddha continued to sit
2. **Teach as appropriate**: Realization naturally expresses itself
3. **Remain humble**: "Ultimate" does not mean "finished"
4. **Benefit beings**: The return is not solitary

---

## The Completion of the Commentary

### What Has Been Accomplished

Across ten fascicles, Miao-lo has:

1. Established the lineage and context (F1)
2. Explained the structure and methodology (F2)
3. Detailed the practice (F3-F10)
4. Addressed all ten objects
5. Explained all ten modes
6. Integrated the whole into Tiantai understanding

### What Remains for the Practitioner

The commentary points the way. The practitioner must walk:

> "Reading the map is not the journey. Understanding the tools is not using them. The commentary has done what commentary can do. Now practice."

---

## The Final Teaching

### From Miao-lo

> "This commentary is called 'Transmitting the Expansive Explanation' (傳弘決). 'Transmitting' because it passes on what Zhiyi taught. 'Expansive' because it opens what was condensed. 'Explanation' because it clarifies what was obscure."

> "But the ultimate transmission is not in words. It is from mind to mind. The reader who understands not just the letter but the spirit has received the transmission."

### From Zhiyi (as preserved by Miao-lo)

> "All Buddha's teaching aims at one thing: ending suffering. The *Mohe Zhiguan* is one expression of this aim. The Ten Objects and Ten Modes are tools for this work. Do not mistake the tools for the goal."

> "The goal is simple: See the nature of mind. Everything else serves this seeing."

---

## Summary

The final three chapters of the *Mohe Zhiguan* address what happens after the essential practice is established:

1. **Fruit**: The results of practice—the three bodies of Buddha
2. **Teaching**: How realization naturally expresses itself in teaching
3. **Return**: The ultimate destination, which is the origin, which was never left

These chapters are brief not because they are unimportant but because they describe what happens naturally when practice is correct. The practitioner's work is in the seventh chapter—Correct Contemplation. When that is complete, fruit, teaching, and return arise without additional effort.

## What This Fascicle Covered

### Part 1: The Māra Object (魔事境)

The fifth of the Ten Objects, addressing external interference during practice.

**The Four Māras**:
1. **Affliction-Māra** (煩惱魔) — Internal saboteur
2. **Aggregate-Māra** (陰魔) — Body-mind trap
3. **Death-Māra** (死魔) — Fear of impermanence
4. **Heavenly-Māra** (天魔) — External adversary

**The Twelve Categories of Demonic Activity**:
- Physical (pain, pleasure, abnormal states, illness)
- Emotional (grief, terror, rage, false devotion)
- Cognitive (confusion, false insight, visions, dreams)

**The Core Teaching**:
> "The māra-realm is suchness; the Buddha-realm is suchness. One suchness, not two suchnesses."

### Part 2: Integration of the Ten Objects

The complete map of contemplative territory:

| # | Object | Chinese | Category |

## The Six Identities — Progress Through Practice

| Identity | Chinese | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Principle** | 理即 | Buddha in principle (everyone) |
| **Name** | 名字即 | Hearing and understanding (student) |
| **Contemplation** | 觀行即 | Beginning practice (practitioner) |
| **Resemblance** | 相似即 | Stable realization (adept) |
| **Partial Realization** | 分真即 | Breaking ignorance (sage) |
| **Ultimate** | 究竟即 | Complete Buddhahood (Buddha) |

---

## The Essential Teaching

### The Three Truths

| Truth | Chinese | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Emptiness** | 空諦 | No inherent existence |
| **Provisional** | 假諦 | Functional manifestation |
| **Middle** | 中諦 | Neither and both |

> "Three truths, one reality. One reality, three aspects. Not sequence. Not separation. Simultaneous."

### The Core Formula

> "一念三千" — "3,000 worlds in one thought-moment."

Every moment of mind contains:
- 10 dharma-realms × 10 (mutual inclusion) = 100
- 100 × 10 suchnesses = 1,000
- 1,000 × 3 domains = 3,000

This is the inconceivable that is contemplated in the first mode.

---

## Miao-lo's Contribution

### What the Commentary Provides

1. **Clarification**: Making explicit what Zhiyi left implicit
2. **Organization**: Structuring the vast material
3. **Defense**: Responding to criticisms from other schools
4. **Transmission**: Ensuring the teaching survives

### The Lineage Preserved

```
Nāgārjuna → Huiwen → Huisi → Zhiyi → Guanding → ... → Zhanran (Miao-lo)
```

Miao-lo is the ninth patriarch of Tiantai. His commentary ensures the teaching reaches future generations.

---

## For the Practitioner

### The Work

1. **Sit**: Establish regular practice
2. **Contemplate**: Apply the method to what arises
3. **Continue**: Through obstacles internal and external
4. **Trust**: The path has been walked before

### The Method

> "Contemplate this thought-moment as containing the 3,000 worlds. See the empty, provisional, and middle nature of what arises. Do not grasp, do not reject. Rest in seeing."

### The Fruit

Comes naturally when conditions are complete. Do not chase it.

### The Return

To where you already are. To what you already are.

---

## Final Words

### From the Commentary

> "The Mohe Zhiguan is the heart of Tiantai. This commentary is the explication of that heart. But explication is not the heart itself. The practitioner must find the heart in practice, not in words."

### The Transmission

> "What is transmitted? Not the words. Not even the concepts. What is transmitted is the recognition: 'This very mind is Buddha.' When that recognition is stable, the transmission is complete."
