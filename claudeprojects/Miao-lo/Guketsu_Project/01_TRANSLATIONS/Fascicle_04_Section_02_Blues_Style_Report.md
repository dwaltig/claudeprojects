# Blues Tone Check Report
## Fascicle_04_Section_02_Blues.md

### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.9/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "They often arrive together" `{DOCTRINE: preserves grouped-object rationale}`
- "Response is two-handed: practical treatment plus contemplation." `{LEXICON: safeguards non-dual practical/contemplative response}`
- "Key rule: non-engagement." `{DOCTRINE: preserves karmic-vision handling}`
- "Counter is not theatrical combat." `{RHYTHM: aligns with non-reactive Mara protocol}`
- "what looked like attack becomes instruction" `{RHYTHM: faithful transformational close}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Long explanatory catalogs | Compressed object-by-object operational map |
| High narrative detail in examples | Focused response protocol retained |
| Separate disjoint sections | Unified diagnostic thread across all three objects |
| Mildly descriptive close | Practice-useful conversion framing |

### 4. Notes
- Preserved object distinctions while improving actionability.
- Ready for clause-index pass if scholarly source is later line-expanded.
