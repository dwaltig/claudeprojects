## Overview

Fascicle 7 of Miao-lo's *Zhiguan Fuxing Zhuan Hongjue* completes the exposition of the Ten Modes of Contemplation (十乘觀法) by presenting Modes 5-10. While the earlier fascicles established the foundational contemplative methodology through Modes 1-4, this fascicle provides the diagnostic, therapeutic, positional, endurance, and liberative dimensions necessary for the completion of practice.

## The Six Modes Treated in This Fascicle

### Mode 5: Discerning Openness and Obstruction (通塞)

**Function**: Diagnostic assessment of whether the contemplative path is clear or blocked.

**Key Teaching**: Even correct practice can generate new obstructions through attachment to the practice itself. The four-sentence examination (四句檢校) provides a comprehensive diagnostic:

1. Openness within obstruction (塞中得通)
2. Obstruction within openness (通中有塞)
3. Obstruction as simply obstruction (塞自是塞)
4. Openness as simply openness (通自是通)

**Distinctive Tiantai Contribution**: The one-mind (一心) approach integrates horizontal, vertical, and distinct dimensions of openness-obstruction in a single moment of contemplative awareness.

---

### Mode 6: Adjusting the Path Factors (道品調適)

**Function**: Appropriate application of the thirty-seven factors of awakening (三十七道品).

**Key Teaching**: The path factors form an organic structure—from roots (four foundations of mindfulness) through trunk (four right efforts) to fruit (noble eightfold path). The practitioner adjusts which factors to emphasize based on current conditions.

**The Three Gates of Liberation**: Emptiness (空門), signlessness (無相門), and wishlessness (無作門) represent the culmination of path-factor practice. In the Perfect Teaching, these three are simultaneous aspects of a single liberative insight.

---

### Mode 7: Counteractive Aids for Opening (對治助開)

**Function**: Targeted treatment for specific obstacles when standard practice proves insufficient.

**Key Teaching**: Six obstructions (六蔽) require six perfections (六度) as antidotes:

| Obstruction | Perfection |
|-------------|------------|
| Stinginess (慳) | Generosity (布施) |
| Immorality (破戒) | Moral Discipline (持戒) |
| Anger (瞋) | Patience (忍辱) |
| Laziness (懈怠) | Effort (精進) |
| Distraction (散亂) | Concentration (禪定) |
| Ignorance (愚癡) | Wisdom (般若) |

**The Four Followings (四隨)**: When direct treatment fails, the practitioner may turn to alternative perfections, combine multiple perfections, or proceed directly to ultimate contemplation.

---

### Mode 8: Knowing the Sequential Positions (知次位)

**Function**: Accurate self-assessment of one's stage on the path.

**Key Teaching**: Claiming attainments not yet realized constitutes a grave offense. The four foundations of mindfulness (四念處) establish the discernment necessary for honest evaluation.

**The Three Animals**: Different levels of aspiration:
- Small deer (麞) — Śrāvaka: escapes alone
- Larger deer (鹿) — Pratyekabuddha: escapes with backward glance
- Great elephant (大象) — Bodhisattva: leads all beings to safety

**The Ten Methods for Harmonizing Teachings (十意融通)**: Hermeneutical principles for reconciling apparent contradictions among scriptures.

**The Five Repentances (五悔)**: Preparatory practices for entering higher stages:
1. Confession (懺悔)
2. Entreaty (勸請)
3. Rejoicing (隨喜)
4. Transfer of Merit (迴向)
5. Vow (發願)

---

### Mode 9: Patient Endurance (安忍)

**Function**: Maintaining stability when facing internal and external obstacles.

**Key Teaching**: 安忍 combines settled peace (安) with endurance (忍). The practitioner develops capacity to maintain contemplative orientation regardless of circumstances—neither fighting obstacles nor fleeing from them, but steadily continuing practice.

---

### Mode 10: Freedom from Dharma-Attachment (無法愛)

**Function**: Releasing attachment to the practice itself.

**Key Teaching**: Even love of the Dharma constitutes a form of grasping that must ultimately be released. The teaching remains valid and beneficial; the practitioner simply ceases to cling to it as an object of craving.

**The Raft Metaphor**: The Dharma is for crossing to the other shore. Upon arrival, continued attachment to the raft becomes an impediment.

## Structural Analysis of the Ten Modes

| Category | Modes | Function |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Foundation | 1-4 | Establish the core contemplation |
| Diagnostic | 5 | Assess openness and obstruction |
| Therapeutic | 6-7 | Adjust method and apply treatment |
| Positional | 8 | Know one's stage accurately |
| Endurance | 9 | Maintain stability through difficulty |
| Liberation | 10 | Release attachment to the path itself |

## Major Doctrinal Contributions

### 1. Integration of Abhidharma and Tiantai

Miao-lo draws extensively on Abhidharma sources (*Mahāvibhāṣā*, *Abhidharmakośa*) and Mādhyamika treatises (*Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*) while interpreting them through the Tiantai lens of the three truths and mutual inclusion.

### 2. The One-Mind Principle

Throughout the fascicle, Miao-lo emphasizes that horizontal and vertical dimensions of practice are integrated in the single moment of contemplative awareness. This prevents both sequential gradualism and mere abstraction.

### 3. The Therapeutic Framework

Modes 5-7 constitute a sophisticated therapeutic apparatus for addressing obstacles in practice. The four-sentence examination, the thirty-seven factors, and the six perfections provide comprehensive tools for diagnosis and treatment.

### 4. Hermeneutical Method

The ten methods for harmonizing teachings offer a principled approach to reconciling apparent contradictions among Buddhist scriptures—a persistent challenge in scholastic Buddhism.

### 5. Practical Psychology

The five repentances, the three animals metaphor, and the discussions of endurance and non-attachment provide practical psychological guidance for practitioners at various stages.

## Relation to Other Fascicles

**Preceding Fascicles (5-6)**: Established Modes 1-4, the foundational contemplative methodology.

**Following Fascicle (8)**: Will address 歷緣對境 (encountering objects in daily life)—the application of contemplation to ordinary experience.

---

## Significance for Tiantai Practice

Fascicle 7 represents the maturation of contemplative methodology. Having established the foundation (Modes 1-4), the practitioner now possesses:

1. **Diagnostic capacity** (Mode 5) to recognize when practice is blocked
2. **Adjustment skills** (Mode 6) to apply appropriate path factors
3. **Therapeutic tools** (Mode 7) for targeted treatment of obstacles
4. **Positional awareness** (Mode 8) to accurately assess progress
5. **Endurance capacity** (Mode 9) to maintain stability through difficulty
6. **Liberative freedom** (Mode 10) from attachment to the path itself

These six modes ensure that practice does not stall at the foundational level but proceeds toward complete realization.
