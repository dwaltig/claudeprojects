## The Structure of the Mohe Zhiguan

The whole thing has ten chapters:

| # | Name | What It Covers | Where |
|---|------|----------------|-------|
| 1 | Grand Outline | The big picture | Fascicle 1 |
| 2 | Explaining the Name | What "stopping and seeing" means | Fascicle 2 |
| 3 | Revealing the Essence | What's actually being realized | Fascicle 2 |
| 4 | Including All Dharmas | How one practice covers everything | Fascicle 2 |
| 5 | Partial vs. Complete | Why this teaching is different | Fascicle 2 |
| 6 | Skillful Means | The setup work | Fascicle 2 |
| 7 | Correct Practice | The actual work | Fascicles 3-10 |
| 8 | Fruit | What you get | This section |
| 9 | Teaching | How it spreads | This section |
| 10 | Coming Home | Where it all leads | This section |

Chapter 7 took up most of Zhiyi's teaching and Miao-lo's commentary. The final three chapters are shorter because they describe what happens naturally when the work is done right.

## Chapter 8: Fruit — What You Get

### The Question

What are the fruits of correct practice? What results from applying the Ten Modes to the Ten Objects?

### Two Kinds of Fruit

**1. Fruit Along the Way**

Results that arise during practice:

| Stage | What Happens | The Experience |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Name Stage** | Initial understanding | You get the concept |
| **Practice Stage** | Glimpses | Moments of actually seeing the Three Truths |
| **Resemblance Stage** | Stability | Consistent realization in practice |
| **Partial Realization** | Breakthrough | Actually cutting through ignorance |
| **Ultimate** | Completion | The full thing |

**2. The Final Fruit**

The result of complete practice:

> "The fruit of correct practice is the three bodies: Truth-body, Reward-body, Transformation-body. These aren't three separate things—they're one reality seen from different angles."

### The Three Bodies as Fruit

| Body | What It Is | What It Comes From | How It Shows |
|------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Truth-body** | Universal nature | Wisdom seeing emptiness | The truth that's everywhere |
| **Reward-body** | Glorified form | Wisdom seeing the provisional | Buddha in the pure lands |
| **Transformation-body** | Appearing form | Wisdom seeing the middle | Buddha appearing in the world to teach |

### How This Relates to Practice

Miao-lo is clear:

> "The three bodies aren't attained from outside. They're the inherent nature of mind, revealed through practice. Practice doesn't create Buddha-nature—it removes what's covering it."

This echoes what we learned in Fascicle 7: removing the film, nurturing the pearl.

### Warning About Fruit

Zhiyi warned against being preoccupied with results:

> "If you practice for the sake of getting fruit, you won't get fruit. Fruit arises naturally when conditions are complete. Your job is to create the conditions, not to grab at results."

## Chapter 9: Teaching — How It Spreads

### The Question

Once realization happens, how does teaching arise? What enables the awakened one to teach in ways that help different beings?

### The Logic of Teaching

Teaching arises from three factors:

**1. Wisdom**

The awakened one sees:
- What reality is (the nature of things)
- What beings are capable of (their roots)
- What will work for each one (appropriate means)

**2. Compassion**

Wisdom without compassion wouldn't result in teaching. The awakened one teaches because beings suffer and teaching can end suffering.

**3. Appropriate Means**

Wisdom and compassion need appropriate expression. The awakened one adapts teaching to circumstance.

### The Four Ways Teaching Works

The teaching arises through four modes (we covered these early on):

| Mode | What It Does | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Worldly** | Meet beings where they are | Using local language, customs |
| **Individual** | Address specific needs | Teaching generosity to the stingy |
| **Therapeutic** | Cure specific ills | Teaching impermanence to the attached |
| **Ultimate** | Reveal the final truth | Teaching the Three Truths directly |

### From Realization to Expression

Miao-lo traces the movement:

```
Realization (inner)
      ↓
Compassion arises (response to suffering)
      ↓
Wisdom discerns (what is needed)
      ↓
Teaching emerges (appropriate expression)
```

> "The awakened one doesn't deliberate: 'What shall I teach?' Teaching arises spontaneously from the conjunction of realization, compassion, and circumstance. It's like a bell that sounds when struck—the sound is appropriate to the strike."

### What This Means for the Practitioner

1. **First, realize**: Teaching without realization is empty words
2. **Develop compassion**: Realization without compassion is incomplete
3. **Trust emergence**: The appropriate teaching will arise naturally
4. **Stay humble**: Even after teaching, continue to practice

## Chapter 10: Coming Home — The Ultimate Return

### The Question

Where does the path lead? What's the final destination?

### Three Destinations (Depending on Which Path)

| Path | Destination | What It Means |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Tripiṭaka** | Arhat | Personal liberation from the wheel |
| **Shared** | Bodhisattva (initial) | Liberation plus aspiration |
| **Distinct** | Buddha (sequential) | Full realization through stages |
| **Complete** | Buddha (immediate) | Full realization here and now |

### The Tiantai Teaching on Coming Home

The ultimate return is:

> "Return to the origin. But the origin was never left. The 'return' is the recognition that there was never any departure."

This is expressed in the famous formula:

> "This very mind is Buddha."

### The Three Truths as Coming Home

| Truth | The Return |
|-------|------------|
| **Emptiness** | Return to the unborn nature of things |
| **Provisional** | Return to functional manifestation |
| **Middle** | Return to the non-dual identity of emptiness and provisional |

> "Coming home isn't going to a place. It's recognizing the nature that was always present. The wheel and nirvāṇa aren't two places. Liberation is seeing through the illusion of separation."

### What This Means in Practice

1. **Continue practicing**: Even the Buddha continued to sit
2. **Teach as appropriate**: Realization naturally expresses itself
3. **Remain humble**: "Ultimate" doesn't mean "finished"
4. **Benefit beings**: The return isn't solitary

## The Completion of the Commentary

### What's Been Accomplished

Across ten fascicles, Miao-lo has:

1. Established the lineage and context (F1)
2. Explained the structure and methodology (F2)
3. Detailed the practice (F3-F10)
4. Addressed all ten objects
5. Explained all ten modes
6. Integrated the whole into Tiantai understanding

### What Remains for the Practitioner

The commentary points the way. The practitioner must walk:

> "Reading the map is not the journey. Understanding the tools is not using them. The commentary has done what commentary can do. Now practice."

---

## The Final Teaching

### From Miao-lo

> "This commentary is called 'Transmitting the Expansive Explanation.' 'Transmitting' because it passes on what Zhiyi taught. 'Expansive' because it opens what was condensed. 'Explanation' because it clarifies what was obscure."

> "But the ultimate transmission is not in words. It's from mind to mind. The reader who understands not just the letter but the spirit has received the transmission."

### From Zhiyi (as preserved by Miao-lo)

> "All Buddha's teaching aims at one thing: ending suffering. The *Mohe Zhiguan* is one expression of this aim. The Ten Objects and Ten Modes are tools for this work. Don't mistake the tools for the goal."

> "The goal is simple: See the nature of mind. Everything else serves this seeing."

## The Luthier's Summary

The final three chapters describe what happens after the essential work:

1. **Fruit**: The results of practice—the three bodies
2. **Teaching**: How realization naturally expresses itself
3. **Coming Home**: The destination, which is the origin, which was never left

These chapters are brief not because they're unimportant but because they describe what happens naturally when practice is correct. Your work is in Chapter 7—Correct Practice. When that's complete, fruit, teaching, and return arise without additional effort.
