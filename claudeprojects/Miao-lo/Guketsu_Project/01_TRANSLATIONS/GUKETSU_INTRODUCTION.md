# General Introduction

**Guketsu** (*Notes on the Great Cessation and Contemplation*) is the indispensible key to Master Zhiyi's meditation manual. Written in the Tang Dynasty by the Ninth Patriarch **Zhanran** (Miao-lo, 711–782), specifically to defend and clarify the Tiantai tradition, this commentary is often called the "eyes" of the *Mohe Zhiguan*.

If Zhiyi is the architect, Zhanran is the engineer. He takes the grand, flowing structures of the *Mohe Zhiguan* and subjects them to rigorous stress-testing. He defines terms, answers critics (particularly from the Huayan and Yogacara schools), and pushes the doctrinal implications to their radical conclusions.

Most famously, it is in the *Guketsu* that Zhanran articulates the doctrine of **"Insentient Buddha Nature"** (*Wuqing Youxing*). He argues that if the Three Truths are truly universal, then even "grasses, trees, tiles, and stones" must possess the potential for enlightenment. To deny this, he claims, is to trap oneself in a dualistic view of mind versus matter.

This **Scholarly Edition** presents selected fascicles of the *Guketsu* that are most essential for understanding the core Tiantai glosses. It is intended to be read alongside the *Mohe Zhiguan*, serving as a technical manual for the advanced practitioner and scholar.
