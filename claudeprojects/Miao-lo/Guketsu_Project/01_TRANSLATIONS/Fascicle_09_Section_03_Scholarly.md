## I. The Great Vehicle Dhyānas

These are the practices that define the Bodhisattva path. They are not merely for suppression of defilement but for the cultivation of positive power to aid beings.

### 1. Compassion Samādhi (慈心定)
Also known as the **Four Immeasurables** (四無量心).
-   **Loving-Kindness**: Giving happiness.
-   **Compassion**: Removing suffering.
-   **Joy**: Rejoicing in others' merit.
-   **Equanimity**: Equality towards friends and enemies.

**Miao-lo's Insight**: "In the Hīnayāna, this is just a visualization. In the Mahāyāna, it is the **function of the Essence**. The 'Unconditioned Compassion' (無緣大慈) arises from seeing the emptiness of the self and the emptiness of beings, yet still responding."

### 2. Causes and Conditions Samādhi (因緣定)
Contemplating the **Twelve Links of Dependent Origination**.
- Past causes → Present effects.
- Present causes → Future effects.
- **The Insight**: Seeing the links breaks the chain. In the Perfect Teaching, one sees that **Ignorance IS Buddha-nature** (when transformed).

### 3. Buddha-Recollection Samādhi (念佛三昧)
Focusing on the Buddha.
- **Form Body**: The 32 marks.
- **Dharma Body**: The wisdom and merit.
- **Real Mark**: The nature of the Buddha as non-dual.
- **The Result**: "Seeing the Buddhas of the ten directions standing before one."

### 4. Superknowledges (神通)
- The **Six Superknowledges** (Divine Eye, Ear, etc.) are natural byproducts of the Fourth Dhyāna when directed by wisdom.
- **The Bodhisattva's Use**: They are not magic tricks. They are **skillful means** (upaya) to remove obstacles for beings. Example: Using the Divine Eye to see where a being has been reborn to help them.

## II. Applying the Ten Modes to the Zen Object (正明修觀)

Miao-lo now integrates the entire fascicle by applying the **Ten Modes of Contemplation** to the **Meditative States Object**.

### Mode 1: Contemplating the Inconceivable Object
**The Method**:
When a dhyāna state arises (e.g., the joy of the First Dhyāna), do not rest in it. **Observe it**.
-   Where does this joy come from?
-   It is not the self. It is not other.
-   It is **Empty** (no fixed nature).
-   It is **Provisional** (the sensation exists).
-   It is the **Middle** (the Dhyāna itself is the Dharma-Realm).

**The 3000 Realms**:
This single moment of "Dhyāna Joy" contains the Ten Worlds.
-   If you cling to it → **Human/Heavenly Realm**.
-   If you use it to escape → **Two Vehicles Realm**.
-   If you engage it with Bodhicitta → **Bodhisattva Realm**.
-   If you see its true nature → **Buddha Realm**.

### Mode 2: Generating Bodhicitta
"I will use this concentration not for my own bliss, but to stabilize my mind for the liberation of all beings."

### Mode 3: Skillful Stabilization
If the mind sinks into the bliss (too much stopping), raise it with inspection (contemplation). If the mind scatters in analysis, settle it with the dhyāna factor.

### Mode 10: Release Dharma-Attachment
**Crucial**: You must release the attachment to the Dhyāna state itself.
> "The Dhyāna is a boat. Do not build a house on the boat. Cross the river."

## III. The Ultimate Integration

Miao-lo concludes by noting that all these Zens—Worldly, Transcendent, and Great Vehicle—are ultimately **One Zen** in the Perfect Teaching.
- The **Root Dhyāna** is the **Dharma-body** (when seen as Middle).
- The **Impurity** is the **Empty** aspect.
- The **Compassion** is the **Provisional** aspect.

Practicing one allows access to all, if the View (Mode 1) is correct.
