## Key Insights from Fascicle 6

### On Thought-Delusion

> "Thought-delusion differs from view-delusion in that it arises from repeated contemplation and habitual patterns, not from sudden grasping at false views."

### On the Four Gates

> "The four gates are not four separate paths but four ways of entering the one reality. Like four doors to a single room, they all lead to the same destination."

### On Method

> "Whether one uses analytical or substantial contemplation depends on the practitioner's capacity. The sharp can directly perceive emptiness; the dull must analyze step by step."
