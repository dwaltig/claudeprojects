### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.8/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "private peace over universal vow" `{DOCTRINE: faithful two-vehicle contrast}`
- "reawaken bodhi intention" `{LEXICON: preserves mode-2 antidote core}`
- "Rest stop is not destination." `{RHYTHM: clear conjured-city warning}`
- "Obstacle is not their appearance. Obstacle is identification." `{DOCTRINE: preserves bodhisattva-object subtlety}`
- "Attainment acknowledged. Attainment not possessed." `{RHYTHM: concise release doctrine}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Extended doctrinal exposition | Compressed high-level release architecture |
| Heavy table dependence | Oral flow with preserved milestone warnings |
| Broadly descriptive bodhisattva section | Identity-release focus sharpened |
| Generalized ending | Functional vow-based closure |

### 4. Notes
- Preserves motivational and identity axis distinction with good clarity.
- Can be extended with ten-stage specifics if needed for instructional context.
