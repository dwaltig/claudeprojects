## The Noise Gate: Impurity Meditations

You love the body. You love the shape, the color, the feel. That's noise. It messes up the signal.

**The Nine Thoughts** are the **Noise Gate**.
You look at the body—yours or someone else's—and you watch it rot.
Bloating. Turning purple. Eaten by worms. Turning to dust.

**The Luthier says**: "It's ugly. But it cleans up the sound. You stop clinging to the 'pretty' signal and start hearing the 'real' signal. The body is just a rental instrument. It breaks."

## The Eight Back-Sheddings (The EQ Cuts)

"Back-Shedding" means you turn your back on the junk and shed the weight. It's like cutting the frequencies that cause feedback.

1.  **Cut the Mids**: See the impurity outside, keep the body sense inside.
2.  **Cut the Lows**: Drop the body sense. You're just a skeleton looking at the world.
3.  **Boost the Highs**: Pure light. After the rot, you see the pure color.
4-7. **Formless Settings**: (Space, Consciousness, etc.) - same as before, but now you're using them to *shed* attachment, not just to hang out.
8.  **The Mute Button (Extinction)**: Kill everything. No feeling. No perception. The ultimate "Stop."

## The Victory Places & All-Places (The Master Volume)

**Victory Places**: You don't just see the blue light; you **control** it. You can make it small, huge, bright, dim. You are the boss of the signal.

**All-Places**: You turn the reverb to 10.
"Water." The whole room is water.
"Fire." The whole room is fire.
You realize reality is **plastic**. It bends to the mind.

## The Lion Sprint & Transcendence (The Switching System)

**Sequential Dhyāna**: Clicking Pedal 1, then Pedal 2, then Pedal 3... slow and steady.

**Lion Sprint**: Clicking 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9, then 9-8-7-6... fast. Shaking off the dust. You don't get stuck in any pedal.

**Transcendence**: You go from **Clean** (Zen 1) straight to **Mute** (Extinction). You jump over the middle.
This is **virtuosity**. You're not bound by the order of the setlist. You play what you want, when you want.

---

**The Luthier's Verdict**:
"This gear is powerful. It breaks the chains of samsara. But careful—if you stop here, you're an Arhat. You're out of the band. You need to keep the channel open for the audience (Compassion)."

## The Luthier's Glossary (Section 2)

- **九想** (Nine Thoughts) → **Noise Gate** — impurity contemplations on decay
- **八背捨** (Eight Back-Sheddings) → **EQ Cuts** — turning away, shedding weight
- **勝處** (Victory Places) → **Master Volume** — control over perception
- **一切處** (All-Places) → **Reverb at 10** — extending perception everywhere
- **師子奮迅** (Lion Sprint) → **Fast Switching** — rapid up-down through states
- **超越三昧** (Transcendence Samādhi) → **Jumping the Fretboard** — skipping intermediate states
- **滅盡定** (Extinction Absorption) → **Mute Button** — no feeling, no perception

### The Setup

- **Nine Thoughts** → Look at the body rot; cleans up attachment noise
- **Back-Sheddings** → Shed weight, cut frequencies
- **Lion Sprint** → 1-2-3-4... fast; don't get stuck
- **Transcendence** → Jump from Clean to Mute; virtuosity
- **The warning** → "If you stop here, you're an Arhat. You're out of the band."
