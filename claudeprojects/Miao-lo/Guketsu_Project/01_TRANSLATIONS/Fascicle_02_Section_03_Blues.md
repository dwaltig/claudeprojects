## The Question

You've got the name. You've got the body. Now: **How does this thing relate to everything else?**

Is Zhiguan one technique among many? Or does it *contain* all techniques?

Answer: **It contains everything.**

---

## The Six Ways Zhiguan "Embraces" Everything

| Category | What It Embraces |
|---|---|
| **1. Principle** | The ultimate truth (and the partial truths) |
| **2. Delusion** | All the afflictions |
| **3. Wisdom** | All kinds of knowing |
| **4. Practice** | All methods of cultivation |
| **5. Stages** | All levels of attainment |
| **6. Teachings** | All doctrinal categories |

---

## 1. Embracing Principle (*She Li*)

**Two kinds of principle:**

| Type | What It Is |
|---|---|
| **Expedient** | The partial truths. Emptiness. Conventional. |
| **True** | The complete truth. The Middle Way. |

**The verdict:** You don't throw out the partial to get the complete. The partial *is* the complete, seen clearly.

> "The wrong notes are part of the right song. They just need to be heard correctly."

---

## 2. Embracing Delusion (*She Huo*)

**Three kinds of delusion:**

| Delusion | What It Hides |
|---|---|
| **View/Thought** | True Emptiness. The basic suffering stuff. |
| **Dust-and-Sand** | Conventional Truth. The "how to help others" stuff. |
| **Ignorance** | The Middle Way. The deep root. |

**The verdict:** You don't break them one at a time. You transform them all at once.

> "You don't fix one string while the others are still buzzing. You tune the whole guitar."

---

## 3. Embracing Wisdom (*She Zhi*)

**Three kinds of wisdom:**

| Wisdom | What It Knows |
|---|---|
| **All-Knowing** | Emptiness. |
| **Path Wisdom** | Conventional methods. |
| **All-Mode Wisdom** | The Middle. Non-dual. |

**The verdict:** One wisdom is three. Three are one.

> "The treble, the bass, and the midrange are all *sound*."

---

## 4. Embracing Practice (*She Xing*)

**Two kinds of practice:**

| Type | What It Is |
|---|---|
| **Principal** | The main event. The Ten Modes of Contemplation. |
| **Auxiliary** | The supporting stuff. Precepts, repentance, etc. |

**The verdict:** You need both.

> "You can't play a solo without the rhythm section. And the rhythm section is nothing without the solo."

---

## 5. Embracing Stages (*She Wei*)

**Six Identities (again):**

| Stage | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Blueprint** | You already have it. |
| **First Class** | You hear about it. |
| **First Cuts** | You start doing it. |
| **Getting Closer** | You're almost there. |
| **Breakthrough** | You break through. |
| **Master** | You've fully realized it. |

**The verdict:** All six stages are contemplating the same truth. The difference is clarity.

> "The beginner and the master both play the guitar. The master just hears what the beginner can't."

---

## 6. Embracing Teachings (*She Jiao*)

**Four Teachings:**

| Teaching | What It Is |
|---|---|
| **Tripiṭaka** | Analytical. Break things into parts. |
| **Shared** | Body-watching. Shared with the small vehicle. |
| **Distinct** | Sequential Middle Way. Step by step. |
| **Perfect** | Non-dual. Immediate. This one. |

**The verdict:** The first three aren't rejected. They're *opened* to reveal the Perfect.

> "The student's version of the song isn't wrong. It's just incomplete. The master hears the complete song even in the student's playing."

## Luthier's Verdict

This guitar contains every song.

-   **Principle**: Both partial and complete truths.
-   **Delusion**: All afflictions, transformed.
-   **Wisdom**: All kinds of knowing, unified.
-   **Practice**: Main and supporting, together.
-   **Stages**: All levels, same truth.
-   **Teachings**: All doctrines, opened.

That's why it's called "Great" (*Mo He* = Mahā). Nothing is left outside.
