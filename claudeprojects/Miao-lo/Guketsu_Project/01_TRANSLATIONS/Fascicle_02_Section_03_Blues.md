## Opening Word

Name marks the name.
Body reveals the body.
Then this turn asks:
what dharmas does that body embrace?

Answer:
not one corner.
The whole field.

## From Understanding into Practice

This chapter says contemplation is not random.
Contemplation rises from understanding.

Name and body,
partial and complete,
all of that belongs to understanding-work.

From understanding, practice gets established.
From practice as cause,
fruit appears as result.

So the order stands:
understanding first,
proper contemplation next,
fruit-result after.

## On Relative and Absolute, Sequence and Non-Sequence

In naming-work,
we speak in relative and absolute language.

In body-characteristics,
we speak in sequence and non-sequence language.

In embracing-dharmas,
six meanings are carried.
In partial/complete,
five gates are carried.

Forms differ.
Intent does not split.

---

## One Intent Through Four Segments

Text is fourfold.
Meanings run in two tracks.
Intent is one.

Words may say two.
The burden lands in one.

What is revealed is one.
Revealing agencies are three.
Still, one meaning.
Still, one intent.

---

## Teaching-Characteristic and Eye-Wisdom

The body is what gets revealed.
Teaching-characteristic and eye-wisdom reveal it.

Name-section leans toward absolute-relativity.
Body-section leans toward realm.

Different emphasis,
same work:
bring principle into seeing.

---

## Closing Moan

Don’t grab one sentence
and call that the whole mountain.

This text does not praise fragments.
It gathers the whole teaching-body
so wondrous contemplation can stand.
