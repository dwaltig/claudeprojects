## Overview: The Realm of Dhyāna (禪境)

Fascicle 9 is entirely dedicated to the **Sixth Object**: **Meditative States** (禪定境, *chán dìng jìng*).

Having addressed the obstacles of Afflictions, Illness, and Karma in the previous fascicle (and presumably Mara, though Mara often overlaps with these), Miao-lo now turns to the **attainments** that arise during practice. These states are "objects" (境) because they can become:
1.  **Obstacles**: If the practitioner clings to them or mistakes them for liberation.
2.  **Vehicles**: If the practitioner contemplates them with the Ten Modes.

This fascicle provides a comprehensive encyclopedic treatment of Buddhist meditation states, ranging from ordinary worldly dhyānas to the most advanced Mahāyāna samādhis.

## The Necessity of Contemplating Dhyāna

Miao-lo explains why this object must be contemplated:

> 若入流竟者。初住已去無功用故。若此位兼發一切事禪。任運即理不須更觀。今令觀者在於假名五品位中。

"If one has 'entered the stream' (entered the First Abode), there is no [deliberate] effort. If in this position one concurrently develops all phenomenal dhyānas, they naturally accord with principle and need not be further contemplated. The instruction to contemplate now lies within the **proficience-in-names** (five grades) position."

Practitioners in the early stages (Five Grades) may develop deep meditative states due to past karma or present practice. Without correct contemplation, these states can lead to:
- **Pride** (慢)
- **Wrong Views** (邪見)
- **Rebirth in the Form/Formless Realms** (preventing liberation)
- **Demonic Interference** (魔事)

Therefore, Dhyāna must be treated as an **object of contemplation**, not just a resting place.

## The Classification of Dhyānas

Miao-lo follows the classification system of the *Ci Di Chan Men* (Sequential Dhyāna Gates), dividing all meditative states into four categories:

1.  **Worldly Dhyānas** (世間禪):
    - The Four Dhyānas (四禪)
    - The Four Undefiled/Immeasurable Minds (四無量心)
    - The Four Formless Absorptions (四無色定)
    - *Characteristic*: Leaking (有漏), bound to samsara.

2.  **Also-Worldly-Also-Transcendental Dhyānas** (亦世間亦出世間禪):
    - The Six Wondrous Gates (六妙門)
    - The Sixteen Special Excellences (十六特勝)
    - The Transparent Light Dhyāna (通明禪)
    - *Characteristic*: Can be used for both worldly attainment and liberation.

3.  **Transcendental Dhyānas** (出世間禪):
    - The Nine Thoughts (九想)
    - The Eight Recollections (八念)
    - The Ten Thoughts (十想)
    - The Eight Back-Sheddings (八背捨) - Vimokṣa
    - The Eight Victory Places (八勝處)
    - The Ten All-Places (十一切處)
    - The Nine Sequential Dhyānas (九次第定)
    - The Lion Sprint Samādhi (師子奮迅三昧)
    - The Transcendence Samādhi (超越三昧)
    - *Characteristic*: Non-leaking (無漏), leading to Arhatship or Pratyekabuddhahood.

4.  **Neither-Worldly-Nor-Transcendental Dhyānas** (非世間非出世間禪):
    - The Great Vehicle Dhyānas (e.g., The Self-Nature Zen, etc.) - though often these are realized *through* the previous forms when viewed with the Perfect Mind.
    - Included here:
        - Compassion Samādhi (慈心定) - in its Mahāyāna form
        - Causes and Conditions Samādhi (因緣定)
        - Buddha-Recollection Samādhi (念佛三昧)
        - Superknowledges (神通) - as function

## Doctrinal Significance

Fascicle 9 demonstrates the **encyclopedic scope** of the Tiantai system. Zhiyi and Miao-lo do not reject any form of meditation found in the sutras. Instead, they:
1.  **Classify** it (Worldly, Transcendent, etc.).
2.  **Diagnose** it (Is it a trap? A tool?).
3.  **Integrate** it (How does it fit into the Perfect Teaching?).

By applying the **Ten Modes** (especially Mode 1: Inconceivable Object) to these states, even the most mundane "Root Dhyāna" can be transformed into a gateway to the **Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought**.
