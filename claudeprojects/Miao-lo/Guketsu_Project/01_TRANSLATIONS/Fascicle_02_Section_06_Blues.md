## Opening Word

Now the text enters the ten-dharma explanation,
starting with object.

Question rises:
if object was already discussed,
why explain inconceivable object again?

Because pointing to mind in brief
is not the same
as detailing inconceivable characteristics.
Without that detail,
confusion remains.

---

## Why Object Is Reopened

Wondrous contemplation
must contemplate the object
until the object becomes wondrously seen.

Then object corresponds to principle.
Then what is contemplated
clarifies contemplative agency.

When wondrous object meaning stands,
wondrous contemplation can stand.
So object is explained again.

---

## Root of the Nine Vehicles

This chapter also shows:
wondrous object is root of the nine vehicles.

Only by cultivating nine
according to that root
can one enter stages.

For that reason,
it is called
Ten-Vehicle Wondrous Contemplation.

---

## Thinkable and Inconceivable

The text first clarifies the thinkable,
then the inconceivable.

Why keep the thinkable?
Because learners already heard
realm-distinctions there.

Showing ten realms in one mind
makes ten-in-one-mind knowable.

If one discards the thinkable level,
both dimensions are lost.

---

## One Medicine Across Nine Objects

The same contemplation
is transferred across nine subsequent objects,
like agada medicine
curing many illnesses.

Wording varies,
meaning is one.
Intent is not trapped
in one-versus-different argument.

---

## Three Truths and Mind-Made

Three-truth dharma
does not go beyond
cultivation/nature
and self/other.

"Mind is like a master painter":
in all worlds
there is no dharma it does not produce.

"Mind-made" carries two senses:
in principle,
making means possessing;
in event,
it does not exceed three times.

Contemplation here
focuses principled possession.
Deconstructing and establishing together
are all dharma-realm.

---

## Dharma-Realm Naming

Dharma-realm and dharma-nature:
names differ,
meanings differ,
body is one.

All dharmas are delimited
by three truths.
Tenfold display is added
to make characteristics explicit.

---

## Closing Moan

Do not clutch only method.
Do not clutch only object.

Let one-mind contemplation
see the inconceivable rightly,
then the tenfold workings
all return to one field.
