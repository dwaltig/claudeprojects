## The Question

Prep's done. Shop's ready. Now: **How do you actually build the guitar?**

This is the chapter where you pick up the tools.

---

## The Structure

Two lists:
-   **Ten Objects** — What shows up on your workbench
-   **Ten Modes** — What you do with it

---

## The Ten Objects (*Shi Jing*)

**What shows up during practice:**

| # | Object | What It Is |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Aggregates** | Your body-mind. The starting point. |
| 2 | **Afflictions** | Desire, anger, confusion arising. |
| 3 | **Illness** | Physical sickness during practice. |
| 4 | **Karmic Impressions** | Past stuff coming up. |
| 5 | **Demonic Stuff** | Interference. Internal or external. |
| 6 | **Meditative States** | Jhāna, bliss, peace arising. |
| 7 | **Wrong Views** | Mistaken ideas taking hold. |
| 8 | **Pride** | Arrogance. "I've got this." |
| 9 | **Two Vehicles** | Small-vehicle tendencies. Just want out. |
| 10 | **Bodhisattva** | High experiences. Still not final. |

**The Logic:**
-   **Object 1** is where you start. Always.
-   **Objects 2-5** are obstacles.
-   **Objects 6-10** are attainments you might mistake for the finish line.

> "Whatever shows up on the bench, you work with it."

## The Ten Modes (*Shi Cheng Guan Fa*)

**What you do with whatever shows up:**

| # | Mode | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Contemplate the Inconceivable** | See the Three Truths in the object. |
| 2 | **Generate Bodhi-Mind** | Aspire to full Buddhahood for all. |
| 3 | **Stabilize the Mind** | Use the right method to calm down. |
| 4 | **Break Through** | Deconstruct all views. |
| 5 | **Discern Openness/Obstruction** | Know what helps and what hinders. |
| 6 | **Regulate the Path-Factors** | Adjust the 37 Factors. |
| 7 | **Apply Antidotes** | Use auxiliary practices. |
| 8 | **Know Your Stage** | Understand where you are. |
| 9 | **Develop Patience** | Don't quit. |
| 10 | **Let Go of the Dharma** | Release attachment to the attainment. |

**The Logic:**
-   **Modes 1-5** are the core. Sharp practitioners might only need these.
-   **Modes 6-7** are remedial. When the first five aren't enough.
-   **Modes 8-10** are protective. Prevent falling off.

> "Use as many as you need. The goal is results, not formulas."

## The First Mode: The Inconceivable Object

**The heart of the whole thing.**

### What Is the Inconceivable Object?

**One moment of mind** (*yi nian xin*).

This single thought contains:
-   **10 Dharma-Realms** (Hell → Buddha)
-   **Each realm contains all 10** = 100 realms
-   **Each has 10 Suchnesses** = 1,000 suchnesses
-   **Each in 3 Domains** = **3,000 worlds**

This is the famous **一念三千** — "3,000 Worlds in One Thought."

### How to Contemplate

1.  Observe a single thought arising.
2.  Recognize it's not separate from Empty, Conventional, Middle.
3.  Realize this one thought contains *everything*.

> "One thought = the whole Dharma-realm. The whole Dharma-realm = one thought."

## Luthier's Verdict

This is the build.

| Part | Number | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Objects** | 10 | What shows up |
| **Modes** | 10 | What you do with it |
| **Core Doctrine** | 3,000 in One | The inconceivable nature of mind |

Everything before was prep. This is where you make the guitar.
