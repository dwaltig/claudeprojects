## The Core Teaching of Fascicle 3

**一念三千** (*Yi Nian San Qian* — "3,000 Worlds in One Thought-Moment")

This is not a metaphor or visualization. It is the **actual structure of reality** as revealed through contemplation:

-   **One thought-moment** contains the **ten dharma-realms**
-   Each realm contains all ten = **100 realms**
-   Each has **ten suchnesses** = **1,000**
-   Each in **three domains** (aggregates, beings, lands) = **3,000 worlds**

---

## The Complete Practice Structure

| Component | Number | Function |
|---|---|---|
| **Objects** | 10 | What arises during practice |
| **Modes** | 10 | How to work with what arises |
| **Obstacles** | 8 (common) | Difficulties and their remedies |
| **Core Realization** | 3,000 in One | The inconceivable nature of mind |

---

## The Relationship Between Objects and Modes

**Object 1 (Aggregates)** is the foundation:
-   All practitioners start here
-   If mastered, may not need the others
-   The Ten Modes are applied systematically

**Objects 2-10** are conditional:
-   Arise only when needed
-   Same Ten Modes applied
-   Each becomes a vehicle to realization

## Miao-lo's Key Insights

### On the Aggregates
> "The aggregates are not apart from Buddha-nature. To contemplate the aggregates with the Perfect view is to contemplate Buddha-nature directly."

### On the Ten Modes
> "Sharp practitioners may only need Modes 1-5. Average practitioners will need Modes 6-7. All practitioners must understand Modes 8-10 to avoid errors."

### On Obstacles
> "Obstacles are not enemies. They are opportunities to deepen practice. Each obstacle, when properly addressed, becomes a step forward."

### On the Remaining Objects
> "Whatever arises, use it. Every object, when properly contemplated, becomes a vehicle to realization."

## What Comes Next (Fascicles 4-10)

With the complete practice methodology established, the *Mohe Zhiguan* proceeds to:

-   **Fascicles 4-5**: Detailed treatment of specific objects and modes
-   **Fascicles 6-7**: Advanced applications and special cases
-   **Fascicles 8-10**: Fruit, Teaching, and Ultimate Return

The Guketsu continues to provide Miao-lo's commentary, clarifying difficult passages and resolving apparent contradictions.

---

## Practical Summary

**For the practitioner**:

1.  **Begin** with the aggregates (Object 1)
2.  **Apply** the Ten Modes systematically
3.  **Recognize** obstacles when they arise
4.  **Work with** whatever objects appear
5.  **Realize** that one thought contains all worlds

**The goal**: Not to transcend the aggregates, but to **realize their true nature** as the Three Truths—empty, conventional, and middle.
