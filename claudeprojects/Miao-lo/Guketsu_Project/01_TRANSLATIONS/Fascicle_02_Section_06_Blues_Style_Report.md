- Vibration Score: 8.9/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "Because pointing to mind in brief is not the same as detailing inconceivable characteristics." `{DOCTRINE: preserves rationale for re-opening 境 section}`
- "Wording varies, meaning is one." `{LEXICON: concise rendering of 文異義一}`
- "Mind is like a master painter" `{DOCTRINE: retains canonical citation anchor}`
- "Deconstructing and establishing together are all dharma-realm." `{DOCTRINE: maps 俱破俱立俱是法界}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Expanded modernized ten-object/ten-mode taxonomy | Source-bounded object-first rationale and doctrinal chain |
| Large unsourced explanatory inserts | Reduced to clauses evidenced by scholarly pass-2 file |
| Heavy metaphor framing | Canonical metaphors retained; speculative metaphors pruned |
| Endpoint-focused framing | Restored thinkable/inconceivable dual-necessity structure |

### 4. Notes
- High doctrinal density retained with minimal register loss.
- Recommended next loop: clause-index audit once ten-object and ten-vehicle sublines are expanded in scholarly source file.
