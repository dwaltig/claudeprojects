# Blues Tone Check Report
## Fascicle_03_Section_01_Blues.md

### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.4/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "This first object is the aggregates... The practice doorway." `{RHYTHM: concise testimonial opening preserving gateway function}`
- "The draft marks three approaches... Perfect inconceivable." `{DOCTRINE: retains three-teaching contemplative distinction}`
- "See each aggregate as conditioned, empty of fixed self, yet provisionally present." `{LEXICON: aligns with three-truth framing without adding doctrine}`
- "One thought contains five aggregates... ten realms interinclude." `{DOCTRINE: preserves one-thought containment logic}`
- "No need to destroy the aggregates." `{RHYTHM: safeguards against nihilistic misread}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Extended glossary-style sub-sections | Condensed source-anchored stanzas by doctrinal function |
| Metaphoric expansion around examples | Reduced metaphor load to preserve fidelity traceability |
| Sequential explanation-only tone | Testimonial cadence with doctrinal anchors retained |
| Table dependence for core flow | Oral progression: opening -> methods -> burden -> closure |

### 4. Notes
- Meaning was prioritized where stylistic flourish risked doctrinal drift.
- Candidate next pass: clause indexing when fuller bilingual line-block is available.
