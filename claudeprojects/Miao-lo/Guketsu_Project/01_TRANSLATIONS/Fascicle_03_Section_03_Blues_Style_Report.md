# Blues Tone Check Report
## Fascicle_03_Section_03_Blues.md

### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.6/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "Obstacles do not prove failure." `{RHYTHM: preserves core framing that obstacles are part of path}`
- "recognize, trace cause, apply remedy, release" `{LEXICON: compact rendering of troubleshooting protocol}`
- "Bliss is conditioned, not final liberation." `{DOCTRINE: protects against samadhi-attachment drift}`
- "Do not dramatize. Do not chase. Do not flee." `{RHYTHM: practical anti-reactivity instruction}`
- "obstacle becomes fuel" `{RHYTHM: keeps transformational endpoint without adding doctrine}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Long obstacle-by-obstacle procedural tables | Compressed remedy architecture preserving key obstacle classes |
| Repeated explanatory prose | Cadenced diagnostic workflow with doctrinal safeguards |
| Mixed metaphor density | Focused practical register with minimal ornament |
| Outcome implied | Explicit transformation logic in closure |

### 4. Notes
- This rewrite preserves applied troubleshooting utility while improving oral force.
- Future pass could restore per-obstacle line-item detail if needed for workbook usage.
