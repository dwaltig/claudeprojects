## Opening Word

This first object is the aggregates.
Not one more topic.
The practice doorway.

Body-mind as lived,
all of it,
falls inside these five.

---

## Three Contemplative Approaches

The draft marks three approaches:
Tripitaka analytic,
Shared emptiness-facing,
Perfect inconceivable.

This section leans Perfect.

Not by denying the other two,
but by gathering them
into three-truth seeing.

---

## The Five Aggregates

Form:
material appearance,
body and sensed world.

Feeling:
pleasant, painful, neutral,
with craving, aversion, or dull drift arising.

Perception:
labeling and recognition,
concept-building and memory-marking.

Formations:
volitions, impulses, karmic propulsion,
wholesome, unwholesome, neutral streams.

Consciousness:
knowing functions,
conditioned by organ and object.

---

## Contemplative Burden

The burden is not theory recitation.

See each aggregate as conditioned,
empty of fixed self,
yet provisionally present.

That non-split seeing
is middle-way function.

---

## One Thought Contains the Field

Perfect-method emphasis:
not only one-by-one analysis,
but one-mind contemplation.

One thought contains five aggregates.
One thought opens ten realms.
Ten realms interinclude.
Suchness and domains unfold.

This is the one-thought-totality vision:
three-truth structure in one moment.

---

## Practical Warning

Do not turn "aggregate contemplation"
into abstraction.

The point is direct seeing
in present arising,
not conceptual collection.

---

## Closing Moan

No need to destroy the aggregates.
No need to worship them.

See them as they are:
empty,
provisional,
middle.

Then the first gate is open.
