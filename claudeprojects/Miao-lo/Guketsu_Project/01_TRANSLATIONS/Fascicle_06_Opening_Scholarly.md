## Introduction to Breaking Through Thought-Delusion (破思假)

### The Nature of Thought-Delusion

The text now turns to the second major category of delusion: **thought-delusion** (思惑, *sīhuò*), also called the **three correct poisons** (正三毒, *zhèng sān dú*). This designation requires explanation.

Among the thought-delusions, there are four fundamental afflictions: greed, anger, delusion, and pride. However, pride is subsumed under delusion, leaving three primary categories. These are termed "correct" (正, *zhèng*) for two reasons:

1. They are **not background afflictions** (非背使, *fēi bèi shǐ*) — they arise directly in consciousness
2. They are **not habitual tendencies** (非習氣, *fēi xíqì*) — they are the primary afflictions themselves

### The Structure of Thought-Delusion

**Vertical enumeration** (歷三, *lì sān*): These afflictions pervade the three realms (desire, form, formless).

**Horizontal enumeration** (九地, *jiǔ dì*): Within each realm, they are classified into nine grades or levels of intensity.

The distribution across the three realms:
- **Desire realm**: Four types (greed, anger, delusion, pride) × 3 grades = 12 categories
- **Form realm**: Three types (no anger) × 3 grades = 9 categories  
- **Formless realm**: Three types (no anger) × 3 grades = 9 categories

**Total**: 81 categories of thought-delusion

### Why Nine Grades?

The division into nine grades reflects the progressive nature of wisdom and the gradual elimination of delusion. In reality, the distinctions are infinite — wisdom becomes clearer by degrees, and delusion is exhausted gradually. However, the teaching establishes nine grades as a pedagogical framework.

This ninefold classification serves to:
1. Distinguish levels of practice
2. Determine stages of fruition
3. Provide a map for practitioners

Just as the classification of rebirth in the Pure Land into nine grades is a provisional teaching to accommodate different capacities, so too the nine grades of thought-delusion represent a skillful means rather than an absolute division.

### The Function of Thought-Delusion

**Before elimination**: Each grade of thought-delusion, in its unbroken state, possesses the power to:
- Provide energy for continued existence
- Moisten the seeds of rebirth
- Sustain the cycle of birth and death

**After elimination**: Once a particular fruition is attained and the corresponding delusions are severed, rebirth in that realm ceases.

## The Stream-Enterer's Seven Returns

### The Doctrine

The **Stream-Enterer** (初果, *chūguǒ*; Skt. *sotāpanna*) is distinguished from those who have merely broken through view-delusion by the specific limitation: **at most seven returns** (七反, *qī fǎn*).

This means:
- Maximum of seven more rebirths in the desire realm
- Definite liberation within seven lifetimes
- No possibility of an eighth rebirth

Not all Stream-Enterers require the full seven returns. As the *Laṅkāvat*āra Sūtra* states:

> "The lowest grade requires seven returns; the middle grade, three to five; the highest grade attains *parinirvāṇa* in this very life."

### Explanations from the Treatises

**From the *Satyasiddhi Śāstra* (*Chéng Lùn*, 成論)**:

"In seven lifetimes, the wisdom of the uncontaminated matures. This is like:
- Taking medicine for seven days until the illness is cured
- The *kalala* embryo transforming every seven days
- Family relationships extending to seven generations
- The seven-step snake: due to the power of the four elements, it walks seven steps; due to the power of its venom, it cannot take an eighth"

The power of delusion extends to seven returns; the power of the Path prevents an eighth.

**From the *Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra* (*Pó Shā*, 婆沙)**:

*Question*: Why is it called "seven" and not "fourteen"?

*Answer*: Counting both intermediate existence (*antarābhava*) and actual existence (*bhava*), the number does not exceed seven, hence "seven returns."

Moreover:
- Seven places of birth: human realm plus six desire-realm heavens
- Seven paths cultivated
- Seven afflictions severed

The seven afflictions are:
1. Desire-realm craving (欲愛, *yù ài*)
2. Anger (恚, *huì*)
3. Form-realm craving (有愛, *yǒu ài*)
4. Pride (慢, *màn*)
5. Ignorance (無明, *wúmíng*)
6. Views (見, *jiàn*)
7. Doubt (疑, *yí*)

If we count comprehensively, there should be seven human births, seven heavenly births, and fourteen intermediate existences — totaling twenty-eight births. However, following the primary explanation, we speak of "seven returns."

## The Lamp Metaphor: Extinction at Peak Brightness

**As stated in the *Chū Yào Jīng* (出曜經)**:

"Like a lamp that is extinguished precisely when it burns brightest."

This metaphor illustrates that the Stream-Enterer, though still possessing desire and other afflictions, has fundamentally transformed their nature.

### The Transformation of Desire

**Although desire remains**, the Stream-Enterer is protected by the power of the **moral precepts arising from the Path** (道共戒, *dào gòng jiè*):

- Naturally refrains from sexual misconduct
- Avoids improper conduct even with one's own spouse
- Observes proper times and places
- Maintains purity through the power of realization, not mere willpower

This is likened to how insects naturally stay four inches away from a blade — not through conscious effort, but through inherent nature.

### The Distinction from View-Delusion

Having severed view-delusion and attained the wisdom of personal emptiness (*pudgala-śūnyatā*), the Stream-Enterer:

- Still experiences the **three poisons** in isolated, specific instances
- Understands that all dharmas arise from conditions
- Does not grasp at inherent existence
- Maintains correctness regarding the three poisons — hence "correct poisons"

**Though these afflictions can still moisten rebirth**, they no longer create the causes for rebirth in the four evil destinies (hell, hungry ghost, animal, asura realms).

This differs fundamentally from view-delusion, which:
- Involves grasping and attachment
- Follows objects and generates clinging
- Creates causes for rebirth in the four evil destinies
- Operates indiscriminately and pervasively

Therefore, the **correct three poisons** exist in:
- Those with complete bondage (ordinary beings who have not yet attained the Path)
- Noble ones (Stream-Enterers and above)

In noble ones, these afflictions:
- Do not create causes for the four evil destinies
- Arise with discrimination (knowing when to engage and when to refrain)
- Can be deliberately employed or set aside
- Differ entirely from the indiscriminate arising of view-delusion

## The Name "Thought-Delusion"

This category is called **thought-delusion** (思惑, *sīhuò*) because:

1. It arises through **repeated contemplation** (思惟, *sīwéi*)
2. It requires **sustained meditation** to eliminate
3. It is severed through the **contemplative path** (修道, *xiūdào*), not the path of seeing

Unlike view-delusion, which can be eliminated suddenly upon seeing the truth, thought-delusion must be worn away gradually through practice.
