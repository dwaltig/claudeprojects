## Opening Word

After object comes method.
These ten are called vehicles
because they carry practice forward.

Not ten disconnected systems.
One integrated road,
ten functional turns.

---

## Mode 1: Inconceivable Object

Foundation mode.

Observe one mind-moment in aggregates.
See ten realms.
See mutual inclusion.
See three-truth structure
in that single arising.

If this is deeply stabilized,
later modes may reduce.

---

## Mode 2: True Bodhi-Mind

After seeing inter-inclusion,
make the vow for all beings.

Without bodhi-mind,
contemplation folds inward
into self-centered quietism.

With bodhi-mind,
insight becomes liberative function.

---

## Mode 3: Skillful Settling

Balance stopping and contemplating.

Too much stopping: dullness.
Too much contemplating: scatter.

Balanced practice:
clear and stable,
able to remain with aggregates
without collapse.

---

## Mode 4: Breaking Through Dharmas

Break grasping at self.
Break grasping at dharmas.
Break grasping at emptiness.
Break grasping at middle as concept.

This is deconstruction
without falling into negation-theater.

---

## Mode 5: Discern Open and Obstructed

Recognize what opens practice
and what blocks it.

A method can open in one stance
and obstruct in another
if grasped one-sidedly.

So discernment is ongoing,
not a one-time label.

---

## Modes 6-7: Regulation and Antidotes

When first five are insufficient,
regulate path-factors,
apply targeted antidotes.

This is not downgrade.
This is accurate medicine.

---

## Modes 8-10: Protection from Subtle Error

Know stages to prevent pride or despair.
Stabilize patience to endure pressure.
Release dharma-attachment
so attainment itself is not clung to.

Even refined insight
can harden into identity
if release is incomplete.

---

## Closing Moan

Ten modes,
one burden:
carry aggregates into three-truth seeing
without attachment,
without retreat,
without self-sealing.
