## Mode 6: Adjusting the Path Factors (道品調適)

### I. The Tree of the Path (道樹)

Miao-lo opens his treatment of Mode 6 by presenting the traditional metaphor of the path factors as a tree:

> 次舉譬者。婆沙大論並依樹譬道品。故名道樹。

"Next, presenting the metaphor: both the *[Mahā]vibhāṣā* and the *Great Treatise* use the tree metaphor for the path factors. Therefore it is called 'the tree of the path.'"

The organic structure is as follows:

| Component | Path Factors |
|-----------|--------------|
| Roots (根) | Four Foundations of Mindfulness (四念處) |
| Trunk (幹) | Four Right Efforts (四正勤) |
| Branches (枝) | Four Bases of Supernatural Power (四如意足) |
| Leaves (葉) | Five Faculties and Five Powers (五根五力) |
| Flowers (華) | Seven Factors of Awakening (七覺支) |
| Fruit (果) | Noble Eightfold Path (八正道) |

Miao-lo notes that both the *Mahāvibhāṣā* and the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* employ this metaphor, though with slight variations:

> 二論並與今文大同。但今結果位在初住。與婆沙異。

"Both treatises largely agree with the present text. However, the present text places the fruit-position at the first abiding [stage], differing from the *Vibhāṣā*."

This indicates that while Miao-lo draws on Abhidharma sources, he interprets them through the Tiantai lens of the Six Identities and progressive positions.

### II. The Three Kinds of Spiritual Guides (三善知識)

The path factors function as spiritual guides in three capacities:

> 道品善知識下結前合譬。準方便中有三知識。

"The path factors as spiritual guides—this concludes and combines the previous metaphor. According to the expedient [section], there are three kinds of guides."

1. **同行善知識** (Companion Guide): The path factors accompany the practitioner, walking the same path.

2. **教授善知識** (Teaching Guide): The path factors instruct by showing what to cultivate next.
   > 由是道品令行無誤
   > "Through these path factors, practice proceeds without error."

3. **外護善知識** (Protective Guide): The path factors guard against deviation.
   > 諸品防護妄誤不侵
   > "The various factors protect and guard; error and delusion do not intrude."

### III. The Three Gates of Liberation (三脫門)

Miao-lo transitions to discuss how the path factors culminate in the three liberative gates:

> 次明三脫門者。明道品功能。

"Next, explaining the three gates of liberation: this clarifies the function of the path factors."

#### Definition from the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*

> 大論二十一問。涅槃唯一門何故三耶。答。法一義三。三秖是一。

"The *Great Treatise* [chapter] twenty-one asks: 'Nirvāṇa has only one gate—why then three?' Answer: 'The dharma is one, the meanings are three. The three are precisely one.'"

The three gates are:

1. **空門** (Gate of Emptiness): Realization that self and dharmas lack inherent existence
2. **無相門** (Gate of Signlessness): Freedom from grasping fixed characteristics
3. **無作門** (Gate of Wishlessness): Cessation of craving for results

#### Differentiation by Teaching

Miao-lo distinguishes how each teaching approaches the three gates:

**Tripiṭaka Teaching (三藏教)**:
> 初三藏教約十六行以分三門
"The Tripiṭaka Teaching uses the sixteen aspects [of the Four Noble Truths] to differentiate the three gates."

**Shared Teaching (通教)**:
> 通教從初但觀幻化。是故不復依十六行。
"The Shared Teaching from the beginning only contemplates illusion. Therefore it does not rely on the sixteen aspects."

**Distinct Teaching (別教)**:
> 次明別教先通約三觀。次別約出假。
"Next, explaining the Distinct Teaching: first generally in terms of the three contemplations, then specifically in terms of emerging into the provisional."

**Perfect Teaching (圓教)**:
> 故圓教中空即無相無作故也
"Therefore in the Perfect Teaching, emptiness is precisely signlessness and wishlessness."

In the Perfect Teaching, the three gates are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects of a single liberative insight.

## Mode 7: Counteractive Aids for Opening (對治助開)

### I. The Rationale for Counteractive Aids

Miao-lo explains when and why these aids become necessary:

> 次釋對治助開。初明來意中。先剋出所助之體。故云為一切三昧作本。

"Next, explaining counteractive aids for opening. In first clarifying the purpose, we initially specify the entity being aided. Therefore [the text] states: '[these aids] serve as the foundation for all samādhis.'"

The fundamental condition requiring counteractive aids:

> 根利下正約根遮以簡助意。四句之中三句不須。唯根鈍有遮用此對治。

"From 'sharp faculties' onward, we precisely use faculties and obstructions to differentiate the meaning of aids. Among the four sentences, three do not require [aids]. Only the dull-facultied with obstructions employ this counteractive [approach]."

The four combinations are:

1. **Sharp faculties, no obstructions (利根無遮)**: No aids needed
2. **Sharp faculties, with obstructions (利根有遮)**: Some aids may help
3. **Dull faculties, no obstructions (鈍根無遮)**: Standard practice suffices
4. **Dull faculties, with obstructions (鈍根有遮)**: Counteractive aids essential

### II. The Six Obstructions (六蔽)

Miao-lo presents the six obstructions that impede practice:

> 助道無量下明用治所依。助道無量但用六者為對六蔽。

"'Aids to the path are immeasurable'—this clarifies the basis for applying treatment. Though aids are immeasurable, we use [only] six because they counter the six obstructions."

| Chinese | Sanskrit equivalent | Meaning |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| 慳 | mātsarya | Stinginess |
| 破戒 | dauḥśīlya | Immorality |
| 瞋 | pratigha | Anger |
| 懈怠 | kausīdya | Laziness |
| 散亂 | vikṣepa | Distraction |
| 愚癡 | moha | Ignorance |

### III. The Six Perfections as Treatment (六度)

Each obstruction has its corresponding perfection as antidote:

| Obstruction | Perfection | Treatment Logic |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Stinginess (慳) | Generosity (布施) | Opens the closed fist |
| Immorality (破戒) | Moral Discipline (持戒) | Restores ethical foundation |
| Anger (瞋) | Patience (忍辱) | Cools the burning |
| Laziness (懈怠) | Effort (精進) | Energizes practice |
| Distraction (散亂) | Concentration (禪定) | Settles the scattered mind |
| Ignorance (愚癡) | Wisdom (般若) | Illuminates darkness |

### IV. The Four Followings (四隨)

When direct treatment proves ineffective, Miao-lo provides a protocol for adjustment:

> 若用下具辯四隨迴轉治相。前之對治已用四中一對治竟。忽非其宜。應須轉用。

"From 'if using' onward, we thoroughly explain the characteristics of treatment through the four followings and their turning. The previous counteractive [approach] has already employed one of the four treatments. If suddenly it proves unsuitable, one should turn to use [another]."

#### 1. Following the Treatment (隨對治)

> 如治一慳者。略於一蔽示四隨相。

"For example, treating one [case of] stinginess: briefly, for one obstruction, we show the four following-characteristics."

The direct approach: apply the corresponding perfection. Stinginess → practice generosity.

#### 2. Following with Turning (隨轉)

If direct treatment fails:

> 所言轉者。或轉用尸乃至般若。或次或超超一至四。

"What is meant by 'turning': perhaps turn to use moral discipline, and so on up to wisdom. Either sequentially or by skipping—skipping from one to four."

The practitioner tries a different perfection. Perhaps the stinginess is rooted in fear (use moral discipline for security) or in confusion (use wisdom).

#### 3. Following with Combination (隨兼)

> 若至五度名轉名具

"If reaching [all] five perfections, it is called 'turning' [and] called 'complete.'"

Multiple perfections may be applied simultaneously: generosity + effort + wisdom, for instance.

#### 4. Following the Ultimate (隨第一義)

> 言第一義者。唯觀無相真如寂理。

"What is meant by 'ultimate truth': only contemplating signless true suchness, quiescent principle."

Abandoning specific treatments, the practitioner directly observes the mind. The obstruction is seen to lack inherent nature; treatment and obstruction are both empty.

### V. Treatment Across the Four Teachings

Miao-lo extends the counteractive framework across all four teachings:

> 若以四教展轉為治以前助後者。還以前六轉望後教六蔽之相。

"If using the four teachings to treat in succession, using the earlier to aid the later: we turn to use the earlier six [perfections] in relation to the later teaching's six-obstruction characteristics."

- **Shared Teaching practitioners** may use Tripiṭaka perfections
- **Distinct Teaching practitioners** may use both Tripiṭaka and Shared perfections
- **Perfect Teaching practitioners** may use all three previous sets

This creates a comprehensive therapeutic arsenal.

### VI. The Five Tastes (五味)

Miao-lo connects the path factors to the five periods of Buddhist teaching using the milk metaphor from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*:

> 又華嚴下約五味判

"Furthermore, from 'Huayan' onward, we judge according to the five tastes."

| Period | Taste | Characteristic |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Huayan | Fresh milk (乳) | Rich but difficult to digest |
| Āgama | Cream (酪) | More accessible |
| Vaipulya | Curds (生酥) | Transitional |
| Prajñā | Butter (熟酥) | Refined |
| Lotus/Nirvāṇa | Ghee (醍醐) | Ultimate refinement |

#### The Twin Trees (枯榮)

The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*'s image of twin trees—one withered (枯), one flourishing (榮)—represents:

> 初華嚴中雖具二義文多明別。故云偏多四榮。

"In the Huayan [period], though both meanings are present, the text mostly clarifies the distinct [teaching]. Therefore we say it 'leans toward the four flourishing.'"

- **Withered trees**: Represent the two vehicles (śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha)
- **Flourishing trees**: Represent the bodhisattva path

In the Lotus and Nirvāṇa sūtras, the withered become flourishing—all paths are revealed as leading to the one vehicle.

## Doctrinal Significance

Modes 6 and 7 constitute the therapeutic dimension of the Ten Modes. Having diagnosed obstruction in Mode 5, the practitioner now adjusts methodology (Mode 6) and applies targeted treatment (Mode 7).

The integration of Abhidharma path-factor analysis with Tiantai three-truth contemplation represents a distinctive synthesis. The 37 factors are not merely graduated practices but are understood through the lens of the three truths—empty, provisional, and middle—allowing for flexible application across all four teachings.

The four followings provide a practical protocol for when standard approaches fail, moving from direct treatment through various adjustments to ultimate contemplation. This ensures that no practitioner remains stuck due to rigid adherence to a single method.
