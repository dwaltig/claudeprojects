### Preface to the *Auxiliary Record for Transmission and Propagation of Concentration and Insight*

Those who revere emptiness and non-being cause the Way of nominal designation to fall into disuse. Those who abandon written words make the meaning of literary composition go astray. The ancient sages and Brahmā-kings appeared in accord with their times to benefit those they encountered. Though sages and worthies were united with the Way and their virtuous voices never transgressed, still they relied on verbal exposition and entrusted their teachings to various collections.

How much more so in this age, when time has grown distant and we dwell in the semblance period of the Dharma, when learning is scarce and few know the crucial moments! Among those who grasp and comprehend, not even one or two out of ten succeed. There are even those who exhaust years in silent sitting, content to節 themselves in stupor and obscurity; or who spend their whole lives discussing mind, yet hesitate between the perfect and partial teachings. That people err so greatly—is it not thus?

Before attaining the stage of touching the elephant, each proclaims the color of milk. Some claim that "mind itself is Buddha" is the gate to awakening and entry; that "form is not different from emptiness" leaves no trace of root or branch. They imagine that merging with non-duality transcends all verbal formulations, so what use are chapters and sentences?

Alas! That the great teaching should decline thus! This is precisely because they have not discerned that the nature of written words is itself離 [transcendent], nor understood how profound is the function of total retention (*dhāraṇī*).

In ancient times, the Great Master Zhizhe [Zhiyi] descended to birth and manifested in the world. He wondrously expounded mysterious virtue and greatly rescued those swept along in the crosscurrents. He inquired about completing the final basketful [of earth] from the Great Thinker [Nāgārjuna through texts], and revived the severed thread from the Dragon Tree [Nāgārjuna]. In establishing his school and creating its classical form, he took the Middle View (*Madhyamaka*) as his teacher and ancestral model. In establishing the ultimate and building his discourse, he took the Supreme Vehicle as his destination and aim.

He then entrusted this to Guanding. Master Guan[ding] drew it out and extended it, respectfully carrying forward the transmission with extensive records and accounts. The gates and windows of the teaching from this point were illuminated anew.

This was continued by Fahua Wei. Master Wei's accumulated cultivation from former lives did not deviate from his original nature.

Next came Tiangong Wei. Master Wei reverently received it like water being transmitted from one vessel to another.

He conferred it upon Zuoxi Xuanlang. Master Lang was exceptionally outstanding, with natural capacity for independent judgment. [Yet] the successive explanations and interpretations gave no leisure to attend to stylistic refinement.

It was then raised up by Pitan Zhanran. Master Ran was an extraordinary birth—even as a youth in pigtails he displayed keen awakening. Zuoxi deeply recognized his unusual capacities and vowed to transmit the lamp through him.

[Zuoxi] once said: "The two gates of *samatha* and *vipaśyanā* [concentration and insight] comprehensively govern the myriad practices. The establishment of the perfect-sudden [teaching] penetrates them with a single [thread]."

Alas! The succession had continued through four generations, nearly two hundred years. Errors of fish [魚] for lu [魯] inevitably produced variations and discrepancies. Just as [Master Ran] was about to explicate the principles and guide the mysterious current, he extensively refuted heterodox doubts, broadly extending through past and present. [His writing was] substantial yet not crude, erudite yet not excessive.

He composed the *Auxiliary Record* (*Fuxing Ji*) in ten fascicles total. It prepares both the extensive and abbreviated purport of former sages, and accords with the superior and inferior capacities of people today. Not only did it systematize what had been heard; it would moreover regulate what was to be practiced.

What is practiced is precisely the three conducts—the subtle operation [of practice] thereby rapidly ascends its stages. What is heard is solely understanding—the mysterious vision of the one true reality is thereby immersed in.

Now, practice has divergent paths, whereby beginning and end become separated as far as heaven [from earth]. Understanding too has no fixed location, whereby shallow and deep also follow the categories [of beings].

He established the discourse "Auxiliary Practice" (*Fuxing*) in order to raise up its completeness. Therefore, from distant regions they came to inquire about doubts and request clarification. Striking away darkness and uncovering obscurity, diligently day and night—how could this not be a profound assistance, reverently according with transmission and propagation!

That the Way is about to flourish—this fortune does not stand alone!

Though I am a末學 [student of the latter age] presumptuously discussing the Supreme Vehicle, it is like a torch's small fire presuming to add brilliance to the sun and moon.

Reverently composed by Gentleman Pumen Zijing of Junshan.
Written in the first year of Yongtai [765 CE], the fourth year of the eighth generation flourishing the Tang.

## Literary Context

This preface was composed by **Pumen Zijing** (普門子敬), a lay Buddhist scholar and devotee of Miao-lo Zhanran, to introduce Zhanran's magnum opus, the *Zhiguan Fuxing Zhuanhong Jue* (止觀輔行傳弘決, *Auxiliary Record for Transmission and Propagation of Concentration and Insight*), commonly abbreviated as *Fuxing Ji* or *Guketsu*.

**Historical Dating**: The preface is dated to **永泰元年** (Yongtai 1), corresponding to **765 CE**, during the Tang Dynasty. The phrase "八葉之四載" (fourth year of the eighth generation) refers to Emperor Daizong, the eighth emperor of the Tang, in his fourth regnal year under this era name.

**Author**: Pumen Zijing identifies himself as "君山除饉男" (Gentleman of Junshan, one who removes hunger). This suggests he was a lay Buddhist scholar associated with Mount Jun. The name "除饉" (removing famine/hunger) likely refers to spiritual hunger, indicating his devotion to Dharma propagation.

**Purpose**: The preface serves multiple functions:
1. **Polemic defense** of textual study against those advocating silent meditation alone or dismissing scriptural learning
2. **Lineage authentication**, tracing the Tiantai transmission through six generations
3. **Historical contextualization** of the *Fuxing Ji* as correcting two centuries of textual corruption
4. **Justification** of Zhanran's commentary as both preserving tradition and adapting to contemporary needs

**Literary Register**: The preface employs classical parallel prose (駢文, *pianwen*) with balanced four- and six-character clauses, typical of formal Buddhist prefaces of the Tang period. It shows influence from both Confucian literary convention and Buddhist philosophical terminology.

## Key Annotations

### Doctrinal and Philosophical Terms

- **名教之道** (*mingjiao zhi dao*) — "The Way of nominal designation": Refers to the Buddhist teaching that employs conventional language and concepts to point toward truth, despite ultimate reality transcending verbal formulation. This defends the necessity of textual study.

- **文字之性離** (*wenzi zhi xing li*) — "The nature of written words is itself transcendent/離": A key Mahāyāna principle that language, while conventional, is not inherently separate from ultimate truth. The character 離 suggests both "transcendence" and "non-separation."

- **總持** (*zongchi*) — "Total retention": Translation of Sanskrit *dhāraṇī*, referring both to mnemonic formulae and to the comprehensive retention of all teachings within a single practice or realization.

- **即心是佛** (*ji xin shi fo*) — "Mind itself is Buddha": A Chan/Zen slogan that the preface critiques when understood as dismissing textual study. The preface argues this must be understood through proper doctrinal framework.

- **色不異空** (*se bu yi kong*) — "Form is not different from emptiness": Direct quotation from the *Heart Sutra*, used here to exemplify those who misunderstand emptiness as negating all practice and study.

- **絕待** (*juedai*) — "Non-duality" or "transcending opposition": Technical term from Tiantai philosophy referring to truth that transcends all conceptual dichotomies. Full term is 絕待妙 (*juedai miao*, "subtlety of non-duality").

- **半滿** (*banman*) — "Partial and complete" or "half-full": Refers to Tiantai doctrinal classification distinguishing preliminary teachings (半字教, "half-word teachings") from complete perfect teachings (滿字教, "full-word teachings"). Based on the Nirvana Sutra's metaphor of dairy products reaching perfection in ghee.

- **中觀** (*zhongguan*) — "Middle View": Chinese translation of *Madhyamaka*, the philosophical school founded by Nāgārjuna. Tiantai claims direct inheritance from Madhyamaka through Zhiyi's synthesis with the Lotus Sutra.

- **上乘** (*shangsheng*) — "Supreme Vehicle": Synonym for Mahāyāna or specifically the One Buddha Vehicle (*ekabuddhayāna*) taught in the Lotus Sutra.

- **止觀** (*zhiguan*) — "Concentration and Insight": Chinese translation of Sanskrit *śamatha-vipaśyanā*, the twin pillars of Buddhist meditation. In Tiantai, these are synthesized in Zhiyi's *Mohe Zhiguan*.

- **圓頓** (*yuandun*) — "Perfect-sudden": Tiantai's highest doctrinal classification, combining "perfect" teaching (圓教, *yuanjiao*—all phenomena interfuse) with "sudden" awakening (頓教, *dunjiao*—immediate realization without stages). Contrasted with gradual or partial approaches.

- **行三** (*xing san*) — "The three conducts": Likely refers to Zhiyi's threefold practice structure: precepts (*śīla*), concentration (*samādhi*), and wisdom (*prajñā*); or possibly the three contemplations (空假中, empty-provisional-middle).

### Lineage Figures

- **智者大師** (*Zhizhe Dashi*) — "Great Master Zhizhe [Wise One]": **Zhiyi** (智顗, 538-597 CE), founder of the Tiantai school and author of the *Mohe Zhiguan* being commented upon.

- **大思** (*Dasi*) — "Great Thinker": Refers to **Nāgārjuna** (龍樹, *Longshu*, c. 150-250 CE), Indian Madhyamaka philosopher whom Tiantai claims as a patriarchal ancestor. The phrase "覆簣於大思" alludes to the Analects metaphor of completing a mountain by adding the final basketful of earth.

- **龍猛** (*Longmeng*) — "Dragon Tree" or "Dragon-Fierce": Alternative Chinese name for **Nāgārjuna**. "Reviving the severed thread from the Dragon Tree" suggests Zhiyi restored authentic Madhyamaka transmission that had been lost or distorted in China.

- **灌頂** (*Guanding*) — **Guanding** (561-632 CE), Zhiyi's closest disciple and redactor of his oral teachings, including the *Mohe Zhiguan*. "頂公" (Master Ding) is a respectful abbreviation.

- **法華威** (*Fahua Wei*) — **Fahua Wei** (dates uncertain, 7th century), third-generation Tiantai master. Little biographical information survives.

- **天宮威** (*Tiangong Wei*) — **Tiangong Wei** (dates uncertain, 7th century), fourth-generation master, also obscure in historical records.

- **左谿玄朗** (*Zuoxi Xuanlang*) — **Xuanlang** (673-754 CE) of Zuoxi, fifth-generation patriarch and Zhanran's direct teacher. "左谿" (Zuoxi, "Left Stream") refers to his residence.

- **毘壇湛然** (*Pitan Zhanran*) — **Zhanran** (711-782 CE), also called **Miao-lo** (妙樂, "Sublime Joy"), sixth-generation patriarch and author of the *Fuxing Ji*. "毘壇" (Pitan) likely refers to his residence at Mount Tiantai.

### Literary and Historical Allusions

- **梵皇** (*fanhuang*) — "Brahmā-kings": Refers to ancient sage-rulers, possibly alluding to both Indian Brahmā-figures and Chinese legendary emperors. Suggests universal applicability of the teaching.

- **像季** (*xiangji*) — "Semblance period": In Buddhist eschatology, the second of three Dharma ages: True Dharma (正法, 500-1000 years), Semblance Dharma (像法, 1000 years), and Final Dharma (末法, 10,000 years). By the 8th century, Chinese Buddhists generally believed they were in the Semblance or Final period.

- **捫象** (*men xiang*) — "Touching the elephant": Allusion to the Buddhist parable of blind men touching different parts of an elephant and claiming different truths. Found in the *Nirvana Sutra* and *Udāna*. Critiques partial understanding.

- **乳色** (*ru se*) — "Color of milk": Continues the elephant metaphor. Also alludes to the *Nirvana Sutra*'s five-stage metaphor of dairy refinement (milk → cream → curdled milk → butter → ghee), representing progressive doctrinal understanding.

- **魚魯** (*yu lu*) — "Fish and lu": Classical example of textual corruption from graphic similarity of characters. From the *Lunyu* (*Analects*) commentary tradition. "Fish [魚] mistaken for lu [魯]" indicates scribal errors accumulating over generations.

### Temporal and Dynastic References

- **永泰元年** (*Yongtai yuannian*) — "First year of Yongtai": **765 CE**, a brief era name (765-766) during Emperor Daizong's reign.

- **興唐八葉之四載** (*xing Tang ba ye zhi si zai*) — "Fourth year of the eighth generation flourishing the Tang": Emperor Daizong (代宗, r. 762-779) was the eighth emperor of the Tang Dynasty. "四載" counts his fourth year under the Yongtai era name.

## Philological Notes

### Classical Chinese Grammatical Features

1. **Parallel Prose Structure** (*pianwen* 駢文):
   - Opening couplet: "宗虛無者名教之道廢 / 遺文字者述作之義乖"
   - Four-character rhythm: "咨覆簣於大思 / 振絕維於龍猛"
   - Six-character balance: "命家作古以中觀為師宗 / 立極建言以上乘為歸趣"

2. **Topicalization Patterns**:
   - "魚魯斯訛,不無同異" — Topic (fish-lu errors) + comment (variations exist)
   - "所治即行三多之妙運遽階" — Topic (what is practiced) + predicate (rapidly ascends stages)

3. **Negation Structures**:
   - "不孤運矣" — Negative 不 + verb 孤 (be alone) + aspect marker 矣
   - "不無同異" — Double negative (not without = there exist) variations

4. **Verb Complements**:
   - "引而伸之" — "Drew [it] out and extended it" — Phrasal verb with pronominal object 之
   - "著輔行記凡十卷" — "Composed the *Fuxing Ji*, totaling ten fascicles" — Result complement 凡

5. **Aspectual Particles**:
   - "道之將行" — 將 indicating prospective/imminent aspect ("about to flourish")
   - "年將二百" — 將 indicating approximation ("nearly two hundred years")

### Key Compound Analysis

1. **止觀輔行傳弘決** (*Zhiguan Fuxing Zhuanhong Jue*):
   - 止觀 = Concentration-Insight (*śamatha-vipaśyanā*)
   - 輔行 = Auxiliary Practice/Record
   - 傳弘 = Transmission-Propagation
   - 決 = Definitive Resolution/Commentary
   - Full meaning: "Definitive Commentary on Auxiliary Practices for Transmission and Propagation of Concentration and Insight"

2. **覆簣** (*fukui*) — "Completing the final basketful":
   - Allusion to *Analects* 9.19: "If I am building a mountain and stop when one basketful of earth is lacking, the stopping is my own doing."
   - Suggests Zhiyi completed what Nāgārjuna began

3. **絕維** (*juewei*) — "Severed thread":
   - 絕 = cut, severed
   - 維 = rope, cord, thread,維系 (connection/continuity)
   - Metaphor for interrupted lineage transmission

4. **惛懵** (*hunmeng*) — "Stupor and obscurity":
   - 惛 = drowsy, muddled
   - 懵 = ignorant, unconscious
   - Critiques formless meditation without understanding

5. **總持** (*zongchi*) — *Dhāraṇī*:
   - 總 = comprehensive, total
   - 持 = retention, upholding
   - Technical Buddhist term for mnemonic/magical formulae and comprehensive understanding

6. **岐路** (*qilu*) — "Divergent paths":
   - Classical metaphor from *Liezi* for confusion caused by multiple branching roads
   - In Buddhist context: incorrect practice methods leading astray

### Textual Corruption Note

The phrase "魚魯斯訛" (*yu-lu si e*) deserves special attention. This refers to the well-known phenomenon of graphic confusion between similar characters in manuscript transmission:

- 魚 (fish, *yu*) consists of components that can resemble 魯 (Lu, a state name; also "crude")
- The *Lunyu* commentarial tradition extensively discussed such corruptions
- Zhanran's *Fuxing Ji* specifically aimed to correct such errors that had accumulated over ~170 years (from Guanding's redaction c. 594 to Zhanran's work c. 765)

### Humility Topoi

The concluding self-deprecation "爝火增輝二曜" (*jue huo zeng hui er yao*) employs the classical topos of inadequacy:

- 爝火 (*jue huo*) = torch, small fire
- 二曜 (*er yao*) = sun and moon (the "two luminaries")
- Structure: Comparing oneself to a small torch presuming to add light to the sun and moon

This is formulaic in prefaces, expressing ritual humility while paradoxically drawing attention to the work's importance.

## Translator's Notes

This preface exhibits the characteristic tensions of 8th-century Chinese Buddhism:

1. **Anti-textualism vs. Scholasticism**: Pumen Zijing defends extensive textual commentary against Chan critiques of scriptural study, while simultaneously affirming the non-dual nature of words and reality.

2. **Lineage Anxiety**: The elaborate tracing of transmission through six generations reflects concerns about authenticity and authority in an era of competing Buddhist schools.

3. **Textual Corruption**: The acknowledgment of "fish-lu errors" over two centuries reveals awareness of manuscript unreliability and the need for critical editing—a sophisticated philological consciousness.

4. **Doctrinal Classification**: The preface's deployment of Tiantai technical vocabulary (圓頓, 半滿, 絕待妙) assumes reader familiarity with complex doctrinal taxonomies developed over 150+ years.

5. **Practice-Theory Integration**: The defense of textual study is ultimately grounded in practice—understanding (*wen* 聞) must lead to realization (*xing* 行), neither being sufficient alone.

The preface thus serves as both historical document and philosophical argument, situating Zhanran's massive commentary within debates about the relationship between meditation, doctrine, and textual study in Tang Buddhism.
