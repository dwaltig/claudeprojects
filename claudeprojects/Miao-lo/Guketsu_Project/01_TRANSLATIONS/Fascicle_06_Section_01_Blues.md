## Two Ways to Sand the Grain

### The Setup

You've got **thought-delusion** (思惑) — the grain in the wood that won't straighten. Now you gotta work it out.

Miao-lo gives you **two methods**:

1. **Analytical Contemplation** (析觀) — **Break it down piece by piece**
2. **Substantial Contemplation** (體觀) — **See the whole thing as empty**

Both get you to the same place: **emptiness**. But they work different.

### Which One Do You Use?

**Analytical** is for the **slow learners**. You gotta take it apart, examine every piece, see how it's put together. Then you realize: "Oh. There's nothing here."

**Substantial** is for the **sharp ones**. They just *see* it. No need to break it down. They look at the wood and go, "Yeah. That's empty."

Miao-lo's saying: **Both work**. But if you're gonna use the analytical method, you better know what you're doing. Don't get stuck in the pieces.

## Working with Desire: The Six Objects

### What You're Up Against

Desire comes in **six flavors**. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* breaks it down:

1. **Color** — You like the way they look. Blue eyes. Dark hair. Whatever.
2. **Form** — You like the shape. Curves. Muscles. The whole package.
3. **Demeanor** — You like the way they move. The walk. The gesture. The vibe.
4. **Speech** — You like the voice. Smooth. Sweet. Says what you wanna hear.
5. **Smoothness** — You like the touch. Soft skin. Warm body.
6. **Human Form** — You just like *people*. Male. Female. Doesn't matter.

### How It Works

**External object** (one of the six) meets **internal faculty** (your mind).

**Result**: **Desire arises**.

This is **cause-and-effect** (因成假). The object is the cause. Your mind is the condition. Desire is the effect.

And here's the thing: **Even a Stream-Enterer still has this**. Even an **Arhat** might have **residual habits**.

There's a guy named **Nanda** (難陀). He became an Arhat. Still had desire-habits so strong they showed up in his body language.

### The Six Desire-Marks

Different realms, different levels of desire:

1. **Earth-dwelling beings** (us) — Full physical union
2. **Trāyastriṃśa Heaven** — Embracing
3. **Yāma Heaven** — Holding hands
4. **Tuṣita Heaven** — Gazing and smiling
5. **Nirmāṇarati Heaven** — Just gazing
6. **Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven** — Just looking

The *Lotus Sūtra* says: **Don't even have the thought**. Forget the action. Don't even *think* about it.

### The Range

Desire ranges from **worse than animals** (some people in this world) to **celibate practice** (some people in this world).

It's all over the map.

## The Analytical Method: Break It Down

### The Four Questions

When desire arises, you ask:

1. **Does it come from the object?** (The person you're looking at?)
2. **Does it come from your mind?** (Your internal faculty?)
3. **Does it come from both?** (Object + mind together?)
4. **Does it come from neither?** (Just... random?)

### The Answer

**None of the above**.

If it came from the object, everyone would desire the same thing. They don't.

If it came from your mind, you'd desire everything. You don't.

If it came from both, you'd have to explain how two non-desires make a desire. Good luck.

If it came from neither, then it's just random. But it's not. It's clearly connected to the object and your mind.

**Conclusion**: There's **no inherent nature of desire**. It's **empty**.

This is **emptiness of inherent nature** (性空).  
This is **emptiness of characteristics** (相空).

### For Sharp Practitioners

You break through the four questions. **Boom**. You're done. You see emptiness. You're in.

### For Dull Practitioners

You break through the four questions. Nothing happens.

So you do it again. And again. **Sixty-four times**.

You examine each question from sixteen angles. Four questions × sixteen angles = **sixty-four examinations**.

Eventually, you get it.

## The Three Provisional Designations

### 1. Cause-and-Effect (因成假)

**What it is**: Desire arises from causes and conditions (object + mind).

**What you do**: Examine it with the four questions. See that it's empty.

### 2. Continuous (相續假)

**What it is**: Desire keeps arising. One thought after another. It's a **stream**.

**The rule**: The *Vinaya* says, "**Prevent continuous desire from leading to action**."

**What you do**: Same as before. Examine the continuity. See that it's empty.

### 3. Relative (相待假)

**What it is**: Desire is designated **relative** to non-desire. Purity is designated relative to impurity.

**What you do**: Examine the relativity. See that it's empty.

---

## The Nine Grades: Sand It Down

### The Process

Each of the **nine grades** of desire has these **three provisional designations**.

You work through them. One by one.

**First grade**: Examine cause-and-effect. Examine continuity. Examine relativity. See emptiness.

**Second grade**: Same thing.

**Third grade**: Same thing.

All the way to **ninth grade**.

### Extension to Other Afflictions

You do this for **greed**. Then you do it for:

- **Anger** (瞋)
- **Delusion** (癡)
- **Pride** (慢)

Same method. Same process.

### The Result

When you've worked through all nine grades of all afflictions, you achieve:

- **Non-arising** (無生) — No more rebirth
- **Complete breaking through** (破遍) — You're done

## The Long Sanding

### What Miao-lo's Saying

This isn't a **lightning bolt**. This is **sanding the grain**.

You take the wood. You examine it. You see the grain. You sand it. You examine it again. You sand it again.

**Sixty-four times** if you're slow.

**Once** if you're sharp.

But either way, you're **working the wood**.

## The Luthier's Take

**Analytical Contemplation** is like taking the guitar apart. You examine every piece. You see how it's put together. You realize: "Oh. There's no 'guitar.' There's just wood and strings and glue."

**Substantial Contemplation** is like looking at the guitar and just *knowing* it's empty. No need to take it apart. You just see it.

Both work. But if you're gonna take it apart, **don't get lost in the pieces**.

The point is to see: **There's no inherent "guitar."** There's no inherent "desire." There's no inherent "you."

It's all **provisional**. It's all **empty**.

And when you see that — really see it — the grain straightens out.

## What's Next

You know how to sand. You've got the methods — analytical or substantial, sixty-four examinations or one look.

But here's the question: **Which door do you enter through?**

That's Section 2. Four gates. Different doors. Same room.

## The Luthier's Glossary

- **析觀** (Analytical Contemplation) → **Taking It Apart** — examining piece by piece
- **體觀** (Substantial Contemplation) → **Seeing the Whole / Stepping Into the Swing** — direct perception of emptiness. You're not analyzing pieces; you're stepping into the groove. [See Blues Glossary: 體 = "The Swing"]
- **因成假** (Cause-and-Effect Provisional) → **The Build** — how things are put together
- **相續假** (Continuous Provisional) → **The Stream** — one thought after another
- **相待假** (Relative Provisional) → **The Comparison** — defined by what it's not
- **六欲境** (Six Objects of Desire) → **Six Flavors of Want** — what hooks you
- **九品** (Nine Grades) → **Nine Levels of Sanding** — from rough to fine

### The Setup

- **Analytical** → Break it down
- **Substantial** → See it whole
- **Four Questions** → The diagnostic
- **Sixty-Four Examinations** → The long sanding
- **Non-Arising** → No more rebirth
