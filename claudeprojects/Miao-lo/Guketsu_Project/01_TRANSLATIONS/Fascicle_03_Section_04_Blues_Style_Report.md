# Blues Tone Check Report
## Fascicle_03_Section_04_Blues.md

### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.5/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "other objects may arise conditionally" `{DOCTRINE: preserves conditional-object principle}`
- "the same ten-mode method applies" `{DOCTRINE: retains methodological continuity across objects}`
- "Different faces, same requirement" `{RHYTHM: concise unifying refrain}`
- "do not mistake station for destination" `{LEXICON: preserves warning on meditative-state attachment}`
- "return it to the one vehicle" `{DOCTRINE: keeps non-fragmentary culmination}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Highly detailed object-by-object exposition | Source-faithful condensed treatment with method continuity |
| Colloquial compression with missing cross-object method link | Explicit ten-mode carry-through restored |
| Scattered warnings across sections | Unified warning block by object type |
| Summary table dependence | Oral structural cadence with doctrinal anchor points |

### 4. Notes
- Compression was controlled to keep all nine object classes present.
- If needed, next pass can expand each object into line-level remedial subprotocols.
