## 1. The Necessity of the "Right" (*Xian Shi* 顯是)

After rejecting the "Ten Wrongs," the mind must settle on the "Right." What constitutes the "Right Mind"? It is the mind that generates intention based on reality, not on biological impulse or social conditioning.

Miao-lo explains: "The 'Right' is revealed through the **Four Great Vows** (*Si Hong Shiyuan* 四弘誓願). These are not merely aspirations; they are the structural response of wisdom to the four aspects of the Noble Truths."

### The Correlation of Truths and Vows

In the *Mohe Zhiguan*, the Four Vows are mapped directly to the Four Noble Truths. The vows are the active engagement with the truths.

| **The Four Noble Truths** (Reality) | **The Four Great Vows** (Response) | **Miao-lo's Commentary** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Suffering** (*Ku*) | **Sentient Beings are numberless; I vow to save them.** | We see the universality of suffering (Biological limit), so we broaden our scope to *all* beings. |
| **2. Accumulation** (*Ji*) | **Defilements are inexhaustible; I vow to end them.** | We see the cause (Conditioning/Karma), so we vow to cut the root, not just the branch. |
| **3. Path** (*Dao*) | **Dharma gates are potentialless; I vow to enter them.** | We see the way out requires skill. We don't just "be good"; we master the *technology* of liberation. |
| **4. Extinction** (*Mie*) | ** The Buddha Way is unsurpassable; I vow to attain it.** | We see the final goal (Nirvana) not as a stopping point, but as the perfection of character. |

## 2. The Distinction of Vows

Miao-lo clarifies that there are two types of vows, and only one is "Right":

1.  **Affinity Vows** (*Yuan Shi*): Vows based on loving those who love you. "I will save my family." This is biological, not spiritual. It is narrow and fragile.
2.  **Dharma Vows** (*Fa Shi*): Vows based on the understanding of Emptiness and Interdependence. "I save beings not because I like them, but because we are not separate." This is the Unshakeable Vow.

> "If the vow is not grounded in the Truth of Suffering, it is Sentimental Compassion. If it is not grounded in the Truth of Emptiness, it is Blind Action." — *Miao-lo*

### The "Uncreated" Vows (*Wu Zuo*)

The highest level of vow is the "Uncreated" or "Spontaneous" Vow. At this level, the Bodhisattva does not think "I am saving you." The saving happens naturally, just as a mirror reflects an image without effort.

*   **Ordinary Vow**: "I must work hard to save people." (Effort/Dualistic)
*   **Uncreated Vow**: "Suffering and Enlightenment are non-dual. Saving beings is just the functioning of the True Self." (Spontaneous/Non-dual)

## Summary

To "Reveal the Right" is to align one's will with the structure of reality. The Four Vows are the interface between the chaotic mind (Ten Wrongs) and the enlightened mind. They transform **Passive Suffering** into **Active Agency**.
