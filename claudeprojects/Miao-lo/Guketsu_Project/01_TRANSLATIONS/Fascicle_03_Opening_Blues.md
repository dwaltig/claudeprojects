## The Shift

Fascicles 1-2 were **orientation and blueprints**. Fascicle 3 is where you **pick up the tools**.

After the 25 Preparations (Fascicle 2, Section 5), you're ready for **正觀** (*Zheng Guan* — "Correct Contemplation").

This is the actual practice.

---

## The Structure (Again)

-   **Ten Objects** — What shows up on your workbench
-   **Ten Modes** — What you do with it

Fascicle 3 starts with the **First Object**: Your body-mind (the Aggregates).

## The Ten Objects (Quick Review)

| # | Object | Type |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Aggregates** | **Universal** — Everyone starts here |
| 2 | **Afflictions** | **Conditional** — Shows up if needed |
| 3 | **Illness** | **Conditional** |
| 4 | **Karmic Stuff** | **Conditional** |
| 5 | **Demonic Interference** | **Conditional** |
| 6 | **Meditative States** | **Conditional** |
| 7 | **Wrong Views** | **Conditional** |
| 8 | **Pride** | **Conditional** |
| 9 | **Two Vehicles** | **Conditional** |
| 10 | **Bodhisattva** | **Conditional** |

**The deal:**
-   Object 1 is the **starting point**. Everyone begins here.
-   Objects 2-10 **might** show up. If they do, you work with them.

> "Master Object 1, you might not need the rest. But if stuff comes up, the right object will present itself."

## Why Start with the Aggregates?

The **five aggregates** (五陰) are:
1.  **Form** (色) — your body
2.  **Feeling** (受) — pleasant, unpleasant, neutral
3.  **Perception** (想) — recognition, labeling
4.  **Formations** (行) — mental impulses, volitions
5.  **Consciousness** (識) — the knowing faculty

### Three Reasons to Start Here

1.  **Always present**: Every moment of experience is made of these five.
2.  **Universal**: Everyone has them. Common ground.
3.  **Complete**: They cover your entire body-mind. Nothing left out.

> "The aggregates are the front door. Walk through and the whole house opens."

## The Method: Ten Modes on the First Object

You take the **First Object** (Aggregates) and apply the **Ten Modes** to it:

| Mode | What You Do |
|---|---|
| 1. Contemplate the Inconceivable | See the aggregates as Empty, Conventional, Middle |
| 2. Generate Bodhi-Mind | Vow to liberate everyone trapped in aggregates |
| 3. Stabilize the Mind | Use calming/contemplation to settle on the aggregates |
| 4. Break Through | Deconstruct all ideas about the aggregates |
| 5. Discern Openness/Obstruction | Know what helps and what hinders |
| 6. Regulate Path-Factors | Apply the 37 Factors |
| 7. Apply Antidotes | Use auxiliary practices if needed |
| 8. Know Your Stage | Understand where you are |
| 9. Develop Patience | Don't quit |
| 10. Let Go of the Dharma | Release attachment to the method |

## The Core Insight: 3,000 in One

When you contemplate the aggregates, the key realization is **一念三千**:

-   In **one moment** of consciousness...
-   There are **ten realms** (hell → Buddha)
-   Each contains **all ten** = 100
-   Each has **ten suchnesses** = 1,000
-   Each in **three domains** = **3,000 worlds**

This is not a metaphor. This is **how reality actually is**.

> "Your ordinary mind right now — this very thought — contains hell, heaven, Buddhahood, and everything in between."

---

## What's in Fascicle 3

1.  **Deep dive** into the five aggregates
2.  **Application** of the Ten Modes to aggregate contemplation
3.  **Troubleshooting** when things go wrong
4.  **Levels** of realization

---

## Luthier's Verdict

-   Fascicle 3 is where you **actually start building**
-   The **First Object** (Aggregates) is where everyone begins
-   The **Ten Modes** are your tools
-   The goal: realize that **one thought contains everything**

Now pick up the tools.
