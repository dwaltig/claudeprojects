## All Ten Objects — The Full Picture

You've been through them all now:

| # | Object | What It Is | Where We Covered It |
|---|--------|------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Aggregates | Body-mind itself | Fascicle 3 |
| 2 | Afflictions | The three poisons and friends | Fascicle 8 |
| 3 | Illness | When the body breaks down | Fascicle 8 |
| 4 | Karma | Past actions surfacing | Fascicle 8 |
| 5 | Māra | External interference | Fascicle 10 |
| 6 | Dhyāna States | Altered states during practice | Fascicle 9 |
| 7 | Wrong Views | Twisted understanding | Fascicle 5 |
| 8 | Pride | "I'm somebody now" | Fascicle 5 |
| 9 | Two Vehicles | Settling for less | Fascicle 5 |
| 10 | Bodhisattva | Good but not complete | Fascicle 5 |

That's the complete territory. Whatever shows up during practice fits somewhere on this map.

## Why These Ten?

### The Logic

Miao-lo explains: These ten exhaust the possibilities.

| Category | Objects | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| **Always Present** | 1. Aggregates | You've got a body-mind. That's the ground. |
| **Inside Jobs** | 2-4. Afflictions, Illness, Karma | These arise from within you |
| **Outside Job** | 5. Māra | This appears to come from outside |
| **Practice-Made** | 6. Dhyāna States | These arise specifically from doing the work |
| **Head Problems** | 7-8. Wrong Views, Pride | Errors in understanding or attitude |
| **Aim Problems** | 9-10. Two Vehicles, Bodhisattva | Incomplete goals |

> "These ten cover everything. The player who knows these ten is ready for anything that walks on stage."

---

## Why This Order?

### Object 1: Body-Mind (Aggregates)

First because it's always present. Before any specific trouble arises, you've already got a body-mind. This is the universal ground.

> "Even when you're sitting peacefully with no disturbance, the aggregates are there. So we start there."

### Objects 2-4: Inside Troubles

Once you establish the work on body-mind, internal disturbances naturally surface:

- **Afflictions**: The poisons stir
- **Illness**: Physical discomfort intensifies
- **Karma**: Past actions manifest as visions, feelings, memories

These are "yours" in the conventional sense.

### Object 5: Outside Trouble

Once the inside stuff settles somewhat, external interference may begin:

- **Māra**: Opposition from outside

This marks the shift from inside work to outside work.

### Object 6: Practice States

As practice deepens, altered states arise:

- **Dhyāna**: Various absorptions, jhānas, samādhis

Not obstacles in themselves—become obstacles through attachment.

### Objects 7-8: Head Problems

With states comes the danger of misinterpretation:

- **Wrong Views**: Misunderstanding what's happening
- **Pride**: Inflating the significance of what you've done

These corrupt genuine progress.

### Objects 9-10: Aim Problems

Finally, even correct understanding can aim at wrong destinations:

- **Two Vehicles**: Settling for personal liberation
- **Bodhisattva**: Advanced but not yet complete

These are the subtlest traps.

## The Horizontal View — All Ten Right Now

Here's the thing: all ten objects are present simultaneously in any moment of experience.

| Object | Present As |
|--------|------------|
| Aggregates | The experience itself |
| Afflictions | Subtle reactive patterns |
| Illness | Physical sensations |
| Karma | Conditioning of perception |
| Māra | Resistance to liberation |
| Dhyāna | Quality of concentration |
| Wrong Views | Interpretive framework |
| Pride | Sense of self-reference |
| Two Vehicles | Habitual goal-orientation |
| Bodhisattva | Aspiration and its limits |

> "In a single moment, all ten are present. The classification into sequence is for teaching. Reality doesn't arise in sequence."

---

## The Vertical View — How They Typically Unfold

In practice, objects tend to arise in order:

```
1. Body-mind (always present)
      ↓
2-4. Inside stuff surfaces
      ↓
5. Outside interference begins
      ↓
6. Altered states develop
      ↓
7-8. Head errors arise
      ↓
9-10. Aim limits encountered
```

This describes typical progression. Your mileage may vary.

## Each Object Contains All Ten

### The Principle

Miao-lo is emphatic:

> "One object contains all ten. Ten objects are one object. This isn't metaphor. This is how it works."

### Example: Body-Mind Containing All Ten

When you're working with the aggregates:

1. **Aggregates**: The aggregates themselves
2. **Afflictions**: Clinging to them
3. **Illness**: The physical aspect
4. **Karma**: Their conditioned nature
5. **Māra**: Aggregates as the basis for the heckler's operation
6. **Dhyāna**: Subtle states within perception
7. **Wrong Views**: Mistaking aggregates for self
8. **Pride**: "My" aggregates
9. **Two Vehicles**: Using aggregate work for personal escape
10. **Bodhisattva**: Seeing aggregates of all beings

### Example: Māra Containing All Ten

When the heckler shows up:

1. **Aggregates**: Māra appears within body-mind experience
2. **Afflictions**: Fear, desire, confusion triggered by māra
3. **Illness**: Physical symptoms from māra interference
4. **Karma**: Māra activating old traces
5. **Māra**: The māra phenomenon itself
6. **Dhyāna**: Māra appearing as false states
7. **Wrong Views**: Māra teaching false doctrine
8. **Pride**: "I defeated māra"
9. **Two Vehicles**: Māra encouraging limited aspiration
10. **Bodhisattva**: Māra appearing as false awakened one

## What This Means for Practice

### The One-Method Approach

Because each object contains all ten, and the Ten Modes apply to any object, you really only need one method:

> "See the inconceivable. Whatever arises is the 3,000 worlds in one thought. Empty, provisional, middle. No need to change methods when the object changes."

This is the simplicity on the far side of complexity.

### The Adaptive Approach

But Miao-lo also makes room for meeting people where they are:

> "For those with sharp roots, one method is enough. For those with dull roots, specific treatments for specific objects may be needed."

That's why the Ten Modes exist: multiple tools for people who can't immediately realize the direct approach.

### Signs You've Got It

How do you know you understand the Ten Objects?

1. **Nothing surprises you**: Whatever arises, you recognize it as one of the ten
2. **No panic**: Even dramatic experiences are met with steadiness
3. **No grasping**: Even blissful states aren't chased
4. **No running**: Even painful states aren't fled
5. **Continuity**: Practice continues regardless of what shows up

## The Ten Objects and the Ten Modes

### How They Relate

| Ten Objects | Ten Modes |
|-------------|-----------|
| What can arise | How to work with what arises |
| The territory | The tools |
| Passive (encountered) | Active (applied) |
| Descriptive | Prescriptive |

> "The Ten Objects describe the field. The Ten Modes describe the work. A farmer has to know both the land and the tools."

### The First Mode as Master Key

While all ten modes can be applied to any object, the first mode—See the Inconceivable Object—is the master key:

> "One who truly realizes the 3,000 worlds in one thought has, in that realization, completed the work of all ten modes. The remaining nine are elaborations for those who haven't yet seen."

---

## Body-Mind as the Primary Object

### Why Start There?

Miao-lo keeps coming back to this:

> "All objects are modifications of body-mind. Afflictions arise within the formations aggregate. Illness arises within the form aggregate. Karma is stored in consciousness. Even māra operates through the aggregates."

Therefore:

> "The player who thoroughly works with body-mind has, in principle, worked with all ten objects. The distinction into ten is for teaching, not for reality."

### The Trap of Chasing Objects

Some practitioners, learning about the ten objects, start looking for them:

- "When will māra appear?"
- "I haven't experienced wrong views yet—am I missing something?"
- "The bodhisattva object sounds advanced—I want that one"

Miao-lo warns:

> "Don't seek the objects. Work with what's present. Body-mind is present now. Start there. What needs to arise will arise."

## The Completion of Correct Practice

### What Chapter Seven Covers

The seventh chapter of the *Mohe Zhiguan*—Correct Practice—covers:

- The ten objects
- The ten modes
- How they relate
- How to apply them

With this section, the treatment of the seventh chapter is essentially complete.

### What's Left

The final three chapters address what happens after correct practice is established:

- **Fruit**: The results that arise
- **Teaching**: How realization leads to teaching others
- **Return**: The ultimate destination

These are treated in Section 3.

---

## The Luthier's Summary

The ten objects are the complete map. Whatever you encounter—internal chaos, external opposition, altered states, head errors, aim limits—the map locates it and the Ten Modes provide the tools.

The deepest teaching: all ten objects are one object, all ten modes are one mode. The apparent complexity resolves into the simplicity of:

> "This very mind is Buddha. This very object is the dharma-realm. Nothing to add, nothing to remove."

## The Luthier's Glossary (Section 2)

### The Ten Objects

| # | Chinese | Luthier's Term |
|---|---------|----------------|
| 1 | 陰入界境 | **Body-Mind** — the ground |
| 2 | 煩惱境 | **The Poisons** — inside job |
| 3 | 病患境 | **The Breakdown** — when body fails |
| 4 | 業相境 | **The Trace** — past actions surfacing |
| 5 | 魔事境 | **The Heckler** — outside opposition |
| 6 | 禪定境 | **The Trip** — altered states |
| 7 | 諸見境 | **The Twist** — wrong understanding |
| 8 | 慢境 | **The Swell** — pride |
| 9 | 二乘境 | **The Shortcut** — settling for less |
| 10 | 菩薩境 | **The Almost** — good but incomplete |

### Key Principles

- **橫論十境** (horizontal integration) → **All Ten Right Now** — simultaneous presence
- **竪論十境** (vertical integration) → **How They Unfold** — typical sequence
- **互攝** (mutual inclusion) → **Each Contains All** — one object = all ten
- **一乘觀法** (one-vehicle method) → **One Method** — the direct approach

### The Summary Teaching

- **一心三觀** (one-mind three views) → **One Look, Three Truths** — the master key
- **即心是佛** (this mind is Buddha) → **Already Home** — nothing to add
