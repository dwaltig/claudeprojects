## Summary of Fascicle 6

### Core Teachings

This fascicle has presented the essential methods for **breaking through thought-delusion** (破思假, *pò sī jiǎ*), the second major category of afflictions that must be eliminated on the path to liberation.

### Key Doctrinal Points

**1. The Nature of Thought-Delusion**

Unlike view-delusion, which can be eliminated suddenly through insight, thought-delusion must be worn away gradually through sustained practice. These are the **three correct poisons** (正三毒):
- Greed (貪)
- Anger (瞋)
- Delusion (癡)

They are termed "correct" because, though still afflictions, they no longer create causes for rebirth in the four evil destinies.

**2. The Structure: Nine Grades Across Three Realms**

The systematic classification into **81 categories** provides a map for practitioners:
- Desire realm: 4 afflictions × 9 grades = 36 categories
- Form realm: 3 afflictions × 9 grades = 27 categories
- Formless realm: 3 afflictions × 9 grades = 18 categories

**3. The Stream-Enterer's Path**

The doctrine of **seven returns** establishes:
- Maximum of seven more rebirths
- Progressive elimination of thought-delusion
- Definite liberation within seven lifetimes

**4. Two Methods of Contemplation**

**Analytical Contemplation** (析觀):
- Breaking down phenomena into components
- Examining causes and conditions
- Suited to those of duller faculties
- Requires sustained, methodical practice

**Substantial Contemplation** (體觀):
- Direct perception of emptiness
- Immediate realization of non-inherent existence
- Suited to those of sharper faculties
- Can achieve realization more swiftly

**5. The Three Provisional Designations**

Applied to each grade of affliction:
- **Cause-and-Effect** (因成假): Understanding how afflictions arise from conditions
- **Continuous** (相續假): Recognizing the stream-like nature of mental states
- **Relative** (相待假): Seeing how all designations are interdependent

**6. The Four Gates**

Four distinct approaches to entering the truth:

**Gate of Existence** (有門):
- Contemplating how all dharmas arise from causes and conditions
- Realizing non-self through understanding interdependence
- Exemplified by the Buddha's first five disciples

**Gate of Emptiness** (空門):
- Contemplating the absence of inherent existence
- Realizing both person-emptiness and dharma-emptiness
- Exemplified by Subhūti's realization

**Gate of Both** (亦有亦空門):
- Recognizing provisional existence and ultimate emptiness
- Avoiding the extremes of reification and nihilism
- Integrating both perspectives

**Gate of Neither** (非有非空門):
- Transcending both existence and non-existence
- Entering the inexpressible truth
- Beyond all conceptual frameworks

### Methodological Principles

**1. The Unity of Diverse Methods**

Though the gates differ, they all lead to the same realization. The principle is one; the approaches are many. This prevents sectarian attachment while honoring diverse capacities.

**2. The Necessity of Skillful Means**

Each method, while effective, can become an obstacle if grasped. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* repeatedly warns against attachment to any particular approach.

**3. Progressive Elimination**

The nine grades represent a gradual process:
- Each grade contains the three provisional designations
- Each must be contemplated and broken through
- The process extends to all afflictions
- Complete elimination results in non-arising (無生)

### Integration with Previous Fascicles

**Building on Fascicle 5**:
- Completed the treatment of the Ten Objects
- Established the foundation for breaking through delusions
- Prepared practitioners for the systematic elimination of afflictions

**Preparing for Fascicle 7**:
- Further refinement of contemplative methods
- Deeper exploration of the Middle Way
- Advanced applications of the principles established here

### Practical Implications

**For Practitioners**:

1. **Recognize the nature of remaining afflictions**: Though view-delusion is broken, thought-delusion persists and must be addressed systematically.

2. **Choose an appropriate method**: Whether analytical or substantial, the method should accord with one's capacity and temperament.

3. **Apply the three provisional designations**: Each affliction must be examined through cause-and-effect, continuity, and relativity.

4. **Work through the grades progressively**: From upper-upper to lower-lower, each grade must be contemplated and eliminated.

5. **Avoid attachment to method**: The gate is a means, not an end. Do not grasp at the approach itself.

### The Path Forward

Having established these methods for breaking through thought-delusion, the practitioner is equipped to:
- Systematically eliminate the 81 categories of affliction
- Progress through the stages of realization
- Ultimately achieve liberation from cyclic existence

The work is gradual, requiring sustained effort over potentially multiple lifetimes. Yet the path is clear, the methods are proven, and the goal is certain.

## Concluding Reflection

Miao-lo's commentary illuminates the practical application of Zhiyi's teachings. By distinguishing methods, clarifying approaches, and providing systematic frameworks, this fascicle serves as an indispensable guide for serious practitioners.

The emphasis on both precision (in the classification of afflictions) and flexibility (in the choice of methods) reflects the Tiantai tradition's characteristic balance of rigor and adaptability.

As we conclude this fascicle, we are reminded that the path to liberation, though demanding, is accessible to all who apply themselves with diligence, wisdom, and skillful means.
