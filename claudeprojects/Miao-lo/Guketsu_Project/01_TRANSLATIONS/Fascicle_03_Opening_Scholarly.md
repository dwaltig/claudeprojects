## Introduction: From Theory to Practice

Fascicle 3 marks the transition from **doctrinal foundation** to **actual practice**. After completing the preparations (25 Conditions), the practitioner now enters **正觀** (*Zheng Guan* — "Correct Contemplation").

The structure of Correct Contemplation consists of:
-   **Ten Objects** (十境 *Shi Jing*) — phenomena that arise during meditation
-   **Ten Modes** (十乘觀法 *Shi Cheng Guan Fa*) — methods applied to each object

Fascicle 3 begins the detailed treatment of the **First Object**: the Aggregates, Bases, and Elements (陰入界).

## The Ten Objects Reviewed

| # | Chinese | English | Nature |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 陰入界 | Aggregates/Bases/Elements | **Universal** — All practitioners start here |
| 2 | 煩惱 | Afflictions | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 3 | 病患 | Illness | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 4 | 業相 | Karmic Impressions | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 5 | 魔事 | Demonic Interference | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 6 | 禪定 | Meditative States | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 7 | 諸見 | Wrong Views | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 8 | 慢 | Pride | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 9 | 二乘 | Two Vehicles | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |
| 10 | 菩薩 | Bodhisattva | **Conditional** — Arises if needed |

### The Logic of the Ten Objects

**Object 1** is the **foundation**. Every practitioner begins by observing their own body-mind (the five aggregates, twelve bases, eighteen elements).

**Objects 2-10** are **developments** that may or may not arise during practice:
-   **Objects 2-5** = Obstacles that hinder practice
-   **Objects 6-10** = Attainments that the practitioner might mistake for the final goal

> "If you master Object 1, you may not need the others. If difficulties arise, the appropriate object will reveal itself."

## Why Start with the Aggregates?

The aggregates (五陰 *wu yin* / *pañca-skandha*) are:
1.  **Form** (色 *rūpa*) — the physical body
2.  **Feeling** (受 *vedanā*) — sensations (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral)
3.  **Perception** (想 *saṃjñā*) — recognition and mental labeling
4.  **Formations** (行 *saṃskāra*) — mental impulses and volitions
5.  **Consciousness** (識 *vijñāna*) — the knowing faculty

### Three Reasons

1.  **Accessibility**: The aggregates are always present. Every moment of experience consists of these five.
2.  **Universality**: All beings have aggregates. This is common ground for all practitioners.
3.  **Comprehensiveness**: The aggregates encompass the entire body-mind. To contemplate them is to contemplate the totality of one's existence.

> "The aggregates are the doorway. Once you pass through, the entire Dharma-realm opens."

## The Method: Ten Modes Applied to the First Object

For the First Object (Aggregates), the practitioner applies all **Ten Modes** sequentially:

| Mode | Application to Aggregates |
|---|---|
| 1. Contemplate the Inconceivable | See the aggregates as the Three Truths |
| 2. Generate Bodhi-Mind | Vow to liberate all beings trapped in aggregates |
| 3. Stabilize the Mind | Use止觀 to settle on the aggregates |
| 4. Break Through | Deconstruct all views about the aggregates |
| 5. Discern Openness/Obstruction | Know what aids/hinders aggregate contemplation |
| 6. Regulate Path-Factors | Apply the 37 Factors to aggregate contemplation |
| 7. Apply Antidotes | Use auxiliary practices if needed |
| 8. Know the Stages | Understand one's level of realization |
| 9. Develop Patience | Endure difficulties without retreating |
| 10. Release Dharma-Attachment | Let go of clinging to the method itself |

## The Core Insight: One Thought Contains All

When contemplating the aggregates, the key realization is **一念三千** (*yi nian san qian* — "Three Thousand Worlds in One Thought-Moment"):

-   In **one moment** of the aggregate consciousness (識陰)...
-   There are **ten dharma-realms** (from hell to Buddha)
-   Each realm contains **all ten** = 100 realms
-   Each has **ten suchnesses** = 1,000
-   Each in **three domains** (aggregates, beings, lands) = **3,000 worlds**

This is not a metaphor. This is the **actual structure of reality** as seen through contemplation.

> "Your ordinary mind right now — this very moment of seeing, hearing, thinking — contains hell, heaven, Buddhahood, and everything in between."

## What Comes Next in Fascicle 3

The remainder of Fascicle 3 provides:
1.  **Detailed analysis** of the five aggregates as objects of contemplation
2.  **Application of the Ten Modes** to aggregate contemplation
3.  **Resolution of difficulties** that arise during practice
4.  **Distinctions** between different levels of realization

---

## Summary

-   Fascicle 3 begins the **actual practice** of Correct Contemplation
-   The **First Object** (Aggregates) is the universal starting point
-   The **Ten Modes** are applied systematically to this object
-   The goal is to realize **一念三千** — that one thought contains all worlds
