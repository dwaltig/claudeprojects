## 1. The Question

Miao-lo raises a critical question:

> "The teaching is called *Zhiguan*. But what *kind* of Zhiguan?"

This is not a trivial distinction. The Tiantai school recognizes **three kinds of Zhiguan**, and they differ fundamentally in *how* they relate Ultimate Reality to the practice.

## 2. The Three Kinds

| # | Name (Chinese) | Name (English) | Analogy | Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **漸次止觀** (*Jian Ci Zhi Guan*) | **Gradual Zhiguan** | Climbing a ladder, rung by rung | *Ci Di Chan Men* (次第禪門) |
| 2 | **不定止觀** (*Bu Ding Zhi Guan*) | **Indeterminate Zhiguan** | A diamond that changes color depending on where you place it | *Liu Miao Men* (六妙門) |
| 3 | **圓頓止觀** (*Yuan Dun Zhi Guan*) | **Perfectly Sudden Zhiguan** | The sky—equally present everywhere at once | *Mohe Zhiguan* (摩訶止觀) |

## 3. Detailed Explanation

### 3.1 Gradual Zhiguan (*Jian Ci*)

**Text**: *Ci Di Chan Men* (次第禪門 / "Sequential Dhyāna Gates")

**Principle**:
- The practitioner moves **step by step** through stages.
- First: moral restraint (*śīla*).
- Second: dhyāna (*ding* 定).
- Third: wisdom (*prajñā*).
- Each stage must be completed before the next can be entered.

**Analogy**: Miao-lo compares this to climbing a ladder (*ti deng* 梯磴):
> "One rung at a time. Do not skip."

**Doctrinal Basis**: This approach corresponds to the **生滅四諦** (Four Noble Truths of arising and ceasing) and the **界內道品** (Path-factors within the Three Realms).

**Criticism**: While valid, this approach is "long and winding" (*yu* 紆). It takes aeons. It is the "slow boat."

---

### 3.2 Indeterminate Zhiguan (*Bu Ding*)

**Text**: *Liu Miao Men* (六妙門 / "Six Subtle Gates")

**Principle**:
- The practitioner does *not* follow a fixed sequence.
- Depending on the arising of conditions (*yuan* 緣), one may enter at any gate.
- Sometimes the practice is shallow, sometimes deep.
- Sometimes one *leaps* forward; sometimes one *falls* back.

**Analogy**: Miao-lo compares this to a **diamond** (*jingang bao* 金剛寶) or a **maṇi-jewel** (*ruyi zhu* 如意珠):
> "Placed in sunlight, its color changes. Placed on different surfaces, it reflects different hues. The practitioner's experience changes according to conditions."

**Doctrinal Basis**: This approach corresponds to the **不定教** (Indeterminate Teaching) within the Eight Teachings. One may receive a "gradual" teaching but have a "sudden" realization, or vice versa.

**Criticism**: More flexible than the Gradual, but still not the highest. The practitioner may "zigzag" rather than proceeding directly.

---

### 3.3 Perfectly Sudden Zhiguan (*Yuan Dun*)

**Text**: *Mohe Zhiguan* (摩訶止觀 / "Great Calming and Contemplation")

**Principle**:
- From the very first moment of practice, the practitioner contemplates **Ultimate Reality** directly.
- There is no preliminary stage. No "building up."
- The entire path is present in every moment.
- The initial aspiration is identical in *nature* (though not in *degree*) to final Buddhahood.

**Analogy**: Miao-lo compares this to **the sky** (*xu kong* 虛空) or to **flight** (*tong zhe teng kong* 通者騰空):
> "One who has supernatural powers rises into the sky. The ground near the feet and the space ten thousand fathoms high are *the same sky*. There is no 'higher' or 'lower' in empty space."

**Doctrinal Basis**: This approach corresponds to the **無作四諦** (Four Noble Truths of No-Arising), the **圓教** (Perfect Teaching), and the **一心三觀** (Threefold Contemplation in One Mind).

---

## 4. The Relationship Among the Three

Miao-lo clarifies:

| Aspect | Gradual | Indeterminate | Perfect/Sudden |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sequence** | Fixed | Variable | None |
| **Time Required** | Long | Medium | Instantaneous (in principle) |
| **Object of Contemplation** | Progressive (界內→界外) | Flexible | Ultimate Reality from the start |
| **Corresponds to** | Tripiṭaka / Shared Teaching | No fixed assignment | Perfect Teaching only |

> "All three contemplate the same Ultimate Reality (*Shi Xiang* 實相). But the Gradual approaches it step by step. The Indeterminate approaches it according to conditions. The Perfectly Sudden *is* it from the first moment."

---

## 5. Why This Matters

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is a text of the **Perfectly Sudden Zhiguan**. It does not teach a preliminary path that later becomes ultimate. It teaches the ultimate path *as* the preliminary.

> "The ground on which you stand is already the Pure Land. The mind with which you practice is already the Buddha-mind. The realization you seek is already your original nature."

This is the meaning of **圓頓** (*Yuan Dun*):
- **圓** (*Yuan*): Complete, whole, lacking nothing.
- **頓** (*Dun*): Sudden, immediate, not gradual.

## Summary

The Three Kinds of Zhiguan are:
1.  **Gradual**: Step-by-step. Long. Like climbing a ladder.
2.  **Indeterminate**: Flexible. Like a diamond changing colors.
3.  **Perfectly Sudden**: Immediate. Like the sky—everywhere at once.

The *Mohe Zhiguan* (and thus the *Guketsu*) is devoted to the **third**. This is the "Great Calming and Contemplation" of the title.
