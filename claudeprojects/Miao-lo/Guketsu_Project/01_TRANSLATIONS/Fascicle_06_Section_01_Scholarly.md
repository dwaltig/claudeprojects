## Methods of Contemplation: Analytical and Substantial

### The Two Approaches

In contemplating thought-delusion, there are two fundamental methods:

1. **Analytical Contemplation** (析觀, *xī guān*)
2. **Substantial Contemplation** (體觀, *tǐ guān*)

Both methods aim at the same goal — the elimination of thought-delusion and entry into emptiness. However, they differ in approach and are suited to different capacities.

### Why Distinguish These Methods?

The text states: "**Space encompasses both analytical and substantial methods, therefore both must be indicated**" (空兼析體故須標列).

This means:
- The realization of emptiness can be approached through either method
- Both are valid paths within the Hīnayāna tradition
- The distinction helps practitioners choose the appropriate method for their capacity

The same distinction applies to breaking through view-delusion. Now, in the context of the Mahāyāna (*yǎn mén*, 衍門), we revisit this distinction to clarify the proper use of analytical contemplation.

## Analytical Contemplation in Context

### The Nature of Analytical Method

The text states: "**In explaining the proper contemplative method, we again clarify the analytical approach**" (正明觀法中初標).

**Key point**: The analytical method, from beginning to end, operates through analysis (*xī*, 析). This distinguishes it from the substantial method.

**Purpose of this discussion**: Not to advocate for the analytical method as the primary approach, but to:
1. Distinguish it clearly from the substantial method
2. Show its limitations compared to the Mahāyāna approach
3. Demonstrate why it is not the main practice (*fēi zhèng yòng yě*, 非正用也)

### Contemplating Desire-Realm Delusions

**Initial framework**: We begin with the delusions of the desire realm, specifically examining one grade of thought-delusion and its three aspects (*sān jiǎ*, 三假):

#### 1. Cause-and-Effect Provisional Designation (因成假)

**External conditions**: The text references the **six objects of desire** (六欲境):

These six objects, as explained in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* (大論, *Dà Lùn*), Volume 21, represent different aspects of sensory attraction:

1. **Color/Appearance** (色) — attraction to physical beauty
2. **Form/Figure** (形容) — attraction to bodily shape and movement
3. **Demeanor** (威儀) — attraction to graceful conduct
4. **Speech** (言語) — attraction to pleasant voice and words
5. **Smoothness** (細滑) — attraction to tactile sensation
6. **Human Form** (人相) — attraction to the general human appearance

**The contemplative analysis**:

When these six external objects meet the internal faculty of mind (*yì gēn*, 意根), they produce:
- **Cause**: The external object
- **Condition**: The internal faculty
- **Effect**: The arising desire (*suǒ shēng fǎ*, 所生法)

This arising desire is what we call the **desire-thought** (欲想). It is a provisional designation based on causes and conditions.

**The six objects in detail** (from *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*, Vol. 21):

The treatise explains that practitioners may be attached to different aspects:

1. Some are染著 (attached) to **color** — blue, yellow, red, white
2. Some, though not attached to color, are attached to **form** — delicate skin, slender fingers, beautiful eyes, arched eyebrows
3. Some are not attached to form but to **demeanor** — walking, standing, sitting, lying down; bowing, looking, extending and contracting limbs; raising eyebrows, glancing; approaching, touching
4. Some are attached to **speech** — soft, skillful words that accord with one's wishes
5. Some are attached to **smoothness** — soft flesh, warm in winter, cool in summer
6. Some are attached to the general **human form** — simply the fact of being male or female

**Treatment**: The **nine contemplations** (九想) are prescribed to counter these six desires. (Details in the Meditation Manual, *Chán Mén*, 禪門)

**Manifestation of desire**:

When these six objects trigger internal responses, the **desire-mark** (貪相) manifests externally. This is the arising of desire based on the six objects meeting the mind-faculty.

**Comparison with attainment**:

Even a **Stream-Enterer** (初果, *chūguǒ*) still has these desires arise, though they are transformed. How much more so for ordinary practitioners!

Even an **Arhat** (無學, *wúxué*) may have residual desire-habits (*xí*, 習), as exemplified by **Nanda** (難陀), whose desire-habits were so strong they manifested even after attaining Arhatship.

**Scriptural reference**: The *Lotus Sūtra* teaches that one should not even give rise to **desire-thought** (欲想), let alone engage in physical union. The text further distinguishes **desire-marks** (欲相) from desire-thought.

**The six desire-marks** (according to the *Abhidharmakośa*, 俱舍):

Different realm-beings experience desire differently:

1. **Earth-dwelling beings** (地居, *dì jū*) — physical union
2. **Trāyastriṃśa Heaven** (忉利天) — embracing
3. **Yāma Heaven** (夜摩天) — holding hands  
4. **Tuṣita Heaven** (兜率天) — gazing and smiling
5. **Nirmāṇarati Heaven** (化樂天) — just gazing
6. **Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven** (他化天) — just looking

The teaching is: One should not even give rise to the thought, let alone engage in the looking, smiling, or physical contact.

**Additional context** (*Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra*, 婆沙):

The four continents also differ in desire:

- **Jambudvīpa** (this continent): Countless acts of desire
- **Pūrvavideha** (Eastern continent): Up to 12 times, down to 10
- **Aparagodānīya** (Western continent): Many as 7-8, few as 4-5  
- **Uttarakuru** (Northern continent): Up to 5, down to 3-4; some practice celibacy

Thus, those with excessive desire are worse than animals. Yet this continent also has those with little desire, even practicing pure conduct (*fàn xíng*, 梵行).

**The range of desire**: From the grossest (more than animals) to the subtlest (celibate practice), desire manifests in countless gradations.

#### Applying Contemplation to Cause-and-Effect

**The method**: "**If one grasps at the six marks and allows the mind to move internally, this is the arising of the provisional**" (若取前六相內動意根即是所生).

When desire arises based on these conditions, one applies contemplation:

**The fourfold analysis**:

1. Does desire arise from the **external object** alone?
2. Does it arise from the **internal faculty** alone?
3. Does it arise from **both together**?
4. Does it arise from **neither** (without cause)?

**Result of analysis**:

Through this fourfold examination, one discovers:
- No inherent **nature of desire** (欲性) can be found
- The **four propositions** (四句) are empty
- This is **emptiness of inherent nature** (性空)
- This is **emptiness of characteristics** (相空)

**For sharp faculties**: After breaking through the four propositions regarding existence, they immediately attain realization. This is the **direct path** (利根二行).

**For dull faculties**: If realization does not occur, they must employ the **sixty-four examinations** (六十四番). This involves examining each of the four propositions through sixteen perspectives, totaling sixty-four analytical approaches.

#### 2. Continuous Provisional Designation (相續假)

**The principle**: The *Vinaya* states, "**One should prevent continuous desire from leading to action**" (制內相續).

This means:
- Preventing the continuity of desire
- Not allowing desire to develop into physical action
- Recognizing that even continuous thought, without action, must be contemplated

**Contemplative approach**: Similar to the cause-and-effect analysis, one examines the continuous arising of desire through the fourfold analysis, discovering its emptiness.

#### 3. Relative Provisional Designation (相待假)

**The principle**: Understanding that all designations are relative and lack inherent reality.

**Example contemplations**:
- Desire is designated in relation to non-desire
- Purity is designated in relation to impurity  
- These are merely conceptual constructs

**Result**: Through examining the relative nature of all designations, one realizes:
- **Emptiness of inherent nature** (性空)
- **Emptiness of characteristics** (相空)

## Gradual Elimination Through the Nine Grades

**The process**: 

"**The first grade also has three provisional designations. The remaining grades should be understood by analogy**" (初品下明餘品亦有三假).

Each of the nine grades of desire-realm thought-delusion contains these three provisional designations. By contemplating each grade through these three aspects, one progressively eliminates thought-delusion.

**Extension to other afflictions**:

"**Breaking through greed, the other afflictions follow the same pattern**" (破貪下餘使亦例).

The same contemplative method applies to:
- Anger (瞋)
- Delusion (癡)  
- Pride (慢)

**Completion**: 

"**Through the nine grades, one achieves the breaking through of non-arising**" (九品下結成無生破遍也).

When all nine grades of all afflictions are broken through, one achieves:
- **Non-arising** (無生) — the cessation of rebirth
- **Complete breaking through** (破遍) — thorough elimination
