## Introduction: The Subtle Danger of Attainment

The **Meditative States Object** (禪定境 *Chan Ding Jing*) arises when the practitioner attains **dhyāna** (禪定) or other meditative absorptions. This is paradoxically both an achievement and a potential obstacle.

Miao-lo warns:
> "Dhyāna is like honey on the razor's edge. Sweet, but dangerous if you linger. The practitioner must recognize dhyāna as a milestone, not the destination."

---

## The Four Dhyānas (四禪)

### First Dhyāna (初禪)

**Characteristics**:
-   Joy and bliss (喜樂) arising from seclusion
-   Thought and examination (尋伺) still present
-   Five factors: Thought, examination, joy, bliss, one-pointedness

**Experience**:
-   Deep peace and happiness
-   Clarity of mind
-   Physical lightness

**Danger**:
-   Attachment to pleasant states
-   Mistaking concentration for wisdom
-   Desire to remain in this state

**Contemplation**:
> "See the first dhyāna as empty, conventional, and middle. It is a conditioned state, not ultimate reality."

---

### Second Dhyāna (二禪)

**Characteristics**:
-   Joy and bliss arising from concentration
-   Thought and examination cease
-   Three factors: Joy, bliss, one-pointedness

**Experience**:
-   Deeper peace than first dhyāna
-   Internal clarity (內淨)
-   Unified mind

**Danger**:
-   Stronger attachment to bliss
-   Pride in attainment
-   Belief that this is liberation

**Contemplation**:
> "The second dhyāna is more subtle than the first, but still conditioned. Do not mistake depth for completeness."

---

### Third Dhyāna (三禪)

**Characteristics**:
-   Equanimity and subtle bliss
-   Joy ceases, only bliss remains
-   Mindfulness and clear comprehension

**Experience**:
-   Profound peace
-   Subtle happiness
-   Refined awareness

**Danger**:
-   Attachment to subtle bliss
-   Belief in having transcended afflictions
-   Stagnation in practice

**Contemplation**:
> "The third dhyāna is the most blissful of all states. This is precisely why it is the most dangerous. Bliss is still a conditioned phenomenon."

---

### Fourth Dhyāna (四禪)

**Characteristics**:
-   Pure equanimity
-   Neither pleasure nor pain
-   Perfect mindfulness and clarity

**Experience**:
-   Complete mental stability
-   Profound equanimity
-   Clear, bright awareness

**Danger**:
-   Attachment to equanimity
-   Mistaking equanimity for wisdom
-   Belief in having attained the goal

**Contemplation**:
> "The fourth dhyāna is the pinnacle of concentration. But concentration is not wisdom. Dhyāna must be united with prajñā."

---

## The Four Formless Absorptions (四無色定)

Beyond the four dhyānas are four formless absorptions:

| Absorption | Chinese | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| **Infinite Space** | 空無邊處 | Boundless space |
| **Infinite Consciousness** | 識無邊處 | Boundless consciousness |
| **Nothingness** | 無所有處 | Nothingness |
| **Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception** | 非想非非想處 | Extremely subtle state |

**The danger**: These are even more subtle than the dhyānas and thus even more seductive. Practitioners can remain in these states for eons without progressing toward liberation.

---

## Distinguishing Dhyāna from Prajñā

| Aspect | Dhyāna (Concentration) | Prajñā (Wisdom) |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | Stability, one-pointedness | Insight, understanding |
| **Function** | Calms the mind | Sees the truth |
| **Result** | Peace, bliss | Liberation |
| **Danger** | Attachment to states | Attachment to views |
| **Alone** | Leads to rebirth in form/formless realms | Leads to dry wisdom |
| **Together** | The Perfect Path | — |

**Miao-lo's teaching**:
> "Dhyāna without prajñā is blindness. Prajñā without dhyāna is instability. The Perfect Teaching unites both in every moment."

---

## Applying the Ten Modes to Meditative States

### Mode 1: Contemplate the Inconceivable

**See dhyāna as the Three Truths**:
-   **Empty**: The meditative state has no inherent existence
-   **Conventional**: It arises from causes and conditions
-   **Middle**: It is neither existent nor non-existent

### Mode 2: Generate Bodhi-Mind

**Transform the experience**:
-   "I vow to help all beings attain this peace"
-   "I vow to guide all beings beyond attachment to peace"

### Mode 10: Release Dharma-Attachment

**The critical mode for this object**:
-   Recognize the attainment
-   Appreciate it without clinging
-   Continue toward complete realization
-   Let go of even the letting go

> "When you release attachment to dhyāna, dhyāna becomes a tool rather than a trap."

---

## Integration: Making Practice Spontaneous

The final theme of Fascicle 4 is **integration** (融通 *Rong Tong*)—making the Ten Modes spontaneous rather than deliberate.

### Three Stages of Integration

| Stage | Practice | Characteristic |
|---|---|---|
| **Deliberate** | Consciously applying modes | Effort required |
| **Natural** | Modes arise spontaneously | Effortless |
| **Complete** | No distinction between practice and non-practice | Constant contemplation |

---

### From Technique to Nature

**Deliberate stage** (初學):
-   "I will now apply Mode 1"
-   "I will now generate Bodhi-Mind"
-   Conscious effort

**Natural stage** (純熟):
-   Modes arise without deliberation
-   Like a skilled musician playing naturally
-   Effort becomes effortless

**Complete stage** (究竟):
-   Every moment is contemplation
-   Every action is the path
-   No separation between practice and life

---

### The Integration of Zhi and Guan

**Beginning practice**:
-   Zhi and Guan are practiced separately
-   "Now I calm" / "Now I contemplate"

**Intermediate practice**:
-   Zhi and Guan alternate smoothly
-   Balance is maintained

**Advanced practice**:
-   Zhi and Guan are simultaneous
-   Calming IS contemplating
-   Contemplating IS calming

**Perfect integration**:
> "When Zhi and Guan are fully integrated, there is no longer 'calming' and 'contemplating.' There is only the mind resting in its true nature, which is both still and clear."

---

## Signs of Integration

| Sign | Manifestation |
|---|---|
| **Effortlessness** | Practice feels natural, not forced |
| **Continuity** | Contemplation continues in all activities |
| **Flexibility** | Appropriate response arises spontaneously |
| **Stability** | Mind remains clear in all circumstances |
| **Compassion** | Bodhi-Mind is constant, not cultivated |

## The Practitioner's Journey Through Fascicle 4

| Section | Object | Key Learning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Afflictions | Afflictions are Buddha-nature |
| 2 | Illness/Karma/Māra | External obstacles are teachers |
| 3 | Meditative States | Attainments can be traps |
| 3 | Integration | Make practice spontaneous |

---

## Miao-lo's Final Teaching for Fascicle 4

> "The advanced practitioner does not seek objects. Does not avoid objects. When objects arise, they are recognized and worked with. When objects are absent, there is no sense of loss. This is the meaning of integration."

> "The difference between beginning and advanced practice is not in the method but in the depth. The beginner applies the modes deliberately. The advanced practitioner embodies them naturally. The master has forgotten both practice and non-practice."

---

## Summary

Fascicle 4 completes the treatment of conditional objects and introduces integration:

**Objects covered**:
-   Afflictions (6 root + 20 secondary)
-   Illness (4 types)
-   Karmic Impressions
-   Demonic Interference (4 types of Māra)
-   Meditative States (4 dhyānas + 4 formless absorptions)

**Key insights**:
-   All objects are Buddha-nature
-   Obstacles are teachers
-   Attainments can be traps
-   Practice must become spontaneous

**The path forward**:
-   Fascicles 5-10 will cover the remaining objects (Wrong Views, Pride, Two Vehicles, Bodhisattva) and the ultimate fruit of practice
