## Opening Moan

A name gets stood up for living beings.
Not because the Real needs naming,
but because we do.

"Zhiguan" is one of those names:
a loving trick,
a raft-word,
a mercy-word for crossing.

---

## Gate One: Relative (相待)

Relative means this leans on that.
Long leans on short.
Big leans on small.

So with Zhi and Guan.
In this gate they stand facing each other,
and each gets spoken by contrast.

This is teaching-work,
still in the coarse register,
still medicine for beings who need distinction.

---

## Gate Two: Absolute (絕待)

Then the blade falls.
Horizontal comparisons: cut.
Vertical comparisons: cut.

If all naming by opposition is cut,
what remains is not a second thing.
What remains is not a concept to hold.

Stopping cannot be seized.
Contemplating cannot be seized.
Even "stopping-and-contemplating" cannot be seized.

That is why this gate is called wondrous.

---

## Gate Three: Meeting the Different Names (會異)

Scriptures speak with many mouths,
but the virtue is one body.

What sounds like wisdom-language
is the contemplation side.
What sounds like liberation-language
is the stopping side.

What sounds like non-dual space
is the body where both are one.

Many names,
one Real-Mark.

---

## Gate Four: Penetrating the Three Virtues (通三德)

At first resolve,
one contemplates nirvana for oneself,
and also leads beings toward it.

At later resolve,
one enters what one contemplated.

From first stirring to final settling,
this road is one road:
contemplate the three virtues,
enter the three virtues.

Split the two words and power thins.
Join them in one meaning and all three virtues stand present.

---

## Closing Word

Name is mercy-language.
Relative is medicine-language.
Absolute is no-grasp language.
Meeting-differences is harmonizing language.
Penetrating-three-virtues is arrival language.

One song, many verses.
One dharma, many names.
