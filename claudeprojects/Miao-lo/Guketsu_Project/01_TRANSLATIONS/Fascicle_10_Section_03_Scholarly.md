## The Structure of the Mohe Zhiguan

The *Mohe Zhiguan* consists of ten chapters:

| # | Chinese | English | Status |
|---|---------|---------|--------|
| 1 | 大意 | Grand Outline | Covered (F1) |
| 2 | 釋名 | Explanation of Name | Covered (F2) |
| 3 | 顯體 | Revealing Essence | Covered (F2) |
| 4 | 攝法 | Embracing Dharmas | Covered (F2) |
| 5 | 偏圓 | Partial vs. Complete | Covered (F2) |
| 6 | 方便 | Skillful Means | Covered (F2) |
| 7 | 正觀 | Correct Contemplation | Covered (F3-F10) |
| 8 | 果報 | Fruit and Result | This section |
| 9 | 起教 | Arising of Teaching | This section |
| 10 | 旨歸 | Ultimate Return | This section |

The seventh chapter on Correct Contemplation occupied the vast majority of Zhiyi's teaching and Miao-lo's commentary. The final three chapters, while important, are treated more briefly because they describe what happens after the essential work is done.

## Chapter 8: Fruit and Result (果報)

### The Question

What are the fruits of correct contemplation? What results from applying the Ten Modes to the Ten Objects?

### The Two Types of Fruit

Miao-lo, following Zhiyi, distinguishes:

**1. Causal Fruit (因果)**

Results that arise during practice:

| Stage | Fruit | Characteristics |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **Name Identity** (名字即) | Initial understanding | Intellectual grasp of the teaching |
| **Contemplation Identity** (觀行即) | Glimpses | Moments of seeing the Three Truths |
| **Resemblance Identity** (相似即) | Stability | Consistent realization in meditation |
| **Partial Realization** (分真即) | Breakthrough | Actual elimination of ignorance |
| **Ultimate Identity** (究竟即) | Completion | Full Buddhahood |

**2. Fruit Proper (果報)**

The final result:

> "The fruit of correct contemplation is the three bodies of Buddha: Dharma-body (法身), Reward-body (報身), and Transformation-body (化身). These are not three separate things but one reality viewed from different angles."

### The Three Bodies as Fruit

| Body | Sanskrit | Fruit Of | Manifestation |
|------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Dharma-body** | *Dharmakāya* | Wisdom realizing emptiness | Universal truth-nature |
| **Reward-body** | *Saṃbhogakāya* | Wisdom realizing provisional | Buddha's glorified form in pure lands |
| **Transformation-body** | *Nirmāṇakāya* | Wisdom realizing middle | Buddha appearing in the world to teach |

### The Relationship to Practice

Miao-lo clarifies:

> "The three bodies are not attained from outside. They are the inherent nature of mind, revealed through practice. Contemplation does not create Buddha-nature; it removes what obscures Buddha-nature."

This echoes the teaching from Fascicle 7 on "removing the film, nurturing the pearl" (除膜養珠).

### Caution Regarding Fruit

Zhiyi warned against preoccupation with results:

> "If you practice for the sake of attaining fruit, you will not attain fruit. Fruit arises naturally when conditions are complete. The practitioner's job is to create the conditions, not to grasp at results."

## Chapter 9: Arising of Teaching (起教)

### The Question

Once realization is attained, how does teaching arise? What enables the Buddha to teach in ways that benefit different beings?

### The Logic of Teaching

Teaching arises from three factors:

**1. Wisdom (智)**

The Buddha's wisdom sees:
- The nature of reality (dharma)
- The capacities of beings (根機)
- The appropriate means for each (方便)

**2. Compassion (悲)**

Wisdom without compassion would not result in teaching. The Buddha teaches because beings suffer and teaching can end suffering.

**3. Skillful Means (方便)**

Wisdom and compassion require appropriate expression. The Buddha adapts teaching to circumstance.

### The Four Siddhāntas Revisited

The teaching arises through four modes, as discussed in the early fascicles:

| Siddhānta | Sanskrit | Function | Example |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Worldly** (世界悉檀) | *Laukika* | Meet beings where they are | Using local language, customs |
| **Individual** (各各為人悉檀) | *Prātipauruṣika* | Address specific needs | Teaching generosity to the stingy |
| **Therapeutic** (對治悉檀) | *Prātipākṣika* | Cure specific ills | Teaching impermanence to the attached |
| **Supreme** (第一義悉檀) | *Paramārtha* | Reveal ultimate truth | Teaching the Three Truths |

### From Realization to Expression

Miao-lo traces the movement:

```
Realization (inner)
      ↓
Compassion arises (response to suffering)
      ↓
Wisdom discerns (what is needed)
      ↓
Teaching emerges (appropriate expression)
```

> "The Buddha does not deliberate: 'What shall I teach?' Teaching arises spontaneously from the conjunction of realization, compassion, and circumstance. It is like a bell that sounds when struck—the sound is appropriate to the strike."

### The Practitioner's Responsibility

What does this mean for the practitioner?

1. **First, realize**: Teaching without realization is empty words
2. **Develop compassion**: Realization without compassion is incomplete
3. **Trust emergence**: The appropriate teaching will arise naturally
4. **Stay humble**: Even after teaching, continue to practice

## Chapter 10: Ultimate Return (旨歸)

### The Question

Where does the path lead? What is the final destination?

### The Three Destinations

Depending on the teaching followed:

| Path | Destination | Characteristics |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Tripiṭaka** | Arhat | Personal liberation from saṃsāra |
| **Shared** | Bodhisattva (initial) | Liberation plus aspiration |
| **Distinct** | Buddha (sequential) | Full realization through stages |
| **Perfect** | Buddha (immediate) | Full realization here and now |

### The Tiantai Teaching on Ultimate Return

The ultimate return is to:

> "Return to the origin (歸源). But the origin was never left. The 'return' is the recognition that there was never any departure."

This is expressed in the famous formula:

> "即心是佛" — "This very mind is Buddha."

### The Three Truths as Return

| Truth | Return |
|-------|--------|
| **Emptiness** (空) | Return to the unborn nature of phenomena |
| **Provisional** (假) | Return to the functional manifestation |
| **Middle** (中) | Return to the non-dual identity of emptiness and provisional |

> "The ultimate return is not to a place. It is to the nature that was always present. Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not two places. Liberation is seeing through the illusion of separation."

### The Practical Meaning

What does "ultimate return" mean in practice?

1. **Continue practicing**: Even the Buddha continued to sit
2. **Teach as appropriate**: Realization naturally expresses itself
3. **Remain humble**: "Ultimate" does not mean "finished"
4. **Benefit beings**: The return is not solitary

## The Completion of the Commentary

### What Has Been Accomplished

Across ten fascicles, Miao-lo has:

1. Established the lineage and context (F1)
2. Explained the structure and methodology (F2)
3. Detailed the practice (F3-F10)
4. Addressed all ten objects
5. Explained all ten modes
6. Integrated the whole into Tiantai understanding

### What Remains for the Practitioner

The commentary points the way. The practitioner must walk:

> "Reading the map is not the journey. Understanding the tools is not using them. The commentary has done what commentary can do. Now practice."

---

## The Final Teaching

### From Miao-lo

> "This commentary is called 'Transmitting the Expansive Explanation' (傳弘決). 'Transmitting' because it passes on what Zhiyi taught. 'Expansive' because it opens what was condensed. 'Explanation' because it clarifies what was obscure."

> "But the ultimate transmission is not in words. It is from mind to mind. The reader who understands not just the letter but the spirit has received the transmission."

### From Zhiyi (as preserved by Miao-lo)

> "All Buddha's teaching aims at one thing: ending suffering. The *Mohe Zhiguan* is one expression of this aim. The Ten Objects and Ten Modes are tools for this work. Do not mistake the tools for the goal."

> "The goal is simple: See the nature of mind. Everything else serves this seeing."

---

## Summary

The final three chapters of the *Mohe Zhiguan* address what happens after the essential practice is established:

1. **Fruit**: The results of practice—the three bodies of Buddha
2. **Teaching**: How realization naturally expresses itself in teaching
3. **Return**: The ultimate destination, which is the origin, which was never left

These chapters are brief not because they are unimportant but because they describe what happens naturally when practice is correct. The practitioner's work is in the seventh chapter—Correct Contemplation. When that is complete, fruit, teaching, and return arise without additional effort.
