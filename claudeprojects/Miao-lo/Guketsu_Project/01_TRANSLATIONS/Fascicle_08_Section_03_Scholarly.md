## Object 4: The Karma Object (業境)

### I. Introduction: Karma as Contemplative Phenomenon

The fourth of the Ten Objects addresses karma (業) that arises during contemplation. Unlike the Affliction Object (mental disturbance) and Illness Object (physical condition), the Karma Object concerns the manifestation of past actions as visions, signs, and obstacles during meditation.

> 次明業境。業是過去所造。今因禪觀而發。

"Next, we clarify the karma object. Karma is what was created in the past. Now, because of meditative contemplation, it arises."

Miao-lo identifies a distinctive phenomenon: intensive practice can accelerate the manifestation of latent karma, causing past actions to appear as present experiences during meditation.

### II. The Nature of Karmic Manifestation

#### A. How Karma Arises During Practice

> 由觀行力故。宿世惡業忽然現前。

"Due to the power of contemplative practice, evil karma from past lives suddenly manifests in the present."

This occurs through several mechanisms:

1. **Contemplative acceleration**: Deep practice speeds karmic ripening
2. **Mental purification**: As obscurations thin, latent karma becomes visible
3. **Karmic pressure**: Accumulated karma seeks expression

> 如風吹土。塵埃忽起。非風造塵。塵本在土。

"Like wind blowing earth, dust suddenly rises. The wind does not create the dust; the dust was already in the earth."

Miao-lo's metaphor clarifies that practice does not create karma but reveals what was already present.

#### B. Forms of Karmic Manifestation

Karma manifests in several ways during meditation:

| Manifestation | Chinese | Description |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Visions | 見業相 | Past actions appear as mental images |
| Physical sensations | 身業發 | Bodily symptoms tied to past karma |
| Emotional surges | 心業發 | Sudden waves of guilt, fear, or remorse |
| Dream signs | 夢中業相 | Karmic content in dreams |

### III. The Classification of Karmic Signs (業相)

Miao-lo systematizes the signs that indicate karmic manifestation:

#### A. Signs of Unwholesome Karma (不善業相)

> 若見地獄餓鬼畜生等相。當知是過去不善業發。

"If one sees signs of hell, hungry ghosts, or animals, know that this is past unwholesome karma arising."

| Vision | Indicates | Past Cause |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Hell realms | Heavy negative karma | Killing, hatred |
| Hungry ghost realms | Moderate negative karma | Greed, stinginess |
| Animal realms | Delusion-based karma | Ignorance, stupidity |
| Asura realms | Contentious karma | Jealousy, fighting |

This corresponds to the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s teaching on visualizing karmic results—specific past actions manifest as "grotesque forms" during contemplation.

#### B. Signs of Wholesome Karma (善業相)

> 若見天宮人道淨土等相。當知是過去善業發。

"If one sees heavenly palaces, human realms, or pure lands, know that this is past wholesome karma arising."

Even positive karmic signs require attention—they can generate attachment and pride.

#### C. Signs of Purification (淨業相)

The *Śikṣāsamuccaya* provides specific purification signs that appear in dreams:

- Vomiting bad food (expelling negativity)
- Eating yogurt or milk (receiving pure nourishment)
- Seeing sun or moon (illumination)
- Moving through sky (transcendence)
- Defeating dark figures (overcoming Māra/death)
- Seeing monastic assembly (connection to Sangha)
- Climbing trees or mountains (spiritual ascent)

> 夢中見斬頭。是煩惱盡相。

"Dreaming of beheading indicates the exhaustion of afflictions."

### IV. The Three Types of Karma

Miao-lo classifies karma according to its weight and treatability:

#### A. Fixed Karma (定業)

> 定業者。重業必受果報。

"Fixed karma: heavy karma that must receive its retribution."

This includes the five heinous acts (五逆):
1. Killing one's father
2. Killing one's mother
3. Killing an arhat
4. Shedding the blood of a Buddha
5. Creating schism in the Sangha

#### B. Unfixed Karma (不定業)

> 不定業者。輕業可轉。

"Unfixed karma: light karma that can be transformed."

This karma is susceptible to change through practice, repentance, and contemplation.

#### C. Present-Life Karma (現業)

> 現業者。今生所造。

"Present-life karma: what is created in this lifetime."

This is still being formed and can be redirected before it ripens.

### V. The Four Powers of Purification

Miao-lo draws on the traditional four powers (四力) for working with karma, corresponding to the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s *Caturdharmaka Sūtra* teaching:

#### Power 1: Revulsion (追悔力)

> 追悔力者。於所造罪深生慚愧。

"The power of revulsion: regarding the created sins, generate deep shame and remorse."

This involves acknowledging specific past actions without rationalization or denial.

#### Power 2: Antidote (對治力)

> 對治力者。修諸善法以滅惡業。

"The power of the antidote: cultivate various wholesome dharmas to extinguish evil karma."

Specific antidotes include:
- Studying profound sutras
- Meditating on emptiness
- Reciting mantras
- Erecting Buddha images
- Offering at stupas

#### Power 3: Restraint (遮止力)

> 遮止力者。誓願更不復作。

"The power of restraint: vow never to repeat the action."

This is the binding commitment to abstain from future negative actions.

#### Power 4: Support (依止力)

> 依止力者。歸依三寶發菩提心。

"The power of support: take refuge in the Three Treasures and generate bodhicitta."

The *Śikṣāsamuccaya* compares bodhicitta to "the fire at the end of an aeon, capable of consuming enormous amounts of past negative karma."

### VI. Applying the Ten Modes to Karma

Miao-lo demonstrates how each of the Ten Modes applies to the Karma Object:

#### Mode 1: Contemplating the Inconceivable Object (觀不思議境)

> 觀業即法界。業性本空。

"Contemplate that karma is precisely the dharma-realm. The nature of karma is fundamentally empty."

The karma is not separate from reality; it manifests the three truths:

- **Empty**: Karma has no inherent existence; no "doer" can be found
- **Provisional**: It functions according to causes and conditions
- **Middle**: It integrates both aspects simultaneously

> 業如夢幻。雖有作用。而無實體。

"Karma is like a dream or illusion. Although it has function, it has no real substance."

This corresponds to the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s teaching: "While karma and its ripening function, no intrinsic 'thing' moves from this life to the next."

#### Mode 2: Arousing the Bodhi-Mind (發菩提心)

> 因業發心。我及眾生皆有如是業障。願皆解脫。

"Because of karma, generate the [bodhi-]mind. Both I and all sentient beings have such karmic obstacles. May all be liberated."

The practitioner's own karmic manifestations become a gateway to universal compassion.

#### Mode 3: Skillfully Settling the Mind (善巧安心)

> 安心於業相。不驚不怖。不喜不憂。

"Settle the mind upon karmic signs. Neither startled nor frightened, neither pleased nor worried."

The practitioner maintains equanimity whether positive or negative karma manifests.

#### Mode 4: Breaking Through All Dharmas (破法遍)

> 破業相空。無業可得。

"Break through karmic characteristics to emptiness. No karma can be found."

This applies the analytical deconstruction:

> 業從何來。業往何去。誰是業者。

"Where does karma come from? Where does karma go? Who is the one with karma?"

Upon investigation, no substantial karma or karma-bearer can be located.

#### Mode 5: Discerning Openness and Obstruction (識通塞)

> 執業即塞。了業空即通。

"Grasping karma is obstruction. Understanding karma as empty is openness."

The diagnostic function determines whether karmic manifestation obstructs or opens the path.

#### Modes 6-10: Complete Application

The remaining modes are applied:

- **Mode 6** (調道品): Adjust path-factors according to karmic conditions
- **Mode 7** (助道對治): Apply specific antidotes (四力) to karmic obstacles
- **Mode 8** (識次位): Recognize one's stage relative to karmic purification
- **Mode 9** (能安忍): Endure karmic manifestations with patience
- **Mode 10** (無法愛): Avoid attachment to states of purification

### VII. The Ultimate Purification

Miao-lo presents the highest teaching on karma purification:

> 業性本空。何須更滅。了業即空。業即解脫。

"The nature of karma is fundamentally empty. What need is there to extinguish it further? Understanding karma as empty—karma is itself liberation."

This corresponds to the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s ultimate teaching: "True purification is seeing 'transgression as no-transgression.'"

> 若了諸法本來清淨。無有自性。則雖造惡業。不墮惡道。

"If one understands that all dharmas are fundamentally pure and without self-nature, then even having created evil karma, one does not fall into evil paths."

However, Miao-lo immediately guards against misunderstanding:

> 非謂縱任。乃是真實見業空故。

"This does not mean indulgence. It is because one truly sees that karma is empty."

This realization must be genuine insight, not intellectual concept used to excuse behavior.

### VIII. Special Cases: Heavy Karma

For particularly heavy karma (such as the five heinous acts), Miao-lo prescribes intensified methods:

> 若造五逆。當勤修懺悔。求佛加護。

"If one has committed the five heinous acts, one should diligently practice repentance and seek the Buddha's protective blessing."

Specific methods include:

1. **Recitation of Buddha names**: Especially the 35 Buddhas or Medicine Buddha
2. **Dharani recitation**: Protective mantras such as the Cundī Dhāraṇī
3. **Invoking Ākāśagarbha**: For confession of root downfalls
4. **Stupa offerings**: Even a single flower can prevent lower rebirth

### IX. Doctrinal Significance

The Karma Object (業境) completes the triad of internal obstacles:
- **Object 2** (煩惱境): Mental afflictions
- **Object 3** (病患境): Physical illness
- **Object 4** (業境): Karmic manifestations

Together, these three address what arises from within the practitioner during contemplation. The remaining objects (5-10) address external phenomena and advanced stages.

The Tiantai approach to karma is distinctive:

> 不同小乘斷業。亦不同外道自然。乃是圓教即業論空。

"This is not like the Hīnayāna severance of karma, nor like the non-Buddhist doctrine of naturalism. It is the Perfect Teaching's [approach of] understanding karma as empty."

The practitioner neither eliminates karma through ascetic effort nor ignores it through philosophical dismissal, but penetrates to its empty nature while respecting its functional power.
