### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.5/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "Name marks the name. Body reveals the body." `{RHYTHM: preserves structural sequence from source with chant-like cadence}`
- "Contemplation rises from understanding." `{DOCTRINE: aligns with 觀由解生}`
- "Text is fourfold... Intent is one." `{DOCTRINE: direct vernacular mirror of 文四義二意唯在一}`
- "What is revealed is one. Revealing agencies are three." `{LEXICON: preserves 所一能三 relation}`
- "Don’t grab one sentence and call that the whole mountain." `{RHYTHM: vernacular rendering of anti-fragment warning}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Table-heavy explanatory format | Clause-mapped oral stanzas tied to scholarly block |
| Added unsourced sixfold details | Kept six meanings as cited without speculative expansion |
| Brand-style "Luthier" framing | Source-locked doctrinal register with gospel cadence |
| Summary-first flow | Structural flow mirroring source order (name/body/practice/fruit) |

### 4. Notes
- Fidelity was prioritized over metaphor expansion to support future audit comparability.
- Candidate for next pass: extend if scholarly section adds contiguous 六義 lines.
