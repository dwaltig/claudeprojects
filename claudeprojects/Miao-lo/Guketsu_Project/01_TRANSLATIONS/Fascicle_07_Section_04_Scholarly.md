## Mode 8: Knowing the Sequential Positions (知次位) — Part 2

### I. The Ten Methods for Harmonizing Teachings (十意融通)

Miao-lo presents ten hermeneutical principles for reconciling apparent contradictions among Buddhist scriptures and treatises:

> 次以十意融通經論者。

"Next, using the ten meanings to harmonize sūtras and treatises."

He notes that these should not be confused with the Ten Modes of contemplation:

> 人見十意之初有諦理之言。便將十乘以對十意。深不便也。

"People see that at the beginning of the ten meanings there is discussion of 'truth and principle.' They then correlate the Ten Modes with the ten meanings. This is deeply inconvenient [i.e., mistaken]."

#### The Ten Methods

1. **道理** (Clarifying the Principle): Different teachings describe different aspects of the same reality.

2. **綱格** (Understanding the Framework): Using the eight teachings (頓漸祕密不定 + 藏通別圓) to classify and sort doctrinal statements.
   > 以教判釋得教遠度。故云綱格。
   > "Through doctrinal classification and interpretation, one obtains the far-reaching scope of the teaching. Therefore it is called 'framework.'"

3. **釋名** (Resolving Names): The same word may carry different meanings in different contexts.
   > 名雖有八用必不俱
   > "Though names number eight, their uses are certainly not simultaneous."

4. **明用** (Distinguishing Functions): Different methods serve different purposes.
   > 祛執遣迷。有執咸破。
   > "Dispelling attachment and removing delusion. All attachments are broken."

5. **明宗** (Clarifying the Goal): Despite different methods, the ultimate aim is one.
   > 位是所階行是能修。能所相帶則方便與證因果不混。
   > "Position is what is ascended; practice is what cultivates. Capacity and object mutually accompany, so expedient [means] and realization, cause and effect, are not confused."

6. **開拓** (Opening and Expanding): Not rigidly boxing the teachings; allowing interpenetration.
   > 開拓法門使佛意不壅
   > "Opening and expanding the Dharma-gate so that the Buddha's intention is not obstructed."

7. **開章** (Generating Structure): Seeing how sections build upon one another.
   > 如諸義疏凡開章段。無不生起如鉤鎖也。
   > "Like all commentaries that divide into sections—none fail to arise [from previous sections] like linked hooks."

8. **帖釋** (Textual Commentary): Careful reading adhering closely to the actual words.
   > 復須附文次第帖釋。不廣不略有事有理。
   > "One must also follow the text and explain in sequence. Neither too broad nor too brief, with both phenomena and principle."

9. **翻譯** (Translation Issues): Recognizing that some problems arise from translation rather than doctrine.
   > 方音不同非關義理不可卒備。
   > "Regional pronunciations differ—this is unrelated to meaning and principle; [such matters] cannot be suddenly prepared."

10. **印心** (Contemplation Practice): The teachings are for practice, not merely theoretical understanding.
    > 附文成觀文不虛設。觀與文合名為印心。
    > "Following the text to accomplish contemplation—the text is not established in vain. When contemplation and text unite, it is called 'sealing the mind.'"

### II. The Five Repentances (五悔)

Miao-lo presents the five repentances as essential preparation for entering higher stages:

> 先知下明五悔意為入觀之方。是故重牒前文觀法。但心理下明用向觀法不能發真。是故應須更加五悔。

"From 'first knowing' onward, we clarify that the five repentances serve as the method for entering contemplation. Therefore we repeat the previous contemplative method. From 'only mind-principle' onward, we clarify that using the previous contemplative method cannot yet manifest the true [realization]. Therefore one must additionally employ the five repentances."

#### 1. Confession (懺悔)

> 懺名下次正明五悔。雖有勸請等四不同。莫非悔罪。故名五悔。

"Though there are [the other] four [practices] such as entreaty, etc., none are other than repenting wrongdoing. Therefore they are called 'five repentances.'"

Definition:
> 陳露者。陳列也首也。悔者伏也。

"陳露 means 'to display and reveal.' 悔 means 'to submit' [i.e., acknowledge and reform]."

The practice involves:
- Recalling wrongdoing from this and previous lives
- Not justifying or minimizing
- Acknowledging the harm caused
- Resolving not to repeat

#### 2. Entreaty (勸請)

Two aspects:
> 一者請住於世。二者請轉法輪。

"First, requesting [Buddhas] to remain in the world. Second, requesting [them] to turn the Dharma-wheel."

Miao-lo quotes the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*:

> 佛雖必說而不待請。請者得福何得不請。猶如大王雖多美膳若有請者必得恩福。

"Though the Buddha will certainly teach without waiting to be asked, those who request obtain merit—how could one not request? Just as a great king, though having abundant fine food, certainly bestows grace and blessing on those who request."

#### 3. Rejoicing (隨喜)

> 佛轉法輪眾生得三世益。我助彼喜者。喜前勸請也。

"The Buddha turns the Dharma-wheel; sentient beings obtain benefit in the three times. 'I assist that joy'—this rejoices in the previous entreaty."

From the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*:

> 隨喜者有二種。一者世間。二者出世。若人無有出世善根。我今隨喜眾生世福。

"Rejoicing is of two kinds: worldly and world-transcending. If a person lacks world-transcending wholesome roots, I now rejoice in sentient beings' worldly merit."

The *Lotus Sūtra* connection:
> 法華隨喜法等者。隨喜品中從法座起。至於餘處為他人說。

"The *Lotus* [chapter on] 'Rejoicing in the Dharma': In the Rejoicing chapter, [practitioners] rise from the Dharma-seat, go to other places, and teach others."

#### 4. Transfer of Merit (迴向)

> 以隨喜福與眾生共及向菩提。

"Through the merit of rejoicing, [one shares] with sentient beings together and [directs merit] toward bodhi."

Two directions of transfer:
1. **To all beings**: May all beings benefit
2. **To awakening**: May this merit lead to supreme enlightenment

The seeming paradox:
> 施眾生者。然修因福不可得共。若得果時則以此福施於眾生。

"Giving to sentient beings: the merit of cultivating causes cannot actually be shared. But when obtaining the fruit, one gives this merit to sentient beings."

#### 5. Vow (發願)

> 迴向為大利等。故法華梵天施宮殿時。皆發願云。願以此功德等

"Transfer [of merit] is great benefit, etc. Therefore in the *Lotus [Sūtra]*, when Brahmā offers palaces, all make vows saying, 'May with this merit...' etc."

The four great vows provide direction for practice.

## Mode 9: Patient Endurance (安忍)

### Definition and Context

Mode 9 addresses the practitioner's capacity to maintain stability when facing obstacles. The term 安忍 combines:

- **安** (ān): settled, peaceful, stable
- **忍** (rěn): endurance, patience, forbearance

### The Function of Endurance

Having established the five repentances as preparatory practice, the practitioner must now develop the capacity to endure:

- **Internal obstacles**: doubt, fear, impatience, boredom
- **External obstacles**: criticism, hardship, temptation

Miao-lo emphasizes that endurance is not passive resignation but active stability—maintaining the contemplative orientation regardless of circumstances.

## Mode 10: Freedom from Dharma-Attachment (無法愛)

### The Final Obstacle

> 即使別教詮於不空。非初心觀何須比決。故並不與圓教空同。

"Even if the Distinct Teaching expresses 'not-empty,' it is not the initial mind's contemplation—why would it need comparative determination? Therefore [such teachings] are entirely not the same as the Perfect Teaching's emptiness."

Having traversed the previous nine modes, the practitioner faces the subtlest obstruction: attachment to the Dharma itself.

### The Logic of Release

The raft metaphor applies: the Dharma is an expedient for crossing to the other shore. Upon arrival, continued attachment to the raft impedes progress on solid ground.

This mode does not advocate:
- Rejection of the Dharma
- Antinomian disregard for practice
- Premature claims of transcendence

Rather, it advocates:
- Freedom from fixation
- Non-grasping relationship with methods
- Continued use without attachment

### Integration with Previous Modes

Mode 10 completes the Ten Modes by preventing the entire system from becoming a new form of bondage. Each mode—from the Hologram (一念三千) through Patient Endurance (安忍)—remains valid and beneficial. The practitioner simply ceases to grasp these methods as objects of craving.

## Doctrinal Significance

Fascicle 7 completes the exposition of the Ten Modes by presenting Modes 5-10. These latter modes address what happens when foundational practice encounters obstacles, how to assess progress accurately, and how to avoid turning the path itself into a new form of bondage.

The ten methods for harmonizing teachings provide hermeneutical tools for resolving apparent contradictions among scriptures—a persistent challenge in Buddhist scholasticism. Miao-lo's approach allows practitioners to benefit from diverse textual traditions without becoming confused by surface-level disagreements.

The five repentances establish a practical entry point for serious practice. They are not merely devotional exercises but functional tools for clearing karmic obstacles and establishing the proper orientation for contemplation.

Modes 9 and 10 address the final challenges: maintaining stability through difficulty (安忍) and releasing attachment to the very methods that brought one to realization (無法愛). Together, they ensure that the practitioner neither abandons the path prematurely nor clings to it beyond its usefulness.
