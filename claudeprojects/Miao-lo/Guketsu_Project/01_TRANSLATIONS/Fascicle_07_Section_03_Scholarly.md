## Mode 8: Knowing the Sequential Positions (知次位) — Part 1

### I. The Purpose of Knowing Positions

Miao-lo opens with a discussion of wisdom (般若) and its relation to the four foundations of mindfulness, then transitions to the critical importance of knowing one's stage:

> 次明知次位者。先明來意。既用前七以為所修。二世善發入位不定。或未入位未得謂得。恐極下根生重罪故。故須明位令行者識之。

"Next, explaining knowing the sequential positions. First clarifying the purpose: having used the previous seven [modes] as what is cultivated, wholesome [states] from both lives may arise, but entering the position is uncertain. Perhaps one has not entered the position yet claims to have attained. Fearing that those of the dullest faculties may generate grave offenses, therefore we must clarify the positions to enable practitioners to recognize them."

This passage establishes the critical danger of misidentification. Claiming attainments not yet realized constitutes a grave offense (重罪), potentially leading to deterioration of practice and misleading of others.

### II. The Structure of Positions

Miao-lo identifies two categories of positions across the four teachings:

> 四教各有真似二位。在賢名似入聖名真。

"Each of the four teachings has two [types of] positions: true and resemblance. Being in the [stage of] worthies is called 'resemblance'; entering sagehood is called 'true.'"

- **Resemblance positions (似位)**: The preparatory stages where realization is approximated but not yet complete
- **True positions (真位)**: The stages of genuine attainment

### III. The Metaphor of Purple and Vermillion

> 次舉喻云朱紫等者。朱正色如真位。紫間色如似位。如赤黑合以成於紫。真妄尚雜故名為似。

"Next, the metaphor 'vermillion and purple, etc.': vermillion, a primary color, is like the true position. Purple, an intermediate color, is like the resemblance position. Just as red and black combine to produce purple, the true and false are still mixed—therefore it is called 'resemblance.'"

This metaphor from traditional Chinese color theory illustrates how resemblance positions contain elements of both realization and delusion, unlike the pure "vermillion" of true attainment.

### IV. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness (四念處)

Miao-lo presents an extended treatment of the four foundations as the basis for accurate self-assessment.

#### A. Mindfulness of Body: The Five Impurities (五種不淨)

**1. Seed Impurity (種子不淨)**

> 初言種子者。如論偈曰。是身種不淨非是妙寶物。不從白淨生。父母邪想憶念風吹淫欲之火。

"First, regarding 'seed': as the treatise verse states, 'This body's seed is impure, not a wondrous treasure. It does not arise from the white and pure. Parents' wrong thoughts, recollection, wind-blown fire of desire...'"

The body originates from parental sexual union—described as "grasping another's leavings" (攬他遺體). The red and white drops (赤白精) are the biological materials from which the embryo develops.

**2. Place Impurity (住處不淨)**

> 生處不淨者。如論偈曰。是身為臭穢不從華開生。亦不從薝蔔又不出寶山。

"The birthplace is impure: as the treatise verse states, 'This body is foul and filthy; it does not arise from flowers blooming, nor from champaka blossoms, nor does it emerge from treasure mountains.'"

The womb environment is characterized as "vile and crowded" (猥者雜惡也).

**3. Characteristic Impurity (自相不淨)**

> 自相不淨者。衣服澡浴種種華香。飴以上饌眾妙美味。經宿之間皆為不淨。

"Self-characteristic impurity: clothing and bathing, various flowers and fragrances, fed with superior dishes and many wonderful flavors—after a night's passage, all becomes impure."

Even with the finest adornments and foods, the body's nature produces waste:

> 假令衣天衣食天食以身性故。亦成不淨。

"Even if clothed in heavenly garments and fed heavenly food, due to the body's nature, it also becomes impure."

**4. Self-Nature Impurity (自性不淨)**

> 自性不淨者。大小便道目淚涕睡常流不息。如論偈云。種種不淨物充滿於其身。常流出不止如漏囊盛物。

"Self-nature impurity: the paths of urine and feces, tears, nasal discharge, saliva—constantly flowing without cease. As the treatise verse states, 'Various impure substances fill this body, constantly flowing out without stopping, like a leaky bag containing things.'"

The body continuously produces and excretes impure substances.

**5. Ultimate Impurity (究竟不淨)**

> 究竟不淨者。如論偈曰。審諦觀此身終必歸死處。

"Ultimate impurity: as the treatise verse states, 'Carefully and truly contemplate this body—in the end it certainly returns to death.'"

The body's final destination is decomposition and dissolution.

#### B. Mindfulness of Feelings: The Three Sufferings (三苦)

Miao-lo presents the three sufferings through the *Abhidharmakośa* metaphor:

> 故俱舍云。如以一睫毛置掌而不覺。若置眼睛上為損及不安。凡夫如手掌不覺行苦睫。智者如眼睛緣極生厭怖。

"Therefore the *Kośa* states: 'Like placing a single eyelash on the palm—one does not perceive it. If placed on the eyeball, it causes harm and disturbance. Ordinary beings are like the palm, not perceiving the eyelash of the suffering of conditioning. The wise are like the eye, and through contact with the extreme, aversion and fear arise.'"

| Type | Chinese | Characteristic |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Suffering of suffering | 苦苦 | Obvious pain: illness, injury |
| Suffering of change | 壞苦 | Pleasure that ends |
| Suffering of conditioning | 行苦 | Pervasive unsatisfactoriness |

#### C. Mindfulness of Mind: Impermanence

**The Cage and Bird Metaphor**

> 如繫鳥等者。如論偈云。鳥來入瓶中羅𣪺揜瓶口。縠穿鳥飛去神明隨業走。

"Regarding 'like a caged bird, etc.': as the treatise verse states, 'The bird enters the bottle, the net-cover seals the opening. When the silk tears, the bird flies away; the spirit follows karma and departs.'"

- The body (bottle/cage) = the physical form
- Consciousness (bird) = the mental continuum
- Karma (net) = the binding force
- Death = the breaking of the container

**The Wax Seal Metaphor**

From the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*:

> 印壞文成等者。重顯籠瓶文仍少異。籠瓶二喻但喻因果。此蠟印喻更加中陰。

"'The seal is destroyed, the pattern appears'—this again reveals [the meaning of] cage and bottle, though the text differs slightly. The two metaphors of cage and bottle only illustrate cause and effect. This wax-seal metaphor additionally includes the intermediate state."

> 如蠟印印泥印與泥合印滅文成。

"Like a wax seal pressed into clay: the seal combines with the clay, the seal is destroyed, the pattern appears."

This illustrates the relationship between:
- Present life (the wax seal)
- Intermediate state (the pressing)
- Future life (the pattern in clay)

#### D. Mindfulness of Dharmas: Non-Self

**The Ghost Room Story (鬼房)**

Miao-lo recounts from the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*:

> 如一山中有一佛圖。中有別房常有鬼來。故諸道人皆捨此房。

"In a certain mountain there was a Buddhist temple. Within it was a particular room where ghosts constantly came. Therefore all the monks abandoned this room."

Two monks, each unaware of the other, take residence in the room. Each mistakes the other for a ghost. They struggle throughout the night, only to discover at dawn that they were old friends fighting phantoms.

> 眾生亦爾。五陰本來無人無我。空取其相生於鬪諍。

"Sentient beings are likewise. The five aggregates originally have no person, no self. Vainly grasping their characteristics, they generate conflict."

**The Two Ghosts and the Corpse (二鬼爭屍)**

From the *Great Treatise*:

> 如人遠行獨宿空亭。夜中有鬼擔一死屍。來著其前。復有一鬼從後而來。瞋罵前鬼云。是我屍何以擔來。

"A person traveling far lodged alone in an empty pavilion. In the night, a ghost came carrying a corpse and placed it before him. Another ghost came from behind, angrily cursing the first: 'This is my corpse! Why did you carry it here?'"

The traveler, asked to adjudicate, tells the truth and is torn apart. But the first ghost replaces each limb with parts from the corpse. By morning, the traveler's entire body has been replaced:

> 其人思惟。此之二鬼皆有大力。實語虛語皆不免死。我今不應妄語答鬼。

"The person thought: 'These two ghosts both have great power. Whether I speak truth or falsehood, I cannot avoid death. I should not answer the ghosts with false words.'"

The traveler wanders to a monastery, where monks teach him:

> 此人自知己身無我易可化度。

"This person himself knew his body has no self—he is easily transformed and liberated."

### V. The Three Animals Metaphor

Miao-lo employs the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*'s metaphor to distinguish the three vehicles:

#### The Small Deer (麞) — Śrāvaka

> 聲聞觀法義之如麞。生老病死猶如獵圍。三界五欲猶如水草。不遑視聽如不暇飲噉。希離二縛如志在免脫。

"The śrāvaka's contemplation is like the small deer. Birth, aging, sickness, and death are like the hunter's encirclement. The three realms and five desires are like water and grass. Not having leisure to look or listen, like not having time to drink or eat. Hoping to escape the two bonds, intent on liberation."

The śrāvaka flees danger single-mindedly, without looking back or helping others.

#### The Larger Deer (鹿) — Pratyekabuddha

> 部行說法名為悲鳴。但讚出苦名為呦咽。

"Teaching the Dharma to groups is called 'mournful crying.' Simply praising escape from suffering is called 'plaintive sound.'"

The pratyekabuddha flees but looks back with compassion:

> 有少悲心似住生死。利物事微名為何益。說已入般。

"Having some compassion, seemingly abiding in birth-and-death. Benefiting beings in small matters—what benefit is this called? Having taught, [the pratyekabuddha] enters parinirvāṇa."

#### The Great Elephant (大象) — Bodhisattva

> 大象合菩薩... 以智去至俱安者。合令群安隱。

"The great elephant corresponds to the bodhisattva... 'With wisdom departing until all are secure' corresponds to 'causing the herd to be safe and hidden.'"

The bodhisattva:
- Knows its own great power
- Endures the dangers of birth-and-death
- Leads all beings across to safety

## Doctrinal Significance

Mode 8 addresses the danger of premature claims to attainment—a persistent problem in contemplative traditions. By establishing the four foundations of mindfulness as prerequisites for accurate self-assessment, Miao-lo ensures that practitioners develop the discernment necessary to evaluate their own progress.

The three animals metaphor provides a framework for understanding different levels of aspiration and capacity. The Tiantai ideal is the elephant—the bodhisattva who leads all beings to liberation—but practitioners must honestly assess whether they currently function as deer or elephant.

The extended treatment of impermanence through the cage-and-bird and wax-seal metaphors emphasizes the urgency of practice while undermining attachment to the physical body as the locus of self.
