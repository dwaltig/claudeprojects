### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.7/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "receive concentration, refuse fixation" `{RHYTHM: concise paradox preserving core warning}`
- "Danger is not the state itself." `{DOCTRINE: avoids anti-dhyana distortion}`
- "Concentration stabilizes. Wisdom liberates." `{LEXICON: clear dyadic distinction}`
- "Most crucial here: release dharma-attachment." `{DOCTRINE: preserves section's operative pivot}`
- "Stopping and contemplating function as one event." `{DOCTRINE: integration of zhi/guan retained}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Long attainment taxonomy exposition | Compressed attainment-risk-integration flow |
| Extensive comparative table prose | Direct doctrinal contrasts in oral cadence |
| Delayed mention of release dynamic | Early and explicit release signal |
| Conceptual conclusion | Practice-forward closing imperatives |

### 4. Notes
- Preserves integration doctrine while increasing readability and cadence.
- Can be expanded into dhyana-by-dhyana line notes if required for teaching packets.
