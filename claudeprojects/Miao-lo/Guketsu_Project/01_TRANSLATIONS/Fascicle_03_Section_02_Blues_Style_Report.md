### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.7/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "One integrated road, ten functional turns." `{RHYTHM: keeps one-vehicle logic while preserving ten-mode distinctness}`
- "Without bodhi-mind, contemplation folds inward..." `{DOCTRINE: preserves anti-self-centered rationale of Mode 2}`
- "Break grasping at emptiness... at middle as concept." `{DOCTRINE: keeps multi-layer deconstruction intent}`
- "A method can open... and obstruct..." `{LEXICON: faithful rendering of open/obstruct discernment}`
- "Release dharma-attachment so attainment itself is not clung to." `{DOCTRINE: preserves Mode 10 endpoint}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Extended metaphor-heavy framing | Source-facing ten-mode progression |
| High improvisational diction | Controlled gospel cadence with doctrinal anchors |
| Over-illustrated subsections | Tight mode-by-mode functional summaries |
| Mixed stylistic persona labels | Unified fidelity-locked register |

### 4. Notes
- Register strengthened while reducing lexical noise around doctrinal pivots.
- Next pass can add clause-level mapping if a fuller bilingual scholarly block is prepared.
