## Fascicle_04_Section_01_Blues.md

### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.8/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "Not proof of failure." `{RHYTHM: retains doctrinal framing that object-arising is natural}`
- "Do not suppress. Do not indulge. Do not identify." `{LEXICON: high-clarity operational triad}`
- "Use inconceivable contemplation on the affliction itself." `{DOCTRINE: preserves mode transfer to object}`
- "affliction... disclosure-material" `{RHYTHM: vernacular rendering of affliction-as-path logic}`
- "Same fire that burns can illuminate." `{RHYTHM: faithful transformation motif}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Enumerated didactic subsections | Condensed mode-compatible doctrinal flow |
| Heavy list density | Oral cadence with preserved classification structure |
| Repetitive explanation of each root affliction | Functional summaries tied to practice handling |
| Outcome implied | Explicit conversion from obstacle to path |

### 4. Notes
- Strong doctrinal retention with improved practical cadence.
- Can be further expanded later if one-to-one root/secondary cross-map is needed.
