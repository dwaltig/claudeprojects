## Opening Word

After the name,
we got to face the body.

Not a slogan-body.
Not a market-body.
The revealed body of practice.

Teaching points it.
Practice bears it.
Principle receives it.

---

## Fourfold Frame

This body-work is opened in four sections,
with one intention running through all four.

Text may split,
meanings may fork,
but the road stays one.

---

## First Turn: Teaching-Characteristics

Name by itself is broad,
running across ordinary and sage,
large and small,
partial and complete.

So the text says:
we cannot stop at naming.
We have to distinguish the marks.

That distinguishing work
is called teaching-characteristics.

---

## Second Turn: Eye-Wisdom as Revealing Agency

Teaching is the saying side.
Practice is the revealing side.
Principle is what gets revealed.

So the order stands:
teaching first,
eye-wisdom second,
realm next,
then gain-and-loss for self and others.

---

## Third Turn: Body and Characteristic Held Together

"Body" means the truth-principle interpreted.
"Characteristic" means distinctions named in teaching-work.

Don’t split them into enemies.
The point is not argument-sport.
The point is revealing what practice is carrying.

---

## Fourth Turn: One Intent Through Four Sections

Many mouths,
one burden.

Four chapter-movements,
not four separate roads.

So this section keeps saying:
what is interpreted,
what interprets,
and who gains or loses,
all get read together.

---

## Closing Moan

The body is not reached by title alone.
The body is revealed where teaching and practice meet.

If we cling to names,
we stay outside.
If we walk the fourfold reveal,
we step inside the work.
