## What Did We Just Cover?

Fascicle 1 is the **orientation**. It's the safety briefing, the shop tour, and the materials checklist—*before* you make a single cut.

Here's the recap.

---

## The Key Sections

### 1. The Lineage
- **The Chain**: Buddha → Mahākāśyapa → 23 guys → Nāgārjuna → Huiwen → Nanyue → Zhiyi → Miao-lo
- **Why It Matters**: This ain't something Zhiyi made up in the bathtub. It's handed down. You're joining a lineage.

### 2. The Setting
- **When**: 594 CE. One summer.
- **Where**: Yuquan Temple. Mountains. Remote.
- **Status**: Zhiyi was at the "Fifth Grade" (Observational Practice). Not a Buddha. Not a beginner. In between.

### 3. The Ten Wrongs
- **What**: Ten bad reasons to start practicing.
- **Examples**: Fame. Money. Power. Spite. Laziness disguised as spirituality.
- **Verdict**: If your motive is wrong, the whole build is crooked.

### 4. The Four Vows
- **What**: The right motivation (to replace the Ten Wrongs).
- **The Four**:
  1.  Beings are infinite—vow to save them.
  2.  Afflictions are endless—vow to cut them.
  3.  Dharma-gates are countless—vow to learn them.
  4.  Buddha-way is supreme—vow to complete it.
- **Verdict**: This is your spine. Straight or crooked, everything follows from here.

### 5. The Six Identities
- **Problem 1**: "I'm already a Buddha" (arrogance)
- **Problem 2**: "I'll never be a Buddha" (despair)
- **Solution**: You ARE *and* you AREN'T. Six stages from blueprint to finished axe.
  1.  **Blueprint** (理即): You have the potential.
  2.  **First Class** (名字即): You learn the terms.
  3.  **First Cuts** (觀行即): You start doing.
  4.  **Getting Closer** (相似即): Your builds start to look right.
  5.  **Breakthrough** (分真即): You make a real guitar.
  6.  **Master** (究竟即): You *are* the craft.

### 6. The Ten Chapters / Five Quick-Starts
- **Ten Chapters**: The full curriculum. (Grand Outline → Ultimate Return)
- **Five Quick-Starts**: The cliff notes. (Generate Mind → Return Home)
- **Verdict**: Know the layout. Don't get lost.

### 7. The Three Paths
- **Gradual**: Scales → chords → songs → improv.
- **Freestyle**: Follow what arises.
- **Sudden**: You already know. Just play.
- **Verdict**: This manual is for Path 3 people.

## The One Big Idea

If you forget everything else, remember this:

> **You are already a master luthier. You just haven't uncovered it yet.**

That's the whole point of the Perfectly Sudden Teaching. You're not "becoming" anything. You're *realizing* what you are.

## What's Next (Fascicles 2-10)

Now that you've got the orientation:

- **Fascicle 2**: What does "Zhiguan" even mean?
- **Fascicle 3**: What's the core material we're working with?
- **Fascicle 4-5**: How does this relate to everything else? What's good, what's junk?
- **Fascicle 6**: The 25 things you do *before* you pick up a tool.
- **Fascicles 7-10**: The actual build. The Ten Objects. The Ten Modes.

## Luthier's Final Word

> "If you don't understand the foundation, the whole build falls apart. If you do, the rest is just details."

Now pick up the manual. We're ready.
