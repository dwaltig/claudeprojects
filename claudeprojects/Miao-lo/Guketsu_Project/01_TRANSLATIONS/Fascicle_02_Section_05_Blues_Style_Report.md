# Blues Tone Check Report
## Fascicle_02_Section_05_Blues.md

### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.8/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "Twenty-Five Preparations, One Wondrous Aim" `{RHYTHM: vernacular title preserving causal orientation toward 妙果}`
- "Cause is established for fruit..." `{DOCTRINE: mirrors 為果立因/剋果 logic}`
- "Near and far are not contradiction." `{LEXICON: preserves 近/遠 distinction without flattening}`
- "Without aspiration... proper zhiguan does not mature." `{DOCTRINE: direct mapping of fivefold deficiency sequence}`
- "It is load-bearing mercy." `{RHYTHM: gospel closure that keeps practical urgency}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Procedural checklist tables | Clause-chain tied to source causality and sequencing |
| Expanded modern analogies | Reduced to minimal doctrinally-safe metaphorics |
| Understated 近/遠 distinction | Explicit near/far topology retained |
| Implicit five-cluster integration | Added explicit analogy-to-practice integration statement |

### 4. Notes
- This pass balances practical readability with high doctrinal traceability.
- Suitable for next step: one-to-one clause index against expanded scholarly line set.
