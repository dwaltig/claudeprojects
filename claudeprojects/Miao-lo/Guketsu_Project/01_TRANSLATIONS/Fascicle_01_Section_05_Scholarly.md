## Translation

### The Necessity of Rejecting the False (簡非)

**Text**:
> 初簡心者。凡厥有情皆悉堪發... 道名既通須以諸非簡之令是。今略為十並是所簡。
> *First, regarding the 'Simplification of the Mind' (Jian Xin): All sentient beings are capable of generating [the intention]... Since the name 'Way' (Dao) is common [to both good and evil], one must use the 'Various Wrongs' (Zhu Fei) to simplify [i.e., filter] it, causing it to be correct/right (Shi). Now, we briefly list ten; all are to be rejected.*

**Commentary**:
Miao-lo explains that "Generating the Intention" (*Fa Xin*) is not inherently good. One can generate an intention to steal, to kill, or to become a demon. Therefore, before we establish the "Right Mind," we must filter out the "Wrong Minds." This is arguably the most critical diagnostic section in the early *Guketsu*.

### The Ten Wrong Minds (List and Analysis)

#### 1. The Mind of the Three Poisons (貪瞋癡)
**Text**:
> 初貪瞋癡其相最甚故名為專... 境強心重判屬上品。
> *First, Greed, Anger, and Stupidity. Their characteristics are most extreme, thus called 'Exclusive'... The object is strong and the mind is heavy; judged as Upper Grade [Evil].*
- **Analysis**: This is the "Hell Path" motivation. Practicing meditation to gain powers for revenge or accumulation.

#### 2. The Mind of the Five *Shantila* (五扇提羅)
**Text**:
> 言五扇提羅等者。未曾有經下卷云... 外形似禪內思邪濁。見者謂聖。
> *Regarding the Five *Shantila* (Sandhila/Eunuchs/Impotent Ones): The *Marvelous Scripture* (*Weicengyou Jing*) says... 'Outwardly they resemble Dhyana [practitioners], but inwardly they think of evil turbidity. Beholders call them Sages.'*
- **Analysis**: These are "Pretenders." They enter the order for profit. They are "spiritual eunuchs"—incapable of producing the seed of enlightenment.

#### 3. The Mind of the Fire Path (行火途)
**Text**:
> 行火途者四解脫經以三途名火血刀也... 且從熱說故云火途。
> *Regarding walking the Fire Path: The *Four Emancipations Sutra* names the Three Paths as Fire, Blood, and Knife... Speaking from the aspect of heat, it is called the Fire Path.*
- **Analysis**: Motivation driven by burning anxiety or the desire to inflict burning.

#### 4. The Mind of Desiring Followers (欲多眷屬)
**Text**:
> 夫畜類者多愛群聚。是故破戒兼好眷屬之所感也。
> *Those of the Animal category mostly love to gather in herds. Therefore, this is the retribution invoked by breaking precepts combined with loving [a large entourage of] followers.*
- **Analysis**: The "Pack Mentality." Practicing to become a cult leader or influencer.

#### 5. The Mind of Swallowing the Flow (吞流)
**Text**:
> 吞流等者。欲他歸己如海吞流。欲己攝他如火焚薪。
> *Swallowing the Flow: Desiring others to return to oneself like the ocean swallows currents. Desiring to consume others like fire burns firewood.*
- **Analysis**: Narcissistic absorbtion. The "Black Hole" teacher.

#### 6. The Mind of Devadatta (如調達)
**Text**:
> 如調達者... 謂教王害父而為新王。我當害佛而為新佛。
> *Like Devadatta... He taught the King to harm his father and become a New King. [He said] 'I will harm the Buddha and become a New Buddha.'*
- **Analysis**: The "Usurper." Ambition to overthrow lineage and replace the teacher. Motivated by jealousy (*Chi*).

#### 7. The Mind of the Six Livestock (六畜)
**Text**:
> 復言六畜者。以六攝盡故也... 從相噉邊故云血途。
> *Speaking of the Six Livestock: The number six exhausts the category... From the aspect of mutual devouring, it is called the Blood Path.*
- **Analysis**: Servility and brutality. Practicing blind obedience or predatory dominance.

#### 8. The Mind of the Four Distants & Eight Directions (四遠八方)
**Text**:
> 四遠八方等者... 次荒之國也。
> *The Four Distants and Eight Directions... The lands of the 'Next Wilderness' (barbarians).*
- **Analysis**: Being a "Spiritual Tourist" or "Barbarian." Uncultured, lacking the central "Civilization" of the Middle Way.

#### 9. The Mind of Self-Praise (歎名曰稱)
**Text**:
> 歎名曰稱。讚德曰揚... 知己無德欲他擬聖。
> *Sighing [for] fame is called 'Cheng'. Praising virtue is called 'Yang'... Knowing oneself has no virtue, yet desiring others to compare one to a Sage.*
- **Analysis**: The "PR Campaign." Fame-seeking.

#### 10. The Mind of Intolerating Inferiors (不耐下人)
**Text**:
> 不耐下人者... 如鴟等者... 豈鴟高飛而勝孔雀。
> *Intolerant of those below... Like the Owl ('Chi')... How can the Owl, flying high, surpass the Peacock?*
- **Analysis**: Arrogance (*Man*). Looking down on beginners or the laity.

## Doctrinal Analysis

### The "Net of Wrongs" (簡非之網)
Miao-lo's commentary here serves a crucial function: it **de-romanticizes** the act of "seeking the Way."
He argues that 90% of people who "seek the Way" are actually seeking:
- Power (Devadatta)
- Fame (Self-Praise)
- Comfort (Five Shantila)
- Entourage (Herd Mentality)

Unless these "Ten Wrongs" are filtered out (*Jian* 簡), the energy of meditation will simply amplify the pathology. Meditation acts as a fertilizer; if the seed is "Devadatta," meditation will grow a "Super-Devadatta."

### The Meaning of "Shantila" (扇提羅)
Miao-lo cites the *Weicengyou Jing* to explain this obscure term. It refers to those who are "Stone Women" (*Shi Nu*) or "Eunuchs" (*Huang Men*) in a spiritual sense. They look the part (shaved heads, robes, meditation posture) but lack the biological capacity to reproduce the Dharma lineage. They are "dead ends."

## Translator's Reflection

This section feels incredibly contemporary. The critique of "Spiritual Materialism" (Chogyam Trungpa's term) is fully anticipated here by Zhiyi and Miao-lo.
The "Mind of Desiring Followers" (Pack Mentality) is a direct critique of the "Guru/Influencer" complex.
The "Mind of Swallowing the Flow" is a devastating psychological profile of the narcissistic teacher who needs students to "feed" them.
