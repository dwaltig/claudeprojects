次明圓教無作弘誓者。
> Next, it clarifies the Perfect Teaching's unconditioned great vows.
四諦之體秖是三諦。
> The substance of the Four Truths is precisely the Three Truths.
故以三諦總標誓境。
> Therefore the Three Truths are used to set the overall object-sphere of the vows.
一念心起與前不別。
> The arising of a single thought-moment is no different from before.
能觀觀智與前永異。
> But the contemplating wisdom that observes is forever different from before.
即此一念即是三諦。
> This very single thought is the Three Truths.
不復更論迷解之本。
> One no longer argues for a separate basis of delusion and liberation.
若根若塵並是法界。
> Whether faculties or objects, all are the Dharma-realm.
法界秖是三諦異名。
> Dharma-realm is only another name for the Three Truths.
次並是下三諦互融故云並是。
> Next, in the line "all are," it says "all are" because the Three Truths mutually interpenetrate.
藏具諸法即是俗也。
> "Containing all dharmas" is the Provisional.
空中名同不須別釋。
> Emptiness and Middle follow the same naming pattern and need no separate explanation.
云何下重釋也。
> "How so?" and below gives a repeated explanation.
並緣生者謂一念心並具百界千如等也。
> "All arise by conditions" means one thought-mind fully contains hundred realms and thousand suchnesses.
如是緣生悉皆無主無主故空。
> Conditioned arising like this is entirely masterless; because it is masterless, it is empty.
即此千如名為妙假。
> This very thousand suchnesses is called wondrous provisionality.
即是法性名為妙中。
> This very dharma-nature is called wondrous middle.
結歸如文。
> The concluding return is as in the text.
非三而三下復疎三諦還成三諦。

非三而三假也。
> Not three yet three is the Provisional.
三而不三空也。
> Three yet not three is Emptiness.
亦應更云非三非不三中也。
> It should further say: neither three nor not-three is the Middle.
文無者略。
> The text omits this for brevity.
非合非散中道雙非。
> Neither conjoined nor dispersed is the Middle's double-negation.
而合即空。
> Yet conjunction is precisely emptiness.
而散即假。
> Yet dispersion is precisely provisionality.
非非合非非散。
> Not not-conjoined, not not-dispersed.
非上雙非即是雙照。
> Not the above double-negation is precisely double-illumination.
先明雙非後明雙照。
> First it clarifies double-negation, then double-illumination.
二文中間論二諦者。
> Between these two passages it discusses the two truths.
以此圓文無前後故。
> Because this Perfect Teaching passage has no before-or-after sequence.
不可一異即中也。
> It cannot be one or different; this is the Middle.
而一空也。
> Yet one is Emptiness.
而異假也。
> Yet difference is Provisional.
如此三諦在根在塵。
> In this way the Three Truths are in faculties and in objects.
如來藏者即當假也。
> Tathagata-garbha here corresponds to the Provisional.
豈如來藏而無佛性。
> How could Tathagata-garbha lack Buddha-nature?
聞此圓頓不宗重者。

良由近代習大乘者雜濫故也。
> are truly due to the mixed confusion of recent Mahayana learners.
況像末情澆信心寡薄。

圓頓教法溢藏盈函。

不暫思惟便至冥目。
> Without even brief reflection, one reaches blind darkness.
徒生徒死一何痛哉。
> To be born and die in vain, how painful.
有人云。
> Someone says:
聞而不行於汝何預。
> If they hear but do not practice, what concern is it of yours?
此未深知久遠之益。
> This does not deeply understand long-range benefit.
如善住天子經。
> As in the Sutra of Prince Sus-thita.
文殊告舍利弗。
> Manjusri told Sariputra:
聞法生謗墮於地獄勝於供養恒沙佛者。
> Hearing Dharma, then slandering and falling into hell, is still better than offering to Ganges-sand Buddhas [without hearing].
雖墮地獄從地獄出。
> Though one falls into hell, after coming out of hell
還得聞法。
> one again gets to hear Dharma.
此以供佛不聞法者。
> This uses those who offer to Buddhas yet do not hear Dharma
而為校量。
> as the basis for comparison.
聞而生謗尚為遠種。
> Even hearing and producing slander is still a distant seed.
況聞思惟勤修習耶。
> How much more hearing, reflecting, and diligently cultivating.
譬如下舉喻也。
> Below, an analogy is presented.
夫以事喻法皆是分喻。
> Using phenomena to analogize Dharma is always a partial analogy.
於中鏡喻其意最親。
> Among them, the mirror analogy is closest in meaning.
何者。
> Why?
遍鏡是明遍明是像。
> The mirror's pervasion is illumination; pervading illumination is image.
非並非別不縱不橫。
> Neither merged nor separate, neither longitudinal nor lateral.
有異伊字天目故也。
> It differs from the "Yi-character" and "Heavenly Eye" models, hence this statement.
不合散下重複疎喻。
> Under "not joined/dispersed," the analogy is unfolded again.
如前可知。
> As above, it can be known.
不一二三者。
> As for "not one, two, three":
雖次第增秖是三諦。
> though increased in sequence, it is only the Three Truths.
三法非有名不一二三。
> Since the three dharmas are non-substantial, it is called not one-two-three.
二三無妨者。
> As for "two and three cause no obstruction":
此逐語便故略一字。
> this follows linguistic convenience, so one term is omitted.
智者因喻斯言有徵。
> Zhizhe used this analogy; these words have proof.
此一念心下合譬。
> Below, "this one thought-mind" applies the analogy.
欲明理等復云生佛亦復如是。
> To clarify principle and related points, it again says beings and Buddhas are likewise so.
今問世人云觀真如。
> Now we ask people who speak of contemplating suchness:
如何觀於眾生身內等佛等生之真如耶(云云)。
> how do they contemplate in sentient bodies a suchness equal in Buddha and equal in beings? (etc.)
華嚴下引證理齊。
> Under Huayan, citations are drawn to prove equality in principle.
故華嚴歎初住心云。
> Therefore Huayan praises the first-abiding mind, saying:
如心佛亦爾。
> As mind, so Buddha.
如佛眾生然。
> As Buddha, so sentient beings.
心佛及眾生是三無差別。
> Mind, Buddha, and sentient beings: these three are without difference.
諸佛悉了知一切從心轉。

作一切佛事自在未曾有。
> Performing all Buddha-works, freely, unprecedented.
若人欲求知三世一切佛。
> If one wishes to know all Buddhas of the three times,
應作如是觀心造諸如來。
> one should contemplate thus: mind makes all Tathagatas.
若無今家諸圓文意。
> If this school's Perfect Teaching textual intent were absent,
彼經偈旨理實難銷。
> the meaning and principle of those sutra verses would indeed be difficult to resolve.
