## The Diagnostics

Miao-lo says: "Before you plug into the high-voltage line, check your signal path. If you have a grounded wire or a cheap pedal, you're not gonna get music—you're gonna get feedback, hum, and eventually, a blown fuse."

He lists **Ten Bad Signal Chains** (*Shi Fei* 十非). If you see any of these on your pedalboard, rip them out.

### 1. The Red Zone (The Three Poisons)
**The Text**: "Greed, Anger, Stupidity."
**The Luthier**: This is running your amp at 11 with no input. Just pure noise. You want the gig for the money (Greed), you hate the sound guy (Anger), and you don't know the chords (Stupidity).
**Verdict**: Unplayable.

### 2. The Spiritual Eunuchs (The Five Shantila)
**The Text**: "They look like Zen masters, but inside, they're muddy."
**The Luthier**: These are the "Posers." They bought the '59 Les Paul reissue, the Marshall stack, and the leather pants. But they can't tune the guitar. They look great in the promo photo, but they have no "output."
**Verdict**: All show, no go.

### 3. The Burnout (The Fire Path)
**The Text**: "Fire, Blood, Knife."
**The Luthier**: This is the guy who plays so hard he breaks strings every song. He's not making music; he's venting aggression. He thinks "louder" means "better."
**Verdict**: Destructive interference.

### 4. The Entourage Effect (Desiring Followers)
**The Text**: "Animals love to herd."
**The Luthier**: This guy starts a band just so he can have groupies. He doesn't care about the setlist; he cares about the Instagram follower count. He's building a cult, not a rhythm section.
**Verdict**: Feedback loop of ego.

### 5. The Black Hole (Swallowing the Flow)
**The Text**: "Like the ocean swallowing currents."
**The Luthier**: The Narcissist. "Everything is about me." If the bass player takes a solo, this guy unplugs him. He wants to be the only sound in the room.
**Verdict**: Mix is terrible.

### 6. The Usurper (Devadatta)
**The Text**: "I'll kill the Buddha and become the New Buddha."
**The Luthier**: This is the lead singer who tries to fire the songwriter. Devadatta was the guy who thought he could do the Beatles better than Lennon and McCartney.
**Verdict**: Band breakup imminent.

### 7. The Sheep (Six Livestock)
**The Text**: "Mutually devouring."
**The Luthier**: The "Yes Men." They just follow the leader off the cliff. They have no tone of their own. They're just livestock in the mosh pit.
**Verdict**: Generic filler.

### 8. The Tourist (Four Distants)
**The Text**: "Barbarians of the wilderness."
**The Luthier**: The guy who shows up to a Blues gig and tries to play Techno. He doesn't respect the genre. He's outside the "Civilization" of the Middle Way.
**Verdict**: Wrong venue.

### 9. The PR Campaign (Self-Praise)
**The Text**: "Knowing you have no virtue, but wanting people to think you're a Sage."
**The Luthier**: The "Hype Man." He spends more time on his press kit than his practice routine. He wants the review to say "Genius" when the tape says "Mediocre."
**Verdict**: Don't believe the hype.

### 10. The Snob (Intolerating Inferiors)
**The Text**: "Like an Owl looking down."
**The Luthier**: The Gatekeeper. "Oh, you play a Squier? Cute." He thinks he's better than the openers. Miao-lo asks: "Since when does an Owl outfly a Peacock?"
**Verdict**: Bad vibes.

## Luthier's Summary

Miao-lo is brutal here. He's saying: **Check your motives.**
If you're sitting on the cushion to get rich, famous, or powerful, you're just wiring a bomb.
Rip out the bad cables. Clean the jacks.
You need a **Clean Signal** (*Shi* 是 - The Right Mind) before you turn on the power.
