## Mode 6: Adjustment of Path Factors (道品調適)

### The Setup

You've diagnosed the roadblock (Mode 5). Now what?

**You adjust**.

The 37 factors of awakening (三十七道品) are your toolkit. But you don't use all 37 at once. You use **what fits the situation**.

---

## The Tree of the Path (道樹)

### The Metaphor

The *Mahāvibhāṣā* and the *Great Treatise* both compare the path factors to a **tree**:

- **Roots**: The four foundations of mindfulness (四念處)
- **Trunk**: The four right efforts (四正勤)
- **Branches**: The four bases of power (四如意足)
- **Leaves**: The five faculties and five powers (五根五力)
- **Flowers**: The seven factors of awakening (七覺支)
- **Fruit**: The eightfold path (八正道)

**The point**: It's not a random collection. It's an **organic whole**. The roots support the trunk. The trunk supports the branches. Everything grows toward the fruit.

### Application

Don't just grab random tools. **Understand the structure**.

If your mindfulness is weak (roots), your effort (trunk) won't have a stable foundation.

If your effort is scattered (trunk), your powers (branches) won't develop properly.

**Work from the roots up**.

## The Three Kinds of Guides (三善知識)

### What They Are

1. **Companion Guide** (同行善知識) — Walks with you. Same path, same direction.

2. **Teaching Guide** (教授善知識) — Shows you the way. Knows the terrain.

3. **Protective Guide** (外護善知識) — Guards you. Keeps the dangers away.

### Application

The path factors serve all three functions:

- **As companion**: The factors walk with you through practice
- **As teacher**: The factors show you what to do next
- **As protector**: The factors prevent you from going astray

## The Three Gates of Liberation (三脫門)

### What They Are

1. **Gate of Emptiness** (空門) — No inherent self, no inherent thing
2. **Gate of Signlessness** (無相門) — No fixed characteristics to grasp
3. **Gate of Wishlessness** (無作門) — No craving for results

**All three lead to the same liberation**. Different doors, same room.

### How They Relate to the Teachings

**Tripiṭaka Teaching** (藏教): Uses the 16 aspects of the Four Noble Truths to enter the three gates.

**Shared Teaching** (通教): Uses direct contemplation of illusion to enter. From the start, you see everything as like a dream.

**Distinct Teaching** (別教): Uses the three contemplations in sequence — first emptiness, then provisional, then middle.

**Perfect Teaching** (圓教): **Emptiness IS signlessness IS wishlessness**. Not three separate gates. One gate, three names.

## Mode 7: Counteractive Aids (對治助開)

### The Setup

Sometimes regular practice doesn't cut it. You need **targeted treatment**.

Miao-lo says: If your root is sharp (利根) and you have no obstacles (無遮), you don't need this. But if you're dull (鈍根) and blocked (有遮), you need the counteractive aids.

**Most of us are dull and blocked**. That's why Mode 7 exists.

## The Six Poisons and Six Medicines

### The Poisons (六蔽)

1. **Stinginess** (慳) — Holding on too tight
2. **Immorality** (破戒) — Acting against what you know is right
3. **Anger** (瞋) — Burning yourself and others
4. **Laziness** (懈怠) — Not showing up
5. **Distraction** (散亂) — Mind all over the place
6. **Ignorance** (愚癡) — Not seeing things as they are

### The Medicines (六度)

1. **Generosity** (布施) — Opens the tight fist
2. **Morality** (持戒) — Aligns action with understanding
3. **Patience** (忍辱) — Cools the burning
4. **Effort** (精進) — Gets you off the couch
5. **Concentration** (禪定) — Settles the scattered mind
6. **Wisdom** (般若) — Illuminates the darkness

### The Match

| Poison | Medicine |
|--------|----------|
| Stinginess | Generosity |
| Immorality | Morality |
| Anger | Patience |
| Laziness | Effort |
| Distraction | Concentration |
| Ignorance | Wisdom |

## The Four Followings (四隨)

### When One Medicine Doesn't Work

What if you're treating stinginess with generosity, but it's not working?

**You adjust**. That's where the four followings come in:

1. **Following the Right Treatment** (隨對治)
   - Try the direct medicine first. Stinginess? Give.

2. **Following with a Turn** (隨轉)
   - If that doesn't work, try a different medicine. Maybe the stinginess is rooted in fear. Try morality (security). Or patience (letting go of anxiety).

3. **Following with Combination** (隨兼)
   - Maybe you need two or three medicines at once. Generosity + effort + wisdom.

4. **Following with the Ultimate** (隨第一義)
   - Drop all the specific treatments. Go straight to the source: **observe the mind itself**. See that stinginess has no inherent nature.

## The Treatment Protocol

### Step 1: Identify the Poison

What's actually blocking you? Be honest. Don't say "ignorance" when the real problem is laziness.

### Step 2: Apply the Direct Medicine

Stinginess → Give something away. Right now.
Anger → Practice patience. Right now.
Laziness → Do one thing. Right now.

### Step 3: Check the Results

Did it help? Is the poison weakening?

### Step 4: Adjust as Needed

If the direct medicine isn't working, try a turn. Try a combination. Try the ultimate.

### Step 5: Don't Cling to the Medicine

The medicine is for the disease. When the disease is gone, you don't keep taking the medicine.

## The Five Tastes (五味)

### The Buddhist Teachings as Milk

Miao-lo connects the path factors to the five periods of the Buddha's teaching:

1. **Huayan Period** → Fresh milk (華嚴)
2. **Āgama Period** → Cream (阿含)
3. **Vaipulya Period** → Curds (方等)
4. **Prajñā Period** → Butter (般若)
5. **Lotus/Nirvāṇa Period** → Ghee (法華涅槃)

**Ghee** is the final refinement. The *Lotus Sutra* is the ghee of the Buddha's teaching.

### The Twin Trees (枯榮)

The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sutra* talks about the **twin trees** — one withered (枯), one flourishing (榮).

- **Withered**: Represents the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha paths
- **Flourishing**: Represents the bodhisattva path

But in the *Lotus* and *Nirvāṇa*, the withered becomes flourishing. **All paths lead to one vehicle**.

## The Luthier's Take

### The Buzz

The guitar's buzzing. Where's it coming from?

You could guess: "Probably the frets." And you'd file down every fret.

Or you could **diagnose**: Press each string. Check each fret. Find the *specific* fret that's causing the buzz. Fix *that one*.

### The Treatment

Don't spray medicine everywhere hoping something works.

**Identify the poison**. **Apply the right medicine**. **Check the results**. **Adjust as needed**.

That's Mode 7.

---

## What's Next

You've got the diagnostic (Mode 5). You've got the tuning (Mode 6) and the treatment (Mode 7).

But how do you know where you are on the journey? How do you avoid overestimating or underestimating your progress?

That's Mode 8: **Knowing the Stages**.

Coming up in Section 3.
