## The Verdict on The Gear

We spent this whole fascicle looking at the gear.
- **The Stock Amps** (4 Zens)
- **The Mods** (16 Excellences)
- **The Noise Gates** (9 Thoughts)
- **The Pro Rig** (Back-Shedding)
- **The Master Class** (Compassion, Superknowledges)

**Miao-lo's final word is simple:**
> "The gear doesn't play itself."

### The Trap
You can have the best rig in the world—you can be sitting in the Fourth Dhyāna, breath stopped, mind like a mirror—and you're still just **sitting**.
If you don't have the **Song** (Wisdom/View), you're just a statue.

### The Fix
Use the gear to **play the Song**.
- Use the **Silence** to hear the Emptiness.
- Use the **Bliss** to understand the Provisional.
- Use the **Power** to help the audience.

### The Hologram
Remember: Every setting on that amp contains the whole shop.
- The **Gain** knob contains Hell (if you abuse it).
- The **Reverb** contains Heaven.
- The **Clean Tone** contains the Buddha.

**Don't get stuck on the setting. Play the music.**

See you in Fascicle 10 for the final breakdown.
