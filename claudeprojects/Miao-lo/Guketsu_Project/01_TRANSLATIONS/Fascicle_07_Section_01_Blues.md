## Mode 5: Openness and Obstruction (通塞)

### The Setup

You've been breaking through delusions with Mode 4 (破法遍). Good. But here's what Miao-lo says:

> "Even if your breaking is correct, you might **create a new obstruction** in the process."

**Translation**: You can use the right method and still get stuck.

How? **You get attached to the method itself**.

You're so proud of your "breaking through" that you turn the cure into a new disease.

## The Four-Sentence Examination (四句檢校)

### The Diagnostic

When you hit a block, ask these four questions:

1. **Is there obstruction within openness?** (通中有塞)
   - You think you're making progress, but you've actually created a new attachment.

2. **Is there openness within obstruction?** (塞中得通)
   - What looks like a block might actually be a breakthrough in disguise.

3. **Is the obstruction just obstruction?** (塞自是塞)
   - Sometimes a wall is just a wall. You need to dismantle it.

4. **Is the openness just openness?** (通自是通)
   - Sometimes the path is clear. Don't second-guess yourself.

### The Application

**Every time** you think you've got it, run the diagnostic.

Even your "aha" moment can become a cage if you cling to it.

## The Metaphors

### 1. Removing the Film (除膜養珠)

**The image**: There's a film over your eye. It's blocking your vision. You remove it. Now you can see.

But here's the thing: **The pearl was there all along**. You didn't *create* the pearl. You just removed what was blocking your view of it.

**Application**: Practice doesn't create Buddha-nature. It removes what's obscuring it.

### 2. Destroying Bandits, Protecting Generals (破賊護將)

**The image**: You're fighting bandits. Good. But what if **your general turns bandit**?

Then you gotta fight him too.

And if the new general turns bandit? Same deal. **No exceptions**.

**Application**: Any practice can become an obstacle if you cling to it. Even the practice of non-attachment can become an attachment.

## The 500 Yojanas: The Lotus Sutra Connection

### The Parable

The *Lotus Sutra* tells the story of a guide leading travelers through a dangerous wilderness. The journey is 500 yojanas (about 2,500 miles). The guide knows **where the path is open** and **where it's blocked**.

Miao-lo says: "The guide **knows openness and obstruction**" (導師善知通塞).

### What the 500 Yojanas Mean

**Six masters** tried to interpret this. Miao-lo critiques them all:

1. **First master**: Said 400 yojanas = the two vehicles. **Problem**: Confused the stages.

2. **Second master** (Shèlùn school): Said 7 kinds of birth-and-death = 500. **Problem**: Left out two kinds.

3. **Third master** (Dìlùn school): Said the positions correspond. **Problem**: Put the "magic city" inside the three realms.

4. **Fourth master**: Said the two vehicles complete the 500. **Problem**: That's jumping the gun.

And so on. Each master grabbed **one piece** and thought it was the whole.

### Miao-lo's Point

The 500 yojanas represent **the entire journey** through:
- Birth and death (生死)
- Afflictions (煩惱)
- And finally: **the treasure place** (寶所)

You can map it different ways:
- **Horizontally** (橫): All at once, in parallel
- **Vertically** (竪): Step by step, in sequence
- **In one mind** (一心): All of it, right now, in this single thought

The last one is the **Tiantai way**. Not gradual. Not sudden. **Complete in a single moment**.

## Four Kinds of Openness and Obstruction

### 1. Horizontal (橫通塞)

**What it is**: Looking at all the afflictions **at once**. View-delusion, thought-delusion, dust-and-sand delusion, ignorance — all present simultaneously.

**Openness**: Seeing them all as empty.
**Obstruction**: Getting stuck on any one of them.

### 2. Vertical (竪通塞)

**What it is**: Going through the stages **one by one**. First you break view-delusion. Then thought-delusion. Then the subtler stuff.

**Openness**: Moving from one stage to the next.
**Obstruction**: Stalling at any stage.

### 3. Horizontal-Distinct (橫別通塞)

**What it is**: Different people enter through **different gates**. Some through emptiness, some through provisional, some through middle.

**Openness**: Finding your gate and entering.
**Obstruction**: Thinking your gate is the only gate.

### 4. One-Mind (一心通塞)

**What it is**: **This is the real deal**. All three truths (空假中) are present in a single thought. No sequence. No separation.

**Openness**: Seeing the three truths as one.
**Obstruction**: Separating them in your mind.

---

## The One-Mind Method

### How It Works

**One mind** contains:
- **Emptiness** (空) — Nothing has inherent existence
- **Provisional** (假) — Everything has provisional existence
- **Middle** (中) — Neither one-sided emptiness nor one-sided existence

**Three truths. One mind. One moment.**

### Breaking Through

**To break vertical obstruction**: See that the three truths aren't sequential. They're simultaneous.

**To break horizontal obstruction**: See that the three truths aren't divided among different people. They're all in you, right now.

**To break all obstruction**: See that even "openness" and "obstruction" are provisional designations. The reality is beyond both.

## The Luthier's Take

### The Roadblock

You're driving to the gig. You know the route. But there's a roadblock.

**Option 1**: Turn around. Give up. "The road is blocked."

**Option 2**: Find another way. "The main road is blocked, but there's a side street."

**Option 3**: Realize that "blocked" and "open" are just descriptions of the current situation. They're not permanent features of reality.

### The Wisdom

**Openness** isn't something you achieve once and keep forever.
**Obstruction** isn't something you remove once and it's gone forever.

Every moment, you check: **Open or blocked? And what do I do about it?**

That's the fifth tool. **The diagnostic**.

---

## What's Next

You know how to check for roadblocks. You've got the four-sentence examination. You understand the four kinds of openness and obstruction.

But what do you **do** when you find a block?

That's Modes 6 and 7: **Adjustment** and **Treatment**.

Coming up in Section 2.
