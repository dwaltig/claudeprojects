## The Central Teaching of Fascicle 2

All of the above can be summarized in one principle:

> **"One thought-moment of the ordinary mind contains the entire Dharma-realm."**

This is the meaning of **一念三千** (*Yi Nian San Qian* — "Three Thousand Worlds in One Thought"):

-   **一念** (*Yi Nian*): One thought-moment
-   **三千** (*San Qian*): Three thousand worlds (10 realms × 10 mutual containment × 10 suchnesses × 3 domains)

## What Comes Next (Fascicles 3-10)

With the doctrinal architecture completed, the *Mohe Zhiguan* proceeds to:

-   **Fascicles 3-5**: Further explication of the Ten Objects
-   **Fascicles 6-7**: Detailed treatment of the Ten Modes
-   **Fascicles 8-10**: Fruit, Teaching, and Return

The Guketsu (*Repair Manual*) provides commentary on all of these, explaining obscure passages, resolving contradictions, and presenting Miao-lo's own insights.

## Closing Remark from Miao-lo

> "If one understands the doctrine, the practice follows naturally. If one practices without understanding, one is like a blind man walking at night."
