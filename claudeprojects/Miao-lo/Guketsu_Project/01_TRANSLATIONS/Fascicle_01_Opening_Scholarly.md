問曰。
> Question:
有何因緣輒集此記。
> What causes and conditions led you to compile this record?
答。
> Answer:
事不獲已。
> The matter could not be avoided.
述此緣起凡有十意。
> In setting forth these causes and conditions, there are in all ten intentions.
一為知有師承非任胸臆異師心故。
> First, so one knows there is lineage-transmission, and does not rely on personal impulse and diverge from the teacher's intent.
二為曾師承者而棄根本隨未見故。
> Second, because some who once received lineage-transmission abandon the root and follow what they have not truly seen.
三為後代展轉隨生異解失本依故。
> Third, because in later generations, as transmission passes onward, divergent interpretations arise and the original basis is lost.
四為信宗好習餘方無師可承稟故。
> Fourth, for those faithful to this school who study in other regions where no teacher is available to receive transmission from.
五為義觀俱習好憑教者行解備故。
> Fifth, for those who cultivate both doctrinal understanding and contemplation and rely on teaching, so that practice and understanding are both complete.
六為點示關節廣略起盡宗要文故。
> Sixth, to point out the crucial joints, the extensive and the brief, the beginnings and endings, and the essential textual purport.
七為建立師解使不淪墜益來世故。
> Seventh, to establish the teacher's interpretation so it does not sink and fall away, thereby benefiting future ages.
八為自資觀解以防誤謬易尋討故。
> Eighth, to support my own contemplative understanding, guard against error, and make inquiry and discussion easier.
九為呈露所解恐有迷忘求刪削故。
> Ninth, to present my understanding, fearing confusion and forgetfulness, and to seek correction and deletion where needed.
十為隨順佛旨運大悲心利他行故。
> Tenth, to accord with the Buddha's intent, apply the great compassionate mind, and carry out conduct that benefits others.
此之一部前後三本。
> This single work has three versions, earlier and later.
其第一本二十卷成。
> The first version was completed in twenty fascicles.
并第二本十卷成者。
> And the second version was completed in ten fascicles.
首並題為圓頓者是為異偏小及不定故。
> Both were initially titled "Perfect-Sudden," in order to distinguish them from partial-Hinayana and indeterminate teachings.
其第二本即文初列竊念者是。
> The second version is precisely the one whose opening text begins with "I privately ponder" (qie nian).
其第三本題意少異。
> The title-intent of the third version is somewhat different.
具如後釋。
> This is fully explained later.
初云止觀明靜者是。
> It begins with the phrase, "Zhiguan is luminous and still."
今之所承即第三本。
> What we now receive is exactly this third version.
時人相傳多以第三而為略本。
> People of the time transmitted that the third was mostly the abbreviated version.
以第二本號為廣本。
> And they called the second version the expanded version.
一往觀之似有廣略。
> At first glance, it seems there is an expanded/abbreviated difference.
尋討始末紙數乃齊。
> But when examined from beginning to end, the page count is in fact equal.
應以第三為再治本不須云略。
> Therefore, the third should be taken as a re-edited version; it need not be called abbreviated.
