問曰。
> Question:
有何因緣輒集此記。
> What causes and conditions led you to compile this record?
答。
> Answer:
事不獲已。
> The matter could not be avoided.
述此緣起凡有十意。
> In setting forth these causes and conditions, there are in all ten intentions.
一為知有師承非任胸臆異師心故。
> First, so one knows there is lineage-transmission, and does not rely on personal impulse and diverge from the teacher's intent.
二為曾師承者而棄根本隨未見故。
> Second, because some who once received lineage-transmission abandon the root and follow what they have not truly seen.
三為後代展轉隨生異解失本依故。
> Third, because in later generations, as transmission passes onward, divergent interpretations arise and the original basis is lost.
四為信宗好習餘方無師可承稟故。
> Fourth, for those faithful to this school who study in other regions where no teacher is available to receive transmission from.
五為義觀俱習好憑教者行解備故。
> Fifth, for those who cultivate both doctrinal understanding and contemplation and rely on teaching, so that practice and understanding are both complete.
六為點示關節廣略起盡宗要文故。
> Sixth, to point out the crucial joints, the extensive and the brief, the beginnings and endings, and the essential textual purport.
七為建立師解使不淪墜益來世故。
> Seventh, to establish the teacher's interpretation so it does not sink and fall away, thereby benefiting future ages.
八為自資觀解以防誤謬易尋討故。
> Eighth, to support my own contemplative understanding, guard against error, and make inquiry and discussion easier.
九為呈露所解恐有迷忘求刪削故。
> Ninth, to present my understanding, fearing confusion and forgetfulness, and to seek correction and deletion where needed.
十為隨順佛旨運大悲心利他行故。
> Tenth, to accord with the Buddha's intent, apply the great compassionate mind, and carry out conduct that benefits others.
此之一部前後三本。
> This single work has three versions, earlier and later.
其第一本二十卷成。
> The first version was completed in twenty fascicles.
并第二本十卷成者。
> And the second version was completed in ten fascicles.
首並題為圓頓者是為異偏小及不定故。
> Both were initially titled "Perfect-Sudden," in order to distinguish them from partial-Hinayana and indeterminate teachings.
其第二本即文初列竊念者是。
> The second version is precisely the one whose opening text begins with "I privately ponder" (qie nian).
其第三本題意少異。
> The title-intent of the third version is somewhat different.
具如後釋。
> This is fully explained later.
初云止觀明靜者是。
> It begins with the phrase, "Zhiguan is luminous and still."
今之所承即第三本。
> What we now receive is exactly this third version.
時人相傳多以第三而為略本。
> People of the time transmitted that the third was mostly the abbreviated version.
以第二本號為廣本。
> And they called the second version the expanded version.
一往觀之似有廣略。
> At first glance, it seems there is an expanded/abbreviated difference.
尋討始末紙數乃齊。
> But when examined from beginning to end, the page count is in fact equal.
應以第三為再治本不須云略。
> Therefore, the third should be taken as a re-edited version; it need not be called abbreviated.
甞於聽次諮決所聞。
> Formerly, during lectures, I consulted and resolved what I had heard.
并尋經論思擇添助。
> And I searched sutras and treatises, considered and selected, and added support.
非率胸臆謬有所述。
> I did not recklessly write from personal impulse in error.
准釋經論。
> According to scriptural and treatise exegesis,
皆分三段。
> all are divided into three sections.
今文正說尚自未周。
> In this text, the main exposition itself is still not complete.
信無第三流通明矣。
> It is clear there is truly no third, circulation section.
唯開章前章安著序可為序分。
> Only before the chapter-opening, Zhang'an's authored preface may be taken as preface section.
開章已去為正說分。
> From chapter-opening onward is the main exposition section.
舊第二本將序及正合為十章。
> The old second version combined preface and main exposition as ten chapters.
故文初云竊念述聞共為十意。
> Thus at the beginning it says, "private reflection and recorded hearing together make ten intentions."
言竊念者謂私竊興念。
> "Private reflection" means privately aroused thought.
序有五意。
> The preface has five intentions:
一商略。
> First, general discussion.
二祖承。
> Second, ancestral transmission.
三辨差。
> Third, distinguishing differences.
四引證。
> Fourth, citation and proof.
五示處。
> Fifth, indicating place.
言述聞者謂記其所受。
> "Recorded hearing" means recording what one received.
正說亦五意。
> The main exposition also has five intentions:
一開章。
> First, opening chapters.
二生起。
> Second, generative sequence.
三分別。
> Third, distinctions.
四料簡。
> Fourth, analytical selection.
五解釋。
> Fifth, explanation.
以將己序及所聽聞合為十段意似未穩。
> To combine one's own preface and what was heard into ten sections seems not fully stable.
故再治定沒斯次第但成序正。
> Therefore, in revised redaction this sequence was removed, leaving only preface and main exposition.
又於序中唯發起等無歸敬者。
> Also, in the preface there are only opening remarks and the like, without homage.
推功於師述記而已。
> It merely attributes merit to the teacher and records what was heard.
若就大師正說文中義開三段。
> If one follows the Great Master's main exposition text, its meaning opens into three sections:
則前六重以為序分。
> the first six layers are the preface section,
正觀果報以為正宗。
> Correct Contemplation and Fruit-Result are the main doctrine,
起教化他為流通分。
> and Arising Teaching for benefiting others is the circulation section.
旨歸既是化息歸寂。
> Since Ultimate Return is the cessation of transformation and return to quiescence,
非三所攝義似流通。
> though not included in those three, in meaning it resembles circulation.
疏中約行尚對三學以為三分。
> In the commentary, by practice it is still matched to the three trainings as three sections.
今亦例彼義開於三有何不可。
> Now, by analogy to that, opening meaning into three has no problem.
今且依前二段為正。
> For now, we take the former two sections as correct.
於初序中加序所聞時處等事以為通序。
> In the initial preface, matters such as time and place of what was heard are added as general preface.
用舊祖承人法等事以為別序。
> Matters of old ancestral transmission, persons, and dharma are used as specific preface.
即再治定之正意也。
> This is exactly the intended meaning of the revised redaction.
不得復用商略等五。
> One must no longer use the five such as general discussion
以為次第而分再治時處等文。
> as sequence to divide the revised text's passages on time, place, and related matters.
故再治定迴舊商略以為圓證。
> Therefore revised redaction turns the old general discussion into Perfect proof.
故下用此商略文云。
> Thus below it uses this general-discussion passage, saying:
今依經更明圓頓。
> "Now, relying on sutra, we further clarify Perfect-Sudden."
言依經者正當引證證圓頓竟。
> "Relying on sutra" means precisely citation and proof; after proving Perfect-Sudden,
請證餘二。
> it requests proof of the other two.
即設問云。
> Then it sets the question, saying:
餘三昧願聞誠證。
> "Regarding the other samadhis, we wish to hear true proof."
第二本中闕此問也。
> This question is missing in the second version.
故第二本商略文云。
> Therefore the second version's general-discussion passage says:
略引佛經粗彰圓意。
> "Briefly citing Buddhist scriptures to roughly manifest Perfect intent."
故知商略不異引證。
> Hence we know general discussion is not different from citation/proof.
故再治定沒商略名迴為引證。
> Therefore revised redaction removes the name general discussion and turns it into citation/proof.
若將前本商略等名次第屬對治定本文。
> If names like general discussion from the former version are sequentially mapped onto the revised base text,
則使止觀明靜等文便為徒設。
> then passages such as "Zhiguan is luminous and still" become pointless additions.
況將商略以對祖承深為未可。
> All the more, taking general discussion to correspond to ancestral transmission is deeply unacceptable.
是故須廢舊章次第。
> Therefore the old chapter sequence must be discarded.
今再治定加通序者欲類結集傳述所聞法體等五。
> Now adding a general preface in revised redaction is to model compilation-style transmission, including five items such as what was heard and dharma-body.
故不同舊商略居初。
> Therefore it differs from the old arrangement that placed general discussion first.
