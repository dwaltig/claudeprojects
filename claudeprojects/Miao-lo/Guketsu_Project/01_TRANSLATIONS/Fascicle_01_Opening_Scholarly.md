## Translation

### Question and Answer: Why This Commentary Was Compiled

**Question**: What causes and conditions have led you to rashly compile this record?

**Answer**: The matter could not be avoided. I述 述 [set forth] these causal origins in ten intentions:

### The Ten Intentions (十意)

**1. [Lineage Authentication]** So that [students] may know there exists a lineage transmission (*shicheng* 師承), and not任 [arbitrarily follow] their own personal judgment, thereby differing from the mind of the師 [authentic teacher].

**2. [Preservation Against Abandonment]** So that those who have曾 [previously] received the lineage transmission do not abandon the root and foundation by following what they have not [properly] seen.

**3. [Prevention of Doctrinal Drift]** So that in後代 [later generations], [when teachings are] transmitted successively, heterodox interpretations do not arise, thereby losing the original foundation upon which [the teaching] depends.

**4. [Provision for the Isolated]** So that those who have faith in the [Tiantai] school and are fond of studying in余方 [other regions] where there is no teacher from whom they can receive and承稟 [inherit the transmission], [may have access to authentic instruction].

**5. [Integration of Principle and Contemplation]** So that those who practice both義 [doctrinal understanding] and觀 [contemplation] together, and who prefer to憑 [rely upon] the teachings, [may have] both practice and understanding fully prepared.

**6. [Structural Illumination]** So as to點示 [point out and reveal] the關節 [crucial junctures]—the extensive and abbreviated, the beginnings and endings, the essential purport of the文 [text].

**7. [Preservation of the Teacher's Interpretation]** So as to建立 [establish and uphold] the teacher's [Guanding's] interpretation, causing it not to淪墜 [sink and fall into oblivion], thereby benefiting來世 [future ages].

**8. [Self-Clarification]** So as to自資 [provide resources for myself] in觀解 [contemplative understanding], thereby防 [preventing]誤謬 [errors and falsehoods], making [the text]易 [easy for]尋討 [investigation and discussion].

**9. [Request for Correction]** So as to呈露 [present and reveal] my own understanding, fearing there may be迷忘 [confusion and forgetfulness], thereby求 [seeking]刪削 [deletion and revision from others].

**10. [Compassionate Propagation]** So as to隨順 [accord with] the Buddha's intention and運 [exercise] the great compassionate mind in利他 [benefiting others]—the practice of benefiting others.

### The Three Versions of the *Mohe Zhiguan*

This single work exists in three versions from前後 [earlier and later periods]:

**The First Version** was completed in twenty *fascicles* (*juan* 卷).

**The Second Version** was completed in ten *fascicles*.

At the beginning of both the first and second versions, [the text] is uniformly titled as "圓頓" (*yuandun*, "Perfect-Sudden"). This is為 [done in order to]異 [distinguish it from]偏小 [partial and Hinayana teachings] as well as及 [from]不定 [indeterminate teachings].

The second version is即 [precisely] the one where at文初 [the beginning of the text] is列 [listed the passage beginning] "竊念" (*qiannian*, "I privately ponder...").

**The Third Version**'s title意 [meaning is]少異 [slightly different]. [This will be] fully [explained] in具 後釋 [the later elucidation]. [This version] begins初 with the phrase "止觀明靜者是" ("*Zhiguan* [Concentration-Insight] is明 [luminous in its]靜 [stillness]...").

**The version we現在承 [presently receive and transmit] is precisely this third version.**

時人 [People of the time]相傳 [mutually transmit] that the third version is mostly以 [considered] the略本 [abbreviated version], while the second version號為 [is called] the廣本 [expanded version].

一往觀之 [At first glance], it似有 [appears to have] an extensive-abbreviated [distinction]. [However, when one]尋討 [investigates and examines] from始末 [beginning to end], the紙數 [number of sheets of paper]乃齊 [is actually equal/the same].

Therefore應以 [one should regard] the third version為 [as] the再治本 [re-edited version], and不須云 [need not call it] the略 [abbreviated version].

## Doctrinal Analysis

### The Programmatic Function of the Ten Intentions

Miao-lo's Ten Intentions constitute a **methodological manifesto** for Tiantai scholasticism. They reveal the epistemological crisis facing eighth-century Buddhism: how to preserve authentic transmission across generations when:
- Oral lineages are breaking down (Intentions 1-3)
- Geographic isolation separates students from living masters (Intention 4)
- Textual corruption accumulates over time (Intentions 6-9)
- The balance between contemplative practice and doctrinal study is threatened (Intention 5)

The structure moves from **preservation** (1-4) → **integration** (5-6) → **transmission** (7-10), mirroring the Tiantai concern for harmonizing principle (*li* 理) and phenomena (*shi* 事), wisdom (*hui* 慧) and practice (*xing* 行).

### Why Lineage Authentication Comes First

The placement of "knowing there exists a lineage transmission" (知有師承) as the **first** intention is doctrinally decisive. In the Preface, Pumen Zijing attacked those who claim "mind itself is Buddha" (即心是佛) as a justification for dismissing textual study. Miao-lo's counter-argument begins here: **enlightenment is not solitary**.

Even the Buddha received predictions from Dīpaṃkara; even Nāgārjuna received transmission through texts. The Tiantai lineage—Nāgārjuna → Huiwen → Huisi → Zhiyi → Guanding—is not mere pedigree but **doctrinal verification**. To "任胸臆" (arbitrarily follow personal judgment) is to risk mistaking the five aggregates for enlightenment, as warned in Intention 8's concern about "errors and falsehoods" (誤謬).

This echoes the *Mohe Zhiguan*'s warning against "增上慢" (*abhimāna*, overweening pride), where meditators mistake the Four Dhyānas for arhatship. Lineage is the **corrective mechanism**.

### Connection to "Fish-Lu Textual Corruption"

The Preface's lament that "errors of fish [魚] for lu [魯] inevitably produced variations and discrepancies" (魚魯斯訛,不無同異) after "nearly two hundred years" finds its technical solution in Intentions 6-9:

- **Intention 6** (點示關節): Identifying structural junctures prevents interpolation
- **Intention 7** (建立師解): Establishing Guanding's authoritative interpretation creates a baseline
- **Intention 8** (自資觀解): Miao-lo's own contemplative verification acts as quality control
- **Intention 9** (呈露所解,求刪削): **Crucially**, Miao-lo invites correction, acknowledging his fallibility

The movement from Guanding's oral redaction (c. 594 CE) → three written recensions → Miao-lo's *Guketsu* (c. 765 CE) spans **171 years**. Graphic confusion between similar characters (魚/魯), divergent oral transmissions (Intentions 2-3), and loss of Zhiyi's living voice created what textual critics call **textual drift**.

Miao-lo's solution is not to "return to the original" (impossible) but to **stabilize the third recension** as authoritative through commentary that embeds the correct interpretation **into the text itself**.

### The Meaning of "Perfect-Sudden" (圓頓)

圓頓 (*yuandun*) represents the **highest doctrinal classification** in Tiantai's five-period, eight-teaching (*wushi bajiao* 五時八教) system:

- **圓** (*yuan*, "perfect/complete"): All dharmas interpenetrate without obstruction (*yuanrong wuai* 圓融無礙). The ten dharma-realms (*shi fajie* 十法界) are mutually inclusive (*hu ju* 互具), yielding the "three thousand realms in a single thought-moment" (*yinian sanqian* 一念三千).

- **頓** (*dun*, "sudden"): Realization is **immediate and non-gradual**. Unlike the藏通別 [Tripiṭaka, Shared, and Distinct] teachings, which require sequential stages, the Perfect-Sudden teaching reveals that "the initial aspiration is complete enlightenment" (*fa xin jiu cheng zheng jue* 發心究竟正覺).

That **both** the 20-fascicle and 10-fascicle versions bear this title confirms they were recognized as transmitting Zhiyi's ultimate teaching, distinct from:
- 偏 (*pian*, "partial"): One-sided emphasis on emptiness (Tripiṭaka) or provisional existence (Shared)
- 小 (*xiao*, "Hinayana"): Two-vehicle liberation without bodhisattva compassion
- 不定 (*buding*, "indeterminate"): Mixed teachings that don't clearly establish the ultimate

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is the **praxis manual** for Perfect-Sudden realization. Its title establishes doctrinal supremacy.

### The Significance of "Re-edited Version" (再治本)

再治本 (*zaizhi ben*) is a **textual-critical term** indicating **authorial revision** rather than mere abbreviation. Miao-lo's argument is crucial:

**Popular misunderstanding**:
- 3rd version = 略本 (abbreviated)
- 2nd version = 廣本 (expanded)

**Miao-lo's correction**:
- "紙數乃齊" (the number of sheets is equal) → **same length**
- Therefore: 3rd version = 再治 (re-edited/refined), not 略 (abbreviated)

This implies **Guanding himself** revised the text, not that later copyists condensed it. The changes are:
1. **Structural**: Opening with "止觀明靜" instead of "竊念" shifts the rhetorical frame from Guanding's humility to the text's objective authority
2. **Pedagogical**: Refinement suggests improved clarity, not reduced content
3. **Canonical**: Designating the 3rd version as authoritative establishes a stable text for commentary

By anchoring his commentary to the "re-edited version," Miao-lo performs a **canonizing act**. He transforms a fluid oral transmission into a **fixed scripture**, parallel to how the Pali Canon or Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* were stabilized through commentary.

## Key Annotations

### Technical Terms

- **師承** (*shicheng*): "Lineage transmission." Compound of 師 (teacher/master) + 承 (receive/inherit). Distinct from mere "study" (*xue* 學), this term implies **direct personal transmission** of both text and praxis. In Chan contexts, this becomes "mind-to-mind transmission" (*yixin chuanxin* 以心傳心), but Tiantai preserves the textual-oral synthesis.

- **圓頓** (*yuandun*): "Perfect-Sudden." See Doctrinal Analysis above. This pairing is specifically Tiantai; Chan uses 頓 alone, Huayan uses 圓 within a fivefold scheme. Tiantai's innovation is **synthesis**: the perfect teaching is necessarily sudden, and sudden awakening is impossible without perfect doctrinal understanding.

- **再治本** (*zaizhi ben*): "Re-edited version." 再 (again/re-) + 治 (govern/regulate/edit) + 本 (version/edition). Critical term indicating **intentional authorial revision**. Contrasts with:
  - 略本 (*luebon*): Abbreviated edition (content removed)
  - 廣本 (*guangbon*): Expanded edition (content added)
  - 原本 (*yuanbon*): Original version
  - 善本 (*shanbon*): Good/reliable edition

- **關節** (*guanjie*): "Crucial junctures." Literally "joints" or "hinges." In textual analysis, points where:
  - Sections transition
  - Doctrinal themes pivot
  - Misreading would corrupt understanding
  Analogous to Aristotle's "natural joints" in *Phaedrus* 265e.

- **淪墜** (*lunzhui*): "Sink and fall into oblivion." 淪 (submerge/perish) + 墜 (fall/drop). Vivid metaphor for textual loss, suggesting both **passive decay** (forgetting) and **active destruction** (persecution, as in the Preface's reference to Emperor Wuzong's anti-Buddhist purges, though that occurs later).

- **承稟** (*chengbing*): "Receive and inherit [transmission]." Formal compound emphasizing the **ritual-pedagogical** nature of learning. One doesn't merely "read" (讀 *du*) a text; one "receives it from a master" (承稟) through initiation into lineage.

### Textual-Critical Terms

- **竊念** (*qiannian*): "I privately ponder..." Opens the 2nd version. 竊 (secretly/humbly) + 念 (think/recollect). Establishes Guanding's voice as **humble recorder** of Zhiyi's words, emphasizing:
  - The oral origin of the text
  - Guanding's subordination to the master
  - The provisional nature of written transmission

- **止觀明靜** (*zhiguan mingjing*): "Concentration-Insight is luminous in its stillness." Opens the 3rd version. This shift from authorial humility to **doctrinal assertion** marks:
  - Objectification of the teaching (no longer "my notes" but "the teaching itself")
  - Emphasis on果 [result] (luminosity, stillness) rather than process
  - Rhetorical authority for canonical status

### Hermeneutical Concepts

- **任胸臆** (*ren xiongyi*): "Arbitrarily follow personal judgment." 任 (let oneself/indulge) + 胸臆 (chest-mind, i.e., subjective opinion). Pejorative term for **unverified personal interpretation**. Contrasts with:
  - 師承 (verified lineage transmission)
  - 憑教 (relying on scripture, Intention 5)
  - 觀解 (contemplative verification, Intention 8)

The Tiantai epistemology requires **threefold verification**: lineage, scripture, and meditative realization. Any two without the third risks error.

- **根本** (*genben*): "Root and foundation." Essential doctrinal principles that, if lost, render derivative teachings meaningless. In Tiantai context, this refers to:
  - 一心三觀 (*yixin sanguan*): The three contemplations in one mind
  - 一念三千 (*yinian sanqian*): Three thousand realms in a single thought
  - 性具 (*xingju*): Inherent inclusion [of all dharmas in Buddha-nature]

Abandoning the "root" (*gen*) to follow "branches" (*mo* 末) is the heretical trajectory Intention 2 warns against.

## Lineage Context

### The Oral-Textual Dialectic

Miao-lo's Ten Intentions reveal the **tension** at the heart of Buddhist transmission:

**Orality's strengths**:
- Flexibility to adapt to students' capacities (*sijiao* 四教)
- Preservation through memorization in monastic communities
- Direct verification through teacher-student relationship

**Orality's vulnerabilities**:
- Memory corruption over generations (魚魯斯訛)
- Loss when communities disperse (as during the An Lushan Rebellion, 755-763 CE, contemporaneous with Miao-lo)
- Inability to transmit to those geographically distant (Intention 4)

**Textuality's strengths**:
- Stability across time and space
- Accessibility for self-study
- Foundation for commentary and elaboration

**Textuality's vulnerabilities**:
- Ossification → treating means as ends
- Literalism → missing oral context
- Authority disputes → which text is authoritative?

Miao-lo's *Guketsu* attempts to **preserve orality within textuality** by:
1. Recording Guanding's oral transmission (Intentions 1, 7)
2. Embedding contemplative verification (Intention 8)
3. Inviting ongoing dialogue (Intention 9: "seeking deletion and revision")
4. Subordinating all to compassionate function (Intention 10)

### Why "Knowing There Is a Lineage" Matters

The assertion "知有師承" (know there exists a lineage) is **performative**, not merely descriptive. It:

1. **Authorizes** the text by embedding it in a narrative: Nāgārjuna → Huiwen → Huisi → Zhiyi → Guanding → (implied: reader)

2. **Disciplines** interpretation by excluding arbitrary readings: one cannot claim "the text means X" if X contradicts the lineage's understanding

3. **Democratizes** access: by **writing down** the lineage's interpretation, Miao-lo makes it available to those who cannot study with a living master (Intention 4), partially resolving the oral-textual tension

4. **Preserves plasticity**: by inviting correction (Intention 9), Miao-lo prevents the lineage from becoming fossilized. The text is authoritative but not absolute.

This is **anti-Chan** polemic in coded form. Contemporary Chan (8th century) emphasized:
- 不立文字 (*bu li wenzi*): Not relying on written words
- 教外別傳 (*jiao wai bie chuan*): Special transmission outside the teachings
- 直指人心 (*zhizhi renxin*): Directly pointing to mind

Tiantai responds: Yes, but **which mind**? Without lineage, scripture, and contemplative verification, "mind" becomes "personal judgment" (胸臆), leading to the errors the *Mohe Zhiguan*'s ten objects diagnose.

The lineage is not **constraint** but **liberation**—freedom from the tyranny of one's own delusions.

## Philological Notes

### Grammatical Structures

1. **Parallel Construction in the Ten Intentions**:
Each intention follows the pattern: **為 + [purpose clause] + 故**
   - 為 (*wei*): "in order to," "so that"
   - 故 (*gu*): "therefore," "for this reason"

This creates a rhythmic, liturgical quality, suggesting the Ten Intentions may have been **memorized** as a pedagogical device.

2. **Negation Patterns**:
   - 非任胸臆 (Intention 1): "not arbitrarily follow personal judgment"
   - 不淪墜 (Intention 7): "not sink into oblivion"
   - 不須云略 (Three Versions): "need not call it abbreviated"

The use of 非 vs. 不 is stylistically significant:
   - 非 (*fei*): Categorical negation ("is not")
   - 不 (*bu*): Modal negation ("does not/should not")

3. **Topic-Comment Structure**:
"此之一部前後三本" (This single work exists in three versions from earlier and later periods)
   - Topic: 此之一部 (this one work)
   - Comment: 前後三本 (has three versions from before and after)

This topicalization emphasizes the **continuity** (one work) despite the **plurality** (three versions), linguistically enacting Miao-lo's harmonizing project.

### Key Compound Analysis

1. **展轉** (*zhanzhuan*, Intention 3): "Successively, in sequence"
   - 展 (unfold/extend) + 轉 (turn/revolve)
   - Conveys the **iterative** nature of transmission: teacher → student → student's student...
   - Embedded risk: each iteration introduces potential drift (隨生異解, "heterodox interpretations arise")

2. **憑教** (*ping jiao*, Intention 5): "Rely upon the teachings"
   - 憑 (lean on/depend on) + 教 (teaching/scripture)
   - Physical metaphor: teaching as **支撐** (support structure)
   - Contrasts with 任胸臆 (relying on subjective opinion)

3. **點示** (*dianshi*, Intention 6): "Point out and reveal"
   - 點 (dot/mark/indicate) + 示 (show/display)
   - Technical term in commentary: to **mark** crucial passages and **show** their function
   - Analogous to modern annotation or marginalia

4. **尋討** (*xuntao*, Intentions 8 & Three Versions): "Investigate and examine"
   - 尋 (search/follow) + 討 (probe/discuss)
   - Scholarly activity requiring **both**:
     - Philological investigation (尋: tracking textual variants)
     - Interpretive discussion (討: debating meanings)

5. **紙數乃齊** (*zhishu nai qi*, Three Versions): "The number of sheets is actually equal"
   - 紙數 (sheet count) = empirical textual evidence
   - 乃 (thereupon/actually) = emphatic particle
   - 齊 (equal/uniform) = identical length

This phrase is **methodologically significant**: Miao-lo uses **material evidence** (physical manuscript length) to **refute** the conventional classification (abbreviated vs. expanded). This is **8th-century textual criticism** in action.

### Intertextual Resonances

1. **"竊念" echo**: Guanding's opening "I privately ponder..." (*qiannian*) recalls the *Analects* 2.1: "The Master said: 'One who governs by virtue is like the North Star—it remains in its place while the multitude of stars pay homage to it.'" The humility topos positions Guanding as **faithful recorder**, not author.

2. **"明靜" doctrinal resonance**: "Luminous stillness" (*mingjing*) echoes:
   - *Vimalakīrti Sūtra*: "The mind that is still and luminous" (心本淨明)
   - *Platform Sūtra*: "Originally not one thing exists" (本來無一物)
   - Tiantai synthesis: 止體靜,觀體明 (stillness is the essence of concentration, luminosity the essence of insight)

The shift from "竊念" → "明靜" thus moves from **subjective recorder** to **objective teaching**, authorizing textual canonization.

## Translator's Reflections

This passage represents a **watershed moment** in Chinese Buddhist intellectual history: the self-conscious **theorization of commentary** as a salvific act.

Miao-lo does not merely comment on the *Mohe Zhiguan*; he **justifies** the act of commentary itself through the Ten Intentions. In doing so, he navigates several tensions:

1. **Authority vs. Humility**: He claims to "establish the teacher's interpretation" (建立師解) while simultaneously "seeking deletion and revision" (求刪削), balancing authoritative transmission with intellectual humility.

2. **Preservation vs. Adaptation**: He stabilizes the third recension as canonical while acknowledging the text's evolution through three versions, honoring both fixity and fluidity.

3. **Textuality vs. Practice**: He writes a massive commentary (10 fascicles) on a meditation manual, risking the very "abandoning the root for the branches" he warns against—yet justifies this through Intention 5's integration of "doctrinal understanding and contemplation."

4. **Exclusivity vs. Accessibility**: He restricts interpretation to lineage-verified readings (Intention 1) while expanding access to those without living masters (Intention 4), democratizing authority through textual fixation.

The Ten Intentions are thus both **manifesto** and **meditation**: they articulate a philosophy of transmission that is itself an act of transmission. Reading them, we participate in the lineage they describe.

This is the **hermeneutic circle** made sacred.

**Translation Notes**:
- All Chinese terms are romanized using Pinyin unless standard Buddhist transliterations exist (e.g., *śamatha-vipaśyanā* for 止觀)
- Sanskrit terms are provided where relevant to clarify doctrinal concepts
- Bracketed interpolations [...] supply grammatical elements implicit in Classical Chinese but needed for English clarity
- Technical terms are glossed upon first occurrence and referenced in Key Annotations section

**Methodology**:
- This translation prioritizes **philological precision** over readability where the two conflict
- Classical Chinese grammatical structures are preserved where possible (e.g., topic-comment patterns)
- Doctrinal analysis draws on Tiantai commentarial tradition and comparative Buddhist philosophy
- Textual-critical observations are grounded in CBETA apparatus and manuscript studies

**END OF FASCICLE 1, PART 1**

Next: Fascicle 1, Part 2 will continue with Miao-lo's discussion of the Five略 (Five Summaries) and the relationship between oral transmission and written record.
