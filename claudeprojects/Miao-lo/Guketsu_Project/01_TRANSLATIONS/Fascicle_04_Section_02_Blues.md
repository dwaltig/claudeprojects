## Opening Word

This section groups three difficult fields:
illness,
karmic manifestation,
and Mara interference.

They often arrive together,
and each can destabilize practice
if misread.

---

## Illness Object

Illness here is not only medical event.
It becomes contemplative object
when body distress exposes attachment.

Four types are marked:
element imbalance,
karmic illness,
demonic illness,
practice-induced illness.

Response is two-handed:
practical treatment plus contemplation.

Pain is not denied.
Pain is read through three truths.

---

## Karmic-Impression Object

Visions,
memories,
narrative eruptions may appear.

Key rule:
non-engagement.

Do not chase.
Do not fear.
Do not build identity from content.

Recognize manifestation,
see emptiness,
continue method.

---

## Mara Object

Mara pressure can show as
affliction escalation,
aggregate fear,
death panic,
or external disturbance.

Counter is not theatrical combat.

Maintain precept-ground,
steady contemplation,
protective supports,
and empty-nature seeing.

---

## Diagnostic Thread

Across all three objects:
1. Name what is arising.
2. Distinguish likely type.
3. Apply matched remedy.
4. Return to non-grasping contemplation.

---

## Closing Moan

Illness,
karma,
Mara:
none is outside the field.

When met without fixation,
what looked like attack
becomes instruction.
