## Three Related Objects

This section covers three objects that often show up together:
-   **Illness** (病患境) — Physical sickness
-   **Karmic Impressions** (業相境) — Past karma showing up
-   **Demonic Interference** (魔事境) — Māra's obstacles

They're grouped because they come from **external or karmic causes** rather than present mental states.

---

## Part 1: The Illness Object (病患境)

### When It Shows Up

Physical sickness that **messes with practice** and won't go away with simple rest or medicine.

Miao-lo's distinction:
> "Ordinary illness gets medicine. The Illness Object shows up when sickness becomes a teacher, revealing deep attachment to the body."

### Four Types of Illness

| Type | Cause | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **Element Imbalance** | Earth, water, fire, wind off | Medical + contemplation |
| **Karmic** | Past karma ripening | Contemplation + repentance |
| **Demonic** | Māra's interference | Protection + contemplation |
| **Practice-Induced** | Wrong method | Fix the method |

---

### Type 1: Element Imbalance

**The Four Elements**:
-   **Earth**: Solid, structure
-   **Water**: Fluid, cohesion
-   **Fire**: Heat, metabolism
-   **Wind**: Motion, breath

**When they're off**:
| Element | Too Much | Too Little |
|---|---|---|
| Earth | Heavy, stiff | Weak, unstable |
| Water | Swelling, damp | Dry, dehydrated |
| Fire | Fever, inflammation | Cold, poor circulation |
| Wind | Restless, pain | Lethargic, bad breathing |

**Fix**:
1.  Medical: Adjust diet, environment, activity
2.  Contemplation: See elements as empty
3.  Balance: Regulate food, sleep, body, breath, mind

---

### Type 2: Karmic Illness

**What it is**: Illness from **past negative karma** ripening now.

**Signs**:
-   Sudden onset, no clear physical cause
-   Resistant to medical treatment
-   Comes with karmic visions or memories
-   Gets worse during practice

**Fix**:
1.  Repentance: Acknowledge past actions
2.  Contemplation: See karma as empty
3.  Merit dedication: Transfer merit to those harmed
4.  Patience: Endure with understanding

**The point**:
> "Past karma is a seed. No power until conditions ripen it. See karma as empty, the seed loses power to sprout."

---

### Type 3: Demonic Illness

**What it is**: Illness from **Māra's interference** to block practice.

**Signs**:
-   Sudden, severe during intensive practice
-   Comes with disturbing visions or thoughts
-   Disappears when practice stops
-   Returns when practice resumes

**Fix**:
1.  Protective practices: Mantras, precepts, refuge
2.  Contemplate emptiness: See all as empty
3.  Don't engage: Ignore visions
4.  Get guidance: Talk to teachers

---

### Type 4: Practice-Induced Illness

**What it is**: Illness from **wrong meditation technique**.

**Common causes**:
-   Forcing concentration
-   Wrong breathing
-   Bad posture
-   Too much effort
-   Imbalanced Zhi and Guan

**Fix**:
1.  Correct the method
2.  Rest: Reduce practice intensity temporarily
3.  Regulate: Balance the five matters
4.  Get guidance: Learn proper technique

---

### Ten Modes on Illness

**Mode 1**: See illness as Three Truths (empty, conventional, middle)

**Mode 2**: "I'll help all beings who suffer from illness"

**Mode 3**: Use pain as the object

**Key**:
> "Illness isn't separate from Buddha-nature. See pain clearly, you see the Dharma-realm. Not suppressing pain. Recognizing its true nature."

---

## Part 2: The Karmic Impressions Object (業相境)

### When It Shows Up

Past karma showing up as **visions, memories, experiences** during meditation.

### Types

| Type | What It Is | Response |
|---|---|---|
| **Past Life Visions** | Seeing previous existences | Don't engage |
| **Karmic Memories** | Remembering past actions | Observe without attachment |
| **Karmic Debts** | Sensing obligations | Contemplate emptiness |
| **Future Visions** | Seeing potential futures | Recognize as conditional |

---

### The Danger

**Don't**:
-   Get fascinated with visions
-   Identify with past lives
-   Get disturbed by memories
-   Cling to pleasant visions
-   Fear unpleasant visions

**Do**:
-   Recognize as karmic manifestation
-   Contemplate as empty
-   Keep practicing
-   Stay equanimous

> "Karmic visions are dreams. No substance. Don't chase. Don't flee. Just recognize as empty."

---

### Telling Karmic Visions from Real Insight

| Characteristic | Karmic Vision | Real Insight |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | Personal, narrative | Universal, direct |
| **Effect** | Fascination or disturbance | Clarity and peace |
| **Content** | Specific events, people | Dharma-nature, emptiness |
| **Result** | Attachment or aversion | Liberation |

---

### Ten Modes on Karmic Impressions

**The key**: **Don't engage**

1.  Recognize it as karmic manifestation
2.  Contemplate it as empty
3.  Don't identify with it
4.  Keep practicing

> "Karmic visions are clouds passing through the sky. Sky isn't affected by clouds. Your Buddha-nature isn't affected by karma."

## Part 3: The Demonic Interference Object (魔事境)

### Four Types of Māra

| Type | What It Is | Response |
|---|---|---|
| **Affliction-Māra** | Internal afflictions intensifying | Contemplate as empty |
| **Aggregate-Māra** | Attachment to body-mind | See aggregates as empty |
| **Death-Māra** | Fear of death | Contemplate deathlessness |
| **Heavenly-Māra** | External interference | Protective practices |

---

### Affliction-Māra

**What it is**: Sudden, intense afflictions during practice

**Examples**: Overwhelming desire, uncontrollable anger, deep depression, extreme pride

**Response**: Recognize as Māra, contemplate as empty, don't suppress or indulge

---

### Aggregate-Māra

**What it is**: Extreme attachment to or fear of body-mind

**Examples**: Fear of losing self, clinging to physical existence, attachment to mental states, resistance to emptiness

**Response**: Contemplate aggregates as empty, study non-self, develop faith in Buddha-nature, go gradual

---

### Death-Māra

**What it is**: Fear of death or impermanence

**Examples**: Anxiety about mortality, clinging to life, fear of annihilation, resistance to change

**Response**: Contemplate the deathless, understand emptiness ≠ annihilation, see death as transformation, realize Buddha-nature is unborn/undying

---

### Heavenly-Māra

**What it is**: External interference from Māra or his crew

**Examples**: Disturbing visions, voices, physical sensations, environmental disturbances

**Response**:
1.  Don't fear (fear gives Māra power)
2.  Don't engage (ignore visions/voices)
3.  Protective practices (mantras, precepts, refuge)
4.  Contemplate emptiness (see all as empty)
5.  Get guidance if needed

---

### Ultimate Remedy for All Māra

**Contemplate emptiness**:
> "Māra has no power over emptiness. Like a shadow, Māra looks substantial but is empty. Shine wisdom's light, shadows disappear."

**Perfect Teaching's view**:
> "Māra isn't separate from Buddha. See Māra clearly, you see Buddha-nature. This is why advanced practitioners thank Māra for revealing attachment."

## Luthier's Summary

| Object | Primary Approach | Key Insight |
|---|---|---|
| **Illness** | Contemplate pain as Three Truths | Illness reveals attachment to body |
| **Karmic Impressions** | Don't engage, see as empty | Karma is dreams—no substance |
| **Demonic Interference** | Contemplate emptiness, protection | Māra has no power over emptiness |

**Miao-lo's point**:
> "These three objects—illness, karma, Māra—are often feared. But in the Perfect Teaching, they're recognized as teachers. They reveal attachment most clearly. When attachment is seen, it dissolves."
