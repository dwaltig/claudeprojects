## Overview

Fascicle 7 of the *Zhiguan Fuxing Zhuan Hongjue* (止觀輔行傳弘決) continues Miao-lo's commentary on Zhiyi's *Mohe Zhiguan*, addressing the latter six of the Ten Modes of Contemplation (十乘觀法). While Fascicles 5-6 treated the first four modes—establishing the foundational contemplation—this fascicle provides the diagnostic, therapeutic, and culminating practices necessary for complete realization.

## The Ten Modes: Structural Overview

The Ten Modes (十乘觀法) constitute Zhiyi's comprehensive methodology for contemplative practice. They function as a progressive yet interpenetrating system:

### Modes 1-4: Foundational Practice
1. **Contemplating the Inconceivable Object** (觀不思議境) — Ichinen Sanzen
2. **Arousing the True Bodhi-Mind** (發真正菩提心)
3. **Skillfully Settling the Mind** (善巧安心)
4. **Breaking Through All Dharmas** (破法遍)

### Modes 5-10: Diagnostic and Culminating Practice (This Fascicle)
5. **Discerning Openness and Obstruction** (通塞)
6. **Adjusting the Path Factors** (道品調適)
7. **Counteractive Aids for Opening** (對治助開)
8. **Knowing the Sequential Positions** (知次位)
9. **Patient Endurance** (安忍)
10. **Freedom from Dharma-Attachment** (無法愛)

## Mode 5: Discerning Openness and Obstruction (通塞)

### Doctrinal Context

The term 通塞 (tōng sè) denotes the practitioner's ability to discern whether the contemplative path is "open" (通) or "obstructed" (塞). This mode addresses a critical juncture in practice: having employed the breaking-through contemplation of Mode 4, the practitioner must now assess whether genuine progress has occurred or whether new obstructions have arisen.

Miao-lo states:
> 恐於通中翻起於塞
> "There is concern that within openness, obstruction may instead arise."

This indicates that even correct practice can generate attachment to the practice itself, thereby creating new obstacles.

### The Four-Sentence Examination (四句檢校)

Miao-lo presents a fourfold diagnostic:

1. **塞中得通** — Obtaining openness within obstruction
2. **通中有塞** — Finding obstruction within openness
3. **塞自是塞** — Obstruction that is simply obstruction
4. **通自是通** — Openness that is simply openness

This tetralemma ensures comprehensive examination of the practitioner's condition.

### The Metaphors

**Removing the Film, Nurturing the Pearl (除膜養珠)**
The eye covered by a film cannot see clearly. Removing the film reveals what was always present—the pearl of Buddha-nature. Practice does not create Buddha-nature but removes what obscures it.

**Destroying Bandits, Protecting Generals (破賊護將)**
If a general becomes a bandit, that general must also be destroyed. This metaphor indicates that no practice—however beneficial—is exempt from examination. Even the "general" of contemplation can become the "bandit" of attachment.

### The 500 Yojanas (五百由旬)

Miao-lo connects this mode to the *Lotus Sūtra*'s parable of the guide who leads travelers through a dangerous wilderness of 500 yojanas. The guide "knows openness and obstruction" (導師善知通塞). Miao-lo critiques six earlier interpretations of this passage, demonstrating that each captured only partial meaning.

### Four Types of Openness and Obstruction

1. **Horizontal (橫通塞)** — Viewing all afflictions simultaneously
2. **Vertical (竪通塞)** — Progressing through stages sequentially
3. **Horizontal-Distinct (橫別通塞)** — Different practitioners entering through different gates
4. **One-Mind (一心通塞)** — All three truths complete in a single moment of thought

The fourth—one-mind openness and obstruction—represents the distinctively Tiantai approach, wherein horizontal and vertical are integrated in non-dual contemplation.

## Mode 6: Adjusting the Path Factors (道品調適)

### The Thirty-Seven Factors of Awakening

This mode addresses the proper application of the traditional thirty-seven factors (三十七道品):

- Four Foundations of Mindfulness (四念處)
- Four Right Efforts (四正勤)
- Four Bases of Supernatural Power (四如意足)
- Five Faculties (五根)
- Five Powers (五力)
- Seven Factors of Awakening (七覺支)
- Noble Eightfold Path (八正道)

### The Tree Metaphor (道樹)

Following the *Mahāvibhāṣā* and *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra*, Miao-lo presents the path factors as an organic structure:

- **Roots**: Four Foundations of Mindfulness
- **Trunk**: Four Right Efforts
- **Branches**: Four Bases of Power
- **Leaves**: Five Faculties and Powers
- **Flowers**: Seven Factors of Awakening
- **Fruit**: Noble Eightfold Path

This organic metaphor indicates that the factors support one another in systematic development.

### The Three Gates of Liberation (三脫門)

Miao-lo discusses how the path factors lead to the three liberative gates:

1. **Gate of Emptiness (空門)** — Realization of the emptiness of self and dharmas
2. **Gate of Signlessness (無相門)** — Freedom from grasping at characteristics
3. **Gate of Wishlessness (無作門)** — Cessation of craving for results

In the Perfect Teaching, these three are simultaneous aspects of a single liberative insight.

## Mode 7: Counteractive Aids for Opening (對治助開)

### The Rationale

When standard contemplation proves insufficient due to dull faculties (鈍根) or karmic obstructions (有遮), targeted treatment becomes necessary. Miao-lo specifies that practitioners with sharp faculties and no obstructions need not employ these aids, but most practitioners require them.

### The Six Obstructions and Six Perfections

| Obstruction (蔽) | Perfection (度) |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Stinginess (慳) | Generosity (布施) |
| Immorality (破戒) | Moral Discipline (持戒) |
| Anger (瞋) | Patience (忍辱) |
| Laziness (懈怠) | Effort (精進) |
| Distraction (散亂) | Concentration (禪定) |
| Ignorance (愚癡) | Wisdom (般若) |

### The Four Followings (四隨)

When direct treatment fails, Miao-lo provides a protocol for adjustment:

1. **Following the Treatment (隨對治)** — Apply the corresponding perfection directly
2. **Following with Turning (隨轉)** — If ineffective, turn to a different perfection
3. **Following with Combination (隨兼)** — Apply multiple perfections simultaneously
4. **Following the Ultimate (隨第一義)** — Abandon specific treatments; observe the mind directly

## Mode 8: Knowing the Sequential Positions (知次位)

### The Danger of Misidentification

Miao-lo emphasizes the grave consequences of claiming attainments not yet realized:
> 未入位未得謂得。恐極下根生重罪故。
> "Not having entered the position yet claiming to have attained—this may cause those of the dullest faculties to generate grave offenses."

### The Four Foundations of Mindfulness (四念處)

Before accurate self-assessment is possible, the practitioner must establish mindfulness through the four foundations:

1. **Mindfulness of Body (身念處)** — Contemplating the five impurities
2. **Mindfulness of Feelings (受念處)** — Contemplating the three sufferings
3. **Mindfulness of Mind (心念處)** — Contemplating impermanence
4. **Mindfulness of Dharmas (法念處)** — Contemplating non-self

### The Three Animals Metaphor

Miao-lo employs a metaphor from the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* to distinguish the three vehicles:

- **麞 (Small Deer)** — The Śrāvaka flees alone, seeking only personal escape
- **鹿 (Larger Deer)** — The Pratyekabuddha flees with backward glances of compassion
- **大象 (Great Elephant)** — The Bodhisattva remains to lead all beings to safety

### The Ten Methods for Harmonizing Teachings (十意融通)

Miao-lo presents ten hermeneutical principles for reconciling apparent contradictions among scriptures and treatises:

1. Clarifying the Principle (道理)
2. Understanding the Framework (綱格)
3. Resolving Names (釋名)
4. Distinguishing Functions (明用)
5. Clarifying the Goal (明宗)
6. Opening and Expanding (開拓)
7. Generating Structure (開章)
8. Textual Commentary (帖釋)
9. Translation Issues (翻譯)
10. Contemplation Practice (印心)

---

## Mode 9: Patient Endurance (安忍)

### Definition

安忍 combines 安 (settled, peaceful) with 忍 (endurance, patience). This mode addresses the practitioner's capacity to maintain stability when facing obstacles—both internal (doubt, fear, impatience) and external (criticism, hardship, temptation).

### The Five Repentances (五悔)

As a preparatory practice for the higher stages, Miao-lo elaborates the five repentances:

1. **懺悔** (Confession) — Acknowledging and revealing past wrongdoing
2. **勸請** (Entreaty) — Requesting Buddhas to remain in the world and teach
3. **隨喜** (Rejoicing) — Taking joy in the merit of others
4. **迴向** (Transfer of Merit) — Directing merit toward all beings and supreme awakening
5. **發願** (Vow) — Establishing the four great vows

---

## Mode 10: Freedom from Dharma-Attachment (無法愛)

### The Final Obstacle

Having traversed the previous nine modes, the practitioner faces the subtlest obstruction: attachment to the Dharma itself. Miao-lo indicates that even love of the teaching constitutes a form of grasping that must be released.

### The Raft Metaphor

The traditional metaphor applies: the Dharma is a raft for crossing to the other shore. Upon arrival, the raft must be abandoned. Continued attachment to the raft—however useful it was during the crossing—becomes an impediment on solid ground.

### Non-Attachment to Non-Attachment

This mode does not advocate rejection of the Dharma but rather freedom from fixation upon it. The teaching remains valid and beneficial; the practitioner simply ceases to grasp it as an object of craving.

## Structure of This Fascicle

Fascicle 7 is divided into four parts in the CBETA edition:

- **Part 1 (卷第七之一)**: Mode 5 — Openness and Obstruction
- **Part 2 (卷第七之二)**: Modes 6-7 — Path Factors and Counteractive Aids
- **Part 3 (卷第七之三)**: Mode 8 (partial) — Four Foundations, Three Animals
- **Part 4 (卷第七之四)**: Modes 8-10 — Stages, Endurance, Freedom from Attachment

---

## Significance

Fascicle 7 completes the exposition of the Ten Modes, providing the diagnostic and therapeutic apparatus necessary for addressing obstacles in practice. The modes presented here are not merely supplementary but integral to the Tiantai contemplative system. Without the capacity to diagnose obstruction (Mode 5), adjust method (Modes 6-7), accurately assess progress (Mode 8), endure difficulty (Mode 9), and release attachment to practice itself (Mode 10), the earlier modes remain incomplete.

The fascicle thus represents the maturation of contemplative methodology—the transition from establishing practice to perfecting it.
