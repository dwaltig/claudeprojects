# Blues Tone Check Report
## Fascicle_02_Section_02_Blues.md

### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.7/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "Not a slogan-body. Not a market-body." `{RHYTHM: vernacular framing that preserves contrast between mere naming and revealed body}`
- "Teaching points it. Practice bears it. Principle receives it." `{LEXICON: maps 能詮/能顯/所詮 chain into oral cadence}`
- "Name by itself is broad... we cannot stop at naming." `{DOCTRINE: preserves 名通凡聖...不能尋之求別體}`
- "The body is not reached by title alone." `{RHYTHM: closes with anti-reification emphasis aligned to source}`
- "Many mouths, one burden." `{RHYTHM: compresses 四章文四義二章意在一}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| Free-form improvisational commentary | Fourfold clause-mapped structure aligned to scholarly sequence |
| Added metaphor chains with weak textual anchors | Tightened lines around teaching/eye-wisdom/principle/gain-loss logic |
| Broad "body" language | Explicit differentiation of body vs characteristics |
| Section-level summary without order markers | Ordered movement: intent -> teaching-characteristics -> agency -> one intent |

### 4. Notes
- This pass intentionally constrained novelty to protect source fidelity while retaining gospel cadence.
- Next compiler-loop can expand line coverage if additional contiguous source lines are added to the scholarly section.
