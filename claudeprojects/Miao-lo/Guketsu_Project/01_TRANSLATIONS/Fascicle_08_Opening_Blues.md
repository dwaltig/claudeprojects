## The Ten Objects (十境): What Hits You on the Road

### The Setup

You've got your ten tools. The Ten Modes (十乘觀法). That's Fascicles 5-7. You know how to contemplate. You know how to break through. You know how to check for roadblocks.

Good.

But here's what Miao-lo's about to tell you:

> "Practice doesn't happen in a vacuum."

The road has potholes. The gigs have hecklers. The bus breaks down.

**The Ten Objects** are what you encounter when you're actually doing the work. Not in theory. In practice.

## The Three Obstacles (三障)

### What Comes Up

When you're sitting there, trying to do the work, three things come up:

| # | Object | Chinese | What It Is |
|---|--------|---------|------------|
| 2 | Afflictions | 煩惱境 | The three poisons kick up |
| 3 | Illness | 病患境 | The body starts acting up |
| 4 | Karma | 業境 | Old stuff starts surfacing |

These are the **internal obstacles**. They come from inside you.

Later fascicles cover the external stuff: demons (魔事), meditation states (禪定), wrong views (邪見), and the rest.

But first, you gotta deal with what's already in the house.

## The Relationship: Tools and Territory

### How It Works

The **Ten Modes** are your tools.
The **Ten Objects** are the terrain.

You use the tools **on** the terrain. Not in the abstract. In the specific.

When afflictions kick up → Apply the ten modes to afflictions.
When illness arises → Apply the ten modes to illness.
When karma surfaces → Apply the ten modes to karma.

Same tools. Different territory. That's the work.

**Object 4: Karma** (業境)

## The Transition

### From Method to Mess

Fascicles 5-7 were clean. Theoretical. "Here's the method."

Fascicle 8 is where it gets messy. "Here's what happens when you actually try it."

You sit down to practice. Your mind races (affliction). Your back hurts (illness). Old guilt surfaces (karma).

**That's not failure. That's the territory.**

The question isn't "How do I avoid this?" The question is "How do I work with it?"

## The Luthier's Take

### The Real Gig

Every musician knows: rehearsal is one thing, the gig is another.

In rehearsal, you've got control. The room's quiet. Nobody's drunk. Nobody's heckling. You can stop and start.

The gig? The gig is chaos. The monitor's feeding back. The drummer's rushing. Someone in the front row is shouting requests.

**You still gotta play.**

That's Fascicle 8. You've rehearsed the Ten Modes. Now you're on stage. The afflictions are in the audience. The illness is in your body. The karma is in your history.

Play anyway.

## The Luthier's Glossary (Opening)

- **十境** (Ten Objects) → **The Territory** — what you encounter
- **十乘觀法** (Ten Modes) → **The Tools** — how you work
- **三障** (Three Obstacles) → **What's in the House** — internal blocks
- **煩惱境** (Affliction Object) → **When Mind Rebels** — poisons intensify
- **病患境** (Illness Object) → **When Body Breaks** — physical trouble
- **業境** (Karma Object) → **When Past Surfaces** — old stuff comes up

### The Setup

- **Rehearsal** → The theory (Fascicles 5-7)
- **The Gig** → The practice (Fascicle 8+)
- **The Work** → Apply tools to territory
- **The Path** → Obstacles included
