## Translation

### The Master's Origins (智者)
**Text**:
> 智者二字即是教主... 幼名光道亦名王道。此從初生瑞相立名。
> *The two characters "Zhi-zhe" (Wise One) refer to the Lord of the Teaching [Zhiyi]. His childhood name was Guang-dao (Illuminating the Way) or Wang-dao (Kingly Way). These names were established based on the auspicious signs at his birth.*

**Commentary**:
Miao-lo establishes Zhiyi's credentials immediately.
- **Double Pupils** (*Chong Tong* 目有重瞳): A classic sign of a sage (like Emperor Shun).
- **Auspicious Birth**: The room was filled with light (*shi nei dong ming* 室內洞明), forcing the neighbors to think there was a fire.

### The Encounter on Mount Dasu (大蘇山)

**Text**:
> 聞光州大蘇山慧思禪師。遙飡風德如飢渴矣... 思初見笑曰。昔共靈山聽法華經。宿緣所追今復來矣。
> *He heard of Dhyana Master Huisi of Mount Dasu in Guangzhou. He feasted on his virtuous reputation from afar like one hungry and thirsty... When Huisi first saw him, he smiled and said: "In the past, we listened to the Lotus Sutra together at Vulture Peak (Ling-shan). Driven by past karmic bonds, you have come again."*

**The "Vulture Peak" Prediction**:
This is a defining moment in Tiantai history. Huisi validates Zhiyi not by his current resume, but by their *shared past life* at similar assembly where Śākyamuni Buddha was preaching the *Lotus Sutra*.
*Implication*: They are "Dharma Brothers" re-uniting for a new mission in China.

### The Realization (The Lotus Samadhi)

**Text**:
> 即示普賢道場行法華三昧... 豁然入定照了法華... 師曰。非爾弗證非我不識。所發定者法華三昧前方便也。所發持者初旋陀羅尼。
> *He immediately showed him the Universal Worthy Bodhimanda for practicing the Lotus Samadhi... [Zhiyi] suddenly entered concentration and illuminated the Lotus [Sutra]... The Master [Huisi] said: "Without you, there would be no realization; without me, no recognition. The concentration you have triggered is the **Preliminary Expedient of the Lotus Samadhi** (*Fahua Sanmei Qian Fangbian*). The retention you have triggered is the **Dharani of the First Turning** (*Chu Xuan Tuoluoni*)."*

**The Certification**:
Huisi confirms Zhiyi's enlightenment on two counts:
1.  **Dhyana (Samadhi)**: The "Preliminary Expedient" (not the full final stage, but the decisive entry).
2.  **Prajna (Dharani)**: The "Dharani of Turning" (*Xuan*). This implies the ability to "turn" (process) infinite meanings from a single sound.

Huisi's famous assessment follows:
> *Text: 縱令文字法師千群萬眾。尋汝之辯不能窮矣。於說法人中最為第一。*
> *Even if there were thousands of "Text-Only Dharma Masters" (*Wenzi Fashi*), seeking to exhaust your eloquence, they could not do so. Among those who expound the Dharma, you are the foremost.*

## Doctrinal Analysis

### The "Dharani of Turning" (*Xuan Tuoluoni* 旋陀羅尼)
Miao-lo emphasizes that *Xuan* (Turning) means "Revolution."
- It spins rapidly, creating a "solid sphere" of meaning.
- One syllable enters the ear, and the mind instantly "turns" it through all its doctrinal implications (Emptiness, Provisionality, Middle).
- It is the "CPU" of the Tiantai Master—the ability to process data at infinite speed.

### The Validation of "Textual vs. Realization"
Huisi distinguishes Zhiyi from "Text-Only Masters."
- **Text-Only**: Can recite the sutra but don't "turn" it. They are static.
- **Zhiyi**: Has the "Dharani of Turning." He creates new insights that *accord* with the text but are not bound by the literal surface.

## Translator's Reflection

This section functions as the **License to Operate**.
Before Zhiyi gives us the *Mohe Zhiguan* (the manual), Miao-lo has to prove Zhiyi is qualified to write it.
The qualification isn't a PhD. It's:
1.  **Peer Review from a Buddha**: (The Vulture Peak connection).
2.  **Field Test**: (The realization on Mount Dasu).
3.  **Supervisor Approval**: (Huisi's certification: "You are Number One").
