## The Final Four

Fascicle 5 completes the **Ten Objects** by covering the last four:

| # | Object | Type |
|---|---|---|
| 7 | **Wrong Views** | Intellectual obstacles |
| 8 | **Pride** | Attitude obstacles |
| 9 | **Two Vehicles** | Hīnayāna tendencies |
| 10 | **Bodhisattva** | Advanced experiences |

These are **subtle obstacles** that show up at more advanced stages. Unlike Objects 1-6 (which can hit anyone), these four typically show up when you've already made real progress.

---

## Why These Are Last

Miao-lo's explanation:
> "Objects 1-6 are common obstacles most practitioners hit. The final four are subtle obstacles only advanced practitioners face. They're last not because they're least important, but because they arise last."

### The Progression

| Objects | Stage | What They're Like |
|---|---|---|
| **1-6** | Beginning → Intermediate | Gross, obvious |
| **7-8** | Intermediate → Advanced | Subtle, hidden |
| **9-10** | Advanced | Attainment obstacles |

---

## Gross vs. Subtle

**Gross obstacles** (Objects 1-6):
-   Obvious, recognizable
-   Cause clear disturbance
-   Easy to identify

**Subtle obstacles** (Objects 7-10):
-   Hidden, difficult to recognize
-   May look like virtues
-   Hard to identify

> "Gross afflictions are thieves in the open. Subtle obstacles are thieves in disguise. The latter are more dangerous—harder to recognize."

---

## Object 7: Wrong Views (諸見境)

### What It Is

**Wrong Views** = mistaken intellectual understandings about the Dharma, often from partial realization.

### Why It Shows Up Now

After experiencing emptiness or other insights, you might:
-   Cling to conceptual understanding
-   Mistake intellectual knowledge for realization
-   Develop one-sided views
-   Get attached to your own interpretation

### The Danger

> "Wrong views at advanced level are more dangerous than gross afflictions at beginning level. Why? Because you think you've understood, so you stop progressing."

---

## Object 8: Pride (慢境)

### What It Is

**Pride** from **partial attainment**—you've made real progress but mistake it for complete realization.

### Seven Types at Advanced Level

| Type | What It Looks Like |
|---|---|
| **Simple** | "I'm more advanced than other practitioners" |
| **Greater** | "I'm more advanced than my teachers" |
| **Pride of pride** | "I'm among the most advanced" |
| **Self-pride** | "I've attained the Dharma" |
| **Inferior** | "I'm only slightly less advanced than masters" |
| **False** | Pride in non-attainments |
| **Perverse** | Pride in wrong attainments |

### Why It's Subtle

At advanced levels, pride disguises itself as:
-   Confidence in the Dharma
-   Certainty in understanding
-   Authority to teach

> "Most dangerous pride: the pride of having transcended pride."

---

## Object 9: Two Vehicles (二乘境)

### What It Is

Despite practicing Perfect Teaching, you develop **Hīnayāna tendencies**.

### What It Looks Like

-   Want personal liberation only
-   Weary of saṃsāra
-   Lack compassion for beings
-   Satisfied with partial realization
-   Retreat from bodhisattva vows

### Why It Shows Up

After experiencing saṃsāra's suffering deeply and tasting emptiness's peace:
> "Why should I stay in saṃsāra to help others? I could enter nirvāṇa now."

### The Fix

**Recall Bodhi-Mind** (Mode 2):
-   Remember Four Great Vows
-   Cultivate great compassion
-   Study Mahāyāna teachings
-   Do bodhisattva practices

---

## Object 10: Bodhisattva (菩薩境)

### What It Is

**Advanced experiences** on the bodhisattva path—ten stages, supernatural powers, etc.

### Why It's an "Object"

Even here, obstacles can show up:
-   Attachment to bodhisattva attainments
-   Pride in supernatural powers
-   Dharma-attachment to the path itself
-   Subtle clinging to bodhisattva identity

### The Final Obstacle

> "Bodhisattva who clings to being a bodhisattva hasn't completed the path. Only when even the bodhisattva identity is released does one enter complete Buddhahood."

---

## How They Connect

These four form a **progression of subtle obstacles**:

| Object | Nature | What You're Clinging To |
|---|---|---|
| **Wrong Views** | Intellectual | Understanding |
| **Pride** | Attitudinal | Attainment |
| **Two Vehicles** | Motivational | Personal liberation |
| **Bodhisattva** | Identity | The path itself |

---

## Ten Modes on Subtle Obstacles

### The Challenge

With subtle obstacles, **first five modes** might not be enough. You must:

1.  **Recognize** the obstacle (often the hardest part)
2.  **Mode 4** (Break Through) to deconstruct subtle views
3.  **Mode 8** (Know Stages) to avoid pride
4.  **Mode 10** (Let Go) to release attachment

### The Key

> "Subtle obstacles are overcome not by adding more practice but by releasing attachment to practice itself. This is why Mode 10 is critical here."

---

## Luthier's Points

### On Recognition

> "Hardest part: recognizing them. Gross afflictions announce themselves. Subtle obstacles disguise themselves as virtues."

### On Humility

> "Practitioner who thinks they've transcended all obstacles is precisely the one who hasn't. True realization comes with profound humility."

### On Completion

> "When all ten objects have been worked with—when even the bodhisattva path is released—what remains? Not emptiness. Not existence. Not Middle Way. What remains can't be spoken."

## What's Coming

1.  Detailed treatment of Wrong Views and Pride (Section 1)
2.  Detailed treatment of Two Vehicles and Bodhisattva (Section 2)
3.  Integration of all ten objects (Section 3)
4.  Completion of Correct Contemplation chapter

## Summary

**Objects 1-6** (Fascicles 3-4): Gross obstacles for beginners/intermediates

**Objects 7-10** (Fascicle 5): Subtle obstacles for intermediates/advanced

**The progression**: Gross → subtle, obvious → hidden, easy → hard to recognize

**The goal**: Complete liberation through recognizing and releasing all obstacles, even the subtle ones.
