## Opening Word

Fascicle 5 handles the final four objects.

Wrong views.
Pride.
Two-vehicle tendency.
Bodhisattva-level attachment.

These are late-stage obstacles,
subtle enough to wear holy clothes.

---

## Why They Come Last

Early objects strike hard and obvious.
These later objects strike fine and hidden.

Not less important.
More difficult to detect.

They arise where practice has matured,
then test whether maturity is genuine
or merely refined clinging.

---

## Subtle Obstacle Logic

Gross obstacles announce themselves.
Subtle obstacles imitate virtue.

Wrong view can look like clarity.
Pride can look like confidence.
Two-vehicle retreat can look like peace.
Bodhisattva attachment can look like service.

So discernment must deepen.

---

## Four-Object Progression

Wrong views:
clinging to understanding.

Pride:
clinging to attainment position.

Two vehicles:
clinging to private liberation.

Bodhisattva object:
clinging to path-identity itself.

---

## Ten-Mode Emphasis at This Stage

Recognition is hardest work.

Then deconstruct subtle fixation,
stabilize humility through stage-knowledge,
and release dharma-attachment.

Here especially,
more effort is not always the cure.
Release of self-reference is.

---

## Closing Moan

Final objects do not ask
for spiritual performance.

They ask for honesty,
non-clinging,
and compassion that does not retire.
