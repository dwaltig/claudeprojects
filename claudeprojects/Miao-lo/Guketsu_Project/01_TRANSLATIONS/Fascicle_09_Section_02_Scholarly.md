## The Realm of No-Leakage (無漏)

Miao-lo now introduces the **Transcendental Zens**. Unlike the Root Dhyānas (which "leak" back into samsara), these practices sever the bonds of attachment. They are the tools of the Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas, but Bodhisattvas must master them too.

## I. The Impurity Meditations (不淨觀)

Designed to break the most fundamental attachment: lust and body-identification.

### The Nine Thoughts (九想)
1.  **Swelling** (脹想): The corpse bloats.
2.  **Discoloration** (壞想): Turns blue/purple.
3.  **Bloody Flesh** (血塗想).
4.  **Festering** (膿爛想).
5.  **Eaten** (噉想): Birds and beasts consume it.
6.  **Scattering** (散想): Limbs torn apart.
7.  **Bone** (骨想): Only the skeleton remains.
8.  **Burning** (燒想).
9.  **Ash/Dust** (壞滅想).

Miao-lo notes:
> "This is strong medicine. Like using fire to fight fire. It is not the 'True' contemplation of the Middle Way, but without it, the coarse obstacles cannot be removed."

## II. The Eight Back-Sheddings (八背捨 - Aṣṭa Vimokṣāḥ)

Also known as the **Eight Liberations**. "Back" (背) means turning the back on desire; "Shedding" (捨) means removing the attachment.

1.  **Internal forms exist, seeing external forms** (內有色相觀外色): Retaining the perception of one's own body while viewing external impurity.
2.  **Internal forms nonexistent, seeing external forms** (內無色相觀外色): Eliminating the perception of one's own body (skeleton visualization) while viewing external impurity.
3.  **Purified Body leading to the Witnessing of the Pure** (淨身作證): Seeing pure colors/lights. (Transition to formless).
4.  **Infinite Space Absorption**.
5.  **Infinite Consciousness Absorption**.
6.  **Nothingness Absorption**.
7.  **Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception**.
8.  **Extinction of Cessation** (滅受想定): The cessation of feeling and perception. The hallmark of the Arhat.

## III. The Eight Victory Places (八勝處 - Abhibhāyatana)

Mastery over the objects of visualization. The practitioner is not just "shedding" attachment but "conquering" the object—able to make it appear, disappear, or change at will.

1.  **Internal form, external small forms**.
2.  **Internal form, external large forms**.
(And so on, matching the Back-Sheddings but with "Victory" - mastery).

---

## IV. The Ten All-Places (十一切處 - Kṛtsna)

Total pervasion. The practitioner can make the entire universe appear as a single element.

- **Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Blue, Yellow, Red, White, Space, Consciousness.**

Miao-lo explains:
> "If one envisions Water, the entire ten directions become water. There is no shore. This breaks the boundaries of rigid perception."

---

## V. The Nine Sequential Dhyānas (九次第定)

Entering the dhyānas in strict order (1→2→3→4→Space→...→Cessation) without skipping or wavering. This proves the stability of the "Pro Rig."

---

## VI. The Lion Sprint Samādhi (師子奮迅三昧)

The ability to enter and exit these states rapidly, forward and backward. Like a lion shaking off dust, the practitioner shakes off the fixation on any specific state.

---

## VII. The Transcendence Samādhi (超越三昧)

The ultimate mastery of the "Pro Rig." The practitioner can jump from the First Dhyāna directly to the Extinction Samādhi, or from the Earth element directly to Nothingness. This flexibility prepares the mind for the non-dual contemplation of the Bodhisattva.
