## Introduction: The Ten Modes as a Complete System

After understanding the aggregates as the object of contemplation (Section 1), the practitioner now applies the **Ten Modes** (十乘觀法 *Shi Cheng Guan Fa*) to this object.

These Ten Modes are called "Dharma-Vehicles" (法乘) because they **carry** the practitioner from delusion to realization. They are not ten separate practices but **one integrated method** with ten aspects.

---

## Mode 1: Contemplate the Inconceivable Object (觀不思議境)

### The Core Practice

This is the **foundation** of all ten modes. If this mode is mastered, the remaining nine may not be necessary.

**Method**: Observe one moment of mind arising in the aggregates.

**What to See**:
1.  This one thought-moment contains the **ten dharma-realms** (hell, hungry ghosts, animals, asuras, humans, gods, śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, Buddhas)
2.  Each realm contains all ten realms = **100 realms**
3.  Each realm has **ten suchnesses** (如是相 through 如是本末究竟等) = **1,000**
4.  Each is present in **three domains** (five aggregates, sentient beings, lands) = **3,000 worlds**

### The Three Truths in One Thought

When you observe this one thought-moment:
-   **Empty Truth** (空諦): The thought has no inherent existence, no permanent self
-   **Conventional Truth** (假諦): The thought provisionally appears with all its characteristics
-   **Middle Truth** (中諦): The thought is neither empty nor conventional, yet both simultaneously

> "This is not analysis. This is direct seeing. When you see one thought clearly, you see the entire Dharma-realm."

---

## Mode 2: Generate the True Bodhi-Mind (發真正菩提心)

### The Vow

After seeing that one thought contains all beings in all realms, the practitioner generates the vow:

> "I vow to liberate all beings from suffering. I vow to help all beings realize what I have realized."

### The Four Great Vows Applied

| Vow | Application to Aggregates |
|---|---|
| Beings are numberless; I vow to save them | All beings trapped in the five aggregates |
| Afflictions are inexhaustible; I vow to end them | All afflictions arising from aggregate-clinging |
| Dharma-gates are boundless; I vow to master them | All methods for liberating aggregates |
| Buddhahood is unsurpassable; I vow to attain it | Complete realization of aggregate-nature |

### Why This Mode Is Necessary

Without the Bodhi-Mind, contemplation becomes **self-centered**. The practitioner might realize emptiness but lack compassion. This mode ensures that realization leads to action.

---

## Mode 3: Skillfully Stabilize the Mind (善巧安心止觀)

### The Method

Use **Zhi** (止 — calming) and **Guan** (觀 — contemplation) to settle the mind on the aggregates.

**Three Levels**:

| Level | Zhi (Calming) | Guan (Contemplation) |
|---|---|---|
| **Coarse** | Stop gross distraction | Observe gross afflictions |
| **Subtle** | Stop subtle wandering | Observe subtle movements |
| **Ultimate** | Rest in non-stopping | Observe non-observing |

### The Balance

-   **Too much Zhi** → The mind becomes dull, loses clarity
-   **Too much Guan** → The mind becomes scattered, loses stability
-   **Balanced** → The mind is both clear and stable

> "Like tuning a lute: too tight, the string breaks; too loose, no sound; just right, music plays."

---

## Mode 4: Universally Break Through Dharmas (破法遍)

### The Purpose

Even after contemplating the inconceivable nature of the aggregates, **subtle attachments** may remain. This mode systematically deconstructs all views.

### The Four Levels of Breaking Through

| Level | What Is Broken | Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Views of Self** | "I am the aggregates" | See aggregates as empty |
| **Views of Dharmas** | "Aggregates are real entities" | See dharmas as empty |
| **Views of Emptiness** | "Emptiness is the ultimate" | See emptiness as empty |
| **Views of the Middle** | "The Middle Way is supreme" | See Middle as non-abiding |

### The Complete Breakthrough

When all views are broken, what remains? **Nothing to grasp, nothing to reject.** This is true freedom.

---

## Mode 5: Discern Openness and Obstruction (識通塞)

### The Principle

Not all paths lead forward. Some practices **open** the way; others **obstruct** it.

**Openness** (通): Practices that accord with the Three Truths
**Obstruction** (塞): Practices that cling to one-sided views

### Examples

| Practice | Openness | Obstruction |
|---|---|---|
| Contemplating emptiness | ✓ Opens if non-attached | ✗ Obstructs if nihilistic |
| Contemplating form | ✓ Opens if seeing provisional | ✗ Obstructs if reifying |
| Contemplating Middle | ✓ Opens if non-dual | ✗ Obstructs if conceptual |

### The Skill

The practitioner must **recognize** when a practice has become an obstruction and **shift** to what opens the way.

---

## Mode 6: Regulate the Path-Factors (道品調適)

### The 37 Factors of Awakening

When the first five modes are insufficient, the practitioner applies the **37 Factors**:

| Group | Factors | Application |
|---|---|---|
| Four Foundations of Mindfulness | Body, Feelings, Mind, Dharmas | Observe aggregates in detail |
| Four Right Efforts | Prevent, Abandon, Cultivate, Maintain | Manage wholesome/unwholesome |
| Four Bases of Power | Desire, Effort, Mind, Investigation | Develop concentration |
| Five Faculties | Faith, Effort, Mindfulness, Concentration, Wisdom | Balance the practice |
| Five Powers | (Same as Faculties, but stronger) | Overcome obstacles |
| Seven Factors of Awakening | Mindfulness, Investigation, Effort, Joy, Tranquility, Concentration, Equanimity | Approach realization |
| Eightfold Path | Right View through Right Concentration | Complete the path |

### The Regulation

Each factor must be **adjusted** according to the practitioner's current state. Too much effort? Increase tranquility. Too much concentration? Increase investigation.

---

## Mode 7: Apply Antidotes and Supports (對治助開)

### When to Use

If the first six modes are still insufficient, apply **auxiliary practices**:

| Obstacle | Antidote |
|---|---|
| Desire | Contemplate impurity |
| Aversion | Contemplate loving-kindness |
| Delusion | Contemplate dependent origination |
| Pride | Contemplate the elements (earth, water, fire, wind) |
| Scattered thoughts | Count the breath |

### The Support

These practices **support** the main contemplation. They are not the goal but **skillful means** to remove specific obstacles.

---

## Mode 8: Know the Stages (知次位)

### The Six Identities

The practitioner must understand their current level to avoid **pride** (thinking they've arrived) or **despair** (thinking they'll never arrive).

| Stage | Description | Relation to Aggregates |
|---|---|---|
| **Principle Identity** (理即) | Inherently Buddha | Aggregates are Buddha-nature |
| **Name Identity** (名字即) | Hear the teaching | Understand aggregates conceptually |
| **Contemplation Identity** (觀行即) | Begin practice | Contemplate aggregates directly |
| **Resemblance Identity** (相似即) | Approach realization | Aggregates appear as Three Truths |
| **Partial Realization** (分真即) | Break ignorance | See aggregates as they are |
| **Ultimate Identity** (究竟即) | Complete Buddhahood | Perfect realization |

---

## Mode 9: Develop Patience (能安忍)

### The Necessity

The path is long. Obstacles arise. Without **patience** (忍), the practitioner will retreat.

**Three Types of Patience**:
1.  **Patience with suffering** — Endure physical/mental difficulties
2.  **Patience with dharmas** — Accept the teachings without doubt
3.  **Patience with non-arising** — Realize the unborn nature of phenomena

---

## Mode 10: Release Attachment to Dharma (離法愛)

### The Final Obstacle

Even after realizing the nature of aggregates, a subtle attachment may remain: **attachment to the realization itself**.

**Signs of Dharma-Attachment**:
-   Pride in one's attainment
-   Clinging to meditative states
-   Attachment to emptiness
-   Attachment to the Middle Way

### The Release

> "Let go of even the letting go. Release even the release."

When this final attachment is released, the practitioner enters the **first bhūmi** (初地) or the **first abode** (初住) of the Bodhisattva path.
