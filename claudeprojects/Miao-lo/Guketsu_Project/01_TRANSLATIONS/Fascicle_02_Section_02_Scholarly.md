## Source-Aligned Bilingual Block

[01][CN] ○次釋體相中。明此止觀所顯之體。  
[01][EN] Next, in explaining body-and-characteristics, it clarifies the body that this zhiguan manifests.

[02][CN] 雖用止觀以為能顯。止觀是行行藉教興。  
[02][EN] Although stopping-and-contemplation are used as the manifesting agency, stopping-and-contemplation are practice, and practice arises by relying on teaching.

[03][CN] 教為能詮行理為所。行望於理復為能顯。  
[03][EN] Teaching functions as interpretive agent, while practice-principle is what is interpreted; relative to principle, practice again functions as manifesting agency.

[04][CN] 能顯復通因果得失。得謂能顯今之妙體。失謂但屬方便凡小。  
[04][EN] This manifesting function also extends through cause/result and gain/loss: "gain" means being able to manifest the present wondrous body; "loss" means remaining only within expedient means of ordinary and lesser paths.

[05][CN] 是故今文四章顯體。  
[05][EN] Therefore in this text, four sections are used to reveal the body.

[06][CN] 初明來意。亦是結前生後。  
[06][EN] First it explains the intent of arrival; this also concludes what precedes and gives rise to what follows.

[07][CN] 須識體理淵玄者。復以體相望於前二。前二俱橫體相唯竪。故云淵玄。  
[07][EN] One must recognize that body-principle is deep and subtle: in relation to the prior two sections, those two are horizontal while body-characteristics are specifically vertical; therefore it is called deep-subtle.

[08][CN] 次開章別釋中。所詮諦理名之為體。分別權實大小不同。故名為相。  
[08][EN] Next, in chaptered detailed explanation: the truth-principle that is interpreted is called "body"; distinguishing differences of expedient/real and great/small is called "characteristics."

[09][CN] 亦云顯體者。體是所顯。教相眼智即是能顯。能從於所故云顯體。  
[09][EN] It is also called "revealing the body": the body is what is revealed; teaching-characteristics and eye-wisdom are the revealing agents; because the agent follows the revealed, it is called revealing-body.

[10][CN] 初云粗寄四意者。粗略也。體相難申略寄四意方能識體。  
[10][EN] "Roughly lodging in four meanings" means concise approximation: since body-characteristics are difficult to expound, one provisionally relies on four meanings to recognize the body.

[11][CN] 教能詮理故教居初。詣理須行行即眼智。是故居次。  
[11][EN] Because teaching interprets principle, teaching is placed first; reaching principle requires practice, and practice is eye-wisdom, so it is placed second.

[12][CN] 次辨所詣即是理境。是故居次。辨取理人自他得失。是故居次。  
[12][EN] Next one distinguishes what is reached, namely the principle-realm, so it is placed next; then one distinguishes those who obtain principle, including gain/loss for self and others, so it is placed next.

[13][CN] 問。初教相章與釋名何別。答。彼釋通名但得名教。今判同異故云教相。  
[13][EN] Question: how does the first chapter, teaching-characteristics, differ from explaining the name? Answer: there, one explains the common name and only obtains named-teaching; here, one judges sameness and difference, thus it is called teaching-characteristics.

[14][CN] 雖語能詮意在所詮。不約能詮無以辨所。  
[14][EN] Though one speaks of the interpreting agent, the intention is on what is interpreted; without relying on the interpreting side, there is no way to distinguish what is interpreted.

[15][CN] 故釋名四段意在絕待。體相四章意在境界。  
[15][EN] Thus, in four sections of explaining the name, the intent lies in absolute-relativity; in four chapters of body-characteristics, the intent lies in the realm.

[16][CN] 是故四章文四義二。章意在一。  
[16][EN] Therefore these four chapters have four textual divisions and two semantic tracks, yet chapter-intent is one.

[17][CN] 此四一名本出光宅。  
[17][EN] These "four ones" originally come from Guangzhai.

[18][CN] 今家和舊亦作四一。數同名異不全同舊。  
[18][EN] Our school, in harmonizing old usage, also makes four ones; the number is the same but names differ, not wholly identical with the old.

[19][CN] 舊云果一今云理一。若無理印則同魔說。  
[19][EN] The old says "one fruit"; now it says "one principle." Without the seal of principle, it becomes like demonic discourse.

[20][CN] 常為一事即是行一。為眾生說即是教一。  
[20][EN] "Always for one great matter" is one-practice; "preaching for sentient beings" is one-teaching.

[21][CN] 疏釋理一約能知見。  
[21][EN] In the commentary, "one principle" is explained from the side of capable knowing-seeing.

[22][CN] 又為四釋謂四智四門四位觀心。能所相對四章義足。  
[22][EN] It is further explained in four ways: four wisdoms, four gates, four stages, and contemplation of mind; with capable and object set in correspondence, the four chapters are semantically complete.

[23][CN] 智是眼智。門是教相。  
[23][EN] Wisdom corresponds to eye-wisdom; gates correspond to teaching-characteristics.

[24][CN] 觀心秖是稟教證智次位秖是眼智所階。以契於理。  
[24][EN] Contemplating mind is precisely receiving teaching and verifying wisdom; successive stages are precisely the levels traversed by eye-wisdom so as to accord with principle.

[25][CN] 於中先明教相中。初文更明來意故也。  
[25][EN] Within this, teaching-characteristics are explained first, and the opening passage again clarifies intent.

[26][CN] 名即是教故云教相。  
[26][EN] Since name itself is teaching, it is called teaching-characteristics.

[27][CN] 名通凡聖大小偏圓。不能尋之求於別體。別體不顯欲捨偏從圓。無由能致。  
[27][EN] Name extends across ordinary/sage, great/small, and partial/complete; one cannot merely trace name and thereby obtain distinct body. If distinct body is not revealed, there is no way to abandon partial and follow complete.

[28][CN] 今明此章分其相別。教家之相。故云教相。  
[28][EN] This chapter now distinguishes its characteristics as distinct instructional markers; therefore it is called teaching-characteristics.

[29][CN] 言通別者。如大經三十三云。佛言。須陀洹者名為逆流。  
[29][EN] As for shared and distinct, as the Mahaparinirvana Sutra (ch. 33) says, the Buddha states that a srotapanna is called one who goes against the stream.

[30][CN] 迦葉難言。若如是者阿羅漢乃至佛。亦得名為須陀洹耶。  
[30][EN] Kasyapa objects: if so, then from arhat up to buddha, could they also be called srotapanna?
