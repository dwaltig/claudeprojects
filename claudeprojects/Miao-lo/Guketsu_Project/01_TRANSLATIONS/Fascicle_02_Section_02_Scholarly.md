## Introduction: What Is the "Body" of Zhiguan?

The third of the Ten Chapters is **顯體** (*Xian Ti* — "Revealing the Essence/Body"). After knowing the *name*, the practitioner must know the *substance* (essence, body) that the name refers to.

Miao-lo explains that the Essence is revealed through **four sections** (四科 *si ke*):

| # | Chinese | English | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **教相** (*Jiao Xiang*) | **Teaching Characteristics** | What doctrines describe this essence? |
| 2 | **眼智** (*Yan Zhi*) | **Eye and Wisdom** | What faculties perceive this essence? |
| 3 | **境界** (*Jing Jie*) | **Object/Realm** | What is the object/realm of this essence? |
| 4 | **得失** (*De Shi*) | **Attainment and Loss** | Who gets it and who loses it? |

## 1. Teaching Characteristics (*Jiao Xiang*)

### The Problem

There are many kinds of "Zhiguan" taught in Buddhism:

-   **Worldly/Secular** (*Shi Jian*): Calming techniques in non-Buddhist systems.
-   **Tripiṭaka** (*Zang Jiao*): The analytical Zhiguan of the Hīnayāna.
-   **Shared Teaching** (*Tong Jiao*): The "body-contemplating" Zhiguan.
-   **Distinct Teaching** (*Bie Jiao*): The sequential Middle Way Zhiguan.
-   **Perfect Teaching** (*Yuan Jiao*): The non-dual, non-sequential Zhiguan.

### The Resolution

The *Mohe Zhiguan* teaches the **Perfect** (*Yuan*) Zhiguan alone. All other forms are:
1.  Either *included* within the Perfect (by implication).
2.  Or *opened* and revealed as already Perfect (by the principle of *kai quan xian shi* 開權顯實).

> "To practice the name 'Zhiguan' without distinguishing these teachings is like calling every mineral 'gold.' The Perfect Teaching alone reveals the true body."

## 2. Eye and Wisdom (*Yan Zhi*)

### The Five Eyes

| Eye | Chinese | What It Sees |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Flesh Eye | 肉眼 | Physical forms (limited) |
| 2. Heavenly Eye | 天眼 | Subtle forms, distant objects |
| 3. Wisdom Eye | 慧眼 | Emptiness (真諦 *Zhen Di*) |
| 4. Dharma Eye | 法眼 | Conventional truth (俗諦 *Su Di*) |
| 5. Buddha Eye | 佛眼 | Middle Way (中諦 *Zhong Di*) |

### The Three Wisdoms

| Wisdom | Chinese | Corresponds To |
|---|---|---|
| 1. All-Knowing Wisdom | 一切智 | Emptiness |
| 2. Path Wisdom | 道種智 | Conventional truth, expedient methods |
| 3. All-Mode Wisdom | 一切種智 | Middle Way, non-dual |

### Application

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is aimed at the **Buddha Eye** and the **All-Mode Wisdom**. This does not mean the other eyes and wisdoms are abandoned—they are *included* within the Buddha Eye.

> "The Buddha Eye contains all five eyes. The All-Mode Wisdom contains all three wisdoms. To reveal the Perfect Essence is to reveal that which includes all."

---

## 3. Object/Realm (*Jing Jie*)

### The Three Truths as Object

The object of the Perfect Zhiguan is the **Three Truths** (*San Di*):

| Truth | Chinese | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Emptiness | 空諦 | All dharmas are empty of inherent existence. |
| 2. Conventional | 假諦 | All dharmas are provisionally established. |
| 3. Middle | 中諦 | Neither empty nor provisional; both and neither. |

But in the Perfect Teaching, these three are **not three**:

> "Emptiness is not other than Conventional. Conventional is not other than Middle. Middle is not other than Emptiness. The Three Truths are one reality viewed from three angles."

### The Dharma-Nature (*Fa Xing*)

The ultimate "object" of contemplation is **法性** (*Fa Xing* — "Dharma-nature"), also called:
-   **真如** (*Zhen Ru* — "Suchness")
-   **實相** (*Shi Xiang* — "True Characteristic")
-   **法界** (*Fa Jie* — "Dharma-realm")

> "The Dharma-nature is neither internal nor external. It is neither produced nor destroyed. It is neither pure nor impure. It is the essence that Zhiguan reveals."

---

## 4. Attainment and Loss (*De Shi*)

### Who Attains?

-   **Those who attain**: Practitioners who follow the Perfect Teaching, who use the Buddha Eye to contemplate the Three Truths, who understand the non-duality of Zhi and Guan.
-   **Those who lose**: Practitioners who cling to partial teachings, who mistake technique for realization, who remain in the Relative without entering the Absolute.

### The Gradations

| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **Principle** (*Li*) | Everyone already possesses the essence (理即). |
| **Name** (*Ming Zi*) | Some hear the teaching and recognize the name (名字即). |
| **Contemplation** (*Guan Xing*) | Some practice and gain partial insight (觀行即). |
| **Resemblance** (*Xiang Si*) | Some attain a resemblance of the truth (相似即). |
| **Partial Realization** (*Fen Zhen*) | Some break ignorance and see the essence (分真即). |
| **Ultimate** (*Jiu Jing*) | The Buddha alone has fully realized it (究竟即). |

---

## Summary

The "Essence" chapter reveals what the name "Zhiguan" points to:

1.  **Teaching Characteristics**: The Perfect Teaching is the sole doctrine.
2.  **Eye and Wisdom**: The Buddha Eye and All-Mode Wisdom are the faculties.
3.  **Object/Realm**: The Three Truths (as one) are the object.
4.  **Attainment and Loss**: The Six Identities measure the degree of realization.

Together, these four sections ensure that the practitioner does not mistake a partial or inferior essence for the true body of Zhiguan.
