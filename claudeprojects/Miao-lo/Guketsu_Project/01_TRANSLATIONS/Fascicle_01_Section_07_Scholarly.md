## 1. The Problem the Six Identities Solve

Miao-lo opens with a question that has plagued practitioners for centuries:

> "Is the initial mind [of awakening] the same as the final mind [of Buddhahood]? Or are they different?"

This is not an abstract question. It is a practical trap:

| **Trap 1: Arrogance (*Zeng Shang Man*)** | **Trap 2: Discouragement (*Qie*)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| "I have realized the nature of mind. I am already a Buddha." | "Buddhahood is so distant, so perfect. I am a deluded being with no chance." |
| **Result**: Cessation of effort, inflation of ego. | **Result**: Giving up, despair. |

The **Six Identities** destroy both traps. They affirm: **"You are already a Buddha (即)"** while simultaneously clarifying: **"There are six distinct stages of realization (六)."**

## 2. The Source of the Doctrine

Miao-lo cites the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* (*Da Zhidu Lun*):

> "Subhūti asked the Buddha: 'Does one attain Bodhi with the initial mind or the final mind?'"

The Buddha's answer forms the basis of the Six Identities:

> "It is not solely the initial mind, yet not apart from the initial mind."

This is the logic of **"Neither identical nor separate"** (*Bu Ji Bu Li*). The beginner *is* the Buddha in principle, but the beginner is *not* the Buddha in realization.

**Analogy from the Treatise**: A wick must burn from beginning to end to consume the candle. The first flame is not the last flame, yet without the first, the last could never exist. The initial aspiration is essential; the final attainment is its completion.

## 3. The Six Stages Explained

### Stage 1: Identity in Principle (*Li Ji* 理即)
- **Definition**: All sentient beings possess the Tathāgatagarbha (Buddha-embryo). The Three Truths (Emptiness, Provisional Existence, Middle) are inherent but **unknown**.
- **Condition**: The being has never heard the teaching. They use it daily without knowing it.
- **Analogy**: A cow grazing in a field. It stands in the same meadow as a sage but does not know the directions of the compass.

### Stage 2: Identity in Name (*Ming Zi Ji* 名字即)
- **Definition**: Through hearing the teaching (from a Buddha, a teacher, or a scripture), one learns the *names* of the truths: Emptiness, Provisional Existence, Middle, Buddha-nature.
- **Condition**: Intellectual understanding only. No personal realization.
- **Key Emphasis**: This stage is essential. Miao-lo criticizes those who "despise the textual teachings and esteem silent contemplation." Without hearing, how can one know?

### Stage 3: Identity in Contemplative Practice (*Guan Xing Ji* 觀行即)
- **Definition**: Hearing is joined with practice. The practitioner begins to *observe the mind* and correlate that observation with the doctrinal teachings.
- **Condition**: Like a "worm-eaten wood" that *happens* to form a character. The realization is real but unstable.
- **Miao-lo's Caution**: "If one merely hears without practicing, one does not understand the meaning of the text." Hearing without practice is like having eyes without sunlight.
- **Citation from *Shoulengyan* (Śūraṅgama)**: One must practice like learning to shoot a bow—first at a large target, then smaller and smaller, until one can hit a single hair in the dark.

### Stage 4: Identity in Resemblance (*Xiang Si Ji* 相似即)
- **Definition**: Contemplation becomes clearer. The practitioner's understanding of the Three Truths begins to *resemble* the truth without being fully realized.
- **Condition**: Like shooting ever closer to the bullseye. The "Ten Faiths" (*Shi Xin*) of the Bodhisattva path.
- **Miao-lo's Phrase**: "The more one contemplates, the more clear; the more one stops [the mind], the more still."

### Stage 5: Identity in Partial Realization (*Fen Zhen Ji* 分真即 or *Fen Zheng Ji*)
- **Definition**: Entry into the "Copper Wheel" (Initial Abiding, *Chu Zhu*). The practitioner first sees the Three Buddha-Natures, breaks one grade of ignorance, and manifests a portion of the Dharma-body.
- **Condition**: From the First Abiding through Equal Enlightenment (*Deng Jue*), each successive stage deepens like the waxing moon.
- **Miao-lo's Analogy (from *Nirvāṇa Sūtra*)**: Like the moon from the first to the fourteenth day. Each night it grows, yet even the fourteenth night is not the full moon.
- **External Function**: Anyone at this stage can manifest in any of the Ten Dharma Realms to teach beings. "If someone should be saved by a Buddha-body, they appear as a Buddha; if by a Śrāvaka, they appear as a Śrāvaka."

### Stage 6: Ultimate Identity (*Jiu Jing Ji* 究竟即)
- **Definition**: The wisdom-light is complete and full. Bodhi (Wisdom-virtue) and Nirvāṇa (Severance-virtue) are both perfected.
- **Condition**: There is no further path. "Beyond the character *荼* (*Tú*), there is no path."
- **Miao-lo's Metaphor**: Forty-two characters represent the path. The Buddha is the final syllable. There is nowhere else to go.

## 4. The Parable of the Poor Woman and the Gold Treasure

Miao-lo cites the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* to summarize all six stages in a single image:

> There was a poor woman with a great gold treasure buried in her house. She did not know it. A wise man told her of it. She began to dig. Gradually she came closer. Finally, she uncovered the treasure and used it freely.

| **Stage** | **Parable Element** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Li Ji** | The treasure exists in the house. |
| **2. Ming Zi Ji** | A wise man *tells* her about it. |
| **3. Guan Xing Ji** | She "uproots weeds"—begins to dig. |
| **4. Xiang Si Ji** | She "gradually draws near." |
| **5. Fen Zhen Ji** | She "approaches, and the treasury opens." |
| **6. Jiu Jing Ji** | She "takes and uses it completely." |

## 5. Why the Six Identities Belong Uniquely to the Perfect Teaching (*Yuan Jiao*)

Miao-lo states that only the **Perfect Teaching** can use the term **"Identity" (*Ji*)**.

- In the **Tripiṭaka Teaching**: Phenomena are not identical to ultimate truth. There is no "即."
- In the **Shared Teaching**: There is a form of "即" (e.g., form is emptiness), but it applies only to the Three Realms.
- In the **Distinct Teaching**: There is identity in principle, but it unfolds sequentially in practice.
- In the **Perfect Teaching**: All phenomena are *immediately* the Dharma-realm. Even greed and anger are Buddha-nature. This is the only teaching where "六即" can be fully applied.

> "If one were to speak of the Three Preceding Teachings [as having 'Identity'], this would be a shallow, expedient use of the term."

## Summary: The Function of the Six Identities

The Six Identities destroy two diseases:

1.  **Arrogance**: "I am already a Buddha" → *No. You are 'Identity in Principle.' You have not yet realized it.*
2.  **Despair**: "I can never become a Buddha" → *No. You are 'identical' to the Buddha in nature. Realization is a matter of practice, not a change of essence.*

This doctrine allows a practitioner to be simultaneously **humble** (acknowledging their current stage) and **confident** (knowing they possess the full potential).
