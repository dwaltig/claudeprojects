### 1. Header Summary
- Task status: Pass
- Vibration Score: 8.6/10
- Moan Severity: GOSPEL

### 2. Annotated Draft Notes
- "A name gets stood up for living beings." `{RHYTHM: keeps oral cadence while preserving source claim that names are established for beings}`
- "a loving trick" `{LEXICON: keeps upaya force without flattening into academic language}`
- "Horizontal comparisons: cut. Vertical comparisons: cut." `{RHYTHM: blues-percussive phrasing; doctrinally aligned with 破橫竪}`
- "Many names, one Real-Mark." `{LEXICON: compresses 會異 into high-resonance refrain while retaining doctrinal core}`
- "Split the two words and power thins. Join them..." `{RHYTHM: vernacular compression of 二字共通三德 logic}`

### 3. Suggested Rewrites (Applied)
| Original (prior Blues draft) | Blues-heavy rewrite (current) |
|---|---|
| "Think of it like treble and bass." | "Relative means this leans on that. Long leans on short. Big leans on small." |
| "When you stop asking which string is vibrating..." | "Then the blade falls. Horizontal comparisons: cut. Vertical comparisons: cut." |
| "The payoff" framing | "Gate Four: Penetrating the Three Virtues" with direct source-mirroring lines |
| Extended improvisational metaphors | Condensed gospel-moan refrains anchored to source logic |

### 4. Notes
- Meaning-risk lines were constrained by source-locked scholarly section to prevent doctrinal drift.
- Register is intentionally vernacular, but lexical choices were tightened to avoid adding unsourced doctrine.
