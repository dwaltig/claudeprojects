## Object 2: The Affliction Object (煩惱境)

### I. Introduction: From Method to Encounter

Having established the Ten Modes of contemplation (十乘觀法) in Fascicles 5-7, Miao-lo now addresses what happens when the practitioner **encounters phenomena** (歷緣對境) during practice. The Affliction Object is the second of the Ten Objects, arising immediately after the practitioner begins contemplating the aggregates (陰入境).

> 自此以下現文六境及略三境。咸是發得。

"From this point onward, the text presents six objects in detail and three objects briefly. All are 'arising and obtaining' [phenomena]."

This indicates that Objects 2-7 receive full treatment while Objects 8-10 receive condensed treatment. The Affliction Object initiates this sequence.

### II. The Nature of Affliction Arising

Miao-lo identifies three causes for affliction arising during contemplation:

#### A. Habitual Karma (習因)

> 若見思未窮但是習因

"If view-delusions and thought-delusions have not been exhausted, this is simply habitual cause."

The practitioner who has not yet severed the roots of defilement will naturally experience afflictions arising from accumulated habitual patterns. This is not pathological but expected.

#### B. Intentional Karma (作意)

> 若起現行故生煩惱名作意業

"If one generates afflictions through present activity, this is called intentional karma."

This refers to afflictions generated in the present moment through incorrect mental operation—what the Indian tradition calls "unwise attention" (ayoniśomanaskāra, 非如理作意).

#### C. Demonic Activity (魔事)

> 或魔所為令發煩惱

"Or demons may cause afflictions to arise."

Miao-lo includes the possibility that external forces (魔, māra) may intensify afflictions beyond what the practitioner's own karma would produce. This receives full treatment in Object 5 (魔事境).

### III. The Three Poisons and Their Derivatives

Miao-lo organizes afflictions according to the traditional classification:

#### The Root Three (三毒)

| Affliction | Chinese | Function |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Greed | 貪 | Attachment to agreeable objects |
| Hatred | 瞋 | Aversion to disagreeable objects |
| Delusion | 癡 | Confusion regarding neutral objects |

> 遇順境故生貪。遇違境故生瞋。遇非違非順境故生癡。

"Encountering agreeable conditions, greed arises. Encountering disagreeable conditions, hatred arises. Encountering conditions neither disagreeable nor agreeable, delusion arises."

This aligns with Śāntideva's analysis in the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*: when the mind moves toward an agreeable object, passion arises; toward a disagreeable object, hatred arises; toward a neutral object, delusion arises.

#### The Five Coverings (五蓋)

| Covering | Chinese | Characteristic |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Desire | 貪欲蓋 | Craving for sensory pleasure |
| Ill-will | 瞋恚蓋 | Hostility and resentment |
| Sloth-torpor | 睡眠蓋 | Mental dullness and drowsiness |
| Restlessness-remorse | 掉悔蓋 | Agitation and regret |
| Doubt | 疑蓋 | Hesitation regarding the path |

### IV. The Relationship to Prior Practices

Miao-lo addresses why afflictions arise even after the practitioner has completed the preliminary practices of "rejecting desires and abandoning coverings" (訶欲棄蓋):

> 如前訶欲棄蓋。與此何異。

"How does this differ from the previous [teaching on] rejecting desires and abandoning coverings?"

His answer establishes a critical distinction:

> 前是助道方便。今是發得正觀。前是未發。今是已發。

"The previous was a preparatory aid to the path. Now is the arising and obtaining of correct contemplation. The previous was before arising; now is after arising."

The preliminary practices (訶欲棄蓋) prepare the mind for contemplation but do not address what happens **during** contemplation when afflictions intensify due to practice itself. The Affliction Object addresses this second, more subtle level.

### V. The 36-Sentence Framework

Miao-lo introduces the comprehensive framework for analyzing afflictions:

> 六根對六塵生六識。識之所對名事煩惱。三六十八。由觀成二。故成三十六。

"The six sense faculties confronting six sense objects generate six consciousnesses. What consciousness confronts is called 'affair-affliction.' Three times six is eighteen. Because contemplation creates two [categories], it becomes thirty-six."

This produces the 36-sentence structure:

| Category | Sense Organs | Objects | Consciousnesses | Total |
|----------|--------------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Contact | 6 | 6 | 6 | 18 |
| × Observing/Observed | — | — | — | ×2 |
| **Total** | — | — | — | **36** |

Each of the 18 contact-points is examined from two perspectives:
1. **As observer** (能觀): How the practitioner's contemplation relates to the affliction
2. **As observed** (所觀): How the affliction appears as object of contemplation

### VI. Treatment Methods: Gradual and Sudden

#### A. Gradual Treatment (思議)

The gradual approach applies specific antidotes (pratipakṣa, 對治) to specific afflictions:

| Affliction | Antidote | Chinese |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Greed | Impurity contemplation | 不淨觀 |
| Hatred | Loving-kindness contemplation | 慈悲觀 |
| Delusion | Dependent origination contemplation | 因緣觀 |
| Distraction | Breath-counting | 數息觀 |
| Arrogance | Element-contemplation | 界分別觀 |

This corresponds to the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s prescription: impurity (aśubha) for passion, loving-kindness (maitrī) for hatred, dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda) for delusion.

#### B. Sudden Treatment (不思議)

The sudden approach does not apply antidotes but directly perceives the empty nature of afflictions:

> 煩惱即菩提。不須更斷。

"Afflictions are precisely bodhi. There is no need for further severance."

This accords with the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*'s ultimate teaching: "By the very understanding of these afflictions, there is bodhi. Whatever is the nature of afflictions, that is the nature of bodhi."

Miao-lo clarifies that this is not license for indulgence:

> 非謂縱任。乃是了達煩惱性空。

"This does not mean indulgence. It means thoroughly penetrating that the nature of afflictions is empty."

### VII. Applying the Ten Modes to Afflictions

Miao-lo demonstrates how each of the Ten Modes applies to the Affliction Object:

#### Mode 1: Contemplating the Inconceivable Object (觀不思議境)

> 觀煩惱即是法界。一念三千。無非佛法。

"Contemplate that afflictions are precisely the dharma-realm. In one thought, three thousand [realms]. Nothing is not Buddha-dharma."

The affliction is not observed as something to be eliminated but as the very manifestation of the three thousand realms in a single moment of thought. Greed, when contemplated correctly, reveals the entire structure of reality.

#### Mode 2: Arousing the Bodhi-Mind (發菩提心)

> 因煩惱發大誓願。眾生無邊煩惱無盡。

"Because of afflictions, generate the great vow. Sentient beings are limitless; afflictions are inexhaustible."

The Four Great Vows are aroused precisely because afflictions exist. Without afflictions, there would be no need for the bodhisattva path.

#### Mode 3: Skillfully Settling the Mind (善巧安心)

> 安心於煩惱。不動不轉。

"Settle the mind upon afflictions. Neither moving nor turning."

Rather than fleeing from afflictions, the practitioner settles the mind directly upon them, using them as the very object of stabilization.

#### Mode 4: Breaking Through All Dharmas (破法遍)

> 破煩惱相。見煩惱空。

"Break through the characteristics of afflictions. See that afflictions are empty."

This applies the breaking-through contemplation specifically to afflictions, dismantling their appearance of solidity.

#### Mode 5: Discerning Openness and Obstruction (識通塞)

> 煩惱即塞。了煩惱空即通。通塞不二。

"Afflictions are precisely obstruction. Understanding afflictions as empty is precisely openness. Openness and obstruction are non-dual."

The diagnostic function of Mode 5 determines whether the practitioner is blocked by or liberated through afflictions.

#### Modes 6-10: Complete Application

The remaining modes (調道品, 助道對治, 識次位, 能安忍, 無法愛) are applied similarly, with afflictions serving as the specific object to which each mode addresses itself.

### VIII. The Four Perversities (四顛倒)

Miao-lo connects afflictions to the fundamental perversities:

| Perversity | Takes | For | Chinese |
|------------|-------|-----|---------|
| 1 | Impermanent | Permanent | 常顛倒 |
| 2 | Suffering | Happiness | 樂顛倒 |
| 3 | Non-self | Self | 我顛倒 |
| 4 | Impure | Pure | 淨顛倒 |

> 此四顛倒是煩惱之根本。

"These four perversities are the root of afflictions."

All afflictions ultimately derive from these four fundamental misperceptions. The treatment of afflictions therefore requires addressing these root causes.

### IX. The Eight Kinds of Arrogance (八慢)

Miao-lo lists the eight forms of pride that constitute subtle afflictions:

1. **慢** (māna) — Basic pride: thinking oneself superior
2. **過慢** (atimāna) — Excessive pride: thinking oneself equal to superiors
3. **慢過慢** (mānātimāna) — Pride upon pride: thinking oneself superior to superiors
4. **我慢** (asmimāna) — Self-pride: attachment to the five aggregates as "I"
5. **增上慢** (adhimāna) — Presumptuous pride: claiming attainments not realized
6. **卑慢** (ūnamāna) — Pride of inferiority: thinking "I am only slightly inferior"
7. **邪慢** (mithyāmāna) — Wrong pride: pride in wrong accomplishments
8. **傲慢** — Arrogance: general condescension toward others

### X. Doctrinal Significance

The Affliction Object (煩惱境) establishes a foundational principle for Tiantai practice: afflictions are not merely obstacles to be eliminated but **objects of contemplation** that reveal the nature of reality when correctly approached.

This differs from gradual paths that treat afflictions solely as enemies:

> 若但斷煩惱。未見煩惱性。雖似離煩惱。還復起煩惱。

"If one merely severs afflictions without seeing the nature of afflictions, although one seems to leave afflictions behind, they will arise again."

The Tiantai approach—grounded in the Perfect Teaching (圓教)—perceives afflictions as the very material through which enlightenment manifests. This does not excuse indulgence but requires the deepest penetration of affliction's empty nature.

## Cross-References

- **Indian Sources**: The antidote framework aligns with *Śikṣāsamuccaya* Ch. 9 (Kṣāntipāramitā) and Ch. 13-14 (Smṛtyupasthāna, Ātmabhāvapariśuddhi)
- **Tiantai Context**: This section presupposes the Ten Modes from Fascicles 5-7, especially Mode 4 (Breaking Through) and Mode 5 (Openness/Obstruction)
- **Lotus Sūtra Connection**: The "afflictions as bodhi" teaching derives from the One Vehicle doctrine wherein nothing is excluded from the path
