問曰。
> Question:
有何因緣輒集此記。
> What causes and conditions led you to compile this record?
答。
> Answer:
事不獲已。
> The matter could not be avoided.
述此緣起凡有十意。
> In setting forth these causes and conditions, there are in all ten intentions.
一為知有師承非任胸臆異師心故。
> First, so one knows there is lineage-transmission, and does not rely on personal impulse and diverge from the teacher's intent.
二為曾師承者而棄根本隨未見故。
> Second, because some who once received lineage-transmission abandon the root and follow what they have not truly seen.
三為後代展轉隨生異解失本依故。
> Third, because in later generations, as transmission passes onward, divergent interpretations arise and the original basis is lost.
四為信宗好習餘方無師可承稟故。
> Fourth, for those faithful to this school who study in other regions where no teacher is available to receive transmission from.
五為義觀俱習好憑教者行解備故。
> Fifth, for those who cultivate both doctrinal understanding and contemplation and rely on teaching, so that practice and understanding are both complete.
六為點示關節廣略起盡宗要文故。
> Sixth, to point out the crucial joints, the extensive and the brief, the beginnings and endings, and the essential textual purport.
七為建立師解使不淪墜益來世故。
> Seventh, to establish the teacher's interpretation so it does not sink and fall away, thereby benefiting future ages.
八為自資觀解以防誤謬易尋討故。
> Eighth, to support my own contemplative understanding, guard against error, and make inquiry and discussion easier.
九為呈露所解恐有迷忘求刪削故。
> Ninth, to present my understanding, fearing confusion and forgetfulness, and to seek correction and deletion where needed.
十為隨順佛旨運大悲心利他行故。
> Tenth, to accord with the Buddha's intent, apply the great compassionate mind, and carry out conduct that benefits others.
此之一部前後三本。
> This single work has three versions, earlier and later.
其第一本二十卷成。
> The first version was completed in twenty fascicles.
并第二本十卷成者。
> And the second version was completed in ten fascicles.
首並題為圓頓者是為異偏小及不定故。
> Both were initially titled "Perfect-Sudden," in order to distinguish them from partial-Hinayana and indeterminate teachings.
其第二本即文初列竊念者是。
> The second version is precisely the one whose opening text begins with "I privately ponder" (qie nian).
其第三本題意少異。
> The title-intent of the third version is somewhat different.
具如後釋。
> This is fully explained later.
初云止觀明靜者是。
> It begins with the phrase, "Zhiguan is luminous and still."
今之所承即第三本。
> What we now receive is exactly this third version.
時人相傳多以第三而為略本。
> People of the time transmitted that the third was mostly the abbreviated version.
以第二本號為廣本。
> And they called the second version the expanded version.
一往觀之似有廣略。
> At first glance, it seems there is an expanded/abbreviated difference.
尋討始末紙數乃齊。
> But when examined from beginning to end, the page count is in fact equal.
應以第三為再治本不須云略。
> Therefore, the third should be taken as a re-edited version; it need not be called abbreviated.
甞於聽次諮決所聞。
> Formerly, during lectures, I consulted and resolved what I had heard.
并尋經論思擇添助。
> And I searched sutras and treatises, considered and selected, and added support.
非率胸臆謬有所述。
> I did not recklessly write from personal impulse in error.
准釋經論。
> According to scriptural and treatise exegesis,
皆分三段。
> all are divided into three sections.
今文正說尚自未周。
> In this text, the main exposition itself is still not complete.
信無第三流通明矣。
> It is clear there is truly no third, circulation section.
唯開章前章安著序可為序分。
> Only before the chapter-opening, Zhang'an's authored preface may be taken as preface section.
開章已去為正說分。
> From chapter-opening onward is the main exposition section.
舊第二本將序及正合為十章。
> The old second version combined preface and main exposition as ten chapters.
故文初云竊念述聞共為十意。
> Thus at the beginning it says, "private reflection and recorded hearing together make ten intentions."
言竊念者謂私竊興念。
> "Private reflection" means privately aroused thought.
序有五意。
> The preface has five intentions:
一商略。
> First, general discussion.
二祖承。
> Second, ancestral transmission.
三辨差。
> Third, distinguishing differences.
四引證。
> Fourth, citation and proof.
五示處。
> Fifth, indicating place.
言述聞者謂記其所受。
> "Recorded hearing" means recording what one received.
正說亦五意。
> The main exposition also has five intentions:
一開章。
> First, opening chapters.
二生起。
> Second, generative sequence.
三分別。
> Third, distinctions.
四料簡。
> Fourth, analytical selection.
五解釋。
> Fifth, explanation.
以將己序及所聽聞合為十段意似未穩。
> To combine one's own preface and what was heard into ten sections seems not fully stable.
故再治定沒斯次第但成序正。
> Therefore, in revised redaction this sequence was removed, leaving only preface and main exposition.
又於序中唯發起等無歸敬者。
> Also, in the preface there are only opening remarks and the like, without homage.
推功於師述記而已。
> It merely attributes merit to the teacher and records what was heard.
若就大師正說文中義開三段。
> If one follows the Great Master's main exposition text, its meaning opens into three sections:
則前六重以為序分。
> the first six layers are the preface section,
正觀果報以為正宗。
> Correct Contemplation and Fruit-Result are the main doctrine,
起教化他為流通分。
> and Arising Teaching for benefiting others is the circulation section.
旨歸既是化息歸寂。
> Since Ultimate Return is the cessation of transformation and return to quiescence,
非三所攝義似流通。
> though not included in those three, in meaning it resembles circulation.
疏中約行尚對三學以為三分。
> In the commentary, by practice it is still matched to the three trainings as three sections.
今亦例彼義開於三有何不可。
> Now, by analogy to that, opening meaning into three has no problem.
今且依前二段為正。
> For now, we take the former two sections as correct.
於初序中加序所聞時處等事以為通序。
> In the initial preface, matters such as time and place of what was heard are added as general preface.
用舊祖承人法等事以為別序。
> Matters of old ancestral transmission, persons, and dharma are used as specific preface.
即再治定之正意也。
> This is exactly the intended meaning of the revised redaction.
不得復用商略等五。
> One must no longer use the five such as general discussion
以為次第而分再治時處等文。
> as sequence to divide the revised text's passages on time, place, and related matters.
故再治定迴舊商略以為圓證。
> Therefore revised redaction turns the old general discussion into Perfect proof.
故下用此商略文云。
> Thus below it uses this general-discussion passage, saying:
今依經更明圓頓。
> "Now, relying on sutra, we further clarify Perfect-Sudden."
言依經者正當引證證圓頓竟。
> "Relying on sutra" means precisely citation and proof; after proving Perfect-Sudden,
請證餘二。
> it requests proof of the other two.
即設問云。
> Then it sets the question, saying:
餘三昧願聞誠證。
> "Regarding the other samadhis, we wish to hear true proof."
第二本中闕此問也。
> This question is missing in the second version.
故第二本商略文云。
> Therefore the second version's general-discussion passage says:
略引佛經粗彰圓意。
> "Briefly citing Buddhist scriptures to roughly manifest Perfect intent."
故知商略不異引證。
> Hence we know general discussion is not different from citation/proof.
故再治定沒商略名迴為引證。
> Therefore revised redaction removes the name general discussion and turns it into citation/proof.
若將前本商略等名次第屬對治定本文。
> If names like general discussion from the former version are sequentially mapped onto the revised base text,
則使止觀明靜等文便為徒設。
> then passages such as "Zhiguan is luminous and still" become pointless additions.
況將商略以對祖承深為未可。
> All the more, taking general discussion to correspond to ancestral transmission is deeply unacceptable.
是故須廢舊章次第。
> Therefore the old chapter sequence must be discarded.
今再治定加通序者欲類結集傳述所聞法體等五。
> Now adding a general preface in revised redaction is to model compilation-style transmission, including five items such as what was heard and dharma-body.
故不同舊商略居初。
> Therefore it differs from the old arrangement that placed general discussion first.

已述新舊有無次第。
> We have already set forth the old and new sequence of presence and absence.
所以改稱摩訶名者有二義故。
> The reason for changing the title to "Mohe" has two meanings.
一者為對俗兄出小止觀。
> First, it was to correspond to the Small Zhiguan composed for the lay elder brother.
二者為存梵音兼含之富。
> Second, it was to preserve the Sanskrit sound's richness of combined meanings.
故大論云。
> Therefore, the Great Treatise says:
言摩訶者名含三義。
> "The term mohe contains three meanings."
謂大多勝。
> Namely: great, many, and superior.
依疏四教釋比丘位則非今意。
> To interpret bhiksu ranks by the Four Teachings according to the commentary is not the present intent.
用此三名釋圓三觀正當題旨。
> Using these three names to explain the Perfect Teaching's three contemplations exactly fits the title's purport.
大是空義多是假義勝是中義。
> Great is emptiness-meaning, many is provisional-meaning, superior is middle-meaning.
是故改從兼含之名。
> Therefore, it was changed to a name with combined inclusion.
以題一心三觀之部。
> This serves as the title for this treatise on one-mind three contemplations.
若爾。
> If so,
何異圓頓改從摩訶。
> how is this different from changing "perfect-sudden" to "mohe"?
答。
> Answer:
圓頓之名雖異偏漸。
> Although the name "perfect-sudden" differs from partial and gradual,
其言通總闕於含三。
> its wording is broad and general but lacks inclusion of the three.
故改此土單淺之音以存彼語多含之稱。
> Therefore we change this land's single and shallow sound to preserve that language's title rich in multiple inclusions.
以是應知止觀二字無非摩訶。
> From this one should know that the two characters zhi and guan are nothing other than mohe.
即是一心三止三觀之止觀也。
> They are precisely the zhi-guan of one-mind three zhis and three guans.
故知總攬一部以為首題。
> Therefore we know the whole treatise is comprehensively gathered as the heading-title.
始自大意終於旨歸無非摩訶之止觀也。
> From Great Meaning at the beginning to Ultimate Return at the end, all is mohe zhi-guan.
是則題名是總十章為別。
> Thus the title is the general, and the ten chapters are the particular.
於十章中則大意為總餘八是別。
> Within the ten chapters, Great Meaning is general, and the remaining eight are particular.
故知總別自行因果化他能所咸是摩訶妙定慧也。
> Therefore know that general/particular, self-practice cause/effect, and transforming-others agent/object are all mohe's wondrous samadhi and wisdom.
何者於總釋中發心修行自行因也。
> Why? In the general exposition, arousing mind and cultivation are self-practice cause.
次感大果自行果也。
> Next, realizing the great fruit is self-practice fruit.
次裂大綱化他能也。
> Next, opening the great outline is the ability for transforming others.
既有能化必有所被。
> Since there is ability to transform, there must be those transformed.
文略舉能以攝於所。

能所事畢同入旨歸。
> When agent/object are complete, both enter the Ultimate Return.
於別釋中始從釋名終至正觀自行因也。
> In the particular exposition, from Explaining the Name through Proper Contemplation is self-practice cause.
次果報章自行果也。
> Next, the Fruits-and-Rewards chapter is self-practice fruit.
起教一章化他能也。
> The Arising-Teaching chapter is the ability in transforming others.
所被義當化他所也。
> In meaning, those transformed correspond to the object in transforming others.
後三大章其文闕略義意同前總中後三。
> The latter three major chapters are textually abbreviated, but their meaning matches the latter three in the previous general section.
是故後文略而不說。
> Therefore the later text is brief and not explained.
初序分為二。
> The initial preface section is divided into two.
於通序中雖類集經通中五事既是私記。
> In the common preface, although it resembles the five items in collected-sutra common prefaces, this is a private record.
故闕同聞。
> Therefore, co-hearers are omitted.
於中為六。
> Within it there are six items.
初之四字述所聞體。
> The initial four characters state the substance of what was heard.
止觀二字正示聞體。
> The two characters zhi-guan directly indicate the heard substance.
明靜二字歎體德也。
> The two characters ming-jing praise the virtue of that substance.
謂止體靜觀體明也。
> That is: zhi-substance is still, guan-substance is luminous.
始終十章正觀十法莫非止觀體咸明靜。
> From beginning to end, in ten chapters and ten dharmas of proper contemplation, all are zhi-guan whose substance is entirely luminous and still.
則通指一部以為所聞。
> Thus it generally points to the whole treatise as what was heard.
如法華經本門迹門無非妙法體咸真實。
> As in the Lotus Sutra's origin-gate and trace-gate, all are wondrous Dharma whose substance is entirely true-real.
前代未聞者明能聞人。
> "Not heard in previous generations" clarifies the person able to hear.
反以他往顯成我聞述己兼他語現及往。
> By contrast with others in the past, it reveals "my hearing," speaking of oneself while including others, in language of present and past.
故云前代。
> Therefore it says "previous generations."
今章安聞已遠霑餘世後代可聞。
> Now that Zhang'an heard it, this has far-moistened later ages, so later generations can hear.
所言代者雖義立三十年今取代更為異世義。
> As for "generation," although one meaning sets it at thirty years, here it is taken as the meaning of a different age.
異世弘法世世有之故云代也。
> Since Dharma is propagated in different ages, age after age, it is called "generation."
自漢明夜夢洎乎陳朝。
> From Emperor Ming of Han's night-dream down to the Chen dynasty,
凡諸著述當代盛行者溢目。
> writings flourishing in their own times filled the eyes.
預廁禪門衣鉢傳授者盈耳。
> Those included in Chan-gate robe-and-bowl transmissions filled the ears.
豈有不聞止觀二字。
> How could there have been none who heard the two characters zhi-guan?
但未若天台說此一部。
> Yet none were like Tiantai's exposition of this single treatise.
定慧兼美義觀雙明。
> Samadhi and wisdom are jointly excellent; doctrine and contemplation are doubly luminous.
撮一代教門攢法華經旨。
> It gathers the teaching-gates of an era and assembles the Lotus Sutra's purport.
成不思議十乘十境。
> It forms the inconceivable ten vehicles and ten objects.
待絕滅絕寂照之行。
> It teaches the practice of severing attachment even to severance, of quiescent illumination.
前代未聞斯言有在。
> "Not heard in previous generations" truly has warrant in these words.
故南山歎云。
> Therefore Nanshan praised, saying:
唯衡岳台崖雙弘禪慧。

從德為名故用靜義。

因即為王立法號云。
> Thereupon he gave the prince a Dharma name, saying:
大王。
> Great Prince,
紆遵聖禁名曰總持。
> in reverent accord with holy precepts, your name is Zongchi (Total Retention).
王曰。
> The prince said:
師傳佛法燈稱為智者。
> You, Master, who transmit the Buddha-dharma lamp, should be called Zhizhe.
今從後說故云智者。
> Now we follow this later appellation, thus "Zhizhe."
大隋等者說教時也。
> "Great Sui" and so on indicates the time of teaching.
諸經既多乃通云一時。
> Since many sutras exist, they generally say "at one time."
則該乎長短攝彼精麁。
> That encompasses long and short, including refined and coarse.
今唯一部故別指大隋。

旋荊置寺以答地恩。

初名一音後改玉泉。
> It was first named Yiyin, later changed to Yuquan.
泉色如玉因以名焉。
> The spring's color was like jade, therefore the name.
寺者。
> As for "monastery":
西方云僧伽藍此云眾園亦通名精舍。
> In the western regions it is called sangharama; here "assembly-garden," also generally called vihara.
此間方俗通以九司官舍曰寺。
> In this region's custom, official residences of the nine ministries are commonly called si.
謂有法度之處也。
> Meaning places with regulations.
故以法度之稱以名精舍。
> Therefore the term for regulated offices was used to name monasteries.
至十四年時年五十七。

於彼玉泉而說止觀。
> There at Yuquan he taught Zhiguan.
次重明分齊。

初明時分齊。

一夏者通舉始終策修之限。

以無緣慈心無依倚恣樂說辨故曰不窮。
> By unconditioned compassion, mind without dependence, freely delighting in eloquent exposition, it is called inexhaustible.
位居五品乃是觀行無緣慈也。
> His rank residing in fifth grade is contemplative-practice unconditioned compassion.
霔者如大論第五評四法師偈云。
> As for "downpour," Great Treatise fascicle 5 evaluates four kinds of Dharma teachers in verse:
多聞辯慧巧言語美說諸法轉人心。
> Much learning, eloquent wisdom, clever words, beautifully speaking dharmas that turn people's minds.
自不如法行不正譬如雲雷而無雨(其一)廣學多聞有智慧訥口拙言無巧便。
> Yet one does not practice according to Dharma and conduct is not right, like clouds and thunder without rain (first). Broad learning, much hearing, with wisdom, but mouth is dull and speech awkward, without skillful expression.
不能顯發法寶藏譬如無雷而小雨(其二)不廣學問無智慧不能說法無好行。
> Unable to reveal the Dharma-treasure, like no thunder with only light rain (second). Not broad in study, without wisdom, unable to preach Dharma and lacking good conduct.
是弊法師無慚愧譬如小雲無雷雨(其三)多聞廣智巧言語美說諸法轉人心。
> Such a corrupt teacher without shame is like small clouds with neither thunder nor rain (third). One with much learning, broad wisdom, clever speech, beautifully preaching dharmas that turn minds.
行法心正無所畏如大雲雷霔洪雨(其四)偈意以多聞為雲說法如雷慈行如雨。
> Whose practice is according to Dharma, mind upright and fearless, like great clouds and thunder pouring vast rain (fourth). The verse means much hearing is cloud, preaching is thunder, compassionate practice is rain.
大師具三即第四法師。
> The Great Master possessed all three and thus was the fourth kind of Dharma teacher.
雖樂說不窮者。
> As for being inexhaustible in joyful preaching:
辯有四種。

謂義法辭樂說也。
> namely eloquence of meaning, dharma, wording, and joyful preaching.
義謂顯了諸法之義。
> Meaning means clearly explaining the meaning of all dharmas.
法謂稱說法之名字。
> Dharma means stating the names of dharmas.
辭謂能說名之語言。
> Wording means language able to speak those names.
雖有此三必須樂說說前三也。

後三大章及餘三境託緣不終。
> The final three great chapters and remaining three objects were not completed due to contingent conditions.
故傳中云。
> Therefore the biography says:
灌頂私記止觀十卷。
> Guanding privately recorded Zhiguan in ten fascicles.
方希再聽畢其首尾。
> He had hoped to hear again and complete beginning and end.
會智者涅槃鑽仰無所。
> But Zhizhe entered nirvana, and there was nowhere to seek instruction.
餘文雖略准上可知。
> Though remaining text is brief, one can know it by the above.
增上慢者如禪境云。
> As for arrogance, the Chan-object section says:
無所知人得此謂為無生忍。

四禪比丘謂為四果。
> A bhiksu in fourth dhyana claims it as the four fruits.
起絕言見鼠唧鳥空。

後三大章亦准五略後之三略。
> The latter three major chapters also accord with the latter three summaries of the Five Summaries.
其文雖闕於義已足。
> Though their wording is absent, in meaning they are already sufficient.
故託夏末以為闕緣。
> Therefore, the end of the summer retreat is taken as the condition for this omission.
信行圓乘於茲罷唱故云法輪停轉。
> The teaching for faithful practice of the perfect vehicle ceased here, therefore it is said "the Dharma-wheel stopped turning."
被行略周餘止不說故云後分弗宣。
> Since the covered praxis had been outlined sufficiently, the remaining parts were not expounded, therefore it is said "the latter section was not proclaimed."
弗者不也。
> "Fu" means "not."
然挹流尋源下別序也。
> Now, "drawing from the stream and seeking the source" below is the separate preface.
前言通者義通而文別。
> Earlier, what was called "common" is common in meaning but particular in wording.
別語止觀明靜等故。
> Because it uses particular expressions such as "zhi-guan ming-jing."
今別序者意別而存通。
> As for this separate preface, its intention is separate while retaining what is common.
通語二十三師等故。
> Because it uses common expressions such as "the twenty-three masters."
雖通別不同而亦不出師資人法。
> Though common and separate differ, they still do not go beyond persons and Dharma in teacher-disciple transmission.
故通序中止觀秖是師資所聞所說之法。
> Therefore, in the common preface, zhi-guan is simply the Dharma heard and spoken by teacher and disciple.
次舉能聞能說之人。
> Next, it raises the persons who can hear and can speak.
次明聞說若時若處。
> Next, it clarifies when and where this hearing and speaking occurred.
故舉通中所聞之法如香如流。
> Therefore, it cites in the common section the Dharma that was heard, as fragrance and as stream.
令知大覺如根如源。
> This makes one know great awakening as root and as source.
又此別者雖無餘部可望。
> Further, though this separate section has no other treatise to compare with,
師資所承三部不同。
> within teacher-disciple transmission, the three works received are distinct.
頓對餘二故名為別。
> In direct contrast to the other two, it is therefore named "separate."
又此所承與諸師異亦名為別。
> Also, what is transmitted here differs from other masters, and is thus called "separate."
於中先明祖承付法由漸。
> Within this, first it clarifies the patriarchal succession by gradual Dharma-transmission.
若不先指如來大聖無由列於二十三祖。
> If one does not first point to the Great Sage Tathagata, there is no basis for listing the twenty-three patriarchs.
若不列於二十三祖無由指於第十三師。
> If one does not list the twenty-three patriarchs, there is no basis for indicating the thirteenth master.
若不指於第十三師。
> If one does not indicate the thirteenth master,
無由信於衡崖台岳。
> there is no basis for trusting Heng, Ya, Tai, and Yue.
故先譬其由如尋源討根。
> Therefore, its process is first likened to seeking the source and investigating the root.
今之止觀興于像末如流如香。
> The present zhiguan flourishes in the Semblance and Final ages, like a stream and like fragrance.
金口梵音如根如源。
> The Brahma-sound from the Golden Mouth is like root and source.
挹者斟酌也。
> "Yi" means to ladle and measure.
詩云。
> The Odes says:
惟北有斗不可挹酒漿。
> "Only in the north is there the Dipper, yet it cannot ladle ale and wine."
酌其流須尋其濫觴。
> To draw from its flow, one must seek its headwaters.
知其香須討其根本。
> To know its fragrance, one must seek its root and basis.
故大經云。
> Therefore the Great Sutra says:
聞其香氣則知其地當有是藥。
> On smelling its fragrance, one knows that land should have this medicine.
其藥真味停留在山猶如滿月。
> The medicine's true flavor abides in the mountain, like the full moon.
隨其流處有種種名。
> Following where its stream reaches, there are various names.
真味實理也。
> The true flavor is the real principle.
眾名末教也。
> The many names are the latter teachings.
滿月譬實理也。
> The full moon is a metaphor for the real principle.
在山譬理在陰也。
> Being in the mountain is a metaphor for principle abiding in concealment.
如來依理隨機立名。
> The Tathagata establishes names by relying on principle and adapting to capacities.
像末四依弘宣佛化。
> In the Semblance and Final ages, the Four Reliances broadly proclaim Buddha-transformation.
受化稟教須討根源。
> Those who receive transformation and instruction must seek root and source.
若迷於根源則增上濫乎真證。
> If one is deluded about root and source, overestimation corrupts true realization.
若香流失緒則邪說混於大乘。
> If fragrance and stream lose their thread, heterodox claims mix into Mahayana.
由是而知台衡慧文宗于龍樹。
> From this, one knows that Tiantai's Huiwen takes Nagarjuna as ancestral source.
二十三聖繼踵堅林。
> The twenty-three sages followed one another in a firm succession.
實有由也良可信也。
> There truly is a causal line; it is indeed credible.
論曰至次良者欲明付法。
> From "the treatise says" down to "next, liang," it intends to clarify Dharma transmission.
汎引教驗有師無師。
> It broadly cites teachings as evidence for both having a teacher and having no teacher.
言無師者如大論第二云。
> As for no teacher, Great Treatise fascicle two says:
我行無師保志一無等侶。
> In my practice I have no teacher-guardian; my resolve is one, without equal companion.
積一行得佛自然通其道。
> Accumulating the one practice, one attains Buddhahood and naturally penetrates its path.
增一第十五云。
> Ekottarika, fascicle fifteen, says:
阿若等五人問佛。
> Ajnata and four others asked the Buddha:
師為是誰。
> Who is your teacher?
佛答云。
> The Buddha answered:
我亦無師保亦復無等侶。
> I too have no teacher-guardian and likewise no equal companion.
獨等無過者冷而無復溫。
> Unique, equal to none and surpassed by none, cool with no return to heat.
律文大同。
> Vinaya passages are largely the same.
那先經云。
> The Naxian Sutra says:
佛無師成道自悟一切法法華云。
> The Buddha, without teacher, attained the Way and self-awakened to all dharmas; the Lotus says:
佛智無師智。
> Buddha-wisdom is wisdom without teacher.
俗中太師太傅太保皆師義也。
> In secular usage, Grand Preceptor, Grand Tutor, and Grand Guardian all carry the sense of teacher.
次云有師。
> Next it speaks of having a teacher.
受莂等者。
> Receiving prediction and related cases:
莂字謂派莂亦分別。
> The character bie's means branching differentiation, also discrimination.
字書多作別字如瑞應云。
> Lexicons often write it as bie; as Ruijing says:
至于昔者定光佛興時。
> In former times, when Dipankara Buddha appeared,
我為菩薩名曰儒童乃至買華奉定光佛。
> I was a bodhisattva named Rutong, and even bought flowers to offer Dipankara Buddha.
散華供養華住空中。
> Scattering flowers in offering, the flowers remained in space.
佛知其意而讚歎言。
> The Buddha knew his intent and praised, saying:
汝無數劫所學清淨。
> For countless kalpas your training has been pure.
因記之曰。
> Thereupon he gave prediction, saying:
汝自是後九十一劫。
> After this, in ninety-one kalpas,
劫號為賢。
> the kalpa will be named Wise.
汝當作佛名釋迦文。
> you shall become Buddha named Sakyamuni.
乃至身升虛空得無生忍。
> Eventually his body rose into space and he attained patience of non-arising.
論云無師經稱記莂。
> The treatise says no-teacher; sutras call it predictive designation.
書言去復引俗典亦具二義。
> After citing canonical statements, it again cites secular classics, which also contain these two meanings.
生知如無師學成如記莂。
> Innate knowing corresponds to no-teacher; knowledge completed through study corresponds to prediction.
故論語云。
> Thus the Analects says:
生而知之者上。
> Those who know by birth are highest.
學而知之者次。
> Those who know through learning are next.
困而學之又其次也。
> Those distressed yet who learn are next again.
困而不學民斯為下矣。
> Distressed yet not learning: such people are lowest.
良者善也長也。
> Liang means good and also chief.
書雖不論久遠因果。
> Though the classic does not discuss long-range cause and effect,
今且汎引相似之言以證二義於理無失。
> for now it broadly cites similar statements to prove these two meanings; in principle there is no error.
讀此文者應以良字而為句末。
> Readers of this passage should take liang as the end of the sentence.
世有不曉句逗之人以良字為句頭甚為未隱。
> Some in the world do not understand sentence pauses and place liang at sentence-beginning, which is quite inappropriate.
如第二本下句頭復有然字。
> For example, in the second version the next sentence already begins with ran.
豈可讀彼第二本云良然法門等耶。
> How could one read that second version as liang-ran dharma-gate, and so on?
故不可用。
> Therefore that reading cannot be used.
然無師之與記莂約事雖殊其理不二。
> Yet no-teacher and prediction differ in event, while their principle is nondual.
在因必藉師保果滿稱為獨悟。
> At the causal stage one must rely on teacher-guidance; when fruit is full it is called solitary awakening.
以此因果共為諸師所承元祖。
> By this, cause and fruit together serve as the primal ancestor inherited by all masters.
次法門浩妙至藍而青者。
> Next, from "the dharma-gate is vast and subtle" to "blue from indigo":
汎舉法喻問上二途。
> it broadly raises Dharma and analogy to question the above two routes.
人既分於事理因果。
> Since persons are divided by event/principle and cause/fruit,
所證法體亦分二耶。
> is the realized Dharma-body likewise divided in two?
浩者水大貌。
> Hao means the appearance of vast waters.
法既大妙為事為理。
> If the Dharma is great and subtle, is it event or principle?
為天真獨朗者問無師法為從藍而青者問學成法。
> "Naturally true and singly bright" asks the no-teacher Dharma; "blue from indigo" asks Dharma completed through learning.
理非造作故曰天真。
> Principle is uncreated, therefore called naturally true.
證智圓明故云獨朗。
> Realizing wisdom is perfectly bright, therefore called singly luminous.
由師染習故曰從藍由學功遂故曰而青。
> Conditioned through teacher-training, it is called from indigo; accomplished through study, it is called blue.
書云。
> The classic says:
青出於藍而青於藍染使然也。
> Blue comes from indigo yet is bluer than indigo; this is caused by dyeing.
今引染義非引勝藍。
> Now it cites the dyeing meaning, not the "bluer-than-indigo" meaning.
行人若聞至宗元者總答也。
> From "if practitioners hear" to "ancestral source" is the general answer.
宗尊也主也。
> Zong means honored and also primary.
元首也長也。
> Yuan means head and also chief.
若尋所傳法展轉相付乃識能傳人元由宗緒。
> If one traces transmitted Dharma through successive handing-on, one then knows the transmitting persons' primal origin and lineage.
故識一期佛為元由。
> Therefore one knows the Buddha of a given period as the primal source.
方曉今師宗於龍樹。
> Only then does one understand that our present lineage takes Nagarjuna as ancestor.
從大覺至降魔者別答也。
> From "Great Awakening" to "subduing Mara" is the specific answer.
先雙酬兩問大覺義當天真行滿義當記莂。
> First it answers both questions together: Great Awakening corresponds to natural truth; completion of practice corresponds to prediction.
人之與法兩意咸爾。
> For persons and Dharma alike, both meanings are so.
二意兼備師資道成。
> With both meanings complete, teacher-disciple way is accomplished.
故書云。
> Thus the classic says:
崐竹未剪則鳳音不彰。
> If Kun bamboo is uncut, phoenix tones do not manifest.
情性未鍊則神明不發。
> If disposition is unrefined, spiritual clarity does not emerge.
凡情既待鍊而發故真理亦由學而成。
> Since ordinary dispositions emerge through refinement, true principle likewise is accomplished through learning.
覺者詩云有覺德行。
> As for awakening, the Odes says, "there is awakened virtuous conduct."
又云覺者大明也。
> It also says awakening means great brightness.
曉也直也。
> It means understanding and uprightness.
今亦如是。
> Now likewise so.
十號具足種智圓明。
> The ten titles complete, seed-wisdom perfectly bright.
三惑頓盡大夜斯曉。
> The three delusions suddenly exhausted, the great night thereby dawns.
二死永除無復迴曲。
> The two deaths forever removed, no further turning or crookedness.
又覺滿等名為大覺。
> Also, fullness of awakening and so on is called Great Awakening.
四教不同覺智亦異。
> The four teachings differ, and awakening-wisdom also differs.
且寄漸始通總而說略云大覺。
> For now, using gradual beginnings in a broad/general way, it is briefly called Great Awakening.
以覺大故世間中尊。
> Because awakening is great, he is world-honored among beings.
積劫行滿者亦通總而說。
> Accumulated kalpas and completed practice are likewise spoken broadly and generally.
是故不云三阿僧祇及以無量阿僧祇等。
> Therefore it does not state three asamkhyeyas and immeasurable asamkhyeyas, etc.
劫此云時。
> Kalpa here means time.
俱舍等論多以二十增減為一中劫。
> Treatises such as Abhidharmakosa mostly take twenty increase-decrease cycles as one middle kalpa.
八十增減為一大劫。
> Eighty increase-decrease cycles make one great kalpa.
金光明云。
> Golden Light says:
梵天三銖天衣三年一拂。
> Brahma heaven's three-zhu heavenly robe brushes once every three years.
拂盡畟方四十里石以為小劫。
> When it wears out a forty-li square stone, that is one small kalpa.
八十里盡以為中劫。
> Wearing out eighty li makes a middle kalpa.
百二十里盡名為大劫。
> Wearing out one hundred twenty li is called a great kalpa.
不於如此劫數修學不名菩薩。
> Without cultivation over such kalpa counts, one is not called bodhisattva.
又云。
> It also says:
有一里劫二里劫乃至萬里劫。
> There are one-li kalpas, two-li kalpas, up to ten-thousand-li kalpas.
又云。
> It also says:
有大方城周四十里。
> There is a great square city forty li in circumference.
滿中芥子不概令平。
> Fill it with mustard seeds, not leveling it by pressing.
百年取一盡名為劫。
> Taking one every hundred years, when exhausted it is called a kalpa.
經劫無數名阿僧祇。
> Passing through countless kalpas is called asamkhyeya.
委出劫義非文正意故不廣明。
> A detailed exposition of kalpa-meaning is not this passage's main intent, so it is not extensively explained.
涉六年以伏見至降魔者。
> From enduring six years, subduing wrong views, up to subduing Mara:
伏見為調外道降魔為摧天魔。
> Subduing views means taming non-Buddhist doctrines; subduing Mara means crushing the heavenly Mara.
故六年苦行過其所行。
> Therefore the six-year ascetic practice exceeded what others practiced.
先同後異化道宜然。
> First conforming then differing, this is fitting for the transforming path.
故五人中著愛行者而捨之去。
> Hence among the five men, those attached to desire-practice left him.
過六年已食食修禪。
> After six years, he ate food and cultivated meditation.
著見行者又捨之去。
> Those attached to view-practice also left him.
後降天魔樹王成道。
> Later he subdued heavenly Mara and attained the Way beneath the king of trees.
降魔之相廣在諸經。
> The signs of subduing Mara are extensively recorded in various sutras.
且瑞應云。
> For example, Ruijing says:
天魔與佛相難詰。
> Heavenly Mara challenged and questioned the Buddha.
佛云。
> Buddha said:
丈夫會當鬪戰死終不身在為他降。
> A true man should fight even to death and never live only to submit to others.
魔云。
> Mara said:
比丘何求坐樹下樂於林藪毒獸間。

雲起可畏杳冥冥。
> Clouds rise, fearful and dim-dark.
天魔圍繞不以驚。

佛云。

古有真道佛所行。

佛云。
> Buddha said:
吾覩欲盛吞火同棄國如唾無所貪。
> I see desire blazing like swallowing fire; I cast away kingship like spittle, craving nothing.
得王亦有老死憂去此無利勿妄譚。
> Even gaining kingship still has the grief of aging and death; apart from this there is no benefit, so do not speak vainly.
魔云。
> Mara said:
何安坐林而快語委國財位守空閑。
> Why sit at ease in the forest, speaking boldly, abandoning kingdom, wealth, and rank to keep empty solitude?
而不見我興四兵象馬步兵億百千。

大集觀佛三昧等云。
> Great Collection, Contemplation of Buddha Samadhi, and others say:
魔王初欲來戰於佛。

既成道已說必託處故略舉此始中終三。
