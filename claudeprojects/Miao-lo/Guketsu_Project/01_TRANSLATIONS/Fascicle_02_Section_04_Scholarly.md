## Source-Aligned Bilingual Block

[01][CN] ○四明漸頓者。初釋名也。  
[01][EN] Fourth, clarifying gradual and sudden: first, explanation of names.

[02][CN] 三觀三智次第而入。藉者由也。因空入假因假入中。  
[02][EN] The three contemplations and three wisdoms are entered in sequence; "reliance" means proceeding by stages: from emptiness into provisional and from provisional into middle.

[03][CN] 故云藉淺。為中道故先修二觀。為利他故先斷己縛。故云由深。  
[03][EN] Thus it is called relying on what is shallow; for middle-way realization one first cultivates two contemplations; for benefiting others one first cuts one's own bonds, thus called proceeding from depth.

[04][CN] 足極二名有通有別。通則俱通初後。別則極後足初。  
[04][EN] The two terms "sufficiency" and "ultimacy" have both shared and distinct meanings: in the shared sense both run through beginning and end; in the distinct sense, ultimacy is at the end while sufficiency is present at the start.

[05][CN] 漸扶於偏頓扶於圓。旁出異義更互相成。  
[05][EN] Gradual supports the partial; sudden supports the complete; side distinctions further complete one another.

[06][CN] 大小半滿亦復如是。  
[06][EN] Great/small and half/full are likewise so.

[07][CN] 前之二教是漸非頓者。據設教意而得漸名。  
[07][EN] The first two teachings are gradual and not sudden according to pedagogical intent.

[08][CN] 法華開竟俱名為頓。今若開竟漸即是頓。故云是菩薩道。  
[08][EN] After Lotus opening-revelation they are all called sudden; when opening is completed, gradual itself is sudden, therefore it is called bodhisattva-path.

[09][CN] ○五權實者。初釋名。此權本是諸佛妙體。體內方便故名權謀。  
[09][EN] Fifth, expedient and real: first, explanation of names. This expedient originally belongs to the buddhas' wondrous body; as expedience within that body, it is called expedient strategem.

[10][CN] 問者。何意用權復用實耶。  
[10][EN] Question: why employ expedient means and then employ the real?

[11][CN] 答意者。初總明用教之意。眾生機薄以權成熟。若機熟已開權廢權。  
[11][EN] Answer: first, generally clarifying instructional intent: beings of weak capacities are matured by expedient means; when capacities mature, expedients are opened and then set aside.

[12][CN] 施開廢等。皆約四悉。為是義故具用權實。  
[12][EN] Applying, opening, and setting aside are all explained through the four siddhantas; for this reason both expedient and real are fully employed.

[13][CN] 若不約五味無以顯於法華實部。  
[13][EN] Without reference to the five flavors, there is no way to reveal the Lotus as the real division.

[14][CN] 教中雖有權實之名。並是為他不獲而說。故名為彊。  
[14][EN] Though teaching contains the names expedient and real, both are spoken in constrained form for others; therefore it is called forced designation.

[15][CN] 對權下釋無別理所以。對破權教故說實教。  
[15][EN] In explaining why there is no separate principle: real teaching is spoken in order to break expedient teaching.

[16][CN] 是故雙非之理不異一實之理。  
[16][EN] Therefore the principle of double-negation is not different from the one-real principle.

[17][CN] 即教下開教顯理。廢教廢權尚即顯理。況即文字是實相理。  
[17][EN] Under "in teaching," opening teaching reveals principle: even setting aside teaching and expedient still reveals principle, all the more so when textual expression itself is real-aspect principle.

[18][CN] 非權非實下。以一止觀結。  
[18][EN] Under "neither expedient nor real," it is concluded by one zhiguan.
