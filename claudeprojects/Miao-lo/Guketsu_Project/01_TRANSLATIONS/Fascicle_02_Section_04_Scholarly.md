## Introduction: Why Distinguish Partial from Complete?

The fifth of the Ten Chapters is **偏圓** (*Pian Yuan* — "Partial and Complete"). After knowing how Zhiguan embraces all teachings, the practitioner must understand *which* form of Zhiguan is ultimate.

This chapter distinguishes:
-   **偏** (*Pian*) — Partial, one-sided, incomplete.
-   **圓** (*Yuan*) — Complete, round, perfect.

## The Five Gates of Distinction

Miao-lo explains that Partial and Complete are distinguished through **five gates** (五門 *wu men*):

| # | Chinese | English | Question |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **大小** (*Da Xiao*) | **Great and Small** | Is the teaching Mahāyāna or Hīnayāna? |
| 2 | **半滿** (*Ban Man*) | **Half and Full** | Is the teaching complete or incomplete? |
| 3 | **漸頓** (*Jian Dun*) | **Gradual and Sudden** | Is the path step-by-step or immediate? |
| 4 | **權實** (*Quan Shi*) | **Expedient and True** | Is the teaching provisional or ultimate? |
| 5 | **偏圓** (*Pian Yuan*) | **Partial and Complete** | Is the principle one-sided or all-encompassing? |

## 1. Great and Small (*Da Xiao*)

### Definition

| Category | Characteristic | Teachings |
|---|---|---|
| **Small** (*Xiao*) | Aimed at individual liberation | Tripiṭaka (三藏) |
| **Great** (*Da*) | Aimed at universal liberation | Shared, Distinct, Perfect (通・別・圓) |

### Application

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is a **Great Vehicle** teaching. It is not a method for personal escape from saṃsāra. It is a method for realizing the truth that all beings will attain.

---

## 2. Half and Full (*Ban Man*)

### Definition

| Category | Characteristic | Teachings |
|---|---|---|
| **Half** (*Ban*) | Only part of the truth is taught | Tripiṭaka, Shared |
| **Full** (*Man*) | The complete truth is taught | Distinct, Perfect |

### Application

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is a **Full** teaching. It does not withhold anything. Even the Distinct Teaching, though "Full," is only half-revealed because it teaches the Middle Way *sequentially* rather than *immediately*.

> "A half-full cup is not empty. But it is not full either."

---

## 3. Gradual and Sudden (*Jian Dun*)

### Definition

| Category | Characteristic | Teachings |
|---|---|---|
| **Gradual** (*Jian*) | Step-by-step cultivation | Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct |
| **Sudden** (*Dun*) | Immediate realization | Perfect |

### Application

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is a **Sudden** teaching. This does not mean "quick" or "easy." It means:

> "The first moment of practice is not different in *kind* from the final moment of Buddhahood. The difference is only in *degree*."

---

## 4. Expedient and True (*Quan Shi*)

### Definition

| Category | Characteristic | Teachings |
|---|---|---|
| **Expedient** (*Quan*) | Adapted to the needs of the audience | Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct |
| **True** (*Shi*) | The ultimate teaching | Perfect |

### Application

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is the **True** teaching. All other teachings are "expedient" (*quan*) in the sense that they are adapted to lower capacities. But:

> "The Expedient is not rejected. It is *opened* to reveal the True that was always present."

---

## 5. Partial and Complete (*Pian Yuan*)

### Definition

| Category | Characteristic | Teachings |
|---|---|---|
| **Partial** (*Pian*) | One-sided; lacking the full scope | Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct |
| **Complete** (*Yuan*) | All-encompassing; nothing excluded | Perfect |

### Application

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is the **Complete** teaching. The term **圓** (*Yuan*) has three meanings:

1.  **Round** (*Yuan*): No corners, no exclusions, nothing left out.
2.  **Perfect** (*Yuan*): Fully realized, no deficiency.
3.  **Sudden** (*Yuan*): Immediate, not gradual.

> "The moon is called *yuan* because it is round. The Complete Teaching is called *yuan* because it lacks nothing."

## Summary Table

| Gate | Small/Large | Half/Full | Gradual/Sudden | Expedient/True | Partial/Complete |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tripiṭaka** | Small | Half | Gradual | Expedient | Partial |
| **Shared** | Great | Half | Gradual | Expedient | Partial |
| **Distinct** | Great | Full | Gradual | Expedient | Partial |
| **Perfect** | Great | Full | Sudden | True | Complete |

---

## The Practical Implication

The practitioner of the *Mohe Zhiguan* must understand:

1.  **Do not mistake the Partial for the Complete.** If you practice only the Tripiṭaka or Shared Teaching, you will attain only partial liberation.
2.  **Do not reject the Partial.** The Partial teachings are *contained* within the Complete. They are opened, not abandoned.
3.  **Aim for the Complete.** The goal is the Perfectly Complete (*Yuan Dun*) Zhiguan.
