## Introduction: The Heart of the Practice

The seventh of the Ten Chapters is **正觀** (*Zheng Guan* — "Correct Contemplation"). This is the **main practice** of the *Mohe Zhiguan*—the actual method of meditation.

It consists of:
-   **Ten Objects** (十境 *Shi Jing*) — What you observe
-   **Ten Modes** (十乘觀法 *Shi Cheng Guan Fa*) — How you observe

---

## The Ten Objects (*Shi Jing*)

The Ten Objects are the **phenomena that arise** during meditation. The first object is fundamental; the others may or may not arise depending on the practitioner.

| # | Chinese | English | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **陰入界** | Aggregates, Bases, Elements | The five aggregates, twelve bases, eighteen elements |
| 2 | **煩惱** | Afflictions | Desire, aversion, ignorance arising |
| 3 | **病患** | Illness | Physical sickness arising during practice |
| 4 | **業相** | Karmic Impressions | Past karma manifesting |
| 5 | **魔事** | Demonic Disturbances | Māra's interference |
| 6 | **禪定** | Meditative States | Attainment of dhyāna |
| 7 | **諸見** | Wrong Views | Mistaken understandings arising |
| 8 | **慢** | Pride | Arrogance arising |
| 9 | **二乘** | Two Vehicles | Hīnayāna tendencies arising |
| 10 | **菩薩** | Bodhisattva | Bodhisattva experiences arising |

### The Logic

1.  **Object 1 (Aggregates)** is the starting point. Every practitioner begins by observing their own body-mind.
2.  **Objects 2-5** are obstacles that may arise from within or without.
3.  **Objects 6-10** are attainments or developments that the practitioner may mistake for the final goal.

> "Whatever arises, use it. The obstacle becomes the path."

## The Ten Modes of Contemplation (*Shi Cheng Guan Fa*)

For **each** of the Ten Objects, the practitioner applies the **Ten Modes**. These are also called the "Ten Dharma-Vehicles" because they carry the practitioner to the goal.

| # | Chinese | English | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **觀不思議境** | Contemplate the Inconceivable Object | See the Three Truths in the object |
| 2 | **發真正菩提心** | Generate the True Bodhi-Mind | Aspire to complete Buddhahood for all |
| 3 | **善巧安心** | Skillfully Stabilize the Mind | Use appropriate methods to calm |
| 4 | **破法遍** | Universally Break Through Dharmas | Deconstruct all views |
| 5 | **識通塞** | Discern Openness and Obstruction | Know what aids and what hinders |
| 6 | **道品調適** | Regulate the Path-Factors | Adjust the 37 Factors of Awakening |
| 7 | **對治助開** | Apply Antidotes and Supports | Use auxiliary practices when needed |
| 8 | **知次位** | Know the Stages | Understand one's current level |
| 9 | **能安忍** | Develop Patience | Endure without retreating |
| 10 | **離法愛** | Release Attachment to Dharma | Let go of even the attainment |

### The Logic

-   **Modes 1-5** are the core practice. For a sharp-rooted practitioner, these may be sufficient.
-   **Modes 6-7** are remedial. Used when the first five are insufficient.
-   **Modes 8-10** are protective. They prevent falling into errors.

> "Use as many as you need. The goal is realization, not following a formula."

## The First Mode: Contemplating the Inconceivable Object

The heart of the practice is **觀不思議境** — contemplating the **Inconceivable Object**.

### What Is the Inconceivable Object?

The object of contemplation is **one moment of mind** (*yi nian xin* 一念心). This single thought-moment contains:

-   **Ten Dharma-Realms** (十法界): Hell, Hungry Ghosts, Animals, Asuras, Humans, Heavenly Beings, Śrāvakas, Pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, Buddhas.
-   **Each realm contains all ten realms**: 10 × 10 = 100 realms.
-   **Each realm has Ten Suchnesses** (十如是): 100 × 10 = 1,000 suchnesses.
-   **Each suchness is present in Three Domains**: 1,000 × 3 = 3,000 worlds.

This is the famous doctrine of **一念三千** (*yi nian san qian* — "Three Thousand Worlds in One Thought-Moment").

### How to Contemplate

1.  **Observe** the arising of a single thought.
2.  **Recognize** that this thought is not separate from the Three Truths (Empty, Conventional, Middle).
3.  **Realize** that this one thought contains all dharmas, all realms, all times.

> "One thought is the entire Dharma-realm. The entire Dharma-realm is one thought."

## Summary

The Correct Contemplation chapter is the **practical core** of the *Mohe Zhiguan*:

| Component | Number | Function |
|---|---|---|
| **Objects** | 10 | What arises during practice |
| **Modes** | 10 | How to work with what arises |
| **Core Doctrine** | 3,000 in One Thought | The inconceivable nature of mind |

This is where the theory becomes practice. Everything prior was preparation.
