## Source-Aligned Bilingual Block

[01][CN] 一觀心下正解十法中。初釋境者。  
[01][EN] Under "one-mind contemplation," in the main explanation of the ten dharmas, first comes explanation of object.

[02][CN] 問。前引諸文廣明境竟。此中秖應明能觀觀。何故復明不思議境。  
[02][EN] Question: earlier passages already explained object extensively; here one should only explain contemplative agency. Why explain inconceivable object again?

[03][CN] 答。前雖示體但直指心。心為一切法之本。故示體是心。  
[03][EN] Answer: previously, though body was shown, it only directly pointed to mind; mind is root of all dharmas, so body was shown as mind.

[04][CN] 然未委示不思議相。猶恐人迷。  
[04][EN] Yet inconceivable characteristics were not explained in full detail, so confusion remains possible.

[05][CN] 是故今文妙觀觀之令成妙境。境方稱理。復以所觀顯於能觀。  
[05][EN] Therefore this text applies wondrous contemplation to make wondrous object; only then object corresponds to principle, and what is contemplated clarifies contemplative agency.

[06][CN] 妙境義成妙觀斯立為是義故復明於境。  
[06][EN] Since wondrous object meaning is established, wondrous contemplation is thereby established; for this reason the object is explained again.

[07][CN] 又為知妙境為九乘本。稱本修九方堪入位。是故名為十乘妙觀。  
[07][EN] Also to show that wondrous object is root of the nine vehicles: only by cultivating the nine according to that root can one enter stages; therefore it is called ten-vehicle wondrous contemplation.

[08][CN] 於中先明可思議。次明不思議。  
[08][EN] Within this, the thinkable is clarified first, then the inconceivable.

[09][CN] 言易解者。已聞思議十界歷別。示此十界同在一心。則一心中十界可識。  
[09][EN] "Easy to understand" means one has already heard of ten realms in thinkable differentiation; by showing all ten within one mind, ten realms in one mind become knowable.

[10][CN] 若棄思議。當知是人二法俱失。  
[10][EN] If one discards the thinkable level, know that this person loses both dimensions of the teaching.

[11][CN] 下之九境還移此觀以觀諸境。阿伽陀藥遍治眾病。  
[11][EN] For the nine subsequent objects, this same contemplation is transferred to each object; like agada medicine, it cures many illnesses universally.

[12][CN] 不思議下正明不思議境文異義一。意非一異。  
[12][EN] Under the inconceivable section, wording varies but meaning is one; intent is not fixed as one-versus-different.

[13][CN] 以三諦法不出修性自他故也。  
[13][EN] This is because the dharma of three truths does not go beyond cultivation/nature and self/other.

[14][CN] 心如工畫師造種種五陰。一切世界中。無法而不造。  
[14][EN] Mind is like a master painter producing various five aggregates; in all worlds there is no dharma it does not produce.

[15][CN] 若人欲求知三世一切佛應當如是觀。心造諸如來。  
[15][EN] If one wishes to know all buddhas of the three times, one should contemplate thus: mind produces all tathagatas.

[16][CN] 言心造者不出二意。一者約理造即是具。二者約事不出三世。  
[16][EN] "Mind-made" has two senses: in principle, making is possessing; in events, it does not exceed the three times.

[17][CN] 今欲修觀但觀理具。俱破俱立俱是法界。  
[17][EN] In cultivating contemplation now, one contemplates principled possession: both deconstruction and establishment are all dharma-realm.

[18][CN] 任運攝得權實所現。雖復種種不出十界三世間等。  
[18][EN] It spontaneously gathers manifestations of expedient and real; though various, they do not exceed ten realms and three world-classes.

[19][CN] 法界者下釋法界名。問。法界法性名義何別。答。名異義異而體是一。  
[19][EN] Under "dharma-realm," the name is explained: Question, what differs between dharma-realm and dharma-nature in name and meaning? Answer: names differ, meanings differ, but body is one.

[20][CN] 一切諸法皆以三諦而為界分。為明三諦故須加十以顯相狀。  
[20][EN] All dharmas take three truths as their delimiting structure; to make three truths explicit, ten are added to display characteristics.
