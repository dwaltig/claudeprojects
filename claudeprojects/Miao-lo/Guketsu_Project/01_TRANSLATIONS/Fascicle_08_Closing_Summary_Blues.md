## The Three Internal Obstacles: Summary

### What Fascicle 8 Covered

You've got the Ten Modes (tools). Now you know what they're for:

| Object | Chinese | What Breaks | How You Work It |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Affliction | 煩惱境 | Mind rebels | Antidotes / See empty nature |
| Illness | 病患境 | Body breaks | Six treatments / Body as path |
| Karma | 業境 | Past surfaces | Four powers / Karma is empty |

**These are internal.** They come from you.

---

## The Pattern

### Every Object Gets the Same Treatment

**Gradual approach**: Apply specific medicine to specific disease.
- Greed → Impurity practice
- Hatred → Loving-kindness
- Element imbalance → Breath regulation
- Old karma → Four powers

**Sudden approach**: See the empty nature directly.
- Afflictions = Bodhi
- Illness = Dharma-realm
- Karma = Fundamentally empty

**The integration**: Use both. Match method to capacity.

---

## The Ten Modes Applied

### Same Tools, Different Territory

Each obstacle gets all ten modes applied:

| Mode | Applied to Obstacles |
|------|---------------------|
| 1. Inconceivable Object | See obstacle as three truths |
| 2. Arousing Mind | Generate compassion through obstacle |
| 3. Settling Mind | Neither run nor chase |
| 4. Breaking Through | Deconstruct the obstacle |
| 5. Openness/Obstruction | Diagnose the situation |
| 6. Adjusting Path-Factors | Fit method to condition |
| 7. Counteractive Aids | Apply specific antidotes |
| 8. Knowing Position | Locate yourself honestly |
| 9. Patient Endurance | Stay with it |
| 10. No Dharma-Love | Don't cling to success |

**Same ten tools. Applied to whatever shows up.**

## The Key Teaching

### Obstacles Are the Path

> "Obstacles are precisely the path. There are no obstacles to leave behind."

**Not**: The path is obstacle-free.
**But**: The obstacles are what you work with.

The musician doesn't play silence. The musician plays notes — including the wrong ones, the missed ones, the unexpected ones.

**That's the gig.**

---

## What's Different About Tiantai

### Not Gradual, Not Sudden

**Gradual schools**: Remove obstacles one by one. Become pure. Then realize.

**Sudden schools**: Realize first. Obstacles were always empty. Nothing to remove.

**Tiantai (Perfect Teaching)**: Obstacles and realization are non-dual. Work with them while seeing through them.

> "This is the Perfect Teaching's approach: understanding [obstacles] as empty while respecting their functional power."

**Translation**: You don't pretend the fire isn't hot. You also don't pretend the fire is solid.

## From Rehearsal to Gig

### The Transition Complete

Fascicles 5-7: **Rehearsal**. Here are your ten methods.

Fascicle 8: **The gig starts**. Here's what happens when you actually try.

Your mind rebels? Mode 1-10 on afflictions.
Your body breaks? Mode 1-10 on illness.
Your past surfaces? Mode 1-10 on karma.

**Same instruments. Live performance.**

## What's Coming

### External Obstacles

Fascicle 8 covered what's inside.

Fascicle 9 covers what's outside:

| Object | Chinese | What It Is |
|--------|---------|------------|
| 5. Demons | 魔事境 | External interference |
| 6. Meditation States | 禪定境 | Getting high on practice |
| 7. Wrong Views | 邪見境 | Mistaken understanding |

These require different treatment because they involve phenomena from outside your immediate experience.

**But the pattern remains**: Ten Modes applied to whatever shows up.

## The Luthier's Take

### The Full Set

You want to play a full set? You gotta play through:

- **The nerves** (affliction) — When your hands shake
- **The pain** (illness) — When your back gives out
- **The regrets** (karma) — When old mistakes haunt you

And later:

- **The hecklers** (demons) — When external forces interfere
- **The high** (meditation states) — When success becomes a trap
- **The confusion** (wrong views) — When you don't know what's real

**That's the full set.**

No shortcuts. No skipping tracks. Play through all of it.
