## What We Covered

Fascicle 3 is where **theory becomes practice**. This is the actual method for **Correct Contemplation** (正觀).

## The Sections

### Opening
-   Ten Objects + Ten Modes structure
-   Object 1 (Aggregates) is universal
-   Objects 2-10 are conditional

### Section 1: The Five Aggregates
-   Form, Feeling, Perception, Formations, Consciousness
-   Three methods: Analytical, Embodying, Inconceivable
-   **Bottom line**: One thought = 3,000 worlds

### Section 2: The Ten Modes
-   Complete method for working with aggregates
-   Ten aspects of one integrated practice
-   **Bottom line**: Sharp practitioners might only need 1-5

### Section 3: Troubleshooting
-   Eight common obstacles
-   Practical fixes
-   **Bottom line**: Obstacles are opportunities

### Section 4: The Other Nine Objects
-   Afflictions through Bodhisattva
-   When they show up, how to work with them
-   **Bottom line**: Whatever arises, use it

## The Core Teaching

**一念三千** — "3,000 in One Thought"

Not a metaphor. Actual reality:
-   One thought = ten realms
-   Each contains all ten = 100
-   Each has ten suchnesses = 1,000
-   Each in three domains = **3,000 worlds**

---

## The Complete Structure

| Part | Number | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Objects** | 10 | What shows up |
| **Modes** | 10 | What you do with it |
| **Obstacles** | 8 (common) | Problems and fixes |
| **Core** | 3,000 in One | The inconceivable nature |

---

## How Objects and Modes Work Together

**Object 1 (Aggregates)** = Foundation:
-   Everyone starts here
-   Master this, might not need the rest
-   Apply Ten Modes systematically

**Objects 2-10** = Conditional:
-   Only show up if needed
-   Same Ten Modes
-   Each becomes a vehicle

## Luthier's Key Points

### On Aggregates
> "Aggregates aren't separate from Buddha-nature. See them clearly, you see Buddha-nature."

### On Ten Modes
> "Sharp practitioners: Modes 1-5. Average: need 6-7. Everyone: must understand 8-10."

### On Obstacles
> "Obstacles aren't enemies. They're opportunities. Each one, fixed properly, moves you forward."

### On Other Objects
> "Whatever shows up, use it. Every object, worked with properly, becomes a vehicle."

## What's Next (Fascicles 4-10)

-   **4-5**: Detailed treatment of specific objects/modes
-   **6-7**: Advanced applications
-   **8-10**: Fruit, Teaching, Ultimate Return

## For the Practitioner

**The method**:
1.  Start with aggregates
2.  Apply Ten Modes
3.  Recognize obstacles
4.  Work with whatever shows up
5.  Realize one thought contains all

**The goal**: Not to transcend aggregates, but to **see what they actually are**—empty, conventional, middle.
