## Opening Word

After the first object (aggregates),
other objects may arise conditionally.

If first-object work is fully stabilized,
these may not dominate.
If they do arise,
the same ten-mode method applies.

---

## Nine Conditional Objects

Afflictions.
Illness.
Karmic manifestations.
Demonic interference.
Meditative states.
Wrong views.
Pride.
Two-vehicle tendency.
Advanced bodhisattva-level experience.

Different faces,
same requirement:
recognize and contemplate rightly.

---

## Practice Principle Across Objects

Do not abandon the root method
when new object-types appear.

Bring each object
under inconceivable contemplation,
bodhi intention,
stabilization,
breakthrough,
open/obstruct discernment,
and release.

---

## Object-Type Warnings

Afflictions:
do not externalize them.
Contemplate directly.

Illness:
use both contemplative and practical care.

Karmic and disturbing appearances:
non-engagement, non-fascination,
steady continuation.

Meditative states:
do not mistake station for destination.

Wrong views and pride:
break conceptual fixation,
recalibrate by stages and humility.

Two-vehicle tendency:
restore universal vow and broad compassion.

Advanced bodhisattva experiences:
still subject to subtle attachment;
continue release.

---

## Closing Moan

Nine objects are not detours.
They are conditional fields
where the same road proves itself.

Whatever rises,
carry it through ten-mode seeing,
and return it to the one vehicle.
