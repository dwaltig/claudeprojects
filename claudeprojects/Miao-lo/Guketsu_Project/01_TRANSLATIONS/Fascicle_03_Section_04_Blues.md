## The Deal

After you master the **First Object** (Aggregates), you might encounter one of the **other nine**. These are "conditional"—they only show up if needed.

Miao-lo's point:
> "Master Object 1, you might never see the rest. But if they show up, you work with them the same way: Ten Modes."

## The Nine Conditional Objects

| # | Object | Type |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | **Afflictions** | Internal obstacles |
| 3 | **Illness** | Physical obstacles |
| 4 | **Karmic Stuff** | Past karma showing up |
| 5 | **Demonic Interference** | External obstacles |
| 6 | **Meditative States** | Attainments that trap you |
| 7 | **Wrong Views** | Intellectual obstacles |
| 8 | **Pride** | Attitude obstacles |
| 9 | **Two Vehicles** | Small-vehicle tendencies |
| 10 | **Bodhisattva** | Advanced experiences |

---

## Object 2: Afflictions (煩惱境)

### What It Is
Strong emotions (greed, anger, delusion) that **won't go away** through aggregate contemplation alone.

### When It Shows Up
-   Deep-rooted stuff
-   Past karma activating
-   Environmental triggers

### How to Work With It

**Use the affliction as the object**:
-   See it as empty, conventional, middle
-   Vow to help all beings with this affliction
-   Apply Zhi-Guan to the affliction itself

> "Anger isn't separate from Buddha-nature. See anger clearly, you see the Dharma-realm."

---

## Object 3: Illness (病患境)

### What It Is
Physical sickness that **messes with** your practice.

### Types

| Type | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Element Imbalance** | Earth, water, fire, wind off | Medical + contemplation |
| **Karmic** | Past karma ripening | Contemplation + repentance |
| **Demonic** | Māra's interference | Protection + contemplation |
| **Practice-Induced** | Wrong method | Correct the method |

### How to Work With It

-   Contemplate pain as empty
-   See body as aggregates (back to Object 1)
-   Be patient
-   Get medical help when needed

> "Illness is a teacher. Shows where you're attached to the body."

---

## Object 4: Karmic Impressions (業相境)

### What It Is
Past karma showing up as **visions, memories, experiences** during meditation.

### Examples
-   Past life visions
-   Old memories surfacing
-   Karmic debts becoming conscious

### How to Work With It

**Don't engage**:
-   Recognize it as karma
-   See it as empty
-   Don't get fascinated or disturbed
-   Keep practicing

> "Karmic visions are dreams. No substance. Don't chase, don't flee."

---

## Object 5: Demonic Interference (魔事境)

### What It Is
**Māra** (internal or external) trying to mess with your practice.

### Four Types

| Type | What It Is |
|---|---|
| **Affliction-Māra** | Internal afflictions intensifying |
| **Aggregate-Māra** | Attachment to body-mind |
| **Death-Māra** | Fear of death |
| **Heavenly-Māra** | External interference |

### How to Work With It

**Don't engage**:
-   Don't fear or fight
-   See everything as empty
-   Keep precepts
-   Get guidance if needed

> "Māra has no power over emptiness. Like a shadow, it disappears in light."

---

## Object 6: Meditative States (禪定境)

### What It Is
Attaining **dhyāna** (deep meditation states) and thinking you're done.

### The Four Dhyānas

| Dhyāna | What It's Like |
|---|---|
| **First** | Joy and bliss with thought |
| **Second** | Joy and bliss without thought |
| **Third** | Equanimity and subtle bliss |
| **Fourth** | Pure equanimity |

### The Danger

Get attached, you:
-   Get reborn in the form realm
-   Stagnate
-   Mistake meditation for wisdom

### How to Work With It

**Let it go** (Mode 10):
-   Recognize it's conditioned
-   See it as empty
-   Don't cling
-   Keep going toward wisdom

> "Dhyāna is a rest stop. Enjoy the rest, but don't make it home."

---

## Object 7: Wrong Views (諸見境)

### What It Is
Mistaken ideas that arise during practice.

### Common Ones

| View | Error |
|---|---|
| **Eternalism** | Permanent self |
| **Nihilism** | Annihilation |
| **One-sided emptiness** | Cling to emptiness, reject form |
| **One-sided form** | Cling to form, reject emptiness |

### How to Work With It

**Break through** (Mode 4):
-   Deconstruct all views
-   Study Middle Way
-   Get guidance
-   Contemplate causation

> "Views are chains. Even golden chains bind."

---

## Object 8: Pride (慢境)

### What It Is
Arrogance from **partial attainment**.

### Seven Types

| Type | What It Looks Like |
|---|---|
| **Simple** | "I'm better" |
| **Greater** | "I'm better than the best" |
| **Pride of pride** | "I'm the absolute best" |
| **Self-pride** | "I am" |
| **Inferior** | "I'm only slightly worse" |
| **False** | Pride in non-attainments |
| **Perverse** | Pride in wrong things |

### How to Work With It

**Know your stage** (Mode 8):
-   Study Six Identities
-   Be honest about where you are
-   Serve others
-   Contemplate elements

> "Pride is the last chain. Even advanced practitioners watch for it."

---

## Object 9: Two Vehicles (二乘境)

### What It Is
Tendency toward **Hīnayāna**—just want to escape for yourself.

### Signs
-   Want personal liberation only
-   Lack compassion
-   Satisfied with partial realization

### How to Work With It

**Remember the vow** (Mode 2):
-   Recall Four Great Vows
-   Cultivate compassion
-   Study Mahāyāna
-   Do bodhisattva practices

> "Two Vehicles aren't wrong, just incomplete. Perfect Teaching embraces all."

---

## Object 10: Bodhisattva (菩薩境)

### What It Is
Advanced experiences—ten stages, supernatural powers, etc.

### The Danger

Even here:
-   Subtle attachment remains
-   Pride in attainment
-   Dharma-attachment

### How to Work With It

**All Ten Modes**:
-   Keep seeing Three Truths
-   Let go of even bodhisattva attainments
-   Go to complete Buddhahood

> "Bodhisattva path has many stages. Don't stop till the end."

---

## The Summary

**Same method for all**:
1.  Recognize which object showed up
2.  Apply Ten Modes to it
3.  Don't get disturbed
4.  Keep going

| Object | Primary Approach |
|---|---|
| Afflictions | See as empty, generate compassion |
| Illness | Contemplate pain, get treatment |
| Karmic Stuff | Don't engage, see as empty |
| Demonic | Don't fear, contemplate emptiness |
| Meditative States | Don't cling, keep going |
| Wrong Views | Deconstruct, study Middle Way |
| Pride | Know your stage, serve |
| Two Vehicles | Remember vow, cultivate compassion |
| Bodhisattva | All modes, let go |

**Luthier's Point**:
> "Whatever shows up, use it. Every object, when worked with properly, becomes a vehicle."
