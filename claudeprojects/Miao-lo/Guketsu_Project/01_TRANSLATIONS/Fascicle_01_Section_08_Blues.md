## The Problem

You've got the tools (The Four Vows). You've got the skill levels explained (The Six Identities). Now: **What's the curriculum?**

Miao-lo says: "The *Mohe Zhiguan* isn't a pile of notes. It's a **shop manual**. And every shop manual has a structure."

## The Ten Chapters: Your Build Log

Think of the Ten Chapters as the **ten tabs in a binder** for building a complete instrument from scratch.

| Tab | Name | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Grand Outline** | The executive summary. The blueprint. |
| **2** | **What's in a Name?** | What does "Zhiguan" (Stop-Look) actually *mean*? |
| **3** | **The Core Material** | What's the *body* of this practice? (Think: What species of tonewood are we using?) |
| **4** | **How Everything Fits** | How does this practice relate to all the other methods out there? |
| **5** | **Cheap vs. Quality** | Distinguishing the good builds from the hack jobs. |
| **6** | **Prep Work** | The 25 things you do *before* you pick up a tool. (Clean the shop, gather materials, etc.) |
| **7** | **The Actual Build** | The main event. Cutting, shaping, gluing, finishing. |
| **8** | **The Finished Axe** | What happens when you're done? What does a complete instrument look like? |
| **9** | **Teaching Others** | Once you've built one, you can show someone else how to do it. |
| **10** | **Hanging It Up** | The instrument goes to the customer. You rest. The cycle is complete. |

## The Logic: Eyes and Feet

Miao-lo gives a simple breakdown:

-   **Tabs 1-5** are your **EYES**. You gotta *see* what you're doing before you start cutting.
-   **Tabs 6-7** are your **FEET**. You gotta *move*. Knowledge without action is just talk.
-   **Tabs 8-10** are the **RESULT**. The guitar plays itself into existence.

> "No eyes, you're blind. No feet, you're stuck. No result, you're wasting everybody's time."

## The Five Quick-Start Guides (*Wu Lue*)

Not everyone has time for the full manual. So Miao-lo says: Here's the **Five 略** (Abbreviations). It's like a "Quick-Start Guide" that comes with the product.

| # | Quick-Start | What It Covers |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Generate the Great Mind** | Know WHY you're building. (Tabs 1-5) |
| **2** | **Do the Great Work** | Actually pick up the tools. (Tabs 6-7) |
| **3** | **Get the Great Result** | The guitar is done. (Tab 8) |
| **4** | **Tear Open the Great Net** | Teach someone else. (Tab 9) |
| **5** | **Return to the Great Home** | Put down the tools. Mission complete. (Tab 10) |

### Why "Great"?

Every one of these says "Great" (*Da*). That's not hype.

-   **Great Mind**: Not "I want a guitar." It's "I want to make something that moves people."
-   **Great Work**: Not "I'll follow the instructions." It's "I'll put my soul into this build."
-   **Great Result**: Not "It plays." It's "It *sings*."
-   **Great Net**: The customer doesn't just get a guitar. They get the knowledge of *why* it works.
-   **Great Home**: You don't retire. You just... become the craft.

## Horizontal vs. Vertical

Here's where it gets interesting.

**Vertical** = Read the manual front to back. Do Tab 1, then Tab 2, then Tab 3...

**Horizontal** = Every tab *already contains the whole*. When you're in the "Prep Work" tab, you're already *thinking* about the finished guitar. When you're in the "Actual Build" tab, you're already *living* the result.

This is the **Perfect Teaching**. The blueprint is in the wood. The song is in the strings before you pluck. The skill is in the hands before they move.

## Luthier's Verdict

The Ten Chapters are the full curriculum.
The Five Quick-Starts are the cliff notes.

**If you don't know the layout, you'll get lost.**
**If you know the layout, every step makes sense.**

Now we're ready to actually read the manual.
