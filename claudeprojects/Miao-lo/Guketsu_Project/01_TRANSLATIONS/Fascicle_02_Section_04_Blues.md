## The Question

You've got a guitar. But is it a **real guitar** or a **knockoff**?

Same deal with Zhiguan. There's a lot of stuff out there called "meditation" or "calming and contemplation." Some of it's the real thing. Some of it's partial. Some of it's junk.

This chapter teaches you to **tell the difference**.

## The Five Ways to Test

| Test | Question |
|---|---|
| **1. Great vs. Small** | Is this for everyone or just for yourself? |
| **2. Half vs. Full** | Is this the whole truth or just part of it? |
| **3. Gradual vs. Sudden** | Do you have to climb or can you fly? |
| **4. Expedient vs. True** | Is this adapted for beginners or the real deal? |
| **5. Partial vs. Complete** | Is this one-sided or all-encompassing? |

## Test 1: Great vs. Small (*Da Xiao*)

| Category | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Small** | For yourself. Personal escape. |
| **Great** | For everyone. Universal liberation. |

**Verdict:** The *Mohe Zhiguan* is **Great**. It's not about getting yourself out of the burning house. It's about realizing the house isn't burning.

## Test 2: Half vs. Full (*Ban Man*)

| Category | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Half** | Part of the truth. Missing pieces. |
| **Full** | The whole truth. Nothing held back. |

**Verdict:** The *Mohe Zhiguan* is **Full**. Even the "good" teachings can be half-full. The Distinct Teaching has the Middle Way, but it teaches it step-by-step, which is still incomplete.

> "A half-full cup isn't empty. But it's not full either."

## Test 3: Gradual vs. Sudden (*Jian Dun*)

| Category | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Gradual** | Step by step. Rung by rung. |
| **Sudden** | Immediate. The whole thing at once. |

**Verdict:** The *Mohe Zhiguan* is **Sudden**. This doesn't mean "quick" or "easy." It means:

> "The first moment of practice is the same *kind* of thing as Buddhahood. The difference is only in degree."

---

## Test 4: Expedient vs. True (*Quan Shi*)

| Category | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Expedient** | Adapted for beginners. Training wheels. |
| **True** | The ultimate thing. No training wheels. |

**Verdict:** The *Mohe Zhiguan* is **True**. But the Expedient isn't thrown out. It's *opened* to reveal what was True all along.

> "The training wheels were always attached to a real bike."

---

## Test 5: Partial vs. Complete (*Pian Yuan*)

| Category | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Partial** | One-sided. Missing something. |
| **Complete** | All-encompassing. Nothing left out. |

**Verdict:** The *Mohe Zhiguan* is **Complete**. The Chinese word **圓** (*Yuan*) means:

1.  **Round** — No corners, no exclusions.
2.  **Perfect** — No deficiency.
3.  **Sudden** — No gradual steps.

> "The moon is *yuan* because it's round. This teaching is *yuan* because it lacks nothing."

## Luthier's Verdict

**How to spot a knockoff:**
-   Is it only for yourself? → Partial.
-   Is it missing something? → Partial.
-   Does it require endless steps? → Partial.
-   Is it just for beginners? → Partial.
-   Is it one-sided? → Partial.

**How to spot the real thing:**
-   Great, Full, Sudden, True, Complete.

That's the *Mohe Zhiguan*.
