## Opening Word

Here the text turns to discernment:
gradual and sudden,
expedient and real.

Not to make a fight-club of doctrines,
but to show how practice reaches principle.

---

## Gradual and Sudden

Three contemplations,
three wisdoms,
can be entered in sequence.

From emptiness to provisional,
from provisional to middle.

So one line says "relying on what is shallow."
Another says "proceeding from depth."

Why?
For middle-way realization,
one first cultivates the prior two.
For benefiting others,
one first cuts one’s own bonds.

---

## Shared and Distinct Usage

"Sufficiency" and "ultimacy"
carry shared and distinct senses.

Shared:
beginning and end both participate.

Distinct:
ultimacy names the far end,
sufficiency can be present at the start.

Gradual can support partial teaching.
Sudden reveals complete teaching.
Yet these relations inter-complete,
not merely cancel.

---

## Lotus Opening Logic

Before opening,
some teachings are counted gradual.

After Lotus opening is completed,
gradual itself can be called sudden.

Why?
Because opened expedients become
bodhisattva-path function.

---

## Expedient and Real

Expedient is not outside buddhahood-body.
It is expedience within that body.

Beings with weak capacities
are matured by expedient means.
When capacities mature,
expedient is opened,
then expedient fixation is set aside.

Applying, opening, setting aside:
all read through the four siddhantas.

---

## No Separate Principle

Real teaching is spoken
to break fixation on expedient teaching.

So the principle of double-negation
is not different from one-real principle.

Open teaching, reveal principle.
Even when teaching-form is set down,
principle is still revealed.

All the more,
when words themselves
are read as real-aspect principle.

---

## Closing Moan

Neither clutch expedient
nor clutch "real" as an idol.

One zhiguan closes the matter:
function and principle,
opened and set down,
all return to one practice-road.
