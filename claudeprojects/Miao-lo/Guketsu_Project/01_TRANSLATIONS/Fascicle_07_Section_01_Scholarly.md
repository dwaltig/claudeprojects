## Mode 5: Discerning Openness and Obstruction (通塞)

### I. Introduction and Purpose (來意)

Miao-lo opens his treatment of Mode 5 by establishing its relationship to the preceding mode:

> 次釋通塞中先列異名。次明來意有法譬合。

"Next, in explaining openness and obstruction, we first list the alternative names, then clarify the purpose through dharma, metaphor, and their combination."

The fundamental purpose of this mode is diagnostic: having employed the breaking-through contemplation (破法遍) of Mode 4, the practitioner must now assess whether genuine progress has occurred. Miao-lo identifies a critical danger:

> 恐於通中翻起於塞

"There is concern that within openness, obstruction may instead arise."

This indicates that even correct contemplation can generate new obstacles—specifically, attachment to the contemplation itself. When the practitioner becomes proud of "breaking through," this very pride becomes a new obstruction.

### II. The Rationale for Four-Sentence Examination

Miao-lo explains why the four-sentence examination is necessary:

> 故知前破遍中但用能破破於所破。猶未悟者必於能所心生塞著。

"Therefore, in the previous breaking-through, one simply used the breaking capacity to break what is to be broken. Those who have not yet awakened will certainly generate obstruction and attachment regarding the capacity and its object."

The four sentences (四句) address this problem systematically:

1. **通途通塞** — General openness and obstruction: the object of breaking is obstruction; the capacity to break is openness.

2. **別相通塞** — Specific openness and obstruction: attachment arising regarding the capacity itself becomes obstruction; breaking that attachment without generating new attachment becomes openness.

### III. The Four Meanings (四義)

Miao-lo identifies four dimensions of openness and obstruction:

> 然今此中總有四義。一橫通塞。二竪通塞。三橫別通塞。四一心通塞。

"Now, in this context there are altogether four meanings: (1) horizontal openness-obstruction, (2) vertical openness-obstruction, (3) horizontal-distinct openness-obstruction, and (4) one-mind openness-obstruction."

#### 1. Horizontal (橫通塞)
All afflictions—view-delusions, thought-delusions, dust-and-sand delusions, and ignorance—are examined simultaneously. Openness consists in perceiving all as empty; obstruction consists in becoming fixed on any particular one.

#### 2. Vertical (竪通塞)
The practitioner progresses through stages sequentially: first breaking view-delusions, then thought-delusions, and so forth. Openness consists in advancing from stage to stage; obstruction consists in stalling at any level.

#### 3. Horizontal-Distinct (橫別通塞)
Different practitioners enter realization through different gates (emptiness, provisional existence, middle). Openness consists in finding one's appropriate gate; obstruction consists in asserting that one's gate is the only valid approach.

#### 4. One-Mind (一心通塞)
This represents the distinctively Tiantai integration. All three truths are present in a single moment of thought, with no temporal sequence or division among practitioners. This mode subsumes and perfects the previous three.

> 文四義二。前三為成一心故也。

"The text has four meanings but two [categories]: the first three exist for the purpose of accomplishing one-mind."

### IV. The Four-Sentence Diagnostic (四句檢校)

The examination proceeds through four sentences:

> 一者塞中得通。二者通中有塞。三者塞自是塞。四者通自是通。

1. **塞中得通** (Obtaining openness within obstruction): What appears to be blockage may contain the seed of breakthrough. The very recognition of obstruction can become the occasion for liberation.

2. **通中有塞** (Finding obstruction within openness): What appears to be progress may conceal subtle attachment. Pride in one's contemplation creates new bondage.

3. **塞自是塞** (Obstruction that is simply obstruction): Some obstacles are straightforward impediments requiring direct dismantling.

4. **通自是通** (Openness that is simply openness): Sometimes the path is genuinely clear, and second-guessing constitutes its own form of obstruction.

### V. The Metaphors

#### A. Removing the Film, Nurturing the Pearl (除膜養珠)

> 除膜養珠但成分喻

"Removing the film and nurturing the pearl constitutes only a partial metaphor."

The eye covered by a cataract-like film (膜) cannot see clearly. Removing the film reveals what was always present. This metaphor illustrates that practice does not create Buddha-nature but removes what obscures it.

However, Miao-lo notes this metaphor is incomplete because it does not address the possibility that "the pearl might become the film"—that is, what functions as openness might subsequently function as obstruction.

#### B. Destroying Bandits, Protecting Generals (破賊護將)

> 若破賊護將便成遍喻

"If [we use] destroying bandits and protecting generals, it becomes a complete metaphor."

This metaphor addresses the limitation of the first:

> 將若為賊此賊亦破。賊若為將此將亦護。如是展轉將皆為賊。節節破之。

"If a general becomes a bandit, that bandit must also be destroyed. If a bandit becomes a general, that general should also be protected. Thus, in succession, all generals may become bandits. Section by section, they must be destroyed."

No practice—however beneficial—is exempt from scrutiny. The contemplation that once served as "general" (openness) may become "bandit" (obstruction) through attachment.

### VI. The 500 Yojanas (五百由旬)

Miao-lo connects this mode to the *Lotus Sūtra*'s parable in Chapter 7 (化城喻品):

> 經云導師善知通塞。故用法華將導譬也。

"The sūtra states that the guide 'knows well openness and obstruction.' Therefore we use the *Lotus* metaphor of the guide."

#### Critique of Six Masters

Miao-lo examines and critiques six earlier interpretations of the 500 yojanas:

**First Master**: Identified 400 yojanas with the two vehicles (seventh and eighth grounds of the Shared Teaching).

*Miao-lo's critique*: This confuses the stages. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* correlates the two vehicles with 400 yojanas differently.

**Second Master** (攝論師 - Shèlùn school): Proposed seven kinds of birth-and-death corresponding to 500 yojanas.

*Miao-lo's critique*: This interpretation omits the final two kinds (有後, 無後 - "with remainder" and "without remainder").

**Third Master** (地論師 - Dìlùn school): Correlated the positions (住位) with 200 yojanas.

*Miao-lo's critique*: This places the "magic city" (化城) within the three realms, which contradicts the sūtra's intent.

**Fourth Master**: Identified the two vehicles as completing all 500 yojanas.

*Miao-lo's critique*: This has the two vehicles "usurping authority" (擅行) over territory they should not traverse.

**Fifth and Sixth Masters**: Various correlations with afflictions.

*Miao-lo's critique*: Each captures only partial meaning.

#### The Tiantai Interpretation

> 今明下今家正解。正顯今家依法華明通塞義也。

Miao-lo presents the Tiantai interpretation based on three correlations:

1. **Correlation with Birth-and-Death (約生死)**: The 500 yojanas represent the complete cycle of saṃsāra.

2. **Correlation with Afflictions (約煩惱)**:
   - View-delusions across three realms = 100
   - Lower fetters (下分結) = 100
   - Upper fetters (上分結) = 100
   - Dust-and-sand delusions = 100
   - Ignorance = 100

3. **Correlation with Contemplative Wisdom (約觀智)**: Through contemplation, one "passes through" (過) these 500 yojanas by knowing them as empty.

### VII. One-Mind Openness and Obstruction

The culminating teaching integrates all dimensions:

> 若一心下正明一心。即是檢校一心破遍。

"One-mind [openness-obstruction] precisely refers to examining one-mind breaking-through."

#### Breaking Vertical Obstruction

> 一心三觀破竪通塞

"One-mind three contemplations break vertical openness-obstruction."

The three contemplations (of emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle) are not sequential but simultaneous. This breaks the vertical arrangement wherein one proceeds from stage to stage.

#### Breaking Horizontal Obstruction

> 三觀一心破橫通塞

"Three contemplations, one mind, break horizontal openness-obstruction."

The three contemplations are not divided among different practitioners but are all present in a single mind. This breaks the horizontal arrangement wherein different people approach through different gates.

#### The Integration

> 空即三觀等者。次圓三觀。觀觀具三以破橫別。

"Emptiness is precisely the three contemplations, etc. Next, the Perfect three contemplations—each contemplation contains all three, breaking horizontal-distinct [obstruction]."

In the Perfect Teaching:
- Contemplation of emptiness contains provisional and middle
- Contemplation of provisional contains emptiness and middle
- Contemplation of middle contains emptiness and provisional

This mutual inclusion (圓融) characterizes the Tiantai approach.

## Doctrinal Significance

Mode 5 serves as the pivotal diagnostic function within the Ten Modes. Without the capacity to discern openness and obstruction, the practitioner cannot:

1. Recognize when correct practice has generated new attachment
2. Adjust methodology appropriately
3. Avoid the error of claiming attainment not yet realized
4. Progress from the foundational modes (1-4) to the culminating modes (6-10)

The one-mind approach to openness and obstruction distinguishes Tiantai from gradual approaches that treat stages sequentially and from approaches that assign different gates to different practitioners. In Tiantai, all dimensions are integrated in the single moment of contemplative awareness.
