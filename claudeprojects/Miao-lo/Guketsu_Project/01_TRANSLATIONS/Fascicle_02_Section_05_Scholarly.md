## Introduction: Why Preparations?

The sixth of the Ten Chapters is **方便** (*Fang Bian* — "Skillful Means" or "Preliminaries"). Before the practitioner can enter the formal contemplation (*Zheng Guan*), certain conditions must be established.

Miao-lo explains that these are the **Twenty-Five Preparatory Conditions** (二十五方便 *Er Shi Wu Fang Bian*), organized into **five groups of five**:

| Group | Chinese | English | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **具五緣** | **Fulfilling Five Conditions** | External supports |
| 2 | **訶五欲** | **Rejecting Five Desires** | Removing gross obstacles |
| 3 | **棄五蓋** | **Abandoning Five Hindrances** | Removing subtle obstacles |
| 4 | **調五事** | **Regulating Five Matters** | Balancing body and mind |
| 5 | **行五法** | **Practicing Five Dharmas** | Cultivating the mind |

---

## Group 1: Fulfilling Five Conditions (*Ju Wu Yuan*)

These are the **external supports** necessary for practice:

| # | Chinese | English | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **持戒清淨** | Pure Precepts | Moral discipline must be intact |
| 2 | **衣食具足** | Sufficient Clothing/Food | Basic needs must be met |
| 3 | **閑居靜處** | Quiet Dwelling | A peaceful place to practice |
| 4 | **息諸緣務** | Cessation of Affairs | Worldly business must be set aside |
| 5 | **近善知識** | Proximity to Good Teachers | Access to qualified guidance |

> "Without these five, the practitioner is like a bird trying to fly without wings."

## Group 2: Rejecting Five Desires (*He Wu Yu*)

These are the **gross obstacles** arising from the five sense-objects:

| # | Chinese | English | Object |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **色** | Forms | Visual objects |
| 2 | **聲** | Sounds | Auditory objects |
| 3 | **香** | Smells | Olfactory objects |
| 4 | **味** | Tastes | Gustatory objects |
| 5 | **觸** | Touches | Tactile objects |

### The Practice

"Rejecting" (*he* 訶) does not mean "hating." It means:
1.  **Recognizing** the desire when it arises.
2.  **Understanding** that the object is not inherently pleasurable.
3.  **Releasing** the attachment without suppression.

> "The desires are like salt water. The more you drink, the thirstier you become."

---

## Group 3: Abandoning Five Hindrances (*Qi Wu Gai*)

These are the **subtle obstacles** that obstruct concentration:

| # | Chinese | English | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **貪欲蓋** | Desire | Attachment to pleasant objects |
| 2 | **瞋恚蓋** | Aversion | Hostility toward unpleasant objects |
| 3 | **睡眠蓋** | Sloth/Torpor | Dullness and drowsiness |
| 4 | **掉悔蓋** | Restlessness/Regret | Agitation and remorse |
| 5 | **疑蓋** | Doubt | Uncertainty about the teaching |

### The Practice

Each hindrance has a specific antidote:

| Hindrance | Antidote |
|---|---|
| Desire | Contemplation of impurity |
| Aversion | Contemplation of loving-kindness |
| Sloth | Contemplation of light |
| Restlessness | Contemplation of tranquility |
| Doubt | Contemplation of dependent origination |

> "The hindrances are like clouds covering the sun. The sun is always there; it is the clouds that must be dispersed."

## Group 4: Regulating Five Matters (*Tiao Wu Shi*)

These are the **body-mind adjustments** that balance the practitioner:

| # | Chinese | English | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **調食** | Regulating Food | Neither too much nor too little |
| 2 | **調睡** | Regulating Sleep | Neither excessive nor deficient |
| 3 | **調身** | Regulating Body | Correct posture |
| 4 | **調息** | Regulating Breath | Smooth and even breathing |
| 5 | **調心** | Regulating Mind | Neither tense nor slack |

### The Practice

The metaphor is a stringed instrument:
-   **Too tight** → The string breaks.
-   **Too loose** → No sound.
-   **Just right** → The music plays.

> "The practitioner is like a lute-player. The strings must be tuned before the music can be played."

## Group 5: Practicing Five Dharmas (*Xing Wu Fa*)

These are the **mental qualities** that must be cultivated:

| # | Chinese | English | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **欲** | Aspiration | The wish to attain the goal |
| 2 | **精進** | Effort | Continuous diligence |
| 3 | **念** | Mindfulness | Non-forgetfulness |
| 4 | **巧慧** | Skillful Wisdom | Discrimination between wholesome and unwholesome |
| 5 | **一心** | One-pointedness | Unified concentration |

### The Practice

These five are progressive:
1.  **Aspiration** motivates the practitioner to begin.
2.  **Effort** sustains the practice.
3.  **Mindfulness** prevents distraction.
4.  **Skillful Wisdom** guides the choices.
5.  **One-pointedness** is the result.

> "Without aspiration, there is no beginning. Without one-pointedness, there is no completion."
