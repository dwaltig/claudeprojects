## Source-Aligned Bilingual Block

[01][CN] 釋二十五方便。初且通明漸頓二種。次今就下。方始別明今文方便。  
[01][EN] Explaining the twenty-five expedient means: first broadly clarifying two kinds, gradual and sudden; then specifically clarifying the expedients of this text.

[02][CN] 初文通論頓方便者。初釋名云善巧。  
[02][EN] In the initial broad discussion of sudden expedients, the first explanation of name says "skillful adeptness."

[03][CN] 迴向令成妙因故名善巧。  
[03][EN] Because dedication-and-transfer makes these become wondrous causes, it is called skillful adeptness.

[04][CN] 以種智導。毫善不停。能過二乘極果之上。  
[04][EN] Guided by all-mode wisdom, even tiny goodness does not stop short and can pass beyond the terminal fruit of the two vehicles.

[05][CN] 方便下重釋也。以善能和合故名方便。  
[05][EN] "Expedient means" is then re-explained: because skillfully harmonizing is possible, it is called expedient means.

[06][CN] 若為果立因。因立必能剋果。故號剋果之因名為和合取果。  
[06][EN] If a cause is established for fruit, that cause must obtain fruit; therefore this fruit-obtaining cause is called harmonized fruit-taking.

[07][CN] 今文二十五法。和合調停方得成。於圓初住因。剋妙覺果。  
[07][EN] In this text, only by harmonizing and regulating these twenty-five factors can one establish causes for initial abiding in the Perfect and obtain wondrous awakening fruit.

[08][CN] 十種者即十境也。若觀若發入品非遙。故名為近。二十五法去真遙故。故名為遠。  
[08][EN] The ten kinds are the ten objects: through contemplation and manifestation, entry into grade is not far, thus called near; the twenty-five factors are farther from true attainment, thus called distant.

[09][CN] 初列五科。次生起。即以初住名為所在。  
[09][EN] First the five categories are listed, then their generative sequence; initial abiding is identified as destination.

[10][CN] 譬如下舉譬以譬五科。  
[10][EN] Next, analogies are raised to illustrate the five categories.

[11][CN] 初譬具緣。息餘下譬訶欲。雖息下譬棄蓋。身雖下譬五事。上緣下譬五法。  
[11][EN] First analogy illustrates complete conditions; "ceasing what remains" illustrates rebuking desires; "though ceased" illustrates abandoning hindrances; "though the body..." illustrates the five matters; "upper condition..." illustrates the five dharmas.

[12][CN] 止觀下合。具合五科。  
[12][EN] Under zhiguan, the analogy is matched and all five categories are fully joined.

[13][CN] 第四調五事者文義同前。文相又二。所謂開合。  
[13][EN] Fourth, regulating five matters: text and meaning follow the earlier pattern, with two textual modes, opening and combining.

[14][CN] 第五行五法者。文義同前而不分事理。  
[14][EN] Fifth, practicing five dharmas: text and meaning follow the same pattern but are not divided into matter and principle.

[15][CN] 若無樂欲希慕。若無身心苦策。若無念想。若無方便。若無一心。止觀合正行不成。  
[15][EN] Without aspiration, bodily/mental exertion, mindfulness, expedient method, and one-pointedness, proper zhiguan practice is not accomplished.

[16][CN] 若能欣習無厭。若能曉夜匪懈。若能念念相續。若能善得其意。若能一心無異。  
[16][EN] If one can delight in cultivation without fatigue, remain diligent day and night, sustain thought after thought, skillfully grasp intended meaning, and keep one-pointed non-divergence,

[17][CN] 此人下合正行成就。  
[17][EN] then proper practice is fulfilled in that person.

[18][CN] 世間淺事謂界內禪定。尚須二十五法而為方便。何況出世圓頓之道。  
[18][EN] Even shallow worldly matters, namely meditative states within the realm, still require these twenty-five as expedients, all the more so for the supramundane Perfect-Sudden path.
