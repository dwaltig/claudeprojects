## 1. The Question of Structure

After establishing the doctrinal foundations (Four Vows, Six Identities), Miao-lo now explains *how the Mohe Zhiguan is built*.

The *Mohe Zhiguan* is not a random collection of teachings. It is an **architectural system** with:
1.  **Ten Chapters** (*Shi Zhang*): The complete structure of the text.
2.  **Five Abbreviations** (*Wu Lue*): A condensed summary of the Ten Chapters, used for beginners.

## 2. The Ten Chapters (*Shi Zhang*)

Miao-lo lists the Ten Chapters as follows:

| # | Chapter Name (Chinese) | Chapter Name (English) | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **大意** (*Da Yi*) | **Grand Outline** | Summary of entire system (like a table of contents) |
| 2 | **釋名** (*Shi Ming*) | **Explanation of the Name** | What does "Zhiguan" mean? |
| 3 | **顯體** (*Xian Ti*) | **Revealing the Essence** | What is the *substance* of Zhiguan? |
| 4 | **攝法** (*She Fa*) | **Embracing the Dharmas** | How does Zhiguan relate to all other teachings? |
| 5 | **偏圓** (*Pian Yuan*) | **Partial vs. Complete** | Distinguishing inferior from superior teachings |
| 6 | **方便** (*Fang Bian*) | **Skillful Means / Preliminaries** | The 25 preparatory conditions for practice |
| 7 | **正觀** (*Zheng Guan*) | **Correct Contemplation** | The actual practice (Ten Objects, Ten Modes) |
| 8 | **果報** (*Guo Bao*) | **Fruit/Result** | What happens when practice succeeds? |
| 9 | **起教** (*Qi Jiao*) | **Arising of Teaching** | How the realized practitioner benefits others |
| 10 | **旨歸** (*Zhi Gui*) | **Ultimate Return** | The final destination (Nirvāṇa, Three Virtues) |

### The Logic of the Ten Chapters

Miao-lo explains the **生起** (*Sheng Qi* — "arising and generation") of these chapters:

1.  **Chapters 1-5** belong to **Understanding** (*Jie* 解): You must first *know* what Zhiguan is before you can practice.
2.  **Chapters 6-7** belong to **Practice** (*Xing* 行): After understanding, you *do* the work.
3.  **Chapters 8-10** belong to **Fruition** (*Guo* 果): After practice, you attain the result and benefit others.

> "If you do not know the name, how can you know the essence? If you do not know the essence, how can you practice? If you do not practice, how can you attain the fruit?"

## 3. The Five Abbreviations (*Wu Lue*)

The **Five略** are a *shortened* version of the Ten Chapters, used to give the student a general sense of direction before diving into the details.

| # | Abbreviation (Chinese) | Abbreviation (English) | Corresponding Chapters |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **發大心** (*Fa Da Xin*) | **Generating the Great Mind** | Chapters 1-5 (Understanding) |
| 2 | **修大行** (*Xiu Da Xing*) | **Cultivating the Great Practice** | Chapters 6-7 (Practice) |
| 3 | **感大果** (*Gan Da Guo*) | **Attaining the Great Fruit** | Chapter 8 (Fruition) |
| 4 | **裂大網** (*Lie Da Wang*) | **Tearing Open the Great Net** | Chapter 9 (Arising of Teaching) |
| 5 | **歸大處** (*Gui Da Chu*) | **Returning to the Great Abode** | Chapter 10 (Ultimate Return) |

### The Meaning of "大" (*Da* — Great)

Every abbreviation has "Great" (*Da*) in its name. This is not rhetorical flourish. It refers to the **圓頓** (*Yuan Dun* — Perfectly Sudden) nature of this teaching:

-   **Great Mind**: Not a partial mind (seeking personal liberation), but the mind that vows to save all beings.
-   **Great Practice**: Not a technique, but the "non-dual contemplation" of the Dharma-realm.
-   **Great Fruit**: Not a limited attainment, but the complete realization of the Three Virtues.
-   **Great Net**: The network of doubts that binds all sentient beings. To "tear open" means to teach so effectively that all doubts are resolved.
-   **Great Abode**: The "Mysterious Treasury" (*Mi Zang*), the ultimate destination beyond coming and going.

## 4. Understanding vs. Practice

Miao-lo emphasizes a critical point:

> "The first five chapters (Grand Outline through Partial/Complete) are like *eyes*. The next two chapters (Preliminaries and Correct Contemplation) are like *feet*."

-   **Eyes** (*Mu* 目): Without understanding, you are blind. You don't know where to go.
-   **Feet** (*Zu* 足): Without practice, you are crippled. You know where to go but cannot move.

> "Without the eye, one stumbles in the dark. Without the foot, one knows the path but cannot walk it."

## 5. The "Horizontal" and "Vertical" Reading

Miao-lo introduces two ways to read the Ten Chapters:

1.  **Vertical** (*Shu* 竪): Reading from Chapter 1 to Chapter 10 in sequence. This is the *order of learning*.
2.  **Horizontal** (*Heng* 橫): Reading each chapter as complete in itself. Each chapter *contains* the essence of the whole.

For example:
-   In the "Grand Outline" (Ch. 1), the entire path from aspiration to Buddhahood is summarized.
-   In "Correct Contemplation" (Ch. 7), the practice itself *is* the fruit. There is no waiting.

This is the meaning of **圓頓** (*Yuan Dun*): The whole is present in every part.

---

## Summary

The Ten Chapters provide the **complete map**. The Five Abbreviations provide a **quick overview**. Together they ensure that the practitioner:
1.  Knows the destination (Nirvāṇa, Three Virtues)
2.  Knows the path (Four Samādhis, Ten Modes of Contemplation)
3.  Knows the stages (Six Identities, Partial/Complete)
4.  Knows the pitfalls (Ten Wrongs)

Without this structure, meditation is "blind sitting." With it, every moment of practice is oriented toward complete Buddhahood.
