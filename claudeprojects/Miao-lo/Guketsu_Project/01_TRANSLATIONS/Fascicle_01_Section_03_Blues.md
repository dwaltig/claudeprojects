## The Breakdown

### The Five-Point Diagnostic (The Five Summaries)

Miao-lo looks at the *Mohe Zhiguan* and says, "This rig is huge. If you just start soldering random wires, you're gonna burn the house down. You need a schematic."
He calls this schematic the **Five Summaries** (The Five *What's-The-Point*s).

**The Text says:** "Why start here? Because the Great Intention encompasses everything."

**The Luthier says:**
You don't plug in until you check these five things:

1.  **Setting the Gain (Generating the Great Intention)**:
    Before you play a single note, you gotta know *why* you're playing. Are you playing for the tip jar (Small Vehicle) or are you playing to blow the roof off the stadium (Great Vehicle)? This is the "Great Intention." It points straight to the "Great Abode"—the sound you hear in your head before you hit the string.

2.  **The Woodshed (Cultivating the Great Practice)**:
    Intention is nice, but can you play? This is where the **Four Samadhis** come in. It's the practice routine. 90 days sitting, 90 days walking—it's like practicing scales until your fingers bleed. If you ain't woodshedding, you ain't playing.

3.  **The Payoff (Realizing the Great Fruit)**:
    This is the sound coming out of the amp. The "Fruit." We talk about this early to keep the rookie excited. "Stick with it, kid, and one day you'll sound like Hendrix."

4.  **Cutting the Noise (Rending the Great Net)**:
    You got a hum in the line? That's "Doubt." That's the "Net." It traps you. You're sitting there thinking, "Do I really need true bypass?" Miao-lo says, "Rip that net open." You gotta cut the noise to hear the signal.

5.  **The Sweet Spot (Returning to the Great Abode)**:
    This is the final chord that rings out forever. The Secret Store. Nirvana without the static. It's where the signal goes back to silence, but it's a *loud* silence.

### The Chain of Custody (The Lineage)

Now, some people ask, "Who authorized you to fix this amp?"
Miao-lo pulls out the paperwork. It's called **The Lineage** (*Shicheng*).

**The Text says:** "The Golden Mouth Transmission lists both Person and Dharma."

**The Luthier says:**
This is about **Provenance**.
You buy a '59 Les Paul, you wanna see the serial number. You wanna know who owned it before you.
Miao-lo lays out the **Chain of Custody**:

1.  **The Source (The Buddha)**: The original luthier. The guy who built the design.
2.  **The 23 Studio Legends (The Indian Patriarchs)**: The guys who kept the design safe in the warehouse. They didn't change the specs; they just kept the humidity right.
3.  **The Link-Up (The 13th Master / Nāgārjuna)**: This is crucial. This is the guy who brought the design across the ocean. Miao-lo calls him the "High Ancestor." He's the bridge between the vintage era and the modern era.
4.  **The Local Heroes (Huiwen, Huisi, Zhiyi)**: The guys who set up shop on Mount Tiantai. They took that vintage design and built the *Mohe Zhiguan*—the ultimate tour rig.

Miao-lo argues: "If you break this chain, you're just playing a copy. A knockoff. It might look like the real thing, but plug it in and it squeals."

### The Bag and The Knot

Miao-lo uses this killer metaphor: **"The Bag and The Knot"** (*Nang Kuo*).
Imagine a gig bag full of expensive pedals.
- The **Ten Chapters** are the pedals inside.
- The **Five Summaries** are the drawstring.
- The **Great Intention** is the knot.

If you don't have the knot (The Intention), the bag opens up, the pedals fall out, and you leave your vintage Tube Screamer in the parking lot. You gotta keep it tight.
The "Summary" isn't a shortcut; it's the thing that holds the whole rig together.

## Luthier's Note

Miao-lo is telling us: "Don't be a gear snob, but respect the gear."
You need the **Intention** (The Knot) to hold the teaching together.
You need the **Lineage** (The Paperwork) to know you're not playing a fake.
And you need the **Summaries** (The Diagnostic) to make sure you're actually making music, not just making noise.
