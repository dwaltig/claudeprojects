## Object 2: The Affliction Object (煩惱境)

### The Setup

You're sitting. You're trying to practice. And then:

- Desire kicks up. You want something you don't have.
- Anger flares. You resent something that happened.
- Confusion thickens. You don't know what's real.

**That's the Affliction Object.**

It's not a sign you're doing it wrong. It's a sign you're doing it at all.

## Three Causes of Flare-Up

### Why It Kicks Up

When afflictions intensify during practice, there are three reasons:

**1. Habitual Stuff (習因)**

You've got patterns. Years of them. Lifetimes of them. When you sit still, they don't just disappear. They come to the surface.

> "If view-delusions and thought-delusions haven't been exhausted, this is simply habitual cause."

**Translation**: You've been doing this for a long time. It doesn't stop just because you sat down.

**2. Present-Moment Mistakes (作意)**

Sometimes you're generating it right now. Wrong attention. Wrong focus. You're feeding the fire.

> "If one generates afflictions through present activity, this is called intentional karma."

**Translation**: You're making it worse. Check your approach.

**3. Something External (魔事)**

Sometimes it's not just you. Something's messing with you. Could be external forces. Could be what the tradition calls "demons."

> "Demons may cause afflictions to arise."

**Translation**: Not everything is your fault. But you still gotta deal with it.

## The Three Poisons (三毒)

### The Root

Everything comes down to three:

| Poison | Chinese | What It Does |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Greed | 貪 | Wants what it doesn't have |
| Hatred | 瞋 | Pushes away what it doesn't want |
| Delusion | 癡 | Doesn't see what's actually happening |

**The pattern**:
- Pleasant thing appears → Greed kicks in
- Unpleasant thing appears → Hatred kicks in
- Neutral thing appears → Delusion kicks in

Every other affliction is a variation on these three.

## The Five Coverings (五蓋)

### What Blocks the Work

When you sit down to practice, five things cover the mind:

1. **Desire** (貪欲蓋) — Wanting sensory pleasure
2. **Ill-will** (瞋恚蓋) — Holding grudges
3. **Sloth-torpor** (睡眠蓋) — Too tired to focus
4. **Restlessness-remorse** (掉悔蓋) — Can't sit still, can't stop regretting
5. **Doubt** (疑蓋) — "Is this even working?"

These aren't special spiritual problems. They're what everybody deals with. The difference is: you're looking at them instead of just acting on them.

## The Eight Kinds of Pride (八慢)

### The Subtle Stuff

Once you start making progress, pride shows up. Eight flavors:

1. **Basic pride** (慢) — "I'm better than you"
2. **Excessive pride** (過慢) — "I'm equal to people who are better"
3. **Pride upon pride** (慢過慢) — "I'm better than people who are better"
4. **Self-pride** (我慢) — Attachment to "me"
5. **Presumptuous pride** (增上慢) — Claiming what you haven't realized
6. **Pride of inferiority** (卑慢) — "I'm only slightly worse"
7. **Wrong pride** (邪慢) — Pride in wrong accomplishments
8. **Arrogance** (傲慢) — General condescension

**The trap**: The further you go, the subtler the pride gets.

## Gradual Treatment: Specific Antidotes

### The Medicine Cabinet

Each poison has its medicine:

| Affliction | Antidote | What You Do |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Greed | Impurity practice (不淨觀) | See the body as it is |
| Hatred | Loving-kindness (慈悲觀) | Extend care, even to enemies |
| Delusion | Dependent origination (因緣觀) | See how things arise |
| Distraction | Breath-counting (數息觀) | Come back to the breath |
| Arrogance | Element-analysis (界分別觀) | See you're made of the same stuff as everyone |

**The rule**: Match the medicine to the disease.

If greed's the problem, don't use the hatred-medicine. If confusion's the problem, don't just count breaths.

## Sudden Treatment: Afflictions = Bodhi

### The Flip

Here's where Tiantai gets interesting:

> "Afflictions are precisely bodhi" (煩惱即菩提)

**Wait, what?**

Miao-lo's not saying "go ahead and be angry." He's saying:

> "This does not mean indulgence. It means thoroughly penetrating that the nature of afflictions is empty."

**Translation**: When you look directly at the greed, what do you find? Nothing solid. No "greed" sitting there. Just activity arising and passing.

The greed you thought was blocking you? It's made of the same stuff as everything else. Empty. Provisional. Middle.

**That's the sudden treatment.** Not applying an antidote. Seeing that there's nothing there to fight.

## Applying the Ten Modes to Afflictions

### The Full Treatment

Each of the ten tools works on afflictions:

**Mode 1: The Inconceivable Object (觀不思議境)**
Contemplate that afflictions are the dharma-realm (法界). In one thought, three thousand realms. The greed contains everything. The hatred contains everything.

**Mode 2: Arousing the Mind (發菩提心)**
Because of these afflictions, generate the vow. "Sentient beings are limitless; afflictions are inexhaustible." The vow arises **because** of the problem, not in spite of it.

**Mode 3: Settling the Mind (善巧安心)**
Don't run from the affliction. Don't chase it. Settle the mind **on** it. Neither moving nor turning.

**Mode 4: Breaking Through (破法遍)**
Break through the characteristics of the affliction. What is it? Where is it? Who has it?

**Mode 5: Openness and Obstruction (識通塞)**
Affliction is obstruction. Understanding affliction as empty is openness. Openness and obstruction are non-dual.

**Modes 6-10**: Adjust, treat, locate, endure, and let go.

## The 36-Sentence Framework

### How It's Organized

The tradition maps it out:

- 6 sense organs × 6 objects = 36 contact points
- Each contact point can be viewed as observer or observed
- 36 × 2 = 72 ways to analyze

But here's what matters:

**Every door is both entrance and exit.**

The greed that blocks you? It's also the door through. Not around it. Through it.

## The Luthier's Take

### The Performance Anxiety

Before a big gig, the anxiety kicks up. Sweaty palms. Racing thoughts. "What if I mess up?"

You've got two options:

**Option 1**: Try to suppress it. Push it down. Pretend it's not there.
Result: It comes out sideways. Your timing's off. Your feel is wrong.

**Option 2**: Let it be there. Feel the anxiety. Play anyway.
Result: The anxiety becomes fuel. The edge becomes sharpness.

That's what Miao-lo's teaching. The afflictions aren't separate from the performance. They're part of it. Work with them, not against them.

---

## What You Did Wrong

### The Previous Practice

Back in the preliminaries (訶欲棄蓋), you learned to "reject desires and abandon coverings." Good.

But that was preparation. This is the gig.

The difference:

| Then | Now |
|------|-----|
| Before practice | During practice |
| Preparation | Application |
| Getting ready | Actually working |

The afflictions that come up **during** practice are a different category. You're not just preparing the ground. You're working the ground.

## What's Next

You've got the Affliction Object. Mind's doing its thing.

But what about the body?
