## The Second Half of the Tool Kit

### Where We Are Now

Alright. You've got the first four tools from the Ten Tools (十乘觀法):

1. **The Hologram** (一念三千) — See the whole shop in the screw
2. **The True Heart** (發真正菩提心) — Why you're doing this
3. **The Good Stop** (善巧安心) — Where to rest the mind
4. **The Breaking** (破法遍) — How to dismantle everything

Those got you started. But now comes the **diagnostic work**.

What happens when you've got the method but it's **not working**?

That's what Fascicle 7 is about. **Modes 5-10**. The tools you reach for when the build hits a snag.

## The Diagnostic Six

### Mode 5: Openness and Obstruction (通塞)

**What it is**: Checking whether the path is **clear** or **blocked**.

**The metaphor**: You're driving to the gig. The GPS shows the route. But there's a roadblock. Or construction. Or you took a wrong turn.

**通** (tōng) = **Open road**. You're moving.
**塞** (sè) = **Blocked**. Something's in the way.

**The point**: Even if your method is perfect, you can get **stuck**. This tool helps you see **where** you're stuck and **why**.

### Mode 6: Adjustment of Path Factors (道品調適)

**What it is**: **Tuning the practice** to fit the situation.

**The metaphor**: You don't use the same settings on every amp. Different rooms, different bands, different songs.

**The point**: The 37 factors of awakening are your **toolkit**. But you gotta know **which tool** to reach for **when**.

### Mode 7: Counteractive Aids (對治助開)

**What it is**: **Medicine for what ails you**.

**The metaphor**: The guitar's buzzing. Where's it coming from? Fret? Nut? Bridge? You diagnose, then you **treat**.

**The six perfections** (布施, 持戒, 忍辱, 精進, 禪定, 般若) are the **six medicines** for the **six poisons** (慳, 破戒, 瞋, 懈怠, 散亂, 愚癡).

**The point**: When regular practice isn't cutting it, you need **targeted treatment**.

### Mode 8: Knowing the Stages (知次位)

**What it is**: **Knowing where you are on the map**.

**The metaphor**: You're on the road. But are you in Kansas or California? Don't claim you've arrived when you're still three states away.

**The point**: This prevents **overestimation** (thinking you're further than you are) and **underestimation** (not recognizing real progress).

### Mode 9: Patient Endurance (安忍)

**What it is**: **Staying steady when the heat comes**.

**The metaphor**: The gig's going south. Hecklers. Bad sound. Broken string. You don't walk off. You **play through**.

**The point**: Inner obstacles (doubt, fear) and outer obstacles (criticism, hardship) will arise. This tool is **how you hold your ground**.

### Mode 10: Freedom from Dharma-Attachment (無法愛)

**What it is**: **Not getting stuck on the method itself**.

**The metaphor**: You love the vintage amp so much you refuse to play through anything else. Even when the vintage amp is broken.

**The point**: The practice is a **raft**. It gets you across. But if you reach the other shore and keep carrying the raft on your back, you've missed the point.

## Why This Matters

### The Problem

You've learned the method. You're sitting. You're contemplating. And **nothing's happening**.

Or worse: Something's happening, but it's **wrong**. You're getting more anxious. More confused. More stuck.

### The Solution

**Diagnose the obstruction**. Figure out where the block is. Apply the right treatment. Know where you are. Stay steady. Don't cling.

**That's Modes 5-10.**

## The Luthier's Note

The first four tools are about **what to do**.

The next six tools are about **what to do when what you're doing isn't working**.

This is the **troubleshooting manual**. The part of the repair guide that says: "If the previous steps didn't work, check the following..."

Most people never get past step 4. They try the method, it doesn't work immediately, and they give up.

Miao-lo's saying: **Don't give up**. The method works. But you might be blocked. You might need adjustment. You might need treatment. You might be confused about where you are. You might need to endure. You might be clinging.

**Tools 5-10 are for all of that.**
