## Opening Word

Meditative attainment can steady practice.
It can also trap practice.

So this section teaches:
receive concentration,
refuse fixation.

---

## Dhyana and Formless Absorption

Four dhyanas,
then subtler formless absorptions,
can arise with great refinement.

Danger is not the state itself.
Danger is clinging to the state
as final completion.

---

## Dhyana and Prajna

Concentration stabilizes.
Wisdom liberates.

Without wisdom,
concentration can become spiritual sleep.
Without concentration,
wisdom can become unstable concept-work.

Path maturity requires both.

---

## Ten-Mode Reapplication

Contemplate meditative states
as empty,
provisional,
and middle.

Keep bodhi intention active
so peace is not privatized.

Most crucial here:
release dharma-attachment.

Attainment respected,
attachment relinquished.

---

## Integration Arc

Three stages are marked:
deliberate,
natural,
complete.

At first,
modes are consciously applied.

Then modes arise with less friction.

Finally,
practice and life
are no longer split fields.

Stopping and contemplating
function as one event.

---

## Closing Moan

Do not fear attainment.
Do not worship attainment.

Use it,
see through it,
release it,
continue.

That is integration.
