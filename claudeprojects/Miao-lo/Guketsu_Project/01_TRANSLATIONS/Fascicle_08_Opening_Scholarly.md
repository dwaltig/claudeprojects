## Overview: From Method to Application

Fascicle 8 marks a critical transition in Miao-lo's commentary. Having completed the exposition of the Ten Modes of Contemplation (十乘觀法) in Fascicles 5-7, Miao-lo now addresses what happens when the practitioner **encounters objects** (歷緣對境) in the course of practice.

The Ten Modes provided the foundational methodology. But practice does not occur in a vacuum. The meditator encounters:

- **Internal disturbances**: Afflictions (煩惱), illness (病患), karmic manifestations (業)
- **External phenomena**: Demonic interference (魔事), meditative states (禪定), wrong views (邪見)
- **Advanced stages**: The two vehicles (二乘), bodhisattva practice (菩薩), and Buddhahood (佛)

These are the **Ten Objects** (十境) — phenomena that arise during contemplation and require skilled response.

## The Ten Objects (十境)

Miao-lo provides this structural overview:

| # | Object | Chinese | Function |
|---|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Aggregates | 陰入境 | Foundation: contemplate the five aggregates |
| 2 | Afflictions | 煩惱境 | Obstacle: recognize and transform defilements |
| 3 | Illness | 病患境 | Obstacle: work with physical disease |
| 4 | Karma | 業境 | Obstacle: address past actions manifesting |
| 5 | Demons | 魔事境 | Obstacle: discern and resist demonic interference |
| 6 | Meditative States | 禪定境 | Attainment: navigate dhyāna without attachment |
| 7 | Wrong Views | 邪見境 | Obstacle: correct mistaken understanding |
| 8 | Arrogance | 慢境 | Obstacle: overcome spiritual pride |
| 9 | Two Vehicles | 二乘境 | Attainment: transcend limited aspiration |
| 10 | Bodhisattva | 菩薩境 | Attainment: fulfill the bodhisattva path |

**Fascicle 8 covers Objects 2-4**: Afflictions, Illness, and Karma.

## The Relationship Between Objects and Modes

Miao-lo clarifies a crucial structural point:

> 自此以下現文六境及略三境。咸是發得。

"From this point onward, the text presents six objects in detail and three objects briefly. All are 'arising and obtaining' [phenomena]."

The Ten Objects are not separate from the Ten Modes. Rather:

- The **Ten Modes** are the contemplative methodology
- The **Ten Objects** are what arises during contemplation
- The practitioner applies the Ten Modes **to** each Object

> 此九境外所起煩惱。乃至四弘但屬陰境三陰所攝。

"Afflictions arising outside these nine objects, and even the four great vows, belong to the aggregate-object and are subsumed under the three aggregates."

This establishes that all phenomena ultimately reduce to the first object (aggregates), but the Buddha distinguished nine additional objects for pedagogical purposes.

---

## The Three Obstacles (三障)

Miao-lo connects the Ten Objects to the traditional classification of three obstacles:

> 如前七隻分別中。云此之十境是三障攝。

"As in the previous sevenfold distinction, these ten objects are subsumed under the three obstacles."

From the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*:

| Obstacle | Chinese | Contents |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Affliction Obstacle | 煩惱障 | Three poisons, five coverings, eight kinds of arrogance, four perversities |
| Karma Obstacle | 業障 | Five heinous acts |
| Retribution Obstacle | 報障 | Three evil paths, slandering the Dharma, icchantika |

> 故知舉惡能障。故名為障。

"Therefore we know that citing evils that can obstruct is why they are called 'obstacles.'"

## The Transition: From Foundation to Application

### What Came Before (Fascicles 5-7)

The Ten Modes established:
1. **Mode 1**: Contemplating the inconceivable object (一念三千)
2. **Mode 2**: Arousing the bodhi-mind
3. **Mode 3**: Skillfully settling the mind
4. **Mode 4**: Breaking through all dharmas
5. **Mode 5**: Discerning openness and obstruction
6. **Mode 6**: Adjusting the path factors
7. **Mode 7**: Counteractive aids for opening
8. **Mode 8**: Knowing the sequential positions
9. **Mode 9**: Patient endurance
10. **Mode 10**: Freedom from Dharma-attachment

### What Comes Now (Fascicle 8)

The practitioner, equipped with these ten tools, now encounters specific phenomena that require their application:

1. **Afflictions** (煩惱境): When the three poisons intensify during practice
2. **Illness** (病患境): When physical disease arises
3. **Karma** (業境): When past actions manifest as visions or obstacles

Each of these objects receives:
- Analysis of causes and conditions
- Classification of types
- Treatment methods (both gradual and sudden)
- Application of the ten contemplative modes

## Doctrinal Significance

Fascicle 8 represents the integration of contemplative theory with practical application. The Ten Modes are not merely conceptual frameworks but living tools to be applied when the practitioner encounters obstacles.

Miao-lo's approach is distinctive in several ways:

1. **Comprehensive Classification**: Every phenomenon that can arise during practice is categorized and addressed.

2. **Integration of Medical Knowledge**: The illness section incorporates traditional Chinese medicine (pulse diagnosis, five elements, organ theory) within a Buddhist contemplative framework.

3. **Karmic Psychology**: The karma section addresses how past actions manifest as visions and obstacles during meditation, providing both diagnostic and therapeutic guidance.

4. **Gradual and Sudden Methods**: Each object receives both gradual (思議) and sudden (不思議) treatment approaches, accommodating practitioners of different capacities.
