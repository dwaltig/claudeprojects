## Mode 8: Knowing the Stages (知次位) — Part 1

### The Setup

You've got the diagnostic (Mode 5). You've got the tuning and treatment (Modes 6-7). Now comes the question:

**Where are you on the map?**

This is critical. Miao-lo says:

> "If you haven't entered the position but think you have, you commit a **grave offense**."

**Translation**: Claiming enlightenment you haven't attained is a lie. And not a small one.

## Why This Matters

### The Danger of Overestimation

You have a good sitting. You feel clear. You think: "I got it. I'm there."

**You're not.**

That feeling of clarity? It might be the **first stage**. Or it might be **gas**.

If you claim you're at the tenth stage when you're at the first, you:
- Mislead yourself
- Mislead others
- Create karma

### The Danger of Underestimation

On the flip side: You might have genuine insight and dismiss it as "nothing special."

That's also a problem. You might abandon the path right when it's about to open.

**Solution**: Know the stages. Read the map. Don't lie to yourself.

## The Four Foundations of Mindfulness (四念處)

### The Core Practice

Before you can know your stage, you need to **establish mindfulness**. That's where the Four Foundations come in:

1. **Body** (身念處) — Mindfulness of the body
2. **Feeling** (受念處) — Mindfulness of sensations
3. **Mind** (心念處) — Mindfulness of mental states
4. **Dharmas** (法念處) — Mindfulness of phenomena

### 1. Contemplation of the Body: The Five Impurities

The body is **not pure**. Miao-lo breaks it down:

**Seed Impurity** (種子不淨):
Where did this body come from? From "grasping another's leavings" — sperm and egg, red and white drops. Not exactly divine origin.

**Place Impurity** (住處不淨):
Where does the fetus live? In the womb. "Vile and crowded," says the *Great Treatise*.

**Characteristic Impurity** (自相不淨):
Even if you dress it up — fine clothes, perfume, good food — wait a day. It all becomes waste. The body's nature is to produce filth.

**Self-Nature Impurity** (自性不淨):
Pus, blood, phlegm, snot, sweat, tears — constantly flowing. "Like a leaky bag filled with impure things."

**Ultimate Impurity** (究竟不淨):
In the end? A corpse. Bloating, putrefying, bones scattered.

**The Point**: This isn't pessimism. It's **seeing clearly**. You're not the body. The body is a process, not a possession.

### 2. Contemplation of Feelings: The Three Sufferings

**Suffering of Suffering** (苦苦):
Obvious pain. Illness, injury, hunger, cold.

**Suffering of Change** (壞苦):
Pleasure that ends. The meal is delicious — then you're full, then hungry again. The joy of meeting — then parting.

**Suffering of Conditioning** (行苦):
The subtle, pervasive unsatisfactoriness of conditioned existence. Even neutral moments are unstable.

**The Metaphor** (from *Abhidharmakośa*):

> "Like placing a single eyelash on your palm — you don't feel it. But place it in your eye — it causes distress and unease. Ordinary beings are like the palm — they don't perceive the suffering of conditioning. The wise are like the eye — they feel even subtle discomfort intensely."

### 3. Contemplation of Impermanence

**The Cage and the Bird**:

> "Like a bird entering a cage — caught by the hunter's net. When the cage breaks, the bird flies out. The spirit follows karma."

Your body is the cage. Your consciousness is the bird. Karma is the net. When this body breaks, consciousness moves on — to another cage.

**The Wax Seal**:

From the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sutra*:

> "Like a wax seal pressed into clay — the seal is destroyed, the impression appears. The impression doesn't come from the clay, doesn't come from elsewhere. Through the condition of the seal, the pattern appears."

This life is the seal. The next life is the impression. The pattern continues, but nothing permanent transfers.

**The Point**: Don't wait. The breath you just took might be your last. "The out-breath doesn't guarantee the in-breath."

### 4. Contemplation of Non-Self

**The Ghost Room Story**:

Two monks arrive at a monastery. There's a room no one uses — rumored to be haunted. The first monk takes it, determined to confront the ghost. Later, a second monk arrives, also assigned to that room.

Night falls. The second monk knocks. The first monk thinks: "The ghost!" He doesn't open. The second monk pounds harder. The first monk braces the door. They struggle all night.

Dawn comes. They see each other — fellow monks, old friends. They'd been fighting their own fear, not a ghost.

**The Point**: We fight phantoms. The "self" we defend doesn't exist. The "enemy" we attack is our own projection.

**The Two Ghosts and the Corpse**:

A traveler sleeps in an abandoned pavilion. A ghost arrives carrying a corpse. Another ghost follows, claiming: "That's MY corpse!"

They argue. They ask the traveler: "Who brought the corpse?"

He thinks: "If I tell the truth, one ghost will kill me. If I lie, the other will kill me. Either way, I die. Better to tell the truth."

He tells the truth. The first ghost tears off his arm. The second ghost replaces it with an arm from the corpse. They tear and replace, tear and replace, until the traveler's entire body is replaced.

The ghosts leave. The traveler wonders: "Is this my body? Or the corpse's body? Or no body at all?"

He wanders to a monastery. The monks teach him: "The body was **never yours** to begin with. It's always been borrowed parts, assembled by conditions."

He understands. He ordains. He attains liberation.

**The Point**: There's no fixed "you" inside this body. The body is a collaborative project of conditions, constantly being replaced. Attachment to it is attachment to nothing.

## The Three Animals: Deer, Larger Deer, Elephant

### The Metaphor

How do the three vehicles respond to the Buddha's teaching on impermanence?

**The Śrāvaka (聲聞) — Like a Small Deer (麞)**:

Hunters surround the forest (birth, aging, sickness, death). The deer is terrified. It runs — doesn't look back, doesn't help others, just **escapes**.

"Not pausing to drink or eat, single-mindedly fleeing danger."

**The Pratyekabuddha (緣覺) — Like a Larger Deer (鹿)**:

Also surrounded. Also flees. But this deer **looks back**. It calls to the herd. It feels some sadness for those left behind.

"Though fleeing, turning back with mournful cries — hesitating, yet moving forward."

**The Bodhisattva (菩薩) — Like a Great Elephant (大象)**:

The elephant hears the hunters' approach. It has the power to escape alone. But it **stays**.

It leads the herd. It carries the weak. It breaks through the encirclement, bringing everyone to safety.

"Knowing its own great power, enduring the dangers of birth-and-death, taking all beings across."

### The Application

**Which animal are you?**

If you practice only for your own liberation — small deer.

If you practice for yourself but feel compassion — larger deer.

If you practice to bring all beings to liberation — elephant.

**The Tiantai ideal**: Be the elephant. But don't pretend to be an elephant if you're still a deer. **Know your stage**.

## The Luthier's Take

### The Map

You're driving cross-country. You need to know:
- Where you started
- Where you are now
- Where you're going

If you think you're in California when you're in Kansas, you'll make wrong turns.

If you think you're in Kansas when you're in California, you'll miss the beach.

**Read the map. Know your stage.**

### The Animals

Some musicians play for themselves. They're good. They get their satisfaction. **Small deer**.

Some musicians play for themselves but wish they could help others. They teach a little, when it's convenient. **Larger deer**.

Some musicians play to **serve the music** — and through the music, everyone who hears it. They carry the tradition. They bring others along. **Elephant**.

**Which one are you?**

---

## What's Next

You've got the Four Foundations. You understand the Three Animals. You know why knowing your stage matters.

But how do you **stay steady** when the path gets hard? And how do you avoid getting attached to the path itself?

That's Modes 9 and 10: **Patient Endurance** and **Freedom from Dharma-Attachment**.

Coming up in Section 4.
