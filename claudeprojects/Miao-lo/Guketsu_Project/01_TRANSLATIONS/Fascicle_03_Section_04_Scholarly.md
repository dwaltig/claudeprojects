## Introduction: Conditional Objects

After mastering the contemplation of the **First Object** (Aggregates), the practitioner may encounter one or more of the **remaining nine objects**. These are called "conditional" because they arise **only when needed**.

Miao-lo emphasizes: 
> "If the First Object is thoroughly realized, the remaining nine may never arise. But if they do arise, they must be recognized and worked with using the same Ten Modes."

## Object 2: Afflictions (煩惱境)

### What It Is
Strong afflictions (greed, anger, delusion) that arise during practice and **cannot be resolved** through aggregate contemplation alone.

### When It Arises
-   Practitioner has deep-rooted afflictions
-   Past karma activates strong emotions
-   Environmental triggers

### How to Work With It

**Apply the Ten Modes to the affliction itself**:
1.  **Contemplate the inconceivable**: See the affliction as empty, conventional, and middle
2.  **Generate Bodhi-Mind**: Vow to help all beings with this affliction
3.  **Stabilize**: Use Zhi-Guan to settle with the affliction as object
4.  **Break through**: Deconstruct views about the affliction
5.  **Discern**: Know what helps/hinders working with this affliction

> "The affliction is not other than Buddha-nature. To see anger clearly is to see the Dharma-realm."

---

## Object 3: Illness (病患境)

### What It Is
Physical sickness that arises during practice and **interferes** with contemplation.

### Types of Illness

| Type | Cause | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **Four Element Imbalance** | Earth, water, fire, wind out of balance | Medical treatment + contemplation |
| **Karmic Illness** | Past karma ripening | Contemplation + repentance |
| **Demonic Illness** | Māra's interference | Protective practices + contemplation |
| **Practice-Induced** | Improper method | Correct the method |

### How to Work With It

**Use illness as the object**:
-   Contemplate the pain as empty and impermanent
-   See the body as the aggregates (return to Object 1)
-   Apply patience (Mode 9)
-   Seek medical treatment when appropriate

> "Illness is a teacher. It reveals attachment to the body."

---

## Object 4: Karmic Impressions (業相境)

### What It Is
Past karma manifesting as **visions, memories, or experiences** during meditation.

### Examples
-   Visions of past lives
-   Memories of past actions
-   Karmic debts becoming conscious

### How to Work With It

**Do not engage with the content**:
-   Recognize it as karmic manifestation
-   Contemplate it as empty
-   Do not be disturbed or fascinated
-   Continue with the practice

> "Karmic visions are like dreams. They have no substance. Do not chase them or flee from them."

---

## Object 5: Demonic Interference (魔事境)

### What It Is
Obstacles created by **Māra** (internal or external) to disrupt practice.

### Four Types of Māra

| Type | Chinese | Manifestation |
|---|---|---|
| **Affliction-Māra** | 煩惱魔 | Internal afflictions intensifying |
| **Aggregate-Māra** | 陰魔 | Attachment to body-mind |
| **Death-Māra** | 死魔 | Fear of death or impermanence |
| **Heavenly-Māra** | 天魔 | External interference |

### How to Work With It

**The key is non-engagement**:
-   Do not fear or fight
-   Contemplate all phenomena as empty
-   Maintain precepts and protective practices
-   Seek guidance if needed

> "Māra has no power over one who sees emptiness. Like a shadow, it disappears in light."

---

## Object 6: Meditative States (禪定境)

### What It Is
Attainment of **dhyāna** (禪定) or other meditative absorptions that the practitioner might mistake for the final goal.

### The Four Dhyānas

| Dhyāna | Characteristics |
|---|---|
| **First** | Joy and bliss with thought |
| **Second** | Joy and bliss without thought |
| **Third** | Equanimity and subtle bliss |
| **Fourth** | Pure equanimity |

### The Danger

Attachment to these states leads to:
-   Rebirth in the form realm
-   Stagnation in practice
-   Mistaking dhyāna for prajñā

### How to Work With It

**Apply Mode 10 (Release Dharma-Attachment)**:
-   Recognize dhyāna as conditioned
-   See it as empty
-   Do not cling to the experience
-   Continue toward prajñā

> "Dhyāna is like a rest stop on a journey. Enjoy the rest, but do not make it your home."

---

## Object 7: Wrong Views (諸見境)

### What It Is
Mistaken intellectual understandings that arise during practice.

### Common Wrong Views

| View | Error |
|---|---|
| **Eternalism** | Believing in permanent self |
| **Nihilism** | Believing in annihilation |
| **One-sided emptiness** | Clinging to emptiness, rejecting form |
| **One-sided form** | Clinging to form, rejecting emptiness |

### How to Work With It

**Apply Mode 4 (Break Through)**:
-   Deconstruct all views systematically
-   Study the Middle Way
-   Seek guidance from teachers
-   Contemplate dependent origination

> "Views are like chains. Even golden chains bind."

---

## Object 8: Pride (慢境)

### What It Is
Arrogance arising from **partial attainment**.

### Seven Types of Pride

| Type | Manifestation |
|---|---|
| **Simple pride** | "I am better" |
| **Greater pride** | "I am superior to superiors" |
| **Pride of pride** | "I am the best" |
| **Self-pride** | "I am" |
| **Inferior pride** | "I am only slightly inferior" |
| **False pride** | Pride in non-attainments |
| **Perverse pride** | Pride in wrong things |

### How to Work With It

**Study the Six Identities** (Mode 8):
-   Understand the stages clearly
-   Recognize current level honestly
-   Serve others with humility
-   Contemplate the elements

> "Pride is the last fetter. Even advanced practitioners must watch for it."

---

## Object 9: Two Vehicles (二乘境)

### What It Is
Tendency toward **Hīnayāna** (śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha) practice—seeking personal liberation rather than universal Buddhahood.

### Signs
-   Desire to escape saṃsāra alone
-   Lack of compassion for others
-   Satisfaction with partial realization

### How to Work With It

**Recall Bodhi-Mind** (Mode 2):
-   Remember the Four Great Vows
-   Cultivate compassion
-   Study Mahāyāna teachings
-   Engage in bodhisattva practices

> "The Two Vehicles are not wrong, but they are incomplete. The Perfect Teaching embraces all."

---

## Object 10: Bodhisattva (菩薩境)

### What It Is
Advanced experiences on the **Bodhisattva path**—the ten stages (十地), supernatural powers, etc.

### The Danger

Even at this level:
-   Subtle attachment may remain
-   Pride in attainment
-   Dharma-attachment

### How to Work With It

**Apply all Ten Modes**:
-   Continue to see all phenomena as Three Truths
-   Release attachment even to bodhisattva attainments
-   Proceed toward complete Buddhahood

> "The bodhisattva path has many stages. Do not stop until the ultimate goal."

---

## Summary: The Principle of Working with All Objects

**The method is always the same**:
1.  **Recognize** which object has arisen
2.  **Apply the Ten Modes** to that object
3.  **Do not be disturbed** by the object
4.  **Continue** toward realization

| Object | Primary Approach |
|---|---|
| Afflictions | See as empty, generate compassion |
| Illness | Contemplate pain, seek treatment |
| Karmic Impressions | Do not engage, see as empty |
| Demonic Interference | Do not fear, contemplate emptiness |
| Meditative States | Do not cling, continue to prajñā |
| Wrong Views | Deconstruct, study Middle Way |
| Pride | Study Six Identities, serve others |
| Two Vehicles | Recall Bodhi-Mind, cultivate compassion |
| Bodhisattva | Apply all modes, release attachment |

**Miao-lo's Final Point**:
> "Whatever arises, use it. Every object, when properly contemplated, becomes a vehicle to realization."
