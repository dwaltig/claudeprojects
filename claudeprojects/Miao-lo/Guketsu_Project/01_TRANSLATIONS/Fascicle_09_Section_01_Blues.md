## The Root Zens (Worldly Gear)

These are the factory settings. The stuff everyone gets if they sit long enough.

### The Eight Touches: The Signal Check

Before you hit the high states, the body lets you know it's working. This is the **Eight Touches** (八觸):
1.  **Movement**: You feel like you're swaying, even if you're still.
2.  **Itch**: Like bugs crawling on you.
3.  **Coolness**: A sudden breeze.
4.  **Heat**: A flush of warmth.
5.  **Lightness**: Feeling like you're floating.
6.  **Heaviness**: Feeling like a stone.
7.  **Roughness**: Skin feels like sandpaper.
8.  **Smoothness**: Skin feels like silk.

**The Luthier says**: "This is just the tubes warming up. Don't freak out. Don't chase it. Just let the amp hum."

### The Four Dhyānas: The Clean Channels

**Channel 1: Joy (First Dhyāna)**
- **The Sound**: Loud, happy, buzzing. You still have "thinking" (vitarka/vicara) going on, like a slight hum in the background.
- **The Trap**: You fall in love with the buzz.

**Channel 2: Purity (Second Dhyāna)**
- **The Sound**: The hum stops. The thinking mind shuts up. It's just pure, clean tone.
- **The Feel**: Internal joy bubbling up.

**Channel 3: Bliss (Third Dhyāna)**
- **The Sound**: Deep, rich, heavy bass. The "joy" (excitement) settles into "bliss" (deep contentment).
- **The Warning**: This is the most addictive sound in the world. People get stuck here for eons.

**Channel 4: Silence (Fourth Dhyāna)**
- **The Sound**: Dead silence. No pain, no pleasure. The breath stops. The mind is a mirror.
- **The Reality**: It's still just a state. You haven't left the building yet.

## The Transitional Gear (Also-Worldly-Also-Transcendental)

This is where you start modding the amp. You add **Wisdom** to the mix.

### The Six Wondrous Gates
1.  **Count**: One, two, three... keeping the rhythm.
2.  **Follow**: Stop counting, just ride the groove.
3.  **Stop**: Freeze the groove.
4.  **Look**: Analyze the groove. What is it made of?
5.  **Return**: Turn the knobs back to zero. Who is listening?
6.  **Purify**: The sound is gone. The listener is gone. Clean.

### The Sixteen Special Excellences (The Pro Mods)
This is breath practice, but with a **lens**. You don't just "watch the breath." You watch the breath **impermanent**, **fading**, **ceasing**.
It prevents you from getting stuck in the "Flavor" (craving) of the dhyānas.

**The Luthier says**: "It's like playing a solo, but knowing the silence between the notes is more important than the notes. That keeps you honest."
