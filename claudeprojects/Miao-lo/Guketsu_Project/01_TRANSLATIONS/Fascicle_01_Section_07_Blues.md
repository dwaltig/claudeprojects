## The Question

Miao-lo asks: "Is the first guy who picks up a soldering iron the same as the master luthier who's built five hundred guitars?"

This ain't philosophy. This is a trap you gotta avoid.

### Trap 1: The Premature Master
You take one class. You watch a YouTube video. You buy a Fender body blank. You tell everyone you're a "guitar builder."

**Reality**: You're not. You haven't wound a humbucker, carved a neck heel, or set intonation on a tremolo bridge.

*This is **Arrogance**. You stop learning because you think you've arrived.*

### Trap 2: The Eternal Apprentice
You see a 1959 Les Paul. You see a pre-war Martin D-28. You think, "I could never make anything like that. I'll just keep buying kits and never finish."

**Reality**: The guy who made that D-28 started somewhere. He didn't start with a D-28.

*This is **Despair**. You stop trying because you think you'll never get there.*

## The Solution: The Six Stages

The **Six Identities** say: **You ARE a master luthier (即).** But also: **You ain't finished the build yet (六).**

Both are true. Here's how it works.

---

### Stage 1: The Blueprint (*Li Ji*)
**You have the DNA.**
Every human being has hands, a brain, and the capacity to make something beautiful. You were born with the *potential* to build a resonant instrument.

**But**: You don't know it. You've never walked into a shop. You've never held a chisel.

**The Luthier says**: "You *are* a luthier... in theory. But theory don't make music."

---

### Stage 2: The First Class (*Ming Zi Ji*)
**You learn the vocabulary.**
Someone teaches you: "This is a fret. This is a nut. This is a radius. This is a scale length."

You can *talk* about guitar building. You've read the books. You've subscribed to the forums.

**But**: You haven't cut wood yet.

**The Luthier says**: "Don't skip this stage. The guys who 'just jump in' without learning anything first... they ruin good wood. Get the knowledge first."

---

### Stage 3: The First Cuts (*Guan Xing Ji*)
**Knowledge meets the workbench.**
You finally pick up the router. You cut your first fret slots. You install your first tuners.

Is it pretty? **No.**
Is it playable? **Barely.**

**But**: You *did* it. Your hands know something now that your head didn't.

**The Luthier says**: "This is where the worm eats the wood and *happens* to make a 'character.' It looks like something. It's real. But it's wobbly. Keep going."

---

### Stage 4: Getting Closer (*Xiang Si Ji*)
**Your builds start to *resemble* a real guitar.**
The necks are straighter. The frets are level. The intonation is... close. People play them and say, "Hey, this is pretty good."

**But**: A pro can still tell. The action is slightly off. The finish has orange peel. The setup isn't quite dialed.

**The Luthier says**: "You're shooting closer to the bullseye. Every build, you get a little tighter. Don't stop."

---

### Stage 5: The Breakthrough (*Fen Zhen Ji*)
**You break through.**
You build a guitar that *plays*. That *sounds*. That *feels* right. A gigging musician picks it up and says, "I'll buy this."

You have achieved **a portion** of mastery. You can now build *instruments*, not just "projects."

**But**: You're not done. There are still things you can't do. You haven't built a hollow-body. You haven't carved an arched top. You haven't wound your own pickups.

**The Luthier says**: "The moon is on the fourteenth night. Almost full. But not quite."

---

### Stage 6: The Master (*Jiu Jing Ji*)
**The full moon.**
You have built every style. Carved every top. Wound every coil. Your hands move without thinking. The instrument *plays itself* into existence.

There is nowhere else to go. You *are* the craft.

**The Luthier says**: "This is it. There's no note higher than this one. You're running out of frets."

## The Parable: The Buried Gold

Miao-lo tells a story from an old sutra:

> There was a poor woman. Under her house was a massive gold treasure. She never knew.
> A stranger came and said, "There's gold under your floor."
> She started digging.
> Eventually, she hit gold.
> She dug it all out.
> She used it freely.

| **Stage** | **What She Did** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Blueprint** | Gold exists. She doesn't know. |
| **2. First Class** | Stranger tells her. |
| **3. First Cuts** | She starts digging. |
| **4. Getting Closer** | She gets near. |
| **5. Breakthrough** | She hits gold. |
| **6. Master** | She uses it all. |

**The gold was always there.** She just had to dig.

## Why This Only Works for the "Perfect Teaching"

Miao-lo says: You can't use this "六即" framework in the lower schools.

**Tripiṭaka (Theravāda-style)**: "You're not the gold. The gold is over there. You're the dirt." (No Identity)

**Shared Teaching**: "Okay, the dirt is kind of like gold if you squint." (Partial Identity)

**Distinct Teaching**: "You have to dig through the dirt first, *then* you find the gold." (Sequential Identity)

**Perfect Teaching**: "The dirt *is* the gold. You *are* the treasure. But you still gotta dig." (Full Identity + Six Stages)

### The Crucial Point: Inherent Inclusion (性具)

Now pay attention, because this is where Tiantai parts company with everybody else.

Other schools say: "Your afflictions will *transform into* wisdom." Or: "Your delusion *contains* Buddha-nature somewhere inside."

Tiantai says: **No. The dirt doesn't contain the gold. The dirt doesn't become the gold. The dirt IS the gold.**

This is called 性具 (*xingju*)—"Inherent Inclusion." It means your anger, your greed, your confusion—right now, as they are, without transformation—are *already complete* as Buddha-nature. Not "will be." Not "contains the seed of." ARE.

Why does this matter? Because if you think you have to *get rid of* the dirt to find the gold, you'll spend your whole life digging in the wrong direction. The Six Identities work because you're not becoming something else. You're recognizing what you already are—fully, completely, right now.

The digging isn't about removing dirt. It's about recognizing what the dirt always was.

## Luthier's Verdict

The Six Stages are the solution to the two traps.

1.  **If you think you're already the master**: Look at Stage 1. You've got the *potential*. You haven't done the work.
2.  **If you think you'll never be the master**: Look at Stage 6. That guy started at Stage 1, too. *You have the same gold.*

Don't get arrogant. Don't get depressed. Just keep building.

**END OF TAPE**
