## Closing Word

Fascicle 4 is the bridge
from foundational method
to embodied depth.

It does not change the road.
It deepens how the road is walked.

---

## Core Consolidation

Afflictions:
not merely enemies,
but recognition fields.

Illness,
karma,
Mara:
not outside practice,
but conditions requiring right diagnosis.

Meditative attainment:
valuable,
yet dangerous when clung to.

Integration:
from deliberate method
into natural, continuous functioning.

---

## Operational Memory

When a hard object arises:
1. Recognize it.
2. Name its type.
3. Apply matched ten-mode function.
4. Release fixation.

This keeps depth from collapsing
into either repression or indulgence.

---

## Transitional Emphasis

The fascicle hands forward
three commitments:
keep bodhi intention active,
keep three-truth seeing active,
keep release active.

Without those three,
advanced states regress into subtle bondage.

---

## Closing Moan

No object is final.
No attainment is final.
No obstacle is final.

What matters is the way of meeting:
clear,
compassionate,
unclinging.

That way carries into the next fascicles.
