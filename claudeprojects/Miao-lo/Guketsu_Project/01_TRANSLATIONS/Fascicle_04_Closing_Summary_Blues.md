## What We Covered

Fascicle 4 is the bridge between **foundation** (Fascicle 3) and **mastery** (Fascicles 5-10). Detailed treatment of conditional objects + introduction to **integration** (making practice spontaneous).

---

## The Sections

### Opening
-   Foundation → depth transition
-   Three challenges: conditional objects, subtle attachments, integration
-   **Bottom line**: Advanced practice needs flexibility and spontaneity

### Section 1: Afflictions
-   6 root afflictions (greed, anger, delusion, pride, doubt, wrong views)
-   20 secondary afflictions
-   Ten Modes applied to afflictions
-   **Bottom line**: Afflictions are Buddha-nature, not enemies

### Section 2: Illness, Karma, Māra
-   4 types of illness (element, karmic, demonic, practice-induced)
-   Karmic impressions (don't engage)
-   4 types of Māra (affliction, aggregate, death, heavenly)
-   **Bottom line**: External obstacles are teachers

### Section 3: Meditative States and Integration
-   4 dhyānas + 4 formless absorptions
-   Dhyāna vs. prajñā
-   3 stages of integration (deliberate, natural, complete)
-   **Bottom line**: Attainments can be traps; make practice spontaneous

---

## The Core Teaching

**All objects are Buddha-nature**

Afflictions, illness, karma, Māra, meditative states—all are **manifestations of Buddha-nature**. Don't eliminate or transcend. **Recognize their true nature.**

---

## Key Points

### On Afflictions
> "Afflictions and Bodhi aren't two. See afflictions clearly, you see Buddha-nature. Not suppression. Not transformation. Recognition."

### On Obstacles
> "Illness, karma, Māra are often feared. But in Perfect Teaching, they're teachers. They reveal attachment most clearly. When attachment is seen, it dissolves."

### On Attainments
> "Dhyāna is honey on a razor. Sweet, but dangerous if you linger. It's a milestone, not the destination."

### On Integration
> "When Zhi and Guan are fully integrated, there's no 'calming' and 'contemplating.' Only the mind resting in its true nature, both still and clear."

## Conditional Objects Covered

| Object | Key Teaching | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| **Afflictions** | Are Buddha-nature | Detailed (6 root + 20 secondary) |
| **Illness** | Reveals attachment to body | 4 types with fixes |
| **Karmic Impressions** | Like dreams, no substance | Don't engage |
| **Demonic Interference** | No power over emptiness | 4 types of Māra |
| **Meditative States** | Can be traps | 4 dhyānas + 4 formless |

**Still to come** (Fascicles 5-10):
-   Wrong Views, Pride, Two Vehicles, Bodhisattva

---

## Integration Path

| Stage | How It Feels | Practice |
|---|---|---|
| **Deliberate** | Conscious effort | "I will now apply Mode 1" |
| **Natural** | Spontaneous | Modes arise without deliberation |
| **Complete** | No distinction | Every moment is contemplation |

---

## Luthier's Key Points

### On Working with Objects
> "Don't seek conditional objects. Don't avoid them. When they show up, recognize them. When they're gone, don't miss them."

### On Advanced Practice
> "Difference between beginning and advanced isn't the method—it's the depth. Beginner applies modes deliberately. Advanced practitioner embodies them naturally."

### On Mastery
> "Master has forgotten both practice and non-practice. Every moment is contemplation. Every action is the path."

---

## What's Next (Fascicles 5-10)

-   **5-6**: Remaining objects (Wrong Views, Pride, Two Vehicles, Bodhisattva)
-   **7-8**: Fruit and results
-   **9**: How teaching arises from realization
-   **10**: Ultimate return

---

## For the Practitioner

1.  Recognize which object showed up
2.  Apply Ten Modes flexibly (not mechanically)
3.  Work with the object as Buddha-nature
4.  Move toward spontaneous integration
5.  Release attachment to all attainments

**The goal**: Not to perfect technique but to **embody the teaching** so completely that technique becomes nature.
