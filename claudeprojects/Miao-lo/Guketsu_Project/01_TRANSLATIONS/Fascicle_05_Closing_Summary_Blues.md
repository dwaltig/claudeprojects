## Closing Word

Fascicle 5 completes the ten-object map
by treating the final subtle four.

Completion here means:
clearer recognition,
deeper release,
not triumphal endpoint.

---

## What Was Consolidated

Wrong views:
clinging to understanding.

Pride:
clinging to attainment image.

Two vehicles:
clinging to private cessation.

Bodhisattva object:
clinging to noble identity and path-form.

All four expose
self-reference in refined disguise.

---

## Pattern of Progress

From gross obstacles
into subtle obstacles,
from obvious disturbance
into masked fixation.

As subtlety increases,
self-honesty becomes central method.

---

## Release Pattern

Early stage:
release coarse affliction.

Middle stage:
release subtle conceptual/attitudinal hardening.

Advanced stage:
release even correct views and real attainments.

Completion stage:
release path-ownership itself.

---

## Practical Continuation

When objects arise:
recognize,
apply ten-mode function,
release,
continue benefiting beings.

When objects subside:
do not memorialize them.
do not miss them.

---

## Closing Moan

No object to worship.
No attainment to display.
No identity to defend.

Just stable vow,
clear seeing,
and ungrasping activity
moving into the next fascicles.
