## What We Covered

Fascicle 5 completes the **Ten Objects** by covering the final four that show up at advanced stages.

---

## The Sections

### Opening
-   Final four objects: Wrong Views, Pride, Two Vehicles, Bodhisattva
-   Why these are last (subtle obstacles for advanced practitioners)
-   **Bottom line**: Subtle obstacles disguise themselves as virtues

### Section 1: Wrong Views and Pride
-   Five wrong views at advanced levels
-   Seven types of pride
-   **Bottom line**: Highest view is no-view; highest attainment is no-attainment

### Section 2: Two Vehicles and Bodhisattva
-   Two Vehicles: Hīnayāna tendencies
-   Bodhisattva: Ten stages and attachment to path/identity
-   **Bottom line**: Even the bodhisattva path must be released

## The Progression

**Objects 1-6** (F3-4): Gross → subtle, obvious → hidden, easy → hard to recognize

**Objects 7-10** (F5): Extremely subtle, disguised as virtues, require profound self-honesty

---

## Key Points

### On Subtle Obstacles

> "Subtle obstacles are hardest to recognize because they disguise themselves as virtues. Wrong views appear as wisdom. Pride appears as confidence. Two Vehicles appear as realization. Bodhisattva attainments appear as the goal."

### On Recognition

> "Practitioner who thinks they've transcended all obstacles is precisely the one who hasn't. True realization comes with profound humility and recognition that even realization must be released."

### On Release

> "Each level requires releasing what was helpful at the previous level. Beginner releases gross afflictions. Intermediate releases subtle afflictions. Advanced releases even correct views and genuine attainments. Master releases everything, including the release itself."

---

## The Pattern

| Level | What Must Be Released |
|---|---|
| **Beginning** | Gross afflictions |
| **Intermediate** | Subtle afflictions, wrong views |
| **Advanced** | Correct views, genuine attainments |
| **Complete** | Even the path itself |

---

## Luthier's Final Points

### On Completion

> "When all ten objects have been worked with—when even the bodhisattva path is released—what remains? Not emptiness. Not existence. Not Middle Way. What remains can't be spoken. It's the inconceivable functioning of Buddha-nature, benefiting all beings without a doer."

### On Integration

> "The Ten Objects aren't ten separate things to overcome sequentially. They're ten aspects of one fundamental clinging—the clinging to self. When self is completely released, all ten objects dissolve simultaneously. This is why Perfect Teaching can bring complete realization in one lifetime."

### On Practice

> "Don't seek the objects. Don't avoid the objects. When they show up, recognize them and work with them using Ten Modes. When they dissolve, don't miss them. This is the meaning of correct contemplation."

## What's Next (Fascicles 6-10)

-   **6-7**: Further refinement and special cases
-   **8**: Fruit and results
-   **9**: How teaching arises from realization
-   **10**: Ultimate return

---

## For the Practitioner

**After completing the Ten Objects**:

1.  Recognize completion isn't the end but a new beginning
2.  Release attachment to completion itself
3.  Continue to function for all beings
4.  Embody the teaching without clinging to being a teacher
5.  Rest in the inconceivable nature of mind

**The ultimate realization**: No practitioner, no practice, no objects, no realization—yet practice continues perfectly, benefiting all beings.
