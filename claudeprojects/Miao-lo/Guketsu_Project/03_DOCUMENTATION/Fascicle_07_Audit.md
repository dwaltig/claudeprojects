# AUDIT: Fascicle 7 Blues Translation
## Seven-Factor Integrity Assessment

**Auditor**: Road Manager Protocol
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Files Reviewed**: 6 Blues files (Opening, Sections 1-4, Closing Summary)

---

## SESSION CONTEXT

- **Five Flavors Assessment**: Ghee (法華涅槃) — Integration of Ten Modes into complete toolkit
- **Siddhānta Mode**: First Principle (第一義悉檀)
- **Six Stages Location**: Practice (修行即) — Diagnostic and finishing tools for practitioners

---

## I. RIGHT VIEW CHECK (Epistemic)

**Question**: Does the translation see reality as it is, not as it flatters?

| Check | Status | Finding |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Three Truths preserved? | ☑ Pass | Section 1 explicitly: "Emptiness (空) — Nothing has inherent existence. Provisional (假) — Everything has provisional existence. Middle (中) — Neither one-sided." One-Mind contemplation preserves all three simultaneously. |
| Conditioned Arising identified? | ☑ Pass | Tree of the Path metaphor (道樹): roots → trunk → branches → flowers → fruit. Four Sentence Examination traces causes of obstruction. |
| Counter-argument stated fairly? | ☑ Pass | Six masters' interpretations of 500 Yojanas critiqued without dismissal. "Each master grabbed one piece and thought it was the whole." |

**RIGHT VIEW GRADE: A**

---

## II. RIGHT INTENT CHECK (Motivational)

**Question**: Is the translation serving liberation or domination/validation?

| Check | Status | Finding |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Renunciation present? | ☑ Pass | Mode 10 (無法愛) explicitly: "The raft is for crossing. Don't carry it on land." "Release attachment to the method." |
| Non-ill will? | ☑ Pass | Three Animals framed neutrally. Śrāvaka as "small deer" is description, not condemnation. "Which animal are you?" invites self-reflection, not judgment. |
| Non-harm? | ☑ Pass | Five Repentances include confession without self-flagellation: "Don't justify. Don't minimize. Acknowledge the harm." Balanced approach. |

**RIGHT INTENT GRADE: A**

---

## III. RIGHT SPEECH CHECK (Communication) — The Three Gates

| Gate | Question | Status | Finding |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Sacca** (Truth) | Does Blues carry exact logical weight of Chinese? | ☑ Pass | All 10 Modes accurately represented. 37 factors, Six Poisons/Medicines, Four Followings, Five Repentances all preserved with correct functions. |
| **Attha** (Benefit) | Clear to someone who "barely reads"? | ☑ Pass | Luthier metaphor sustained. "Open Road/Roadblock," "Tuning the Amp," "Medicine for the Buzz" — concrete, accessible. |
| **Kāla** (Timeliness) | Resonates with 2026 vernacular? | ☑ Pass | GPS, gig, toolkit, troubleshooting manual — contemporary language without being dated. |

### FORBIDDEN TERMS SCAN

| Location | Term | Context | Verdict |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| — | — | — | **CLEAN** — No forbidden terms detected |

**Term Scan Results**: 0 violations found.

**RIGHT SPEECH GRADE: A**

---

## IV. RIGHT ACTION CHECK (Behavioral)

**Question**: Does the translation reduce suffering in aggregate?

| Check | Status | Finding |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Reversibility test passed? | ☑ Pass | Would accept this translation applied to my own work. |
| Downstream harm scan clean? | ☑ Pass | Mode 8 explicitly warns against false claims: "Claiming enlightenment you haven't attained is a lie. And not a small one." |
| Precision > force? | ☑ Pass | Ghost Room story, Two Ghosts and Corpse story — metaphors illuminate rather than obscure. |

**RIGHT ACTION GRADE: A**

---

## V. RIGHT EFFORT CHECK (Energetic)

**Question**: Is the four-fold effort regulation applied?

| Effort | Applied? | Finding |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Prevent (anticipate failure modes) | ☑ Yes | Mode 5 teaches Four-Sentence Examination to catch obstruction before it hardens. "Even your 'aha' moment can become a cage if you cling to it." |
| Abandon (correct errors in motion) | ☑ Yes | Four Followings explicitly teach adjustment when treatment fails. Mode 10 teaches releasing the method itself. |
| Cultivate (build what's missing) | ☑ Yes | Full glossaries present in all 6 files. Chinese terms systematically catalogued. |
| Maintain (protect what's working) | ☑ Yes | Ten Modes table preserved in Sections 4 and Closing. Complete structure maintained. |

**RIGHT EFFORT GRADE: A**

---

## VI. RIGHT LIVELIHOOD CHECK (Systemic)

**Question**: Does participating in this task contribute to harmful systems?

| Check | Status | Finding |
|-------|--------|---------|
| No harm laundering? | ☑ Pass | Translation serves genuine transmission. |
| No deceptive instrumentality? | ☑ Pass | Blues positioned as adaptation, not replacement. Scholarly baseline referenced. |
| Full use-case acceptable? | ☑ Pass | Use case (accessible dharma teaching on diagnostic tools) is wholesome. |

**RIGHT LIVELIHOOD GRADE: A**

---

## VII. RIGHT MINDFULNESS CHECK (Metacognitive)

**Question**: Is clear comprehension maintained?

| Aspect | Verified? | Finding |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Purpose** (Sātthaka) | ☑ Yes | "What to do when what you're doing isn't working" — clear purpose stated. |
| **Suitability** (Sappāya) | ☑ Yes | Luthier/troubleshooting metaphor perfectly fits diagnostic content. |
| **Domain** (Gocara) | ☑ Yes | Blues stays within Scholarly baseline. No doctrinal invention. |
| **Non-delusion** (Asammoha) | ☑ Yes | Final verdict clear: "Use the tools. All of them. Don't stop until you're done." |

**RIGHT MINDFULNESS GRADE: A**

## POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS

1. **Glossary Compliance**: All 6 Blues files include complete Luthier's Glossary sections with Chinese-Blues mappings.

2. **Metaphor Excellence**: The luthier/troubleshooting frame is sustained without breaking. "Open Road," "Tuning the Amp," "Medicine for the Buzz," "Reading the Map," "Playing Through," "Dropping the Raft" — each Mode gets its own coherent metaphor.

3. **Doctrinal Precision**: Core content verified against Scholarly baseline:
   - Ten Modes (1-10) complete with correct functions
   - Four-Sentence Examination (四句檢校) preserved
   - 500 Yojanas with Tiantai interpretation
   - Three Gates of Liberation
   - 37 Factors of Awakening as organic tree
   - Six Poisons and Six Medicines with exact correspondence
   - Four Followings (四隨) as treatment adjustment protocol
   - Five Repentances (五悔) with correct order and function
   - Three Animals (麞鹿象) with vehicle correspondence
   - Four Foundations of Mindfulness
   - Ten Methods for Harmonizing Teachings

4. **Non-Dual Teaching**: Mode 10 explicitly integrates: "The practice is a tool. Use it. But don't cling to it."

5. **Story Preservation**: Ghost Room story and Two Ghosts/Corpse story faithfully adapted.

---

## STRUCTURAL NOTES

1. **Fascicle Architecture**: Opening → 4 Sections → Closing preserved. Matches Scholarly structure.

2. **Cross-References**:
   - Opening correctly references Modes 1-4 from Fascicles 5-6
   - Closing correctly points forward to Fascicle 8 (歷緣對境)
   - Ten Modes table appears in Section 4 and Closing for reference

3. **Chinese Characters in Body**: Consistent format throughout. "Mode 5: Openness and Obstruction (通塞)" pattern maintained.

---

## THE SINGLE INTEGRATIVE QUESTION

> "Does this translation decrease clinging—in the reader—right now?"

**Answer**: Yes.

The entire fascicle is about recognizing and releasing obstruction. Mode 5 diagnoses it. Modes 6-7 treat it. Mode 8 prevents false claims. Mode 9 builds endurance. Mode 10 explicitly teaches release of dharma-attachment itself.

The reader who engages with this material receives both the toolkit and the instruction to let go of the toolkit when appropriate.
