# AUDIT: Fascicle 9 Blues Translation
## Seven-Factor Integrity Assessment

**Auditor**: Road Manager Protocol
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Files Reviewed**: 5 Blues files (Opening, Sections 1-3, Closing Summary)

---

## SESSION CONTEXT

- **Five Flavors Assessment**: Ghee (法華涅槃) — Integration of all meditative states into One Vehicle
- **Siddhānta Mode**: First Principle (第一義悉檀)
- **Six Stages Location**: Practice (修行即) — Deepening cultivation through specific states

---

## I. RIGHT VIEW CHECK (Epistemic)

**Question**: Does the translation see reality as it is, not as it flatters?

| Check | Status | Finding |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Three Truths preserved? | ☑ Pass | Section 3 explicitly: "Empty... Provisional... Middle" applied to Joy state. "See the 3000 Worlds in that one buzz of Joy." |
| Conditioned Arising identified? | ☑ Pass | Causes of dhyāna arising traced. "Channeling the Greats" section addresses Buddha-Recollection as recognizing Buddha-nature in one's own mind. |
| Counter-argument stated fairly? | ☑ Pass | Warning against attachment to states consistently preserved: "honey on a razor," "Dhyāna-Junkie," "the gear doesn't play itself." |

**RIGHT VIEW GRADE: A**

---

## II. RIGHT INTENT CHECK (Motivational)

**Question**: Is the translation serving liberation or domination/validation?

| Check | Status | Finding |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Renunciation present? | ☑ Pass | Tool 10 "Dropping the Raft" explicitly teaches non-attachment to dhyāna states. |
| Non-ill will? | ☑ Pass | No condescension. "Arhat" framed neutrally ("out of the band" = emphasis on compassion, not contempt for Arhats). |
| Non-harm? | ☑ Pass | Superknowledges section: "Don't use the smoke machine to hide bad playing." Guards against spiritual bypassing. |

**RIGHT INTENT GRADE: A**

---

## III. RIGHT SPEECH CHECK (Communication) — The Three Gates

| Gate | Question | Status | Finding |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Sacca** (Truth) | Does Blues carry exact logical weight of Chinese? | ☐ Pass with Notes | Core teachings preserved. Four Dhyānas, Eight Touches, Sixteen Excellences all present. See TERM VIOLATIONS below. |
| **Attha** (Benefit) | Clear to someone who "barely reads"? | ☑ Pass | Gear/amp metaphor is accessible. "Clean channel," "gain channel," "reverb" — concrete images. |
| **Kāla** (Timeliness) | Resonates with 2026 vernacular? | ☑ Pass | Guitar/amp terminology is contemporary. No dated language. |

### FORBIDDEN TERMS FOUND

| Location | Term | Context | Verdict |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| Opening:18 | "Meditation" | "Dhyāna (Zen/Meditation)" | **MINOR** — Used as definition/gloss, not as primary term. Acceptable. |
| Section 1:61 | "breathing meditation" | "This is breathing meditation, but with a lens" | **VIOLATION** — Should be "breath practice" or "breath work" |

**Term Scan Results**: 1 violation found.

**RIGHT SPEECH GRADE: B+**

---

## IV. RIGHT ACTION CHECK (Behavioral)

**Question**: Does the translation reduce suffering in aggregate?

| Check | Status | Finding |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Reversibility test passed? | ☑ Pass | Would accept this translation applied to my own work. |
| Downstream harm scan clean? | ☑ Pass | Consistent warnings against attachment. "If you stop here, you're an Arhat. You're out of the band." |
| Precision > force? | ☑ Pass | Metaphors serve teaching without sacrificing accuracy. |

**RIGHT ACTION GRADE: A**

---

## V. RIGHT EFFORT CHECK (Energetic)

**Question**: Is the four-fold effort regulation applied?

| Effort | Applied? | Finding |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Prevent (anticipate failure modes) | ☑ Yes | "The Trap" subsections in each dhyāna level. Opening warns: "honey on a razor." |
| Abandon (correct errors in motion) | ☑ Yes | Section 2 explicitly states Arhat limitation. Section 3 requires "Dropping the Raft." |
| Cultivate (build what's missing) | ☐ Partial | Glossary sections MISSING in all Blues files. Chinese terms used but not systematically catalogued. |
| Maintain (protect what's working) | ☑ Yes | Four-category classification (Worldly, Transitional, Transcendental, Great Vehicle) preserved. |

**RIGHT EFFORT GRADE: B**

---

## VI. RIGHT LIVELIHOOD CHECK (Systemic)

**Question**: Does participating in this task contribute to harmful systems?

| Check | Status | Finding |
|-------|--------|---------|
| No harm laundering? | ☑ Pass | Translation serves genuine transmission. |
| No deceptive instrumentality? | ☑ Pass | Blues positioned as adaptation, not replacement. |
| Full use-case acceptable? | ☑ Pass | Use case (accessible dharma) is wholesome. |

**RIGHT LIVELIHOOD GRADE: A**

---

## VII. RIGHT MINDFULNESS CHECK (Metacognitive)

**Question**: Is clear comprehension maintained?

| Aspect | Verified? | Finding |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Purpose** (Sātthaka) | ☑ Yes | "The gear doesn't play itself" — clear statement of purpose. |
| **Suitability** (Sappāya) | ☑ Yes | Guitar/amp metaphor appropriate for dhyāna content (states as "settings"). |
| **Domain** (Gocara) | ☑ Yes | Blues stays within Scholarly baseline. No doctrinal invention. |
| **Non-delusion** (Asammoha) | ☑ Yes | Final verdict clear: "The music is You. (The Buddha-Nature)." |

**RIGHT MINDFULNESS GRADE: A**

---

## SYSTEMIC INTERLOCK CHECK

**Critical Interdependencies**:
- ☑ Right View + Right Intent aligned (no Cold Technocracy)
- ☑ Right Intent + Right View aligned (no Sentimental Delusion)
- ☐ Right Effort + Right Mindfulness aligned — **PARTIAL**: Missing glossaries indicate incomplete Effort
- ☑ Right Speech + Right Intent aligned (no Weaponized Truth)

## CRUEL TRUTH CORRECTIONS

### Correction 1: Forbidden Term Violation

**Location**: Section 1, Line 61

**Current Text**:
> "This is breathing meditation, but with a lens."

**Corrected Text**:
> "This is breath practice, but with a lens."

OR

> "This is breath work, but with a lens."

---

### Correction 2: Missing Glossaries

**All Blues files lack the standard "Luthier's Glossary" section.**

Fascicle 8 Blues files include glossaries with Chinese terms + Blues equivalents. Fascicle 9 Blues files do not.

**Required Action**: Add glossary sections to each Fascicle 9 Blues file.

**Example Format** (for Opening):

```markdown
---

## The Luthier's Glossary (Opening)

- **禪定境** (Dhyāna Object) → **The Gear** — meditative states as objects
- **根本禪** (Root Dhyāna) → **Stock Pickups** — worldly foundational states
- **十六特勝** (Sixteen Excellences) → **Pro Mods** — wisdom-enhanced breath work
- **背捨** (Back-Shedding) → **EQ Cuts** — turning away from attachment
- **師子奮迅** (Lion Sprint) → **Fast Switching** — rapid traversal of states
- **超越三昧** (Transcendence Samādhi) → **Jumping the Fretboard** — non-sequential mastery
- **味禪** (Flavor Zen) → **Getting High on Tone** — attachment to bliss

### The Setup

- **Four categories** → Worldly, Transitional, Transcendental, Great Vehicle
- **The trap** → Attachment to states
- **The fix** → Apply Ten Modes to states
- **The goal** → "The music is You"
```

---

## STRUCTURAL NOTES

1. **Fascicle Architecture**: Opening → 3 Sections → Closing preserved. Matches Scholarly structure.

2. **Wen-Da Format**: Not applicable to this fascicle (encyclopedic content).

3. **Cross-References**:
   - Opening correctly references Objects 2-4 (Afflictions, Illness, Karma) from Fascicle 8
   - Closing correctly points forward to Fascicle 10
   - Missing cross-reference to Fascicle 2 (25 Preparations) that Scholarly version includes

4. **Chinese Characters in Body**: Present but inconsistent. "Eight Touches (八觸)" format used in Section 1, but many terms lack Chinese.

---

## POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS

1. **Metaphor Consistency**: The gear/amp/pedalboard frame is sustained throughout all five files without breaking.

2. **Warning Preservation**: Every "trap" identified in Scholarly is preserved in Blues: "honey on a razor," "Dhyāna-Junkie," "statue," "sitting."

3. **Doctrinal Accuracy**: Core content verified against Scholarly baseline:
   - Four Dhyānas with correct characteristics
   - Eight Touches enumerated
   - Sixteen Excellences mentioned with correct function
   - Eight Back-Sheddings (Vimokṣa) preserved
   - Lion Sprint and Transcendence Samādhi explained
   - Buddha-Recollection as recognizing Buddha-nature

4. **Non-Dual Teaching**: Section 3 correctly integrates: "The Buddha isn't 'out there.' The Buddha is the nature of your own mind."

---

## THE SINGLE INTEGRATIVE QUESTION

> "Does this translation decrease clinging—in the reader—right now?"

**Answer**: Yes, with reservation.

The translation effectively warns against attachment to meditative states. The gear metaphor works: "Don't get high on your own supply."

However, the missing glossaries reduce the teaching's completeness. A reader cannot trace terms back to source without Chinese-Blues mappings.

---

## WORKFLOW COMPLIANCE

| Step | Status |
|------|--------|
| 1. Professor (Scholarly) | ☑ Complete — 5 files |
| 2. Bluesman (Blues) | ☑ Complete — 5 files |
| 3. Road Manager (Audit) | ☑ Complete — this file |

**Workflow executed correctly.** Scholarly preceded Blues.

---

## REQUIRED REMEDIATION

Before Fascicle 9 can be cleared for integration:

1. ☑ Fix "breathing meditation" → "breath practice" (Section 1, Line 61) — **COMPLETE**
2. ☑ Add Luthier's Glossary to all 5 Blues files — **COMPLETE**
3. ☐ Add cross-reference to Fascicle 2 (25 Preparations) in Opening — *Minor; does not block*

**Current Status**: **PASS**

**Final Grade**: **A-**
