## I. THE CORE PHYSICS (Ontology)

### **Insentient Buddha Nature (無情有性)**
*   **Scholarly Definition:** The doctrine that non-sentient objects (plants, land, stones) inherently possess the full nature of Buddhahood—not as potential, but as inherent inclusion (性具).
*   **The Blues Translation:** **"The Wood Sings."**
*   **The Breakdown:**
    *   People think the music comes from the fingers. That's "Idealism" (Huayan).
    *   Miao-lo says: "No. The wood doesn't *become* the song—the wood *is* the song the moment you recognize what music is."
    *   The wood ain't got *potential* to sing. The wood is *already singing*. You just ain't listening yet.
    *   **The Lesson:** Don't look down on the dirt. The dirt is holding you up. The paper *is* the Buddha because it's already doing the Buddha's work—right now, as it is.
*   **[See GLOSSARY.md: 無情有性]**

### **Entity (體 - Tai)**
*   **Scholarly Definition:** The substance or reality of a thing. In Tiantai, this is not a static essence but a dynamic functioning.
*   **The Blues Translation:** **"The Swing" (Verb, Not Noun).**
*   **The Breakdown:**
    *   A "Noun" is a statue. A statue can't save you.
    *   A "Verb" is an action. The "Entity" of the Buddha is the *act* of Opening, Showing, Awakening, and Entering.
    *   **The Lesson:** It ain't a "Thing" you put in your pocket. It's a "Groove" you step into.
*   **[See GLOSSARY.md: 體]**

### **The Three Truths (三諦)**
*   **Scholarly Definition:** Empty (Kū), Provisional (Ke), and Middle (Chū). They are simultaneous and non-dual—not three separate things that combine, but three ways of describing *what was always one*.
*   **The Blues Translation:** **"The Chord."**
    *   **Empty:** The recognition that the note ain't solid—it arises, fades, has no fixed self (Root Note).
    *   **Provisional:** The vibration happening anyway—with all its texture, color, tone (Third).
    *   **Middle:** The sound that fills the room—neither the "no-note" nor the "just-vibration," but the whole thing at once (Fifth).
    *   **The Lesson:** You can *describe* the note as empty or as vibrating, but the music was *always the whole thing*. The three truths ain't three things hitting together—they're three angles on what never was separate.
*   **[See GLOSSARY.md: 三諦]**

## II. THE ENGINEERING (Practice)

### **Ichinen Sanzen (一念三千)**
*   **Scholarly Definition:** Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life.
*   **The Blues Translation:** **"The Hologram" / "The Whole Shop in a Screw."**
*   **The Breakdown:**
    *   You pick up a single screw (one thought). If you look close enough, you see the reflection of the whole workshop (3000 realms) in the chrome.
    *   Hell is in there. Heaven is in there. The Buddha is in there.
    *   **The Lesson:** Fix this one thought, and you fix the whole machine.
*   **[See GLOSSARY.md: 一念三千]**

### **The Ten Onenesses (十不二门)**
*   **Scholarly Definition:** Miao-lo's advanced thesis on how dualities (Body/Mind, Inner/Outer, etc.) are non-dual. These ten gates *collapse* apparent dualities—they don't just connect them.
*   **The Blues Translation:** **"The Wiring Diagram."**
    *   *Body/Mind Oneness:* The Amp and the Electricity.
    *   *Internal/External Oneness:* The Input Jack and the Speaker.
    *   **The Lesson:** Stop trying to cut the wire to see where the electricity is. It flows *through*. The duality was never real—the separation was how you *talked* about the circuit, not how it *runs*.
*   **[See scholarly literature on 十不二门—not in current GLOSSARY.md]**

### **Kyō (Sutra / 經)**
*   **Scholarly Definition:** The thread that holds the teachings together; the words of the Buddha.
*   **The Blues Translation:** **"The Sheet Music."**
    *   It looks like black dots on paper (Insentient).
    *   But if you *read* it (Verb), it becomes the Song (Buddha).
*   **[See GLOSSARY.md: 經]**

### **Gohonzon (The Mandala)**
*   **Scholarly Definition:** The Mandala depicting the Ceremony in the Air. *Note: This is Nichiren's application of Tiantai doctrine, not Miao-lo's original term.*
*   **The Blues Translation:** **"The Master Tape."**
    *   It's the original recording of what awakening sounds like. You tune your own instrument (Life) to match it.
    *   The Master Tape ain't magic—it's a reference tone. You still gotta play.

## III. THE CREW (Lineage)

### **Zhiyi (Tiantai)**
*   **Role:** **"The Composer."** He wrote the symphony.

### **Miao-lo (Zhanran)**
*   **Role:** **"The Head Engineer."** He built the concert hall and explained why the acoustics work. He defended the Composer when the critics (Huayan) said the music was "too simple."

### **Nichiren**
*   **Role:** **"The Lead Player."** He took the Composer's score and the Engineer's rig, walked out on stage, and played it loud enough to shake the foundations.

---

**The Luthier's Note:**
"This project ain't about poetry. It's about *mechanics*. Miao-lo is telling you that if you think Buddha-nature is only in your heart and not in your shoes, you're walking barefoot on broken glass. Everything sings. Everything."

---

## IV. POLEMICAL CONTEXT (Who Miao-lo Is Arguing Against)

### **Anti-Huayan (Mind-Only Critique)**
*   **Their Position:** "The mind creates everything. Matter is just a reflection of consciousness."
*   **Miao-lo's Rebuttal:** "If only the mind matters, why does the guitar body affect the tone? The wood sings too. You can't play idealism—it don't resonate."

### **Anti-Chan (Practice-Skipping Critique)**
*   **Their Position:** "Sudden awakening. No need for gradual practice. Just see your nature directly."
*   **Miao-lo's Rebuttal:** "And the guys who say they can skip the practice and just 'be awakened'? That's called selling a guitar without strings. You ain't playing nothing."
*   **The Lesson:** There's no shortcut that bypasses the work. The Six Identities exist because the map matters. Don't confuse the first stage for the last.

### **Zhiguan (止觀)**
*   **Scholarly:** Calming and Contemplation—the integrated practice.

## VI. FASCICLE 7 TERMS (Modes 5-10)

*These terms are fully developed in the Fascicle 7 Blues translation.*

### **Openness and Obstruction (通塞)**
*   **Scholarly:** The fifth of the Ten Modes. Diagnosing whether the path is clear or blocked.
*   **The Blues Translation:** **"Open Road / Roadblock"**
*   **The Breakdown:**
    *   通 (tōng) = Open. The path is clear. You're moving.
    *   塞 (sè) = Blocked. Something's in the way.
    *   Even the right method can become an obstacle if you cling to it.
*   **The Four-Sentence Examination (四句檢校):**
    1. Obstruction within openness? (Think you're clear, but you're stuck)
    2. Openness within obstruction? (Looks blocked, but it's actually breaking through)
    3. Obstruction is just obstruction? (A wall is a wall—dismantle it)
    4. Openness is just openness? (The path is clear—don't second-guess)
*   **[See Fascicle_07_Section_01_Blues.md]**

### **Path Factor Adjustment (道品調適)**
*   **Scholarly:** The sixth of the Ten Modes. Adjusting which of the 37 factors of awakening to use.
*   **The Blues Translation:** **"Tuning the Amp"**
*   **The Breakdown:** You don't use the same settings on every amp. Different rooms, different bands, different songs. The 37 factors are your toolkit—use what fits.
*   **[See Fascicle_07_Section_02_Blues.md]**

### **Counteractive Aids (對治助開)**
*   **Scholarly:** The seventh of the Ten Modes. Targeted treatment for specific obstacles.

*   **Scholarly:** The eighth of the Ten Modes. Understanding where you are on the path.
*   **The Blues Translation:** **"Reading the Map"**
*   **The Breakdown:**
    *   Don't claim attainment you don't have (overestimation = grave offense)
    *   Don't dismiss real progress (underestimation = abandoning the path)
    *   Read the map. Know where you are.
*   **[See Fascicle_07_Section_03_Blues.md and Fascicle_07_Section_04_Blues.md]**

*   **[See Fascicle_07_Section_04_Blues.md]**

### **Freedom from Dharma-Attachment (無法愛)**
*   **Scholarly:** The tenth of the Ten Modes. Releasing attachment to the practice itself.
*   **The Blues Translation:** **"Dropping the Raft"**
*   **The Breakdown:**
    *   The practice is a raft. It gets you across.
    *   Once you're across, don't carry the raft on your back.
    *   Even love of the Dharma is a form of attachment. It must be released.
*   **[See Fascicle_07_Section_04_Blues.md]**

### **The Five Repentances (五悔)**
*   **Scholarly:** Five practices for clearing the ground before serious practice.
*   **The Blues Translation:** **"The Entry Gate"**

    *   **鹿** (Larger Deer) → **Pratyekabuddha** — Escapes with backward glance, some sadness for others
    *   **大象** (Elephant) → **Bodhisattva** — Leads everyone out, carries the weak
*   **The Lesson:** Which animal are you? Be the elephant—but don't pretend to be an elephant if you're still a deer.
*   **[See Fascicle_07_Section_03_Blues.md]**

### **The Four Followings (四隨)**
*   **Scholarly:** Four ways to adjust treatment when the direct medicine doesn't work.
*   **The Blues Translation:**
    1. **隨對治** → **"Direct Treatment"** — Try the obvious medicine first
    2. **隨轉** → **"Turn"** — If that fails, try another medicine
    3. **隨兼** → **"Combination"** — Use two or three together
    4. **隨第一義** → **"Ultimate"** — Go straight to observing the mind itself
