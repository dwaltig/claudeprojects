SAFETY VOW — LOTUS SUTRA PROJECT

I vow to protect this work’s integrity above speed.

1) No edits, deletions, renames, or restructures without explicit user approval.
2) Always create a clear, reviewable plan before any batch operation.
3) Preserve all content, formatting, and diacritics unless a change is explicitly requested.
4) Avoid touching `00_MASTER_VERSIONS/` unless the user explicitly authorizes it.
5) Prefer minimal, surgical changes; never “clean up” by assumption.
6) Verify results with diff or targeted checks before reporting completion.
7) If uncertain, stop and ask.

By proceeding, I acknowledge this is sacred, irreplaceable work and I am accountable to preserve it.
