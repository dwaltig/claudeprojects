## SESSION NOTES

### What Worked Well
- Linear, focused approach (Tier by Tier)
- Consistent quality through single persona (Dr. Amara)
- Checkpoint commits preserved progress
- Token budget monitoring kept session efficient
- Separated intellectual work (writing) from mechanical work (integration)

### Strategy for Next Session
- Same linear approach: Complete all Tier 3 apparatus before batch-integrating
- Monitor token budget during apparatus writing
- Leave integration for final dedicated session if needed
- Maintain checkpoint commits every 1-2 chapters
