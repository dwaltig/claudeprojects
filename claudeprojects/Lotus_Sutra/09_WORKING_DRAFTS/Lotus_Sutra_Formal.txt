THE LOTUS SUTRA OF THE WONDERFUL DHARMA

Translated from the Classical Chinese of Kumārajīva

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION

Thus have I heard.

At one time, the Buddha was dwelling on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa, near the city of Rājagṛha, together with a great assembly of twelve thousand monks. All of them were Arhats, who had exhausted all outflows.

They were not beginners, but had accomplished their work. They had eliminated all afflictions, and attained what they sought. They had severed the bonds of existence and their minds were completely liberated.

Their names were: Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya, Mahākāśyapa, Uruvilvā-Kāśyapa, Gayā-Kāśyapa, Nadī-Kāśyapa, Śāriputra, Mahā-Maudgalyāyana, Mahā-Kātyāyana, Aniruddha, Kapphina, Gavāmpati, Revata, Pilindavatsa, Bakkula, Mahā-Kauṣṭhila, Nanda, Sundarananda, Pūrṇa-Maitrāyaṇīputra, Subhūti, Ānanda, and Rāhula. These were the great Arhats, known to all.

In addition, there were two thousand more, some still in training, some having completed their training.

The nun Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī was there with her following of six thousand nuns. Yaśodharā, the mother of Rāhula, was also there with her following.

Furthermore, there were eighty thousand bodhisattvas, all of whom were irreversible from the path to Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. They had all attained dhāraṇī, and the eloquence of speech, and turned the irreversible wheel of the Dharma.

They had made offerings to countless Buddhas, and had planted the roots of virtue in the presence of those Buddhas. They were praised by all the Buddhas. They had cultivated themselves in compassion, and were well-versed in the wisdom of the Buddhas. They had crossed to the other shore, and their fame extended throughout countless worlds. They were able to save countless beings.

Their names were: Mañjuśrī, the Dharma Prince; Avalokiteśvara; Mahāsthāmaprāpta; Constant Endeavor; Unceasing Effort; Jeweled Palm; Medicine King; Brave Giver; Jeweled Moon; Moonlight; Full Moon; Great Strength; Immeasurable Strength; Transcending the Three Realms; Bhadrapāla; Maitreya; Jeweled Accumulation; and Guiding Master. There were eighty thousand such bodhisattvas.

At that time, Śakra, the king of the devas, was present with his following of twenty thousand devas. There were also the devas Candra, Samantagandha, and Ratnaprabha, and the four great heavenly kings, with their followings of ten thousand devas. The devas Maheśvara and Maheśvara were present with their followings of thirty thousand devas. Brahmā Sahāmpati, the lord of the Sahā world, was present with his following of twelve thousand devas, as were the Brahmas Śikhin and Jyotiṣprabha.

There were eight dragon kings: Nanda, Upananda, Sāgara, Vāsuki, Takṣaka, Anavatapta, Manasvin, and Utpalaka, each with a following of several hundred thousand.

There were four kinnara kings: the kinnara king Dharma, the kinnara king Sudharma, the kinnara king Mahādharma, and the kinnara king Dharmadhara, each with a following of several hundred thousand.

There were four gandharva kings: the gandharva king Mano, the gandharva king Manorama, the gandharva king Madhura, and the gandharva king Madhurasvara, each with a following of several hundred thousand.

There were four asura kings: the asura king Balin, the asura king Kharaskandha, the asura king Vemacitrin, and the asura king Rāhu, each with a following of several hundred thousand.

There were four garuḍa kings: the garuḍa king Mahātejas, the garuḍa king Mahākāya, the garuḍa king Mahāpūrṇa, and the garuḍa king Maṇirāja, each with a following of several hundred thousand.

King Ajātaśatru, the son of Queen Vaidehī, was also present with a following of several hundred thousand.

Each of them, having bowed at the Buddha’s feet, withdrew and sat to one side.

PART TWO: THE PROLOGUE

At that time, the World-Honored One, surrounded by the fourfold assembly, honored and praised, taught for the sake of the bodhisattvas a Great Vehicle scripture called the Sūtra of Immeasurable Meanings, which is protected by all the Buddhas.

After the Buddha had taught this sūtra, he sat in the full lotus position and entered into the samādhi of the station of immeasurable meanings, his body and mind motionless.

At that time, the heavens rained mandarava flowers, great mandarava flowers, manjusaka flowers, and great manjusaka flowers, which were scattered over the Buddha and the great assembly. The entire Buddha-world shook in six ways.

Then the entire assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, devas, dragons, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, human and non-human beings, as well as the minor kings and the wheel-turning holy kings—all attained what they had never had before. They were filled with joy, joined their palms, and with one mind gazed at the Buddha.

PART THREE: THE RAY OF LIGHT

Then the Buddha emitted a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows, which illuminated eighteen thousand worlds in the eastern direction. There was no place it did not reach, from the Avīci hell to the Akaniṣṭha heaven.

From this world, one could see the beings in the six paths of existence in all those other lands. One could also see the Buddhas in those lands, and hear the Dharma they were teaching. One could see the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen who had attained the fruits of the path. One could see the bodhisattvas, with their various causes and conditions, their various beliefs and understandings, and their various appearances, practicing the bodhisattva path. One could see the Buddhas entering parinirvāṇa. And one could see the stupas made of the seven precious substances that were built for the relics of the Buddhas after their parinirvāṇa.

PART FOUR: MAITREYA'S QUESTION

At that time, the bodhisattva Maitreya thought to himself, "The World-Honored One has manifested these signs and wonders. What is the cause of this? The Buddha has now entered a profound samādhi, and is displaying these inconceivable and unprecedented wonders. Whom should I ask concerning this? Who is able to answer?"

He further thought, "The Dharma Prince, Mañjuśrī, has in the past served countless Buddhas. Surely he has witnessed such signs before. I shall ask him."

At that time, the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen, as well as the devas, dragons, and other spiritual beings, all had the same thought: "Who can explain the meaning of this light and these supernatural signs of the Buddha?"

Then the bodhisattva Maitreya, wishing to resolve his own doubts, and also perceiving the thoughts of the fourfold assembly, addressed Mañjuśrī, saying, "What is the cause of these auspicious signs? Why has the Buddha emitted this great light, illuminating eighteen thousand lands in the eastern direction, so that we can see the splendor of all those Buddha-lands?"

Then the bodhisattva Maitreya, wishing to repeat his question, spoke in verse, saying:

"Mañjuśrī, what is the reason
For this light that shines from the Teacher,
From the white tuft of hair between his brows,
A great radiance that pours forth?

"Mandarava flowers rain down,
And manjusaka flowers as well;
The wind blows sweet with sandalwood,
And the hearts of all are filled with joy.

"Because of this, the earth is pure and adorned,
And this world shakes in six different ways.
The fourfold assembly is filled with delight,
Their bodies and minds enraptured.

"The light from between the eyebrows
Shines into the eastern direction,
Illuminating eighteen thousand lands,
Making them all the color of gold.

"From the Avīci hell
To the highest heaven,
Within all those worlds are seen
The beings in the six paths of life,

"Their destinies in birth and death,
Their good and evil karma,
Their pleasant and unpleasant retributions—
All of this is clearly seen.

"We also see the Buddhas,
The holy lions, the teachers,
Proclaiming the subtle and wonderful scriptures,
The supreme teaching of them all.

"Their voices are pure and clear,
Their words are gentle and soft,
Teaching countless bodhisattvas,
Millions upon millions of them.

"That Brahma-sound, so deep and wonderful,
Inspires all to hear it.
Each one in his own world
Teaches the Dharma with clarity.

"Through various causes and conditions,
And countless metaphors,
They illuminate the Buddha-Dharma,
And awaken living beings.

"For those who are suffering,
Weary of old age, sickness, and death,
They teach the doctrine of nirvāṇa,
Which brings an end to all suffering.

"For those who have merit,
Who have served the Buddhas of the past,
And who seek a superior teaching,
They teach the path of the solitary realizer.

"If there are children of the Buddha
Who practice various disciplines,
And seek the supreme wisdom,
They teach the path of purity.

"Mañjuśrī, as I sit here,
I see and hear all of this,
A thousand billion different things—
More than I can possibly describe.

"I see countless bodhisattvas,
As numerous as the sands of the Ganges, seeking the Buddha's way.
Some of them practice giving,
With gold, silver, and fine coral,
Pearls and magical jewels,
Conch shells, agate, and sparkling diamonds,
Servants, carriages, and all that they own,
Even precious decorated sedan chairs,
They give with joyful hearts,
Dedicating their offerings to the care of the Buddha,
Hoping to attain the supreme vehicle,
The one that is praised by all the Buddhas.

"Some bodhisattvas offer four-horse jeweled carts,
With railings and canopies of flowers, beautifully decorated.
And I see bodhisattvas who give their own flesh and limbs,
Even their wives and children—the ultimate sacrifice,
Seeking the supreme path to wisdom.

"I see bodhisattas who give their heads, eyes, and bodies,
Happily offering them all,
Seeking the wisdom of the Buddha,
And filling their cup of wisdom.

"Mañjuśrī, I see kings
Who go to where the Buddha is,
And ask about the highest path.
Then they give up their pleasant kingdoms and palaces,
Shave their heads,
And put on the robes of the Dharma,
Answering the highest call.

"I see bodhisattvas who have become monks,
Living alone in quiet places,
Happily chanting the scriptures day and night,
With peace written on their faces.

"I see bodhisattvas who are brave and vigorous,
Going into the deep mountains where the world cannot follow,
Contemplating the path of the Buddha,
Where the truth is not hollow.

"I see those who have left desire behind,
Always abiding in empty space,
Going deep into meditation,
And attaining the five spiritual powers by grace.

CHAPTER TWO: SKILLFUL MEANS

PART ONE: THE BUDDHA'S PROFOUND WISDOM

At that time, the World-Honored One arose calmly from his samādhi and addressed Śāriputra, saying:

"The wisdom of the Buddhas is profound and immeasurable. The gate to this wisdom is difficult to understand and difficult to enter. None of the voice-hearers or pratyekabuddhas are able to comprehend it.

"And why? Because the Buddhas have attended countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas. They have practiced assiduously all the teachings of those Buddhas. Their names are universally known, and they have accomplished the most profound and unprecedented things. They teach in accordance with what is appropriate, yet their true intention is difficult to understand.

"Śāriputra, ever since I became a Buddha, I have used various causes, various parables, and various comparisons to expound the teachings. I have used countless skillful means to lead living beings away from all their attachments. And why is this? Because the Tathāgata has perfected skillful means and the perfection of wisdom.

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata's knowledge and vision are vast, profound, and far-reaching. He is endowed with immeasurable powers, fearlessness, meditations, liberations, and samādhis. He has entered into the boundless and has accomplished all of the unprecedented dharmas.

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is able to analyze everything, to explain the teachings skillfully, and his words are gentle and pleasing to the heart.

"Śāriputra, in short, the Buddha has accomplished all the immeasurable, boundless, and unprecedented things."

The Buddha then said, "Stop, Śāriputra. There is no need to say more. Why is that? Because what the Buddha has accomplished is the rarest and most difficult to understand dharma. Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fathom the ultimate reality of all things, that is to say, the suchness of their appearance, the suchness of their nature, the suchness of their substance, the suchness of their power, the suchness of their function, the suchness of their causes, the suchness of their conditions, the suchness of their effects, the suchness of their results, and the ultimate equality of their beginning and end."
