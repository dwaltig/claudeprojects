Formatting Structure
1. Headings and Sections

Main Chapter Title:

Formatted as a bold, uppercase heading:
## **CHAPTER 1: THE OPENING** [Chapter_01...ening.docx]


Subsections:

Each major part of the narrative is introduced with a bold heading, often in uppercase or title case, e.g.
### **THE GATHERING**
### **THE TEACHING BEFORE THE SILENCE**
### **THE LIGHT FROM BETWEEN THE EYEBROWS**
### **MAITREYA ASKS, MAÑJUŚRĪ REMEMBERS**
### **MAÑJUŚRĪ REMEMBERS THE ANCIENT PATTERN**
### **INTERPRETATION NOTES**
### **What I kept**
### **What I changed** [Chapter_01...ening.docx]



2. Line Numbering and Paragraphs

Each line or paragraph is labeled with an “L” and a number (e.g., L1, L2, L3), which helps organize the text and makes referencing specific passages easier.
Paragraphs are separated by double spaces or line breaks for clarity.

3. Text Styles

Bold: Used for headings and section titles.
Italics: Used for subtitles and some interpretive notes, e.g.,
_Blues Interpretation from Classical Chinese by Kumārajīva_ [Chapter_01...ening.docx]
Plain Text: The main narrative and verses are in regular font.

4. Lists

Bulleted Lists:

Used in the “What I kept” and “What I changed” sections to highlight key points.
Bullets are represented with a dash (-) for each item. [Chapter_01...ening.docx]



5. Verses and Rhythm

Verse Sections:

Verses are presented in short, rhythmic lines, often grouped together and separated from prose sections.
These lines mimic blues lyrics, with repetition and call-and-response elements.
Example:
Mañjuśrī, tell me why—
Why the Teacher's shining bright
From that white hair between his eyes,
Pouring out that great big light?

(Each line is a separate paragraph for clarity.) [Chapter_01...ening.docx]



6. Interpretation Notes

At the end, there’s a dedicated section for interpretation notes, explaining the stylistic choices and translation approach.
This section uses headings, italics, and bulleted lists for clarity. [Chapter_01...ening.docx]
