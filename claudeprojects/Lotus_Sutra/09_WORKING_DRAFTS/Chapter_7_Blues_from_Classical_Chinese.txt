THE WONDERFUL DHARMA LOTUS FLOWER SUTRA
CHAPTER SEVEN: THE PHANTOM CITY BLUES
(化城喻品第七)

A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese

THE STORY OF TIME SO DEEP YOU CAN'T EVEN COUNT IT


Now the Buddha, he gathered them monks around him and said:

"Listen here, brothers. I'm gonna tell you about something that happened so far back, so long ago, that your mind can't even stretch that far. We talking about time past counting, time past measuring, time past imagining—we talking about uncountable cosmic ages ago.

Back in that time, there was a Buddha. His name was Great Universal Wisdom Excellence—that's what they called him: the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed One, the Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. His country was called Good City, and that cosmic age was called Great Mark.

Now brothers, listen up. That Buddha passed on into final rest so long ago, the time's so vast you can't wrap your head around it. Let me paint you a picture:

Imagine you took all the earth in three thousand great thousand-fold worlds—every bit of dirt, every grain of sand, every rock and stone—and you ground it all down into ink, finest ink you ever saw. Then you start walking east, and after you pass a thousand worlds, you put down one tiny drop, small as a speck of dust. Then you walk another thousand worlds, and you put down another tiny drop. And you keep on doing this, walking and dropping, walking and dropping, until all that ink is gone, every last bit used up.

Now tell me—could any mathematician, any accountant, any number-cruncher or their best student—could they count up all them worlds you passed through, both the ones where you dropped ink and the ones you didn't? Could they reach the edge of that number and tell you what it is?"

"No, World-Honored One," they said. "They couldn't do it."

"Brothers," the Buddha said, "take all them worlds that man passed through—the ones with ink drops and the ones without—and grind them all down into dust. Every single speck of dust, that's one cosmic age. The time since that Buddha Great Universal Wisdom Excellence passed into final rest is even longer than that—we talking countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of uncountable ages beyond even that number.

But I'm telling you true: with the power of the Tathagata's knowing and seeing, when I look back at that distant time, it's clear as yesterday. I can see it like it's happening right now."


---


Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say it again so it sink down deep, spoke it out in verse:


I remember way back in the past,
Countless ages, time so vast,
There was a Buddha, honored and true,
Named Great Universal Wisdom Excellence, through and through.

Like someone grinding with all their might,
Three thousand great thousand worlds to dust so light,
Taking all that earth and making it ink,
More than you could count or even think.

Passing through a thousand worlds, you go,
Drop one speck of dust, let it show,
Keep on moving, dropping as you roam,
Till all that dust-ink finds a home.

All them worlds where you dropped or not,
Grind them down, every single spot,
Turn it all to dust, don't miss a grain—
Each dust speck equals one age's span, I'm saying plain.

These countless specks of dust you see,
The ages since that Buddha passed are even more than these.
That Buddha's been gone, entered into rest,
For unmeasured ages, I attest.

The Tathagata's wisdom, clear and bright,
Knows when that Buddha passed from sight,
Knows his disciples, the hearers and bodhisattvas too,
Sees them clear as today's morning dew.

You monks should know and understand,
The Buddha's wisdom is pure and grand,
Without outflows, without any wall,
It penetrates through ages, encompasses all.

THE BUDDHA WHO SAT STILL FOR TEN SMALL AGES


The Buddha told them monks:

"This Buddha called Great Universal Wisdom Excellence, he lived for five hundred forty million billion nayuta ages. Now when he first sat down at the place of enlightenment and broke through the demon armies—when he was right there on the verge of getting that supreme perfect enlightenment—the Buddha-truths still wouldn't show themselves to him. They just wouldn't appear.

He sat there like that for one small age. Then ten small ages. Sitting cross-legged, body still, mind still, not moving at all. And still them Buddha-truths wouldn't come into view."


---


THE HEAVENLY KINGS PREPARE THE THRONE


"Now the gods from the Thirty-Three Heavens, they had already prepared for this Buddha. Under that bodhi tree, they laid out a lion throne, high as a mile up in the air. The Buddha was meant to sit on that throne and attain supreme perfect enlightenment.

Soon as he sat down on that seat, all the Brahma kings rained down heavenly flowers—flowers falling like rain across a hundred miles. A fragrant wind would come and blow away the wilted flowers, and fresh new ones would rain down to take their place. This went on without stopping for ten small ages, making offerings to that Buddha—kept going like that right up till he passed away, always raining them flowers.

The Four Heavenly Kings and their gods, they struck the heavenly drums to make offerings to the Buddha. The other gods played heavenly music. For ten full small ages they kept it up, right until he passed into final rest—even then, they kept on playing."


---


THE SIXTEEN PRINCES COME TO SEE THEIR FATHER THE BUDDHA


"Brothers," the Buddha said, "after ten small ages passed, the Buddha-truths finally appeared before Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha, and he achieved that supreme perfect enlightenment.

Now before he left home, that Buddha had sixteen sons. The first one was named Wisdom Accumulation. Each of them sons had all kinds of precious toys and treasures they loved to play with. But when they heard their father had achieved that supreme perfect enlightenment, they let go of all them precious things and went to where the Buddha was. Their mothers cried tears and followed along behind them.

Their grandfather was a wheel-turning holy king. He came with a hundred great ministers and hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of other people, all surrounding them, following them to the place of enlightenment. They all wanted to get close to Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Tathagata, to make offerings, to show respect, to honor and praise him.

When they arrived, they bowed their heads to his feet, walked around him in respect, then put their palms together and gazed up at the World-Honored One. They sang their praise in verse:


Great World-Honored One of mighty virtue and power,
You worked to free all beings hour by hour,
Through countless hundreds of millions of ages long,
Finally became a Buddha, righteous and strong.

All your vows are now complete and whole,
Good fortune! Most excellent goal!
World-Honored One, so rare to see,
You sat for ten small ages patiently.

Your body, hands, and feet so still,
Quiet, peaceful, holding to your will,
Your mind calm and serene always,
Never once scattered in any ways.

Ultimately reaching final silence and peace,
Dwelling firm where outflows cease.
Now we see the World-Honored One
Safe and stable, the Buddha-work done.

We receive this good fortune today,
Celebrate with joy, come what may!
But living beings suffer constant pain,
Blind and lost without a guide to explain.

They don't know the path where suffering ends,
Don't know how to seek freedom, my friends.
Long dark night makes evil paths increase,
While heavenly beings decrease and decrease.

From darkness into darkness they go,
Never hearing the Buddha's name, don't you know.
Now the Buddha's got that highest way,
Safe and stable, where outflows hold no sway.

We along with gods and human folk
Receive the greatest benefit, ain't no joke!
That's why we bow our heads down low,
Take refuge in the Highest One we know."


---


THE SIXTEEN PRINCES REQUEST THE DHARMA WHEEL


Then them sixteen princes, after they finished singing the Buddha's praise, urged the World-Honored One to turn the Dharma wheel. They all said together:

"World-Honored One, please speak the Dharma! You'll bring safety and peace, compassion and benefit to all the gods and human beings!"

Then they spoke it again in verse:


O World Hero, ain't nobody like you,
Adorned with a hundred blessings, through and through,
You got that supreme wisdom, yes you do—
Please speak it out for all the world to view!

Free us and all the living beings too,
Show us clear, distinguish what is true,
Help us gain this wisdom like you got,
So we can follow in your footsteps, hit that spot.

If we become Buddhas one day soon,
All beings can too, under the same moon.
World-Honored One, you know what's deep inside,
What beings are thinking, what they try to hide.

You know the path that each one walks,
You know their wisdom-power when anybody talks,
Their desires, their joys, the good they cultivate,
The karma from past lives that shapes their fate.

World-Honored One, you know it all complete—
Now turn that supreme wheel, don't miss a beat!


---


WHEN THE BUDDHA ACHIEVED ENLIGHTENMENT, THE WHOLE UNIVERSE SHOOK


The Buddha told them monks:

"When Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha attained that supreme perfect enlightenment, in each of the ten directions, five hundred million billion buddha-worlds shook in six different ways. Even them dark places between the worlds—places so dark that the sun and moon with all their power can't light them up—even them places became bright and clear.

The beings living in them dark places could suddenly see each other. They said to each other, 'How come all these beings suddenly appeared here?'

And in all them worlds, the palaces of the gods, right up to the Brahma palaces, they all shook in six ways, and a great light shined everywhere, filling all the worlds, brighter than any heavenly light."


---


THE BRAHMA KINGS FROM THE EAST SEE THE LIGHT


Then in the eastern direction, in five hundred million billion countries, the palaces of the Brahma kings lit up with a brightness twice as bright as usual. Each of them Brahma kings thought to themselves:

"My palace is glowing with light like never before. What's causing this? Why is this happening?"

So them Brahma kings went to visit each other to talk it over. In that group, there was one great Brahma king named Save Everyone. He spoke to all the Brahma beings in verse:


Our palaces are glowing bright,
This light we never seen before tonight.
What's the reason for this sign?
Let's search together, yours and mine.

Could a god of great virtue just been born?
Or has a Buddha come to grace the morn?
This great light shining far and wide
Illuminates the ten directions on every side.


---


Then them five hundred million billion Brahma kings from all them countries, they came together with their palaces, carrying heavenly flowers wrapped in their robes, and traveled west to track down the source of this sign.

They saw Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Tathagata sitting there at the place of enlightenment under the bodhi tree, seated on the lion throne, with all the gods, dragon kings, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans surrounding him respectfully. And they saw them sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel.

Right then, them Brahma kings bowed down, touching their heads to the Buddha's feet, walked around him hundreds of thousands of times, then scattered heavenly flowers on the Buddha. The flowers they scattered piled up like Mount Sumeru. They also made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi tree—that tree was ten miles high. After making flower offerings, each one presented their palace to the Buddha, saying:

"Please have compassion on us and benefit us. We offer these palaces—we hope you'll accept them."

Then them Brahma kings, right there in front of the Buddha, spoke together with one voice in verse:


World-Honored One, so rare and precious,
Hard to encounter, truly precious,
Endowed with countless virtues, it's true,
Able to rescue and protect everyone through and through.

Great Teacher of gods and humans, we say,
Have compassion on this world today.
Beings in the ten directions, one and all,
Receive your abundant grace, we call.

We came from five hundred million billion lands,
Left deep meditation joy to make our stands,
Came here to make offerings to the Buddha, you see,
Left that peaceful bliss to honor thee.

Our palaces from merit we earned before,
Decorated and adorned, we couldn't ask for more.
Now we offer them to the World-Honored One—
Please accept them with compassion when all is done.


---


Then them Brahma kings, after singing the Buddha's praise, each said:

"We only hope the World-Honored One will turn the Dharma wheel, free living beings, and open up the road to nirvana!"

Then them Brahma kings spoke together with one voice in verse:


World Hero, Most Honored of Two-Legged Ones,
Please speak the Dharma before this day is done!
With your great compassion and mighty power so strong,
Free suffering beings from this world of wrong!


Then Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Tathagata—he just nodded silently, saying yes.


---


THE BRAHMA KINGS FROM THE OTHER NINE DIRECTIONS


"And brothers," the Buddha continued, "from the southeast direction, five hundred million billion countries—the great Brahma kings in all them places saw their palaces glowing with light like never before. They got happy, started jumping for joy, filled with wonder. They went to visit each other to discuss what this meant.

In that group, there was one great Brahma king named Great Compassion. He spoke to all them Brahma beings in verse:


What's the reason for this thing,
Why this sign appearing?
Our palaces glowing bright,
Light we never seen before tonight.

Could a god of great virtue just been born?
Or has a Buddha come to grace the morn?
Never seen this sign before—
Let's search with one mind, that's for sure.

We'll pass through thousands of millions of billions of lands,
Following the light with searching hands.
Most likely a Buddha has appeared in the world,
Come to free suffering beings, the truth unfurled.


---


Then them five hundred million billion Brahma kings, with their palaces, carrying heavenly flowers wrapped in their robes, traveled together to the northwest to track down this sign. They saw Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Tathagata sitting at the place of enlightenment under the bodhi tree, seated on the lion throne, surrounded respectfully by gods, dragon kings, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans. And they saw them sixteen princes requesting the Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel.

Then them Brahma kings bowed their heads to the Buddha's feet, walked around him hundreds of thousands of times, and scattered heavenly flowers on him. The flowers they scattered piled up like Mount Sumeru, and they made offerings to the Buddha's bodhi tree. After the flower offerings, each presented their palace to the Buddha, saying:

"Please have compassion and benefit us. We offer these palaces—we hope you'll accept them."

Then them Brahma kings, right there in front of the Buddha, spoke together with one voice in verse:


Holy Master, King Among the Heavenly Ones,
Your voice like the kalavinka bird's beautiful runs,
Have compassion on all beings today,
We bow down to honor you, we pray.

World-Honored One, so rare to find,
Only appears once in a long, long time.
Through a hundred eighty ages gone by,
Empty—no Buddha in the sky.

The three evil paths are overflowing and full,
While heavenly beings diminish and dull.
Now a Buddha's appeared in this world today,
Becoming the eye for beings to see the way.

The world's place of refuge, where we all run,
Rescuing and protecting everyone.
Father of all beings, compassionate one,
Full of mercy, the blessed One.

We have this good fortune from way back when,
Now we get to meet the World-Honored One again!


---


Then them Brahma kings, after singing the Buddha's praise, each said:

"We only hope the World-Honored One will have compassion on everyone and turn the Dharma wheel to free all beings."

Then them Brahma kings spoke together with one voice in verse:


Great Holy One, turn the Dharma wheel today,
Reveal how all phenomena work and play,
Free the suffering beings from their pain,
Let them receive great joy again.

When beings hear this teaching you bring,
Some reach the Way, some to heaven they'll spring.
Evil paths will decrease and fall away,
While those who bear and practice goodness will increase each day.


Then Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Tathagata—he just nodded silently, saying yes.


---


[The Buddha then describes the same pattern for the south, the southwest, the west, the northwest, the north, the northeast, below, and above—Brahma kings from each direction seeing the light, coming to make offerings, requesting the Dharma wheel. Each group led by a Brahma king with names like "Wonderful Dharma" and "Sikhin," each singing similar praises about how rare Buddhas are, how long the darkness lasted, how they left their meditation bliss to come make offerings.]


---


THE BUDDHA TURNS THE DHARMA WHEEL


The Buddha continued:

"Then Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Tathagata, having received the requests from the Brahma kings of the ten directions and from them sixteen princes—right then and there, he turned the Dharma wheel three times with twelve aspects.

This is the kind of wheel that no monk or brahmin priest, no god or demon or Brahma being, nobody else in the whole world could turn. He said:

'This is suffering.
This is the arising of suffering.
This is the cessation of suffering.
This is the path to the cessation of suffering.'

And he spoke extensively about the twelve-linked chain of dependent origination:

Ignorance causes karmic formations.
Karmic formations cause consciousness.
Consciousness causes name-and-form.
Name-and-form causes the six sense bases.
The six sense bases cause contact.
Contact causes feeling.
Feeling causes craving.
Craving causes grasping.
Grasping causes becoming.
Becoming causes birth.
Birth causes old age, death, sorrow, grief, suffering, and distress.

And when ignorance ceases, karmic formations cease.
When karmic formations cease, consciousness ceases.
When consciousness ceases, name-and-form ceases.
When name-and-form ceases, the six sense bases cease.
When the six sense bases cease, contact ceases.
When contact ceases, feeling ceases.
When feeling ceases, craving ceases.
When craving ceases, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, becoming ceases.
When becoming ceases, birth ceases.
When birth ceases, old age, death, sorrow, grief, suffering, and distress cease.


---


"When the Buddha spoke this teaching before that great assembly of gods and humans, six hundred million billion nayuta people—because they didn't cling to any dharma—their minds were freed from all outflows. They all attained deep and wonderful meditation, the three knowledges, the six spiritual powers, and the eight liberations.

When he spoke the teaching the second time, the third time, and the fourth time, thousands of millions of billions like the sands of the Ganges River—all them beings also, because they didn't cling to any dharma, got their minds freed from all outflows.

From then on, the community of hearers was beyond measure, beyond counting—you couldn't figure out how many."


---


THE SIXTEEN PRINCES BECOME MONKS AND TEACH THE LOTUS SUTRA


"At that time, them sixteen princes all left home as young boys to become novice monks. They had sharp faculties, bright and clear intelligence. They'd already made offerings to hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas in the past, practicing pure conduct, seeking that supreme perfect enlightenment.

Together they said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, all these countless thousands of millions of billions of great and virtuous hearers have already achieved realization. World-Honored One, please teach us too about the Dharma of supreme perfect enlightenment. When we hear it, we'll all practice and study it together. World-Honored One, we aspire to the Tathagata's knowing and seeing. What's deep in our minds, the Buddha knows it himself.'

At that time, among the people that the wheel-turning holy king had brought with him, eighty million billion people saw them sixteen princes leave home, and they also asked to leave home. The king gave them permission.


---


"After that, the Buddha accepted the request of them novice monks. After twenty thousand ages passed, then before the fourfold assembly, he spoke this Mahayana sutra called the Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Dharma—the Teaching for Bodhisattvas, What the Buddha Protects and Keeps in Mind.

When he finished speaking this sutra, them sixteen novice monks—for the sake of supreme perfect enlightenment—all received it, upheld it, recited it, and penetrated it completely.

When this sutra was being taught, them sixteen bodhisattva novice monks all believed and accepted it. Among the hearer community, some also understood with faith. But other beings—thousands of millions of billions of kinds—all gave rise to doubts.

The Buddha spoke this sutra for eight thousand ages without ever resting. After finishing speaking this sutra, he went into a quiet room and entered deep meditation for eighty-four thousand ages.

During that time, them sixteen bodhisattva novice monks knew the Buddha had entered his room and was sitting in silent meditation. So each one climbed up on a Dharma seat, and for eighty-four thousand ages, for the fourfold assembly, they extensively explained and analyzed this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra.

Every single one of them guided six hundred million billion nayuta beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River. They taught them, benefited them, gladdened them, and caused them to develop the mind for supreme perfect enlightenment.


---


"After eighty-four thousand ages, Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha came out of his samadhi. He went to the Dharma seat, sat down peacefully, and announced to the great assembly:

'These sixteen bodhisattva novice monks are extremely rare and precious. Their faculties are sharp and clear, their wisdom bright and penetrating. They've already made offerings to countless thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas. In the presence of those Buddhas, they constantly practiced pure conduct, receiving the Buddha's wisdom and opening it up for beings, causing them to enter into it.

You should all repeatedly draw near to them and make offerings to them. Why? Because if any hearers, solitary realizers, or bodhisattvas can believe the sutra-teaching spoken by these sixteen bodhisattvas, can accept it and not reject it—then every one of them will attain the supreme perfect enlightenment and the Tathagata's wisdom.'"


---


THE SIXTEEN PRINCES ARE NOW BUDDHAS IN THE TEN DIRECTIONS


The Buddha told them monks:

"These sixteen bodhisattvas constantly delighted in speaking this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra. Each bodhisattva guided six hundred million billion nayuta beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River. Life after life, wherever those beings were born, they were born together with the bodhisattva, heard the teaching from him, and all believed and understood. Through this cause and condition, they encountered four hundred million billion World-Honored Buddhas, and even now it ain't finished.

Brothers, I'm telling you now: them sixteen novices who were disciples of that Buddha—they've all now attained supreme perfect enlightenment. In the lands of the ten directions, right now they're speaking the Dharma, with countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of bodhisattvas and hearers as their followers.

Two of them novices are Buddhas in the eastern direction. One is named Akṣobhya, in the Land of Joy. The other is named Sumeru Peak.

In the southeast direction, there are two Buddhas: one named Lion Sound, one named Lion Mark.

In the south, there are two Buddhas: one named Dwelling in Empty Space, one named Eternally Extinguished.

In the southwest, there are two Buddhas: one named Emperor Mark, one named Brahma Mark.

In the west, there are two Buddhas. One is named Amitabha. The other is named Crossing Through All Worldly Suffering and Distress.

In the northwest, there are two Buddhas: one named Tamalapattra-Sandalwood-Fragrance Spiritual Powers, one named Sumeru Mark.

In the north, there are two Buddhas: one named Cloud Freedom, one named Cloud Freedom King.

In the northeast, there's a Buddha named Destroyer of All Worldly Fear.

The sixteenth one—that's me, Shakyamuni Buddha, right here in the Saha world, having attained supreme perfect enlightenment.


---


"Brothers, when we were novice monks, each of us taught countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River. They heard the Dharma from us and headed toward supreme perfect enlightenment.

Among these beings, some now dwell on the hearer ground. But I'm constantly teaching them about supreme perfect enlightenment. These people, through this Dharma, will gradually enter the Buddha Way. Why? Because the Tathagata's wisdom is hard to believe, hard to understand.

Those countless beings like the sands of the Ganges River that we taught back then—that's you monks right here, and after I pass into final rest, the hearer disciples in the future world—that's who they are.

After I pass away, there will be other disciples who don't hear this sutra, don't know or awaken to what bodhisattvas do. Through the merit they've gained, they'll give rise to the thought of extinction and enter nirvana. I'll be a Buddha in another land with a different name. Even though these people give rise to the thought of extinction and enter nirvana, in that land they'll seek the Buddha's wisdom and get to hear this sutra. It's only through the Buddha Vehicle that they'll reach true extinction—there ain't no other vehicle, except when the Tathagata uses skillful means to teach.


---


"Brothers, when the Tathagata knows that the time for nirvana has arrived, when the assembly is pure, their faith and understanding firm and solid, when they thoroughly understand the empty nature of all things and have entered deeply into meditation—then he gathers together all the bodhisattvas and hearers and speaks this sutra for them.

In this world, there's no such thing as two vehicles reaching true extinction. There's only one Buddha Vehicle that reaches true extinction.

Brothers, you should understand: the Tathagata's skillful means penetrate deeply into the nature of beings. Knowing how they're inclined toward lesser teachings and how they're deeply attached to the five desires, for their sake he speaks about nirvana. When these people hear it, they immediately believe and accept it."

THE PARABLE OF THE PHANTOM CITY


"Let me give you an example. Say there's a dangerous and terrible road, five hundred yojanas long, a desolate wilderness with no people, a frightening place. A big group of people wants to cross this road to get to where the treasure is.

There's a guide—smart, sharp, wise—who knows this dangerous road inside and out, knows where it's passable and where it ain't. He's leading this group of people, trying to get them through this difficult path.

But the people he's leading get tired and worn out halfway through. They say to the guide: 'We're exhausted, and we're scared too. We can't go any further. The road ahead is still so far. We want to turn back now.'

Now this guide, he's got all kinds of skillful methods. He thinks to himself: 'What a shame! How can they give up this great treasure and want to turn back?'

After thinking this, with his skillful power, on that dangerous road, after three hundred yojanas, he conjures up a great city. He tells them people:

'Don't be afraid! Don't turn back! Look—here's a big city right here where you can rest. Go in and do whatever you want. Once you enter this city, you'll be comfortable and safe. If you can push on to where the treasure is, you can go there too.'

Then them tired, exhausted people—their hearts fill up with great joy. They're amazed and say: 'Now we've escaped this terrible road! Now we're comfortable and safe!'

So all them people go into that magic city. They think they've already crossed over. They think they're safe now.

Then the guide, knowing these people have rested up and ain't tired anymore, makes that magic city disappear. He tells them:

'Come on, let's go. The place where the treasure is—it's close now. That big city back there? I conjured it up just so you could rest.'"


---


THE MEANING OF THE PARABLE


"Brothers, the Tathagata is the same way. Right now I'm the great guide for all of you. I know that the road of birth-and-death and afflictions is dangerous, difficult, and long. You got to get away from it. You got to cross it.

If beings only heard about the One Buddha Vehicle, they wouldn't want to see the Buddha, wouldn't want to get close to him. They'd think: 'The Buddha Way is long and far. We'd have to undergo suffering for a long, long time before we could achieve it.'

The Buddha knows this mind is cowardly and inferior. Using skillful means, he teaches two kinds of nirvana as a resting place midway along the road.

If beings dwell in these two stages, then the Tathagata tells them: 'What you've done ain't finished yet. This stage where you're dwelling—it's close to the Buddha's wisdom. You should observe and consider: the nirvana you've attained ain't the real thing. It's just the Tathagata's skillful means. Within the One Buddha Vehicle, I've made distinctions and spoken of three.'

It's like that guide who, for the sake of resting, conjured up a great city. Once he knew they'd rested up, he told them: 'The treasure place is close. This city ain't real. I just conjured it up.'"


---


Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say it again, spoke it out in verse:


Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha—
Ten small ages sitting at the place of the Way,
Buddha-truths wouldn't appear before him,
Couldn't complete the Buddha Way that day.

The gods, spirit-dragons, and kings,
Asuras and all their company,
Constantly rained down heavenly flowers,
Making offerings to that Buddha, you see.

The gods struck their heavenly drums,
And played all kinds of heavenly music too,
Fragrant winds blew the wilted flowers away,
And rained down fresh beautiful ones, brand new.

After ten small ages passed on by,
Then he finally achieved the Buddha Way.
Gods and humans, their hearts all leaped for joy,
Filled with happiness that glorious day.

That Buddha's sixteen sons—
Each one with their whole family tree,
Thousands of millions of billions surrounding them,
All went together to where that Buddha would be.

They bowed their heads, touching his feet,
Requested him to turn the Dharma wheel, please do.
"Holy teacher's rain of Dharma, let it fall,
Fill us up and all beings too!"

World-Honored One is so hard to meet,
Only appears once in the longest, longest while.
To awaken all the living beings,
He shakes up everything for miles and miles.

In the eastern direction's many worlds—
Five hundred million billion lands—
The Brahma palaces lit up with light,
Brighter than they'd ever seen in all them strands.

When the Brahmas saw this sign,
They came searching to find the Buddha's place,
Scattered flowers to make offerings,
Offered up their palaces with grace.

They requested the Buddha to turn the wheel,
Sang his praises in verses fine.
The Buddha knew the time wasn't right yet,
So he just sat there, accepting, giving them a sign.

From three directions and four corners too,
From up above and down below, just the same—
Scattering flowers, offering palaces,
Requesting the Buddha to turn the wheel, speaking his name.

"World-Honored One, so hard to meet!
Please, with your great compassion today,
Open wide the gate of immortal nectar,
Turn the supreme Dharma wheel, show us the way!"

That World-Honored One of boundless wisdom,
He accepted what all them people requested.
He proclaimed all kinds of teachings for them—
The Four Noble Truths, the twelve-linked chain he manifested.

From ignorance all the way to old age and death—
It all comes from birth, from being born at all.
All these faults and troubles,
Y'all should understand them, big and small.

When he proclaimed this teaching,
Six hundred million billion gai [immeasurable numbers]—
They reached the end of all suffering,
Became arhats, free from dangers.

When he spoke the Dharma the second time,
Thousands of millions like the Ganges sands,
Because they didn't cling to dharmas,
Also became arhats throughout all lands.

After that, those who reached the Way—
Their number was beyond all measure,
You could count for millions of billions of ages,
Still couldn't reach the edge of that treasure.

At that time them sixteen princes—
They left home to become novices, every one.
They all together requested that Buddha:
"Speak the Great Vehicle teaching, let it be done!

For us and all our followers,
May we all complete the Buddha Way.
May we gain what the World-Honored One has—
The wisdom-eye, first and pure, we pray."

The Buddha knew what them boys were thinking,
Knew the practices they'd done in lives gone by.
Using countless causes and conditions,
And all kinds of parables, he taught them high.

He spoke of the Six Perfections,
And all kinds of spiritual power matters.
He analyzed the real and true teachings,
The path that bodhisattvas walk and what really matters.

He spoke this Lotus Flower Sutra,
Verses numerous as the Ganges sands.
After that Buddha finished speaking,
He went to his quiet room with folded hands.

Sitting in one-pointed meditation,
For eighty-four thousand ages he stayed.
Meanwhile all them novice boys,
Knowing the Buddha in meditation hadn't yet swayed—

For countless billions of beings,
They spoke of the Buddha's supreme wisdom, clear and bright.
Each one sat on a Dharma seat,
Speaking this Great Vehicle sutra day and night.

After the Buddha came out of silence,
They preached to help spread the transformation.
Each and every one of them novices
Guided living beings—six hundred million billion, that's the calculation—

Like the sands of the Ganges River, endless and more.
After that Buddha passed into final rest,
Those who heard the Dharma from him before,
In all the Buddha-lands manifest—

They're constantly born together with their teacher.
These sixteen novices too—
They've fully walked the Buddha path,
Now dwelling in the ten directions, teaching true.

Right now they're speaking the Dharma,
Each one already perfectly enlightened.
Those who heard the teaching back then,
In all the Buddha-places, their paths brightened.

Those dwelling on the hearer ground—
I'm gradually teaching them the Buddha Way.
I was one of them sixteen back then,
And for you I spoke the Dharma in the olden days.

That's why with skillful means today,
I'm leading you toward Buddha wisdom's call.
Because of this original cause and condition,
Now I speak the Lotus Sutra to y'all.

To make you enter the Buddha Way—
Be careful, don't be frightened or dismayed!
Like a dangerous and terrible road,
Remote and far, where many dangers laid—

With vicious beasts all around,
And not a drop of water, not a blade of grass—
A place that people fear and dread,
Countless thousands of millions wanting to pass.

The road stretches out so far away—
Five hundred yojanas, the distance goes.
At that time there was one guide,
Strong in memory, with wisdom, one who knows.

His understanding clear, his mind made up,
On that dangerous path, saving folks from disaster.
But all the people got worn out and tired,
They said to that guide, their master:

"Right now we're completely exhausted,
We want to turn back from here today."
The guide thought about it, considered it:
"What a pity, what a shame, I must say!

How could they want to turn around,
And lose out on that great treasure-ground?"
Right then he thought up a skillful method,
Where his spiritual power could be found.

He conjured up a great walled city,
With decorated houses, beautiful and bright,
Surrounded by gardens and forests,
Streams and bathing pools, a lovely sight.

Double gates and tall towers,
Filled with men and women everywhere.
After he made this conjuration,
He comforted them folks: "Don't despair!

Go ahead and enter this city,
Each of you can do what brings you pleasure."
When all them people entered the city,
Their hearts filled up with joy beyond measure.

They all felt safe and secure,
Thinking: "Now we've crossed over for sure!"
The guide knew they'd rested up enough,
Gathered everyone together, that's what he was there for.

He told them: "You should keep moving on now,
This is just a conjured city here.
I saw you were exhausted,
Wanted to turn back out of fear.

So with my skillful power,
I temporarily conjured up this city wall.
Now y'all should push forward with energy—
Together we'll reach the treasure after all!"

I too am like this,
I'm the guide for everyone, you see.
I see all these seekers of the Way
Giving up halfway, unable to break free—

Unable to cross birth and death,
And all the dangerous roads of affliction too.
So with my skillful power,
I speak of nirvana for rest, to help them through.

I say: "Your suffering is extinguished,
You've accomplished everything you need to do."
Once I know they've reached nirvana,
All become arhats, through and through—

Then I gather the great assembly,
And speak the real truth for their sake:
The Buddhas' skillful power—
They made distinctions, spoke of three for your sake.

There's only one Buddha Vehicle,
The rest—they're just resting places, nothing more.
Now I'm telling you the real deal:
What you attained ain't the final score.

To gain the Buddha's all-knowing wisdom,
You should generate great energy and will!
When you've realized all-knowing wisdom,
The Ten Powers and all the Buddha-dharmas still—

With the thirty-two marks adorning you—
That's when you reach true extinction, nothing left to kill.
The Buddhas who are the guides,
They speak of nirvana to give folks a rest on the hill.

Once they know that rest is finished,
They lead them into the Buddha's wisdom, that's the thrill."

END OF CHAPTER SEVEN: THE PHANTOM CITY BLUES


---


TRANSLATOR'S NOTES ON THIS BLUES RENDERING:

**What We're Doing Here:**

This chapter is about time—time so vast your mind can't hold it—and about how a good teacher knows when to let tired people rest before pushing them toward the ultimate goal. I've tried to make it sing like the blues while keeping every bit of the depth.

**Key Metaphors and Choices:**

1. **The Ink and Dust Parable**: The original uses grinding earth into ink and dropping it across inconceivable distances to show how long ago this ancient Buddha lived. I kept the concrete imagery—grinding, walking, dropping—because that's what makes it real. You can feel the vastness through the physical action.

2. **The Sixteen Princes**: These are the sixteen sons who became monks, taught the Lotus Sutra, and are now Buddhas throughout the universe—including Amitabha (Pure Land) and Shakyamuni (our Buddha). This is a profound teaching about the eternal connection between teachers and students across cosmic time.

3. **The Phantom City**: This is the heart of the chapter. A guide leading exhausted travelers creates a magical rest stop—a phantom city—so they can catch their breath before continuing to the real treasure. The Buddha says this is what he does: he teaches "lesser" forms of liberation (the hearer and solitary realizer paths) as rest stops on the way to full Buddha-hood. It ain't the final destination, but it's a necessary mercy for folks who can't make the full journey all at once.

**Blues Elements Used:**

- Call and response structure in the verses
- Repetition with variation (each direction's Brahma kings)
- Direct address ("brothers," "you see," "I'm telling you")
- Concrete physical imagery (grinding, walking, raining flowers, tired feet)
- The blues truth: rest is real, exhaustion is real, but the journey ain't over
- Musical rhythm in the verse sections
- Vernacular grammar ("ain't," "gonna," "y'all")

**Theological Depth Preserved:**

This chapter teaches that the "three vehicles" (hearer, solitary realizer, and bodhisattva paths) are actually all one Buddha Vehicle—the seeming divisions are just skillful means. The Buddha creates "phantom cities" (provisional teachings) because he knows most folks can't handle the full truth right away. It's profound compassion: he meets people where they are.

The deep time framework (the ancient Buddha from countless eons ago, whose sixteen disciples are now Buddhas throughout space) shows that the Dharma operates across inconceivable dimensions—but the Buddha makes it immediate: "I see it clear as today."

**Final Word:**

The blues has always known how to carry heavy truth with a light touch, how to make the cosmic feel personal, how to honor both rest and journey. This chapter does the same thing—and I've tried to let that music come through while keeping every grain of wisdom intact.

May all beings find the rest they need and the courage to keep walking toward that treasure.
