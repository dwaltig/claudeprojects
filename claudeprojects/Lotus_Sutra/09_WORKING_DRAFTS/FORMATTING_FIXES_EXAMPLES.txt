CHAPTER FORMATTING FIXES - BEFORE AND AFTER EXAMPLES
================================================================================

This document shows concrete examples of each formatting inconsistency 
and the recommended fixes.

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 1: CHAPTER CLOSING FORMAT INCONSISTENCY
================================================================================

INCONSISTENCY: Some chapters have title in "END OF CHAPTER" line, others don't

BEFORE (Line 3230 - Chapter 3):
---
END OF CHAPTER THREE

TRANSLATION NOTES:

---

AFTER (Recommended - add title for consistency):
---
END OF CHAPTER THREE: THE PARABLE

TRANSLATION NOTES:

---

WHY: The opening header is "CHAPTER THREE: THE PARABLE" so the closing 
should match with the full title for parallel structure.

SIMILAR FIXES NEEDED (18 total):
  Line 3230: Add "THE PARABLE"
  Line 4424: Add "THE PARABLE OF THE MEDICINAL HERBS"
  Line 6021: Add "WHEN THE FIVE HUNDRED FINALLY HEARD THEIR NAMES CALLED"
  Line 6213: Add "WHEN THE FAITHFUL GET THEIR DUE"
  Line 6555: Add "HONOR THE WORD-CARRIERS"
  Line 6997: Add "WHEN THE JEWELED TOWER ROSE UP"
  Line 7305: Add "WHEN YOUR ENEMY WAS YOUR TEACHER"
  Line 7620: Add "WHEN THE ROAD GETS ROUGH, YOU GOTTA KEEP WALKING"
  Line 8273: Add "HOW TO KEEP YOUR SOUL CLEAN WHEN THE WORLD'S GONE WRONG"
  Line 8803: Add "WHEN THE UNDERGROUND ARMY ROSE UP"
  Line 10207: Add "THE JOY THAT MULTIPLIES"
  Line 10959: Add "WHEN YOUR SENSES WAKE UP"
  Line 11173: Add "THE BODHISATTVA WHO NEVER LOOKED DOWN"
  Line 11559: Add "WHEN THE LORD SHOWED HIS HAND"
  Line 11914: Add "THE PASSING ON"
  Line 12910: Add "WONDERFUL SOUND BODHISATTVA"
  Line 13463: Add "THE ONE WHO HEARS THE WORLD CRYING"
  Line 13903: Add "THE PROTECTION SONGS"

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 2: SUBTITLE ATTRIBUTION INCONSISTENCY
================================================================================

INCONSISTENCY: Only Chapters 1-7 have attribution subtitles; Chapters 8-28 don't

BEFORE (Line 291-293 - Chapter 1):
---
CHAPTER ONE: THE OPENING
A Blues Translation from the Classical Chinese

---

AFTER (Recommended - remove for consistency with Chapters 8-28):
---
CHAPTER ONE: THE OPENING

---

WHY: Only 5 out of 28 chapters have this subtitle. Removing it brings 
consistency with the final 22 chapters which have no attribution subtitles.

SIMILAR FIXES (5 total to remove):
  Line 292: DELETE "A Blues Translation from the Classical Chinese"
  Line 982: DELETE "Blues Translation from Classical Chinese by Kumārajīva"
  Line 1933: DELETE "(Blues Translation from Classical Chinese)"
  Line 4068: DELETE "A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese"
  Line 4841: DELETE "A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese"

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 3: SEPARATOR LINE INCONSISTENCY
================================================================================

INCONSISTENCY: Some chapters have "---", Chapter 3 has "***", most have neither

BEFORE (Line 1933-1936 - Chapter 3):
---
CHAPTER THREE: THE PARABLE
(Blues Translation from Classical Chinese)

***

ŚĀRIPUTRA'S JOY

---

AFTER Option A (Recommended - remove all separators):
---
CHAPTER THREE: THE PARABLE

ŚĀRIPUTRA'S JOY

---

AFTER Option B (Alternative - standardize to "---"):
---
CHAPTER THREE: THE PARABLE

---

ŚĀRIPUTRA'S JOY

---

WHY Option A: Cleaner appearance; no separators needed with section headers
WHY Option B: Adds visual separation if deemed important

SIMILAR FIXES (if removing all):
  Line 294: DELETE "---" (Chapter 1)
  Line 1935: DELETE "***" or change to "---" (Chapter 3)
  Line 4070: DELETE "---" (Chapter 5)
  Line 4844: DELETE "---" (Chapter 7)
  Plus: Multiple "***" in Chapter 3 verses (lines 1947-2314)

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 4: LOWERCASE DUPLICATE CHAPTER HEADER INCONSISTENCY
================================================================================

INCONSISTENCY: Chapters 3-6 and 25-26 have lowercase headers after chapter ends

BEFORE (Lines 3230-3235 - Chapter 3):
---
END OF CHAPTER THREE

TRANSLATION NOTES:

Chapter 3: 
(The Burning House)

---

AFTER (Recommended - remove lowercase headers entirely):
---
END OF CHAPTER THREE: THE PARABLE

TRANSLATION NOTES:

[Notes content begins here]

---

WHY: These lowercase headers appear to be formatting artifacts. They appear 
AFTER the chapter ends and after TRANSLATION NOTES begins, which is illogical. 
None of the other chapters have this pattern.

SIMILAR FIXES (6 total to remove):
  Lines 3234-3235: DELETE "Chapter 3:" and "(The Burning House)"
  Line 4046: DELETE "Chapter 4:"
  Line 4429: DELETE "Chapter 5"
  Line 4819: DELETE "Chapter 6"
  Lines 14048-14049: DELETE "Chapter 25 (Avalokiteshvara)..." and "Chapter 26 (Dharani)..."

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 5: SEPARATOR WITH INCONSISTENT SUBTITLE
================================================================================

BEFORE (Lines 4065-4072 - Chapter 5):
---
CHAPTER FIVE: THE PARABLE OF THE MEDICINAL HERBS
A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese

---

PART ONE: THE BUDDHA PRAISES MAHĀKĀŚYAPA

---

AFTER (Recommended - remove both subtitle and separator):
---
CHAPTER FIVE: THE PARABLE OF THE MEDICINAL HERBS

PART ONE: THE BUDDHA PRAISES MAHĀKĀŚYAPA

---

WHY: Removes two sources of inconsistency (subtitle and separator) while 
maintaining clear section headers like "PART ONE".

================================================================================
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED CHANGES
================================================================================

Four main types of fixes:

TYPE 1: CHAPTER CLOSING TITLES (18 lines to modify)
  Action: Add chapter title to all "END OF CHAPTER X" lines
  Format: "END OF CHAPTER X: [TITLE]"
  Time: 20-30 minutes
  Risk: VERY LOW

TYPE 2: REMOVE SUBTITLE ATTRIBUTIONS (5 lines to delete)
  Action: Delete attribution lines after chapter headers
  Chapters: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
  Time: 5 minutes
  Risk: LOW

TYPE 3: REMOVE LOWERCASE HEADERS (6-8 lines to delete)
  Action: Delete duplicate lowercase chapter headers
  Chapters: 3, 4, 5, 6, 25, 26
  Time: 5-10 minutes
  Risk: LOW

TYPE 4: SEPARATOR LINES (4-30 lines decision-dependent)
  Action: Either remove all OR standardize to "---"
  Recommendation: Remove all (5 lines) for clean look
  Alternative: Add "---" to all 28 chapters (~24 new lines)
  Time: 10-20 minutes
  Risk: MEDIUM (depends on decision)

================================================================================
TOTAL CHANGES FOR COMPLETE STANDARDIZATION
================================================================================

Lines to DELETE:     ~15-20 lines
Lines to MODIFY:     ~18 lines
Lines to ADD:        0 lines (if removing separators) OR ~24 lines (if adding)

Total effort:        ~1 hour 10 minutes
Risk level:          LOW
Complexity:          Very simple (mostly text deletion and replacement)
