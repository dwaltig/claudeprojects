Chapter Twenty-Four: Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva
A Blues Translation from the Classical Chinese

---

THE SIGNAL ACROSS THE DISTANCE

Now listen here. The Buddha Shakyamuni, he let loose a light—
not just any light, but the light from the mark between his eyes,
that white hair curl that shines like truth itself,
and the light from the crown of his head, that bump of wisdom.
And that light, it didn't just shine local, you understand,
it went traveling east across one hundred and eight million billion
    countless worlds,
crossing distances that ain't got no names,
reaching further than numbers can count,
further than the mind can follow.

That light traveled and traveled until it reached a world
called Pure Light Adorned,
and in that world there was a Buddha named
Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Tathagata—
all them ten names: the One Who Comes, the Worthy One,
the Perfectly Awakened, the one who knows and walks right,
the one who went well, the one who understands this world,
the supreme one, the tamer of beings,
teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.
And he was teaching countless bodhisattvas,
all them beings gathered round respectful,
and Shakyamuni's white light came flooding through that world.

THE CALL

Now in that Pure Light Adorned world,
there was a bodhisattva named Wonderful Sound—
and brother, that name ain't just decoration.
He'd been planting good roots for a long, long time,
serving and learning from countless hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas,
and he'd achieved deep wisdom, you hear me?
He had samadhi like you wouldn't believe:
the Wonderful Banner samadhi, the Lotus Flower samadhi,
the Pure Virtue samadhi, the Constellation King Play samadhi,
the samadhi of No Conditions, the Wisdom Seal samadhi,
the samadhi that understands every language every being speaks,
the samadhi that gathers all merit together,
the Pure samadhi, the Spiritual Powers Play samadhi,
the Wisdom Torch samadhi, the Adorning King samadhi,
the Pure Light samadhi, the Pure Storehouse samadhi,
the Uncommon samadhi, the Sun Rotation samadhi—
hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of samadhis
like grains of sand in the Ganges River.

And when Shakyamuni Buddha's light touched his body,
Wonderful Sound felt it.
He felt that call reaching across all them worlds.
And he turned to his own Buddha, Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom,
and he said: "World-Honored One,
I got to go to that Saha world.
I got to pay my respects to Shakyamuni Buddha,
I got to draw near and make offerings.
I got to see Manjushri, that Dharma Prince,
and Medicine King Bodhisattva, and Brave Giving Bodhisattva,
and Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva,
and Superior Practice Bodhisattva, and Adorning King Bodhisattva,
and Superior Medicine Bodhisattva.
I got to go, Lord. That light is calling me."

THE WARNING

Now Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha,
he looked at Wonderful Sound with love and concern,
and he said: "Son, don't you look down on that world.
Don't you go developing no inferior thoughts about it.
Good man, listen to me:
that Saha world, it's rough.
It ain't level—it's got high places and low places,
mountains of dirt and stone,
filled up with pollution and trouble.
The Buddha there, his body looks small.
The bodhisattvas there, their forms look small too.
But you, your body is forty-two thousand yojanas tall.
Me, my body is six million eight hundred thousand yojanas tall.
Your body is beautiful, you understand—
adorned with hundreds of thousands of millions of blessings,
your light especially wonderful.
So when you go—don't you look down on that country,
don't you look down on that Buddha or them bodhisattvas,
don't you look down on that land and develop inferior thoughts."

THE PILGRIM'S FAITH

Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva, he bowed to his Buddha and said:
"World-Honored One, when I go to that Saha world,
it's all the Tathagata's power that sends me.
It's the Tathagata's spiritual powers at play.
It's the Tathagata's merit, wisdom, and adornment
that makes this journey possible.
I ain't going on my own strength, Lord.
This is all you."

TRAVELING WITHOUT MOVING

And then, right there,
Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva didn't rise from his seat.
His body didn't shake, didn't move.
But he entered into samadhi,
and by the power of that samadhi,
over there at Vulture Peak Mountain,
not far from where the Buddha was sitting on his Dharma seat,
there appeared eighty-four thousand jeweled lotus flowers—
gold from the Jambu River for the stems,
white silver for the leaves,
diamond for the stamens,
and manikya jewels for the platforms.

You see, he sent his calling card ahead.
He announced himself through beauty.
The flowers arrived before the man,
preparing the way.

THE QUESTION

Now Manjushri, that Dharma Prince,
he saw them lotus flowers appear,
and he said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One,
what's the cause and condition for this?
Why we seeing this auspicious sign first—
all these thousands and tens of thousands of lotus flowers,
gold stems and silver leaves,
diamond stamens and jewel platforms?"

And Shakyamuni Buddha told Manjushri:
"This is Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva Mahasattva.
He wants to come from Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha's country,
bringing eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas with him,
coming here to this Saha world
to make offerings to me, to draw near, to pay respects,
and also to make offerings to and hear the Lotus Sutra."

THE DESIRE TO SEE

Manjushri said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One,
what good roots did this bodhisattva plant?
What merit did he cultivate
that he got this kind of great spiritual power?
What samadhi does he practice?
Please tell us the name of this samadhi—
we want to practice it diligently too.
By practicing this samadhi,
we'll be able to see this bodhisattva's form and appearance,
large or small, his威儀, his way of moving.
We pray that the World-Honored One, by your spiritual power,
will let that bodhisattva come so we can see him."

Shakyamuni Buddha told Manjushri:
"That Tathagata who passed into extinction long ago, Many Treasures,
he'll make this happen for you,
he'll show you what you need to see."

THE INVITATION

And Many Treasures Buddha, from inside that treasure tower,
he called out to that bodhisattva:
"Good man, come on!
Manjushri, that Dharma Prince, he wants to see you."

THE ARRIVAL

And right then, Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva,
he vanished from that other country,
and he set out with eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas together.
And in every country they passed through,
the earth shook six ways—
it trembled and quaked, it swayed and rocked,
it pounded and crashed.
And in every place, seven-jeweled lotus flowers rained down,
and hundreds of thousands of heavenly music
started playing without nobody touching them—
instruments sounding all by themselves,
heaven itself making music for this pilgrim.

And this bodhisattva—
his eyes were like the leaves of great blue lotus flowers,
and even if you combined the beauty of a hundred thousand million moons,
his face was more perfect than that.
His body was the color of true gold,
adorned with countless hundreds of thousands of merits,
his awesome virtue blazing,
his light shining and glowing,
all his marks complete,
his body strong and firm like Narayana's adamantine body.

He entered a seven-jeweled platform
that rose up into space,
seven tala trees high above the ground.
And surrounded respectfully by all them bodhisattvas,
he came to this Saha world,
to Vulture Peak Mountain.

THE OFFERING AND THE QUESTIONS

When he arrived, he came down from that seven-jeweled platform,
and he took necklaces worth hundreds of thousands
and went to where Shakyamuni Buddha was.
He bowed his head to the Buddha's feet,
he offered up them necklaces,
and he said: "World-Honored One,
Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha
sends his greetings to the World-Honored One.
He asks: Are you free from illness and troubles?
Are you dwelling at ease?
Are you able to move about lightly?
Are you practicing joyfully?
Are the four elements in harmony?
Are worldly affairs bearable?
Are living beings easy to save?
Are they without much greed, anger, ignorance, jealousy, and stinginess?
Are they without disrespect to parents, without disrespect to monks,
without wrong views, without unwholesome minds,
without failure to control the five sense faculties?
World-Honored One, are living beings able to conquer
    the demon enemies?
And Many Treasures Tathagata, who passed into extinction long ago—
is he in that seven-jeweled tower, coming to hear the Dharma?
My Buddha also sends greetings to Many Treasures Tathagata:
Is he peaceful and free from troubles?
Can he endure and remain long?
World-Honored One, I want now to see Many Treasures Buddha's body.
I pray the World-Honored One will show him to me."

And Shakyamuni Buddha spoke to Many Treasures Buddha:
"This Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva wants to see you."

And Many Treasures Buddha told Wonderful Sound:
"Excellent, excellent!
You've come here to make offerings to Shakyamuni Buddha,
to hear the Lotus Flower Sutra,
and to see Manjushri and the others.
This is good, good."

THE PAST CAUSE

Now Flower Virtue Bodhisattva, he asked the Buddha:
"World-Honored One, what good roots did Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva plant?
What merit did he cultivate that he got this spiritual power?"

The Buddha told Flower Virtue Bodhisattva:
"In the past, there was a Buddha named
Cloud Thunder Sound King Tathagata, Arhat,
    Perfectly Enlightened One.
His country was called Manifesting All Worlds.
The kalpa was called Joyfully Seen.
Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva, for twelve thousand years,
he made offerings to Cloud Thunder Sound King Buddha
with a hundred thousand kinds of music,
and he also presented eighty-four thousand seven-jeweled bowls.
Because of this cause and condition, this karmic result,
he's now born in Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha's country,
and he has this spiritual power.

Flower Virtue, what do you think?
That Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva back then,
who made offerings with music and presented jeweled vessels
    to Cloud Thunder Sound King Buddha—
was that somebody else?
No, that was this Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva Mahasattva right here.

Flower Virtue, this Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva
has already made offerings to and drawn near countless Buddhas.
He's been planting roots of virtue for a long, long time.
And he's met hundreds of thousands of millions of billions
    of countless Buddhas,
as many as grains of sand in the Ganges River."

THE POWER TO MANIFEST IN ALL FORMS

"Flower Virtue, you just seeing Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva's body here,
but this bodhisattva, he manifests all kinds of bodies,
appearing everywhere to teach this sutra to all living beings.

Sometimes he manifests as Brahma King,
sometimes as Shakra,
sometimes as Ishvara Deva,
sometimes as Mahesvara Deva,
sometimes as a great heavenly general,
sometimes as Vaishravana Heavenly King,
sometimes as a wheel-turning sage king,
sometimes as various lesser kings,
sometimes as an elder,
sometimes as a householder,
sometimes as a chief minister,
sometimes as a brahman,
sometimes as a bhikshu, bhikshuni, upasaka, or upasika,
sometimes as an elder or householder's wife,
sometimes as a chief minister's wife,
sometimes as a brahman woman,
sometimes as a boy or girl,
sometimes as a deva, dragon, yaksha, gandharva,
asura, garuda, kinnara, mahoraga,
human or nonhuman being—
and in all these forms, he teaches this sutra.

To those in the hells, the hungry ghosts, the animals,
and all the difficult places—he can bring salvation.
Even in the inner palaces of kings,
he transforms into a woman's body to teach this sutra."

THE SCOPE OF THE WORK

"Flower Virtue, this Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva
can protect and save all living beings in the Saha world.
This Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva manifests and transforms like this,
appearing in various bodies in this Saha land,
teaching this sutra to all living beings.
And his spiritual powers, transformations, and wisdom
don't diminish one bit from all this work.

This bodhisattva uses various kinds of wisdom
to illumine the Saha world,
causing all living beings to each obtain what they need to know.
And it's like this in worlds throughout the ten directions,
as many as grains of sand in the Ganges River.

If someone should be saved by a voice-hearer form,
he manifests a voice-hearer form and teaches the Dharma.
If someone should be saved by a pratyekabuddha form,
he manifests a pratyekabuddha form and teaches the Dharma.
If someone should be saved by a bodhisattva form,
he manifests a bodhisattva form and teaches the Dharma.
If someone should be saved by a Buddha form,
he immediately manifests a Buddha form and teaches the Dharma.
Like this, in various ways, according to what's appropriate for saving them,
he manifests that form—
even if someone should be saved by passing into extinction,
he shows the appearance of passing into extinction.

Flower Virtue, Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva Mahasattva
has accomplished this great spiritual power and wisdom power.
His work is like this."

THE NAME OF THE SAMADHI

Then Flower Virtue Bodhisattva said to the Buddha:
"World-Honored One, this Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva
has planted deep good roots.
World-Honored One, what samadhi does this bodhisattva dwell in
that he can manifest and transform like this,
saving and liberating living beings?"

The Buddha told Flower Virtue Bodhisattva:
"Good man, that samadhi is called
Manifesting All Bodies.
Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva dwells in this samadhi,
and he can benefit countless living beings like this."

THE FRUIT OF HEARING

When this chapter about Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva was taught,
those eighty-four thousand people who came with Wonderful Sound—
they all attained the samadhi of Manifesting All Bodies.
And countless bodhisattvas in this Saha world
also attained this samadhi and this dharani.

THE RETURN

Then Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva Mahasattva,
after making offerings to Shakyamuni Buddha
and to Many Treasures Buddha's tower,
he returned to his own land.
And in every country he passed through,
the earth shook six ways,
jeweled lotus flowers rained down,
and hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of kinds of music played.

When he got back to his own country,
surrounded by those eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas,
he went to Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha
and said: "World-Honored One,
I went to that Saha world and benefited living beings.
I saw Shakyamuni Buddha,
I saw Many Treasures Buddha's tower,
I paid respects and made offerings.
I also saw Manjushri, that Dharma Prince,
and Medicine King Bodhisattva,
and Gained Diligent Progress Power Bodhisattva,
and Brave Giving Bodhisattva and the others.
And I also caused these eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas
to attain the samadhi of Manifesting All Bodies."

THE GIFT GIVEN

When this chapter about Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva's
    coming and going was taught,
forty-two thousand sons of heaven attained the patience
    of birthlessness,
and Flower Virtue Bodhisattva attained the Lotus Flower Samadhi.

TRANSLATOR'S NOTES: THE PILGRIMAGE AND THE POWER TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE

This chapter is a pilgrimage story—a narrative about answering a call, making a sacred journey, and returning home transformed and transformative. It's structured like a classic hero's journey, but the hero here is already enlightened. He ain't going to learn something; he's going to witness something and to serve.

THE SIGNAL ACROSS IMPOSSIBLE DISTANCES

The chapter opens with light traveling across "one hundred and eight million billion countless worlds"—a distance that breaks mathematics, that breaks imagination. This ain't a metaphor for "far away." This is genuinely unimaginable distance. And yet the light reaches. The signal gets through.

In blues and gospel terms, this is the call that comes from beyond—the call that reaches you no matter how far you think you are from the source. It's the voice that speaks across every barrier, every distance, every separation. When God calls, when truth calls, when the Dharma calls—ain't no distance too far for that signal to reach you.

Wonderful Sound feels that light touch him, and he knows immediately: "I got to go." That's the nature of a real call. You don't have to study on it. You don't have to think it through. You feel it in your body, and you know.

THE WARNING ABOUT LOOKING DOWN

The Buddha's warning is crucial: "Don't look down on that world." Because Wonderful Sound is forty-two thousand yojanas tall (that's about 160,000 miles), his own Buddha is six million eight hundred thousand yojanas tall (about 26 million miles), and Shakyamuni Buddha's body in our world looks "small." The world itself is "rough, uneven, filled with dirt and stone mountains and pollution."

This is a teaching about respect. About not confusing appearance with essence. About not letting where you come from make you disrespect where you going.

Every person who's ever left their neighborhood and came back educated, who's ever made it out and returned, who's ever risen up and had to go back down—this teaching is for you. Don't look down. Don't develop inferior thoughts about people or places just because they look smaller, rougher, poorer than where you are now.

The Saha world—this world right here—it looks small and troubled from a distance. But that's where the work is. That's where beings need saving. That's where the Dharma needs teaching.

TRAVELING WITHOUT MOVING

"Without rising from his seat, without his body shaking, he entered samadhi"—and by spiritual power alone, he traveled across all them countless worlds. This is supernatural movement. This is the soul traveling while the body sits still.

But notice: before HE arrives, the flowers appear. Eighty-four thousand jeweled lotus flowers show up first at Vulture Peak. The place is prepared. The announcement is made. Beauty arrives before the teacher.

This is how real spiritual work happens. The atmosphere changes before the person shows up. The space is prepared. You can feel something coming before it gets there.

THE PILGRIM'S HUMILITY

When warned about the rough world, Wonderful Sound doesn't puff up with pride, doesn't say "Don't worry, I can handle it." He says: "It's all the Tathagata's power. It's the Tathagata's spiritual powers at play. It's all you, Lord."

This is the humility of the truly powerful. The person who's got real ability knows that ability came from somewhere. It was given. It was cultivated through connection to something greater. "I ain't going on my own strength, Lord. This is all you."

That's the faith that makes pilgrimage possible. You don't go to sacred places on your own strength. You go because you're sent. You go because you're called. You go because the power that called you is the power that will carry you.

HIS BEAUTIFUL APPEARANCE

When Wonderful Sound arrives, the description is stunning: "His eyes were like the leaves of great blue lotus flowers, and even if you combined the beauty of a hundred thousand million moons, his face was more perfect than that. His body was the color of true gold, adorned with countless hundreds of thousands of merits, his awesome virtue blazing, his light shining and glowing."

This ain't false modesty. This ain't "the messenger must be humble and ugly." This is: the truth is beautiful. Holiness is beautiful. Virtue shines. Merit glows.

We get confused sometimes, thinking humility means making yourself small, making yourself ugly, hiding your light. But the Dharma says: let your light shine. Let your merit show. Let the work you've done be visible in your very body.

Wonderful Sound is beautiful because he's good. He shines because he's practiced. His appearance testifies to his virtue. That's not pride; that's just truth.

THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WORLD

When Wonderful Sound arrives, he delivers greetings from his Buddha to Shakyamuni: "Are you free from illness and troubles? Are you dwelling at ease? Are worldly affairs bearable? Are living beings easy to save? Are they without much greed, anger, ignorance, jealousy, and stinginess?"

These ain't small talk. These are real questions about the conditions of teaching in a difficult world. Is it bearable? Can you endure it? Are people willing to learn, or are they too caught up in greed and ignorance?

This is one Buddha, through his messenger, asking another Buddha: "How you holding up in that hard place? Is it too much? You making it?"

Even enlightened beings check on each other. Even Buddhas ask: "You alright? Can you bear it?" That's compassion among teachers.

THE CORE TEACHING: THE POWER TO MANIFEST IN ALL FORMS

The heart of this chapter is the list of forms that Wonderful Sound can take. He manifests as:
- Gods (Brahma, Shakra, Ishvara, Mahesvara)
- Heavenly generals and kings
- Earthly kings, great and small
- Elders, householders, ministers, brahmans
- Monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen
- Wives of various classes
- Boys and girls
- Devas, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas
- Even nonhuman beings
- Even in hells, among hungry ghosts, among animals
- Even as women in kings' inner palaces

"In all these forms, he teaches this sutra."

And then the Buddha makes it even more radical: "If someone should be saved by a voice-hearer form, he manifests a voice-hearer form. If someone should be saved by a pratyekabuddha form, he manifests that. If someone should be saved by a bodhisattva form, he manifests that. If someone should be saved by a Buddha form, he immediately manifests a Buddha form. Even if someone should be saved by passing into extinction, he shows the appearance of passing into extinction."

He becomes whatever form people need to see in order to hear the teaching.

This is the spiritual superpower of meeting people where they are. Not where you wish they were. Not where you think they should be. Where they ARE.

If somebody needs to see a king to listen, he's a king. If somebody needs to see a woman to trust, he's a woman. If somebody needs to see a child to open their heart, he's a child. If somebody needs to see suffering to understand, he shows suffering. If somebody needs to see death to wake up, he shows death.

This is radical adaptability in the service of truth. This is infinite flexibility in the service of liberation. This is the willingness to be whatever the moment needs, to show up however people can receive you, to set aside your own preferred identity in order to give people what they need.

In the black church, we say: "God will meet you where you are." This chapter is teaching that, and more: the bodhisattva will BECOME where you are. Will take your form. Will speak your language. Will show up in your life wearing a face you can recognize.

THE NAME OF THE SAMADHI

When asked what samadhi gives this power, the Buddha says: "That samadhi is called Manifesting All Bodies."

That's the practice. That's the door. The samadhi of Manifesting All Bodies—the meditation, the concentration, the spiritual absorption that gives you the power to show up as whoever needs to show up, to take the form that serves, to be the teacher that this particular being can hear.

And then comes the gift: when this chapter was taught, the eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas who came with Wonderful Sound all attained this samadhi. And countless bodhisattvas in our Saha world also attained it.

Just from HEARING about this power, beings gained the power itself. Just from witnessing this teaching, they received the ability to manifest in all forms.

That's how the Dharma works. The teaching itself transmits the ability. The story itself conveys the power.

THE RETURN

After making offerings to both Buddhas (Shakyamuni and Many Treasures), Wonderful Sound returns home. And on the way back, just like on the way there, the earth shakes, jeweled lotus flowers rain down, heavenly music plays.

He returns to his own Buddha and reports: "I went to that Saha world and benefited living beings. I saw Shakyamuni Buddha, I saw Many Treasures Buddha's tower, I paid respects and made offerings. I also saw Manjushri and Medicine King and the others. And I also caused these eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas to attain the samadhi of Manifesting All Bodies."

The pilgrimage is complete. He went, he witnessed, he served, he returned. And he brought back fruit: not just his own experience, but the transmission of the power to all those who went with him.

That's what a real pilgrimage does. You don't go just for yourself. You go as a representative. You go to bring something back. You go to witness something that others can't witness, so you can testify when you return.

THE STRUCTURE OF CALL AND RESPONSE

This chapter follows the classic structure of spiritual call and response:
1. The signal is sent (Buddha's light)
2. The call is received (Wonderful Sound feels it)
3. The pilgrim answers (I got to go)
4. Warning is given (Don't look down on that rough place)
5. Faith responds (It's all your power, Lord)
6. Journey is made (traveling without moving)
7. Arrival is announced (flowers appear first)
8. Respect is paid (offerings and prostrations)
9. Teaching is given (the power to manifest in all forms)
10. Return is made (shaking earth and raining flowers)
11. Testimony is delivered (reporting back)
12. Fruit is shared (others receive the power)

This is the pattern of spiritual pilgrimage across every tradition. You hear the call. You answer. You're warned of difficulties. You go anyway in faith. You arrive. You witness. You receive. You return. You testify. Others are transformed by your testimony.

WHY THIS MATTERS

In a world that demands you be one thing, have one identity, fit one box—this chapter teaches that the highest spiritual achievement is the ability to be everything, to manifest in all forms, to meet every being where they are.

Not by losing yourself. Wonderful Sound doesn't lose his identity. He's always Wonderful Sound. But he can appear as anything while remaining himself.

This is the spiritual power that our world desperately needs: people who can cross boundaries, speak multiple languages, show up in multiple communities, take multiple forms—all while maintaining their core integrity, all while serving the same truth.

The teacher who can speak to the scholar and the street sweeper. The preacher who can comfort the dying and celebrate with the living. The friend who can be strong when you need strength and soft when you need softness. The parent who can be authority and playmate. The leader who can be visionary and servant.

This is the samadhi of Manifesting All Bodies—the spiritual practice of infinite adaptability in service of liberation.

And the promise of this chapter is: this power is available. Just by hearing about it, beings receive it. Just by understanding it, you gain access to it. The teaching itself transmits the ability.

So this chapter asks: What form do you need to take today? Who needs to see you? How do you need to show up? What body does this moment need you to manifest?

And it promises: You have the power. The samadhi is available. The light has reached you across all them countless worlds. You felt it touch you. Now answer the call. Make the journey. Meet people where they are. Show up in whatever form serves. And when you return, testify. Share the fruit. Pass on the power.

That's the teaching of Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva—the pilgrim who travels without moving, who manifests in all forms, who goes anywhere beings need saving, even to the hells, even to the palaces, even to this rough and troubled world.

He came. He witnessed. He served. He returned. And by his coming, others gained the power to do the same.

May it be so for all who hear this chapter. May the samadhi of Manifesting All Bodies be yours. May you have the power to show up however the world needs you. May you answer the call that reaches across impossible distances. May you make the pilgrimage and return to testify.

This is the Wonderful Sound—not just a name, but a way of being. The sound that adapts to every ear. The voice that speaks every language. The teaching that takes every form. The Dharma that meets you exactly where you are.

Amen. And amen. And let the church say amen.
