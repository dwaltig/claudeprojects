Chapter Ten: Honor the Word-Carriers
(The Teachers of the Dharma)

[THE BUDDHA SPEAKS TO MEDICINE KING]

Now at that time, the World-Honored One, he turns to Medicine King Bodhisattva, and through him he's talking to eighty thousand great beings, and he says:

"Medicine King, you see this great crowd gathered here? You see all these countless heavenly beings, dragon-kings, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas? You see the human folks and the non-human folks? You see the monks and nuns, the lay brothers and lay sisters? You see those seeking to be voice-hearers, those seeking solitary enlightenment, those seeking the Buddha-way?

"Listen now: Every single one of these people—if they hear even one verse, even one sentence of this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra while standing here before me, if they feel even one moment of joy rising in their hearts—I'm giving them all a prophecy right now. Every last one. They all gonna reach that supreme perfect enlightenment. All of them. No exceptions."

[AFTER THE BUDDHA'S GONE]

Then the Buddha says to Medicine King:

"Now let me tell you about after I'm gone, after I leave this world. If there's anybody who hears this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra—even just one verse, just one sentence—and feels one moment of joy in their heart, I'm giving them that prophecy too. They gonna reach that supreme perfect enlightenment.

"And if there's people who receive and uphold this sutra, who read it, recite it, explain it to others, copy it down—even if it's just one verse—if they look at this scripture with reverence like they looking at the Buddha himself, if they make offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners and flags, clothing, music, even just bringing their palms together in respect—

"Medicine King, you need to know: These people already served ten thousand billion Buddhas in the past. They already made great vows in the presence of all those Buddhas. Out of compassion for suffering beings, they chose to be born here in this human world. They came here on purpose."

[WHO'S GONNA BE A BUDDHA?]

"Medicine King, if somebody asks you, 'Which beings are gonna become Buddhas in the future?'—you should point to these people right here. Point to the ones who receive and uphold this Lotus Sutra. You should say: 'These people right here, they gonna become Buddhas in the future world. Guaranteed.'

"Why? Because if good men or good women receive even one sentence of the Lotus Sutra, if they uphold it, read it, recite it, explain it, copy it down, if they make offerings to the scripture-scroll with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners and flags, clothing, music, bringing their palms together in reverence—

"These people deserve the respect of the whole world. You should honor them the same way you honor the Buddha himself. You need to know: This person is a great bodhisattva. They already accomplished that supreme perfect enlightenment. Out of pity for suffering beings, they chose to be born here in this world to widely proclaim and explain this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra.

"How much more so for someone who can receive the whole thing, who makes all kinds of offerings? That person is beyond measure."

[THEY GAVE UP PARADISE TO BE HERE]

"Medicine King, you need to understand something: These people gave up their clean, pure rewards. After I'm gone, out of compassion for suffering beings, they chose to be born in this evil world just to spread this sutra far and wide.

"If a good man or good woman, after I'm gone, can secretly teach even one person even one sentence of the Lotus Sutra—you need to know this person is sent by the Buddha himself. The Buddha dispatched them. They're doing the Buddha's own work.

"How much more so for someone who teaches it broadly to the crowds?"

[DON'T YOU DARE BADMOUTH THE TEACHERS]

"Medicine King, listen to this: If there's an evil person with a bad heart who stands before the Buddha for a whole eon—a whole cosmic age—and constantly curses the Buddha, insults him, speaks against him—well, that sin is still relatively light.

"But if somebody speaks even one evil word, one bad word, against someone who reads and recites the Lotus Sutra—whether they're a monk or a laywoman, whether they left home or still got a home—if you badmouth a teacher of this sutra, that sin is far, far heavier. You hear me? Far heavier."

[HONOR THEM LIKE BUDDHA HIMSELF]

"Medicine King, anyone who reads and recites the Lotus Sutra—you need to know this person is adorned with the Buddha's own adornment. They're carried on the Buddha's own shoulders. The Buddha himself is carrying them.

"Wherever they go, you should turn toward them and bow. You should bring your palms together with single-minded focus. You should honor them, serve them, respect them, praise them. Offer them flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners and flags, clothing, fine food, make music for them. Bring them the best offerings that humans can bring, the finest you got. You should scatter heavenly treasures on them. You should present them with collections of heavenly jewels.

"Why? Why all this honor?

"Because this person joyfully teaches the Dharma. If you hear them for just a moment, just a little while, you immediately reach the ultimate—that supreme perfect enlightenment. That's why."

[THE BUDDHA SINGS IT]

At that time, the World-Honored One, wanting to say this again so it sinks down deep, sings it out in verse:

If you want to walk the Buddha-road,
If you want to gain that natural wisdom-load,
You better constantly make offerings, I'm telling you true,
To those who receive and uphold this sutra, through and through.

If you want to quickly gain
All-种-wisdom, that's the highest plane,
You should receive and hold this scripture tight,
And honor those who hold it day and night.

If there's anybody who can receive and uphold
This Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra of old,
You need to know they're sent by the Buddha himself,
Came here out of pity for suffering, not for wealth.

Those who can receive and uphold this teaching here,
This Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra so dear,
They left their pure lands behind, you see,
Came to this world out of compassion, born to set us free.

You need to know people like this,
They got freedom to be born wherever they wish,
They can choose to come to this evil world,
To widely proclaim this supreme Dharma, let it be unfurled.

You should make offerings with heavenly flowers and incense sweet,
Heavenly jeweled clothing, lay it at their feet,
Heavenly collections of wonderful treasures, the finest kind,
To honor those who teach this Dharma to humankind.

After I'm gone, in that evil world to come,
If there's anybody can uphold this sutra, even some,
You should bring your palms together and bow down low,
Honor them like you honor the World-Honored One, you know.

Bring them the finest food, the sweetest tastes,
All kinds of clothing, nothing gone to waste,
Make offerings to this child of Buddha with everything you got,
Hoping just to hear them teach a little, just a single thought.

If there's somebody in the future world
Who can receive and uphold this sutra that's been unfurled,
I'm sending them among the people, that's where they belong,
To carry on the Buddha's work, to sing the Buddha's song.

If for a whole eon long
Somebody harbors a heart that's wrong,
Makes ugly faces and curses the Buddha to his face,
That person's sin is heavy, but it ain't the worst disgrace.

But if somebody reads, recites, and holds
This Lotus Sutra, precious as gold,
And you speak evil against them, even for a little bit,
That sin is heavier than the first—remember it.

If there's somebody seeking Buddha's way
Who for a whole eon, every single day,
Stands before me with palms together, praising me
With countless verses, honoring what they see—

They get immeasurable merit from praising Buddha so,
But if you praise someone who upholds this sutra, you should know,
The blessings you receive surpass even that,
They're greater than all those praises—now how about that?

For eighty billion eons long,
If you make offerings with your sweetest song,
With the finest colors, sounds, fragrances, tastes, and touches too,
To someone who upholds this sutra, honoring what they do—

After making all those offerings, precious and refined,
If you get to hear this sutra for just a moment's time,
You should rejoice and celebrate, count yourself blessed:
"I have gained great benefit today, I have truly been caressed!"

Medicine King, I'm telling you plain,
Of all the sutras I've taught again and again,
All the scriptures I've already spoken, am speaking now, will speak later on,
Among all of them, this Lotus Sutra is the jewel, the crown.

[THE RAREST TEACHING]

At that time the Buddha spoke again to Medicine King Bodhisattva Mahāsattva:

"The scriptures I have taught are countless—thousands, ten thousands, billions. The ones I've already spoken, the ones I'm speaking now, the ones I will speak in the future—among all of them, this Lotus Sutra is the most difficult to believe, the most difficult to understand.

"Medicine King, this sutra is the secret treasury of all the Buddhas. It's the treasure-room, the locked vault. You can't just hand it out, can't just pass it around carelessly to anybody. This is what all the Buddhas in all the worlds have guarded and protected from ancient times until now. This teaching has never been revealed openly before.

"And this sutra—even while the Buddha is still alive, still in the world, there's plenty of hatred toward it, plenty of jealousy. How much more so after the Buddha's gone?"

[THE BUDDHA'S COVERING, THE BUDDHA'S HAND, THE BUDDHA'S BED]

"Medicine King, you need to know: After the Buddha leaves this world, if there's people who can copy this sutra, uphold it, read it, recite it, make offerings to it, explain it to others—the Buddha himself will cover them with his robe. He'll wrap them up, keep them safe.

"And they'll be protected and thought of by all the Buddhas in other lands, Buddhas who are alive right now in those worlds. These people got great faith-power, great will-power, great roots of goodness.

"You need to know: These people sleep in the same room as the Buddha. The Buddha himself lays his hand on their heads. He touches them."

[WHEREVER THIS SUTRA IS, BUILD A STUPA]

"Medicine King, wherever this sutra is spoken, wherever it's read, wherever it's recited, wherever it's copied down, wherever the scripture-scroll stays—in all those places you should build a stupa made of seven precious materials. Make it extremely high, extremely wide, extremely decorated and beautiful.

"You don't need to put relics in it. You hear me? No need for relics.

"Why? Because this sutra right here already contains the Buddha's whole body. The complete body is already in there.

"This stupa should receive offerings of all kinds of flowers, incense, necklaces, silk canopies, banners and flags, music and singing. People should make offerings, show reverence, honor it, praise it.

"If anybody sees this stupa, bows to it, makes offerings to it—you need to know all these people are getting close to that supreme perfect enlightenment. They're almost there."

[IF YOU CAN'T FIND THIS SUTRA, YOU AIN'T REALLY WALKING THE BODHISATTVA PATH]

"Medicine King, there's a lot of people—whether they left home or still got a home—who say they're walking the bodhisattva path. But if they can't see this sutra, can't hear it, can't read it, can't recite it, can't copy it, can't uphold it, can't make offerings to it—you need to know these people haven't really walked the bodhisattva path the right way. They ain't doing it properly.

"But if there's beings who hear this sutra-teaching, who truly hear it—then they know how to walk the bodhisattva path the right way.

"Any being who's seeking the Buddha-way—if they see this Lotus Sutra or hear it, and after hearing it they believe it, understand it, receive it, uphold it—you need to know this person is getting close to that supreme perfect enlightenment. They're almost home."

[THE PARABLE: DIGGING FOR WATER]

"Medicine King, it's like this—imagine there's a person who's thirsty, desperate for water, needs it bad. So they go up on a high plateau, a high dry place, and they start digging, searching for water, working for it.

"At first they just see dry soil, dusty dirt. They know the water's still far off, still way down there.

"But they don't give up. They keep working, keep applying effort, don't quit. After a while they start seeing damp soil, wet dirt. Then gradually they hit mud.

"Their heart becomes certain, becomes settled. They know for sure: Water's definitely close now. It's right there.

"It's the same way with bodhisattvas. If they haven't heard this Lotus Sutra, haven't understood it, haven't been able to practice and cultivate it—you need to know these people are still far from that supreme perfect enlightenment. The water's still way down there.

"But if they hear it, understand it, think about it deeply, practice and cultivate it—then you can be certain, you can know for sure they're close to that supreme perfect enlightenment. The water's right there.

"Why? Because all bodhisattvas' supreme perfect enlightenment belongs to this sutra. This sutra opens the gate of skillful means. It reveals the true mark of reality. This Lotus Sutra treasury is deep, solid, hidden, distant. Nobody can reach it on their own.

"But now the Buddha teaches it, helps beings mature, brings bodhisattvas to completion, and opens it up for them. Shows them what's been hidden."

[NEW BODHISATTVAS MIGHT GET SCARED—THAT'S OKAY]

"Medicine King, if there's a bodhisattva who hears this Lotus Sutra and gets startled, doubtful, frightened—you need to know that's a brand-new bodhisattva, just started out. That's normal for beginners.

"If a voice-hearer, a disciple, hears this sutra and gets startled, doubtful, frightened—you need to know that's someone full of pride. That's arrogance talking."

[HOW TO TEACH THIS SUTRA: THE THREE GARMENTS]

"Medicine King, if a good man or good woman wants to teach this Lotus Sutra to the four assemblies after the Buddha's gone—how should they teach it? How should they do it?

"This good man or good woman needs to enter the Buddha's room, wear the Buddha's robe, sit on the Buddha's seat. Only then should they widely teach this sutra to the four assemblies.

"What's the Buddha's room? Great compassion for all beings—that's the Buddha's room.

"What's the Buddha's robe? Gentleness and patience—that's the Buddha's robe.

"What's the Buddha's seat? The emptiness of all things—that's the Buddha's seat.

"Settle yourself in these three. Establish yourself there. Then, with a heart that doesn't slack off, doesn't get lazy, teach this Lotus Sutra to the bodhisattvas and the four assemblies. Teach it wide."

[THE BUDDHA'S PROMISE: I'LL SEND YOU AN AUDIENCE]

"Medicine King, when I'm in other lands, other countries, I'll send magical people, conjured-up people, to gather an audience to hear the Dharma. I'll send magical monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen to listen to the teaching.

"These magical people, they'll hear the Dharma, believe it, receive it, follow it, not oppose it.

"If the teacher's in a secluded place, an empty quiet place, I'll send a whole host at that time—heavenly dragons, ghosts and spirits, gandharvas, asuras, all kinds of beings—to listen to the teaching.

"Even though I'm in another land, another country, I'll make sure the teacher sees me from time to time. If they forget a line of the sutra, forget the words, I'll appear and tell them again, help them get it complete."

[THE BUDDHA SINGS IT AGAIN]

At that time the World-Honored One, wanting to state this meaning again, sings it in verse:

If you want to cast off laziness,
Want to leave all slacking behind,
You should listen to this sutra here,
This sutra's hard to hear, hard to find.

Those who believe and receive it—
They're hard to find too, you see,
Like a person thirsty for water
Digging on a plateau, digging to get free.

Even when they see dry dusty soil,
They know the water's still far below,
But gradually they see damp dirt and mud,
They know for certain the water's close, they know.

Medicine King, you need to understand,
These people are like that, every one:
If they never heard the Lotus Sutra,
They're far from Buddha-wisdom, far from the sun.

But if they hear this deep sutra here,
This teaching that clarifies the voice-hearer's way,
This king of all the sutras,
And after hearing it they think on it, meditate and pray—

You need to know these people
Are close to Buddha-wisdom, getting near,
If somebody teaches this sutra to others,
They should enter the Buddha's room without fear.

They should put on the Buddha's robe,
Sit down on the Buddha's seat,
Then face the crowd without being scared,
Widely explain it, make the teaching complete.

Great compassion—that's the room,
Gentleness and patience—that's the robe you wear,
The emptiness of all things—that's the seat,
Settle in these and teach from there.

If while you're teaching this sutra
Somebody comes with an evil mouth to curse,
With swords and sticks and stones to attack,
Remember the Buddha and bear it—don't rehearse.

In thousands of millions of billions of lands
I show my pure and solid body still,
For countless billions of eons
I teach the Dharma to beings, that's my will.

After I'm gone from this world,
If there's somebody who can teach this sutra true,
I'll send four magical assemblies—
Monks and nuns, laymen and women too—

To make offerings to this Dharma-teacher,
To guide and gather the crowds all around,
To bring the beings together
So they can hear this teaching, hear this sound.

If people want to do evil,
Come with swords and sticks and stones to harm,
I'll send magical people to appear
To guard and protect them, keep them from alarm.

If the teacher's all alone,
In a secluded empty place somewhere,
Quiet and still with no human voices,
Reading and reciting this scripture there—

At that time I'll appear for them,
Show them my pure bright shining form,
If they forget a line or phrase,
I'll tell them again, help them perform.

If somebody has these virtues,
Whether teaching the four assemblies or alone,
Reading and reciting in empty places—
They all get to see me, get to see my throne.

If somebody's in a secluded spot,
I'll send heavenly dragon-kings their way,
Yakṣas, ghosts and spirits,
To be their Dharma-listening audience that day.

This person loves to teach the Dharma,
Explains it clearly without any block,
Because all the Buddhas protect and remember them,
They can make the great crowd rejoice, the whole flock.

If you stay close to a Dharma-teacher,
You'll quickly gain the bodhisattva way,
Follow and learn from this teacher,
You'll see Buddhas like Ganges sands one day.

**TRANSLATOR'S NOTES:**

This chapter is about honoring the carriers of wisdom, the teachers and preachers and truth-speakers who keep the word alive. In the blues/gospel tradition, there's deep reverence for those who carry the song forward, who keep the story going, who stand up and testify even when it's hard. This translation tries to honor that tradition.

**Key Interpretive Choices:**

**The Title:** "Honor the Word-Carriers" captures the chapter's essence—this is about respecting those who carry, protect, and transmit the teaching.

**Central Metaphors:**
- "Digging for water on a plateau" - Preserved this parable exactly because it's already perfect. The progression from dry soil → damp soil → mud → water is universal human experience. Anyone who's ever dug a well, planted a garden, searched for something underground knows this progression. The metaphor teaches: signs of progress matter; persistence pays off; you can tell you're getting close before you arrive.

- "The Buddha's room, robe, and seat" - Kept these concrete, physical metaphors. Great compassion is a room you enter. Gentleness is a robe you put on. Emptiness is a seat you sit down on. These aren't abstract concepts—they're actions you take before you start teaching.

- "Carried on the Buddha's shoulders" - A powerful image of being supported, held up, borne along by the Buddha himself.

**The Five Practices:**
The chapter emphasizes five ways of engaging with the sutra:
1. Receiving and upholding (受持)
2. Reading (讀)
3. Reciting (誦)
4. Explaining (解說)
5. Copying (書寫)

I preserved all five explicitly because each one matters. This isn't just about passive reception—it's about active engagement, transmission, embodiment.

**Voice and Tone:**
- Direct address throughout: "You need to know," "Listen now," "You hear me?"
- Repetition for emphasis: "Far, far heavier," "Every last one," "Countless"
- The Buddha speaks with authority but also intimacy—he's teaching, but he's also pleading with people to honor those who carry the word
- Used "ain't" and "gonna" sparingly but strategically for rhythm and emphasis

**The Warning Section:**
The sharp contrast between cursing the Buddha (lighter sin) and badmouthing a teacher of the sutra (heavier sin) is shocking—and meant to be. I kept that shock. This teaching says: The living carriers of wisdom are more vulnerable and thus deserve more protection than the Buddha himself. Don't you dare speak against the preachers, the teachers, the word-carriers.

**Key Theological Points Preserved:**

1. **Universal accessibility**: "Even one verse, even one moment of joy" = enlightenment is promised to all
2. **Teachers are already enlightened**: They chose to be born here out of compassion
3. **The sutra contains Buddha's whole body**: No relics needed where this teaching is
4. **Buddha's ongoing protection**: He sends magical audiences, appears to help teachers who forget lines
5. **Rarity and preciousness**: This teaching is harder to find than water in the desert
6. **The three garments formula**: Compassion (room) + Patience (robe) + Emptiness (seat) = how to teach

**Structural Choices:**
- Maintained prose/verse alternation
- Verses are singable, with rhythm and internal rhyme where natural
- Used rhetorical questions for engagement
- Employed call-and-response patterns in places ("You hear me?" "That's why.")

**The Chapter's Heart:**
This is ultimately about the sanctity of transmission, the holiness of teaching, the honor due to those who carry truth forward. In blues/gospel tradition, the preacher, the singer, the testifier, the one who stands up and speaks the word—these people are sacred. They deserve protection, respect, offerings, gratitude. This chapter says the same thing in Buddhist terms.

The water-seeker parable is the perfect center: We're all thirsty. We're all digging. The teacher is the one who's hit mud, who knows the water's close, who can tell you to keep digging right there. Honor them. Listen to them. They're showing you where to find what you're desperate for.
