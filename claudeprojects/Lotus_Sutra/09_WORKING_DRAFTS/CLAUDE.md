## Translation Conventions

### Character Names and Diacritical Marks

**Critical**: Preserve exact Sanskrit diacritical marks when editing:
- Śāriputra (not Sariputra)
- Mahākāśyapa, Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara
- Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya, Pūrṇa-Maitrāyaṇīputra
- Key diacritics: ś (U+015B), ṇ (U+1E47), ū (U+016B), ā (U+0101), ṃ (U+1E43)

### Technical Terminology

**Consistent capitalization patterns:**
- Dharma (teachings/law) vs. dharma (phenomena/things)
- Buddha (the historical Buddha) vs. buddha (awakened being)
- Tathagata, Bodhisattva, Arhat - always capitalized

**Standard terms:**
- Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi (supreme perfect enlightenment)
- nirvāṇa, samādhi, dhāraṇī
- śrāvaka (hearer/disciple), pratyekabuddha (solitary realizer)

### Formulaic Expressions

**Opening formula:**
"Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying..."

**Verse transition formula:**
"At that time, [Speaker], wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:"

**Buddha's ten epithets** - Used in formal contexts:
Tathagata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One

## Editing Guidelines

### When Modifying Translation Files

1. **Encoding**: All files use UTF-8 - ensure editor preserves Unicode characters
2. **Line references**: Cite by line number from source file when discussing passages
3. **Consistency**: Check parallel passages for terminology consistency across chapters
4. **Tone**: Maintain elevated, formal Buddhist scriptural register
5. **Formulaic language**: Preserve standard opening formulas and transitions

### Stylistic Considerations

**Appropriate:**
- Formal, reverent tone befitting sacred scripture
- Traditional Buddhist terminology with consistent English equivalents
- Poetic but dignified language in verse sections

**Avoid:**
- Modern colloquialisms or contractions (unless in Blues Translation)
- Inconsistent rendering of technical terms
- Over-interpretation or explanatory additions to the source text

## File Encoding and Display

- All .txt files use UTF-8 encoding
- Sanskrit diacriticals appear throughout all English translations
- Chinese source text requires UTF-8 compatible display
- Ensure editors preserve Unicode characters during any modifications

## Translation Philosophy

This project follows traditional Buddhist sutra translation principles:
- Fidelity to Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese rendering
- Preservation of formulaic repetitions characteristic of oral transmission
- Balance between literal accuracy and readable English
- Maintenance of religious register appropriate to sacred text
