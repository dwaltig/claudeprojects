The Buddhist Blues Spiritual Platform - Complete Vision
This document outlines the complete vision for the "Buddhist Blues Spiritual Platform," a multi-faceted project dedicated to sharing wisdom and contemplative practices through various media.
1. About the Artist
William Altig is a Buddhist musician, artist, and practitioner with over twenty years of experience in Buddhist studies. He has dedicated more than a decade to a deep, artistic engagement with the Lotus Sutra and its associated texts.
Altig’s work uniquely combines a scholarly understanding of Buddhist philosophy with a profound expertise in American vernacular spiritual traditions, particularly blues and gospel music. This synthesis has culminated in the Lotus Sutra Trilogy in Blues, a groundbreaking blues interpretation of three core Mahayana texts, which he has also set to music as a ‘Buddhist Blues Opera.’
With a significant online following of over 2,500 listeners and a catalog of more than 3,000 songs, Altig has cultivated a vibrant community at the intersection of Dharma and music. This trilogy is his landmark work, making the radical message of universal enlightenment accessible to a new generation of seekers. He currently resides in Houston, TX.
William Altig's daily contemplative practice centers on this traditional three-sutra cycle: reading one chapter of the Lotus Sutra for 28 days, then alternating between the Immeasurable Meanings Sutra and Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra. This creative project emerged from and serves to deepen this lifelong spiritual practice.
2. Published Volumes (Done, Ready)
The foundation of the platform consists of three core published volumes, interpreted into contemporary blues vernacular and following the traditional Mahayana Buddhist reading order. All three volumes are professionally polished and publication-ready.
* Volume 1: The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra (prologue and foundational teaching)
* Volume 2: The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma (the central teaching, 28 chapters, 190,000 words)
* Volume 3: Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra (commitment and practice guidance)
Together, these three texts form a complete monthly contemplative practice cycle. The creator's personal contemplative practice follows the traditional pattern: reading one chapter of the Lotus Sutra for 28 consecutive days, then alternating between the Immeasurable Meanings Sutra and Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra during the remaining days of the month. This creates a complete monthly spiritual practice cycle that practitioners worldwide can adopt.
3. Audio Versions (In Progress)
To make the published works more accessible, audio versions of the three volumes are in production. This initiative aims to reach a broader audience, including those who prefer auditory learning or are visually impaired. These versions, featuring Maya Angelou's voice, are scheduled for completion by
$$January 1, 2026$$
.
4. Illustrated Children's Books (Planned)
A series of illustrated children's books is planned to adapt the core themes and parables from the platform's teachings for a younger audience. The goal is to introduce concepts of wisdom and compassion in an engaging, age-appropriate format. The series is planned for
$$2026$$
.
5. Dhammapada Interpretation (Planned)
A new interpretation of the Dhammapada is planned. This project will aim to render the classic text in a fresh, modern, and accessible (perhaps "blues")-inflected verse, aligning it with the platform's unique voice and perspective.
6. Contemplative Practice App (In Development)
A mobile application is currently in-development to serve as a digital hub for the platform, offering users tools for contemplative practice. The app is scheduled for
$$2026$$
. Features will likely include:
* Guided meditations (possibly featuring "Buddhist Blues" music)
* Daily readings or verses
* A journal for reflection
* Community features to connect with other practitioners
This comprehensive digital ecosystem will make the 28-day practice cycle accessible to practitioners globally.
7. Pitch: The Foundational Trilogy (The Blues & The Dharma)
"The blues and the Dharma come from the same place: a deep, honest look at the truth of suffering and a rugged path to get free.
I'm a musician, and I've spent the last ten years putting those two truths together. I've rendered the complete Mahayana canon—the core trilogy—into the language that understands this journey best: the blues.
This isn't just a translation; it's a re-voicing. It's the sound of struggle, redemption, and human dignity. All three volumes are polished and ready for publication:
* Volume 1: The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra (The Prologue)
* Volume 2: The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma (The Core Teaching, 190,000 words)
* Volume 3: Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra (The Practice)
This is a decade of my life, my music, and my practice, already resonating with thousands of listeners. I'm not just looking for a publisher; I'm looking for a partner who hears the music in this and understands this is a major cultural and spiritual offering for a world that's hurting and needs to hear it."
8. Pitch: The Complete Platform (The Spiritual Home)
"This isn't just about a book deal. I'm building a complete spiritual home.
It's a practice platform built on the traditional three-sutra cycle that has been my own lifeline, my personal rhythm, for years. I've lived this path. Now, I'm inviting others to join.
The books are the foundation. The audio versions (featuring Maya Angelou's voice), the children's books, and the practice app are the walls and the roof.
I'm offering a complete system for practitioners to walk this path, guided by a voice they can understand—the blues vernacular—and supported by a daily digital guide that walks the 28-day cycle with them. I'm seeking partners who want to build this home with me, not just sell the blueprints."
9. Pitch: Vision Summary (The Single Chord)
"Here's the vision in a single chord: I'm offering a complete, living practice cycle.
It starts with the three-volume 'blues canon'—the Prologue (Immeasurable Meanings), the Core Teaching (Lotus Sutra), and the Practice (Universal Worthy)—all publication-ready.
But the books are just the beginning. They're the sheet music for a whole spiritual ecosystem: audio versions to hear the truth, children's books to pass it on, and a practice app to live it every single day.
I'm looking for partners who see the whole picture and want to build this platform with me, starting with the foundational trilogy."
