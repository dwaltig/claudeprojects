The Parable of the Prodigal Son - A Blues Story of Coming Home


Now listen here, 'cause this is how it went down:

When the Buddha had finished speaking them words, old Subhūti and Mahākātyāyana and Mahākāśyapa and Mahāmaudgalyāyana - they heard something they never heard before. The World-Honored One had just told Śāriputra he was gonna be a Buddha, gonna get that supreme perfect enlightenment, and these four old men - they felt something rare stir up in their hearts. Joy came bubbling up like a spring. They stood up from where they was sitting, straightened out their robes, bared that right shoulder the way you do when you showing respect, dropped down on their right knee, put their palms together, bowed down low, and looked up at the Buddha's face. And they said:

"Lord, we're the eldest ones here, the heads of this congregation. We're old now, getting on in years. We thought we'd made it to the end of the road - thought we'd reached nirvāṇa, that final rest. We figured we wasn't capable of nothing more, wasn't no use trying for that supreme perfect enlightenment no more.

"World-Honored One, when you was preaching all them years past, I was sitting right there in the assembly. But my body got tired, my mind got weary. I just kept thinking about emptiness and signlessness and wishlessness - them three doors to liberation. As for all that Bodhisattva business - playing in supernatural powers, purifying Buddha lands, bringing beings to ripeness - that didn't make my heart sing none. Know why? 'Cause you, World-Honored One, you already brought us out of the three realms of suffering, gave us the certificate of nirvāṇa. And we're old now, getting ancient. When you was teaching them Bodhisattvas about that supreme perfect enlightenment, we didn't feel one spark of desire for it in our hearts.

"But now - oh, now! - we standing here before the Buddha, and we heard you give us hearers that prophecy of supreme perfect enlightenment, and our hearts is full of joy, overflowing with something we never felt before. We never expected this. We never thought that on this day, all of a sudden, we'd hear this rare teaching, this precious thing. We're congratulating ourselves, celebrating deep down, 'cause we done received this great good fortune. We got these infinite treasures - and we wasn't even looking for them. They just came to us on their own."


THE PARABLE OF THE PRODIGAL SON: A BLUES STORY

"World-Honored One, we got a story to tell, a parable to make this meaning clear. Let us lay it out for you:

Once there was a young man, just a boy really, didn't know no better. He up and left his father's house, ran away from home, went wandering off to a far country. And he stayed gone - ten years, twenty years, might've been fifty years. Time got away from him.

As the years rolled by, the boy grew into a man, but he fell on hard times. Got poor. Got desperate. He was running from place to place, chasing after his next meal, looking for clothes to cover his back. He kept drifting, wandering, and wouldn't you know it - his footsteps led him back toward his home country, though he didn't even know it.

Now his father - the father had been looking for that boy all along. Looked everywhere, couldn't find him. Finally the old man settled down in one city to wait. And that father? He got rich. I mean RICH. His house was overflowing with treasure - gold and silver, lapis lazuli and coral and amber and crystal and pearls. His storehouses was so full they was about to burst. He had servants by the dozens, officials and administrators and workers, elephants and horses, carriages and oxen and sheep - couldn't even count them all. His business dealings spread out across other countries, merchants and traders coming and going, crowds of people everywhere.

Meanwhile that poor wandering son - he was going through villages and towns, drifting from country to country, and he came right to the city where his father lived. Didn't even know it was home.

Now the father, he'd been thinking about that boy every day for fifty-some years. Never told nobody about it. Just kept it inside, thinking and mourning, full of regret. He'd say to himself: 'I'm getting old now. I got all this wealth - gold and silver and jewels, storehouses overflowing - but I ain't got no heir, no son to pass it to. One day I'm gonna die, and all this wealth gonna scatter to the wind, won't have nobody to leave it to.' That thought was eating him up inside. He kept remembering his son, couldn't stop thinking about him.

And he'd say to himself: 'If I could just find my boy, if I could just pass all this wealth on to him, then I could rest easy. I could be at peace. Wouldn't have nothing to worry about no more.'


THE SON COMES HOME - BUT HE DON'T KNOW IT

"World-Honored One, this is how it went:

That poor son was hiring himself out for day labor, going wherever the work was. And his wandering feet brought him right to his father's mansion. He stopped outside the gate, standing off to the side.

From where he stood, he could see through them gates. He saw his father sitting on a lion throne, a jeweled footstool under his feet. Brahmins and nobles and householders all around him, showing respect, surrounding him with honor. The old man was draped in pearl necklaces worth ten million, all kinds of jewels adorning his body. Officials and servants stood on his left and right, holding white whisks, attending to him. Above him was a canopy made of precious things, silk banners hanging down. They'd sprinkled scented water on the ground, scattered rare flowers everywhere. Treasures was being brought in and taken out, transactions happening, all kinds of magnificent decorations. The old man's authority was powerful, his dignity was overwhelming.

The poor son saw all this, saw his father wielding all that power, and fear grabbed hold of his heart. He regretted coming to this place. He thought to himself: 'This must be a king, or somebody equal to a king. This ain't no place for a man like me to hire out his labor and earn his keep. Better I go to some poor neighborhood where a man can work with his hands, where food is easy to come by. If I stay here too long, they might force me to work, might press me into service against my will.'

Soon as he thought that, he turned around and ran. Ran fast as he could.


THE FATHER SEES HIS SON

"Now the rich old man was sitting up on that lion throne, and he saw the boy. Recognized him immediately. His heart exploded with joy. He thought to himself: 'NOW I got somebody to inherit all my wealth and treasures and storehouses! I been thinking about this child day and night, had no way to see him, and now he just showed up on his own - this is exactly what I been praying for! I'm old now, getting ancient, but I still care about all this wealth, still want to pass it on.'

Right away he sent people running after the boy. 'Go quick!' he said. 'Bring him back!'

The servants ran after that poor son and grabbed hold of him.

The boy was startled, terrified. He started yelling: 'I ain't done nothing to you! Why you grabbing me? I didn't do nothing wrong!'

But the servants held on tighter, dragged him back by force.

That poor son, he was thinking to himself: 'I'm innocent, I ain't committed no crime, and they got me like a prisoner - they must be fixing to kill me!' The fear got worse and worse until he fainted dead away, fell out on the ground.

The father saw all this from a distance. He told the servants: 'I don't need this man brought in by force. Let him go. Sprinkle cold water on his face so he wakes up, but don't say nothing else to him.'

Why'd the father do that? 'Cause he knew his son's spirit was beaten down low. He knew his own wealth and power was frightening to the boy. He knew for certain this was his child, but he used skillful means - he didn't tell nobody else, 'This is my son.'

The servants said to the boy: 'You free to go now. Go wherever you want.'

That poor son - he was happy as he'd ever been. He got up off the ground and headed straight for the poor part of town to look for food and work.


THE FATHER'S PLAN - SKILLFUL MEANS

"Now the old man, he wanted to draw his son back home, so he set up a plan, used skillful means. He secretly sent two men - men who looked poor and worn down, didn't have no impressive appearance. He told them: 'Go find that poor man and tell him gently: We got work here, and we'll pay you double wages. If he agrees, bring him here to work. If he asks what kind of work, tell him: We'll hire you to clear away dung and trash. Tell him we'll be working right alongside him.'

So them two men went and found the poor son. When they found him, they laid out the whole proposition.

The poor son, he agreed to the price right away and came along to shovel dung.

The father saw his son doing this work, and his heart hurt for him. He felt pity and wonder at the same time.

Then one day, the father looked out through a window and saw his son's body - thin and worn down, covered in dust and dung, filthy and pitiful.

Right then, the father took off his pearl necklaces, took off his fine soft robes and all his ornaments. He put on rough, dirty, tattered clothes, covered himself in dust. He took a dung-shoveling tool in his right hand, made himself look scared and humble. Then he went out to where the workers was and said: 'Y'all work hard now, don't be lazy.'

This was skillful means, so he could get close to his son.

After a while, he spoke to his son directly. Said: 'Hey there, young man. You stay here and keep working, don't go nowhere else. I'll raise your wages. Whatever you need - pots and pans, rice flour, salt and vinegar - don't hesitate to ask. I got some old servants here, too - if you need anything, they'll provide it. Put your mind at ease. I'm like a father to you, don't you worry about nothing.

'Why do I say that? 'Cause I'm old now, and you're young and strong. Long as you been working here, you ain't never been lazy or deceitful, ain't never been angry or resentful or complained. I don't see in you none of them bad qualities I see in other workers. From this day forward, you like a son born to me.'

Right then and there, the old man gave the boy a new name, called him 'son.'

Now the poor son - he was glad about this, but deep down he still thought of himself as just a hired hand, a lowly worker. And so it went for twenty years - the father kept him cleaning out dung and trash.

After them twenty years passed, they'd built up trust between them, and the son could come and go freely in the house. But even so, he still lived in his same place, that little shack outside.


THE FATHER GETS READY TO PASS IT ON

"World-Honored One, then the time came when the old man got sick. He knew death wasn't far off. He said to the poor son: 'I got a lot of gold and silver and jewels, and my storehouses is overflowing. You know how much is in there, what needs to be brought in and taken out - you know all about it. This is what I want - you need to understand my heart in this. Why am I telling you? 'Cause now, you and me ain't no different. You need to pay careful attention so nothing gets lost or wasted.'

Right away the poor son received these instructions. He took charge of all them goods - gold and silver and jewels and all them storehouses. But he didn't want to take not even one meal's worth for himself. He still lived in his same spot outside. That low-down feeling in his heart - he couldn't shake it, couldn't let it go.

Time passed. The father saw his son's mind was gradually opening up, growing bigger. His will was getting stronger, his aspirations was rising. He was starting to feel ashamed of how small he used to think.

When the father's death was getting close, he called his son to him. He gathered all his relatives, the king and his great ministers, the nobles and householders - got everybody together. Then he made this announcement:

'Gentlemen, listen here! This is my son, born from my own body. Years ago in a certain city, he left me and ran away. He wandered suffering and struggling for fifty-some years. His original name was such-and-such, and my name is such-and-such. Back in my home city, I was full of sorrow, searching everywhere for him. Then suddenly in this place, we met again and I found him. This truly is my son, and I truly am his father. Now everything I own - all my wealth and property - it all belongs to him. Everything that's been going in and out of the storehouses - he's known about all of it.'

World-Honored One, when the poor son heard his father say these words, his joy overflowed, burst out of him like he'd never known before. He thought to himself: 'Originally, I had no mind to hope for nothing, wasn't looking for nothing. But now all these treasures have come to me naturally, on their own!'


THE APPLICATION - THIS IS US

"World-Honored One, that rich old man - that's the Tathāgata. And we're all like Buddha's children. The Tathāgata has always been saying we are his sons.

"World-Honored One, because of the three kinds of suffering, we been burning up with torment in birth-and-death, confused and ignorant, attached to small teachings, loving little dharmas.

"But today the World-Honored One made us think, made us sweep away all that garbage of discriminating thoughts about dharmas. We worked hard at it, put in effort, and we reached nirvāṇa - got that one day's wages. Once we got that, our hearts was full of joy, and we thought we was satisfied. We said to ourselves: 'Because we worked so hard in the Buddha's teaching, we got a whole lot.'

"But the World-Honored One - he already knew our hearts was stuck on shabby little desires, loving them small teachings. So he just let us be, didn't try to force us. He didn't say to us: 'Y'all got a share in the Tathāgata's treasury of knowledge and vision.' The World-Honored One used skillful means to preach about the Tathāgata's wisdom. We followed the Buddha and got that one day's wages of nirvāṇa, and we thought it was a huge accomplishment. We had no ambition for this Great Vehicle.

"We also explained the Tathāgata's wisdom for the Bodhisattvas, opened it up and demonstrated it and taught it. But we ourselves had no aspiration for it. Why not? The Buddha knew our hearts loved small teachings, so he used skillful means and taught according to what we could handle. And we didn't know we was really Buddha's children.

"Now - NOW - we finally know: The World-Honored One don't hold back none of his Buddha-wisdom. Why we know that? Because all along, we really BEEN Buddha's children. It's just that we loved them small teachings. If we'd had minds that loved the great teachings, the Buddha would've preached the Great Vehicle to us.

"In this scripture, he only preaches the One Vehicle. But back in the day, in front of the Bodhisattvas, he used to criticize them hearers who loved small teachings. But really, the Buddha was teaching the Great Vehicle all along.

"That's why we're saying: Originally, we had no mind to hope for nothing, wasn't looking for nothing. But now the Dharma King's great treasure has come to us naturally, on its own. Everything that Buddha's children ought to receive - we done already received it all."


THE VERSES - MAHĀKĀŚYAPA SINGS IT AGAIN

Then Mahākāśyapa, wanting to say this meaning again, spoke in verse:

Today we heard
the Buddha's teaching voice,
Joy danced in us,
something we never knew before.

The Buddha said hearers
gonna become Buddhas -
this supreme treasure pile
came without us even asking.

It's like a young boy,
didn't know no better,
left his father's house,
wandered to a far-off land,

Drifted through countries
for fifty-some years.
His father mourned,
searched in every direction,

Searched till he was tired,
finally stopped in one city,
Built himself a house,
enjoyed the five desires.

That house was wealthy,
had gold and silver,
mother-of-pearl and agate,
genuine pearls and lapis lazuli,

Elephants, horses, cattle, sheep,
sedan chairs and carriages,
Farms and servants,
crowds of people everywhere,

His business dealings
spread to other countries,
Merchants and traders
was everywhere you looked,

Thousands and millions
surrounded him with respect,
The king himself
always held him dear,

Ministers and nobles
all honored him deeply.
For all these reasons,
crowds came and went,

Wealthy and powerful like this,
he had great influence.
But he was getting old,
and worrying about his son even more,

Morning and night thinking,
death was getting near:
'My foolish child left me
fifty-some years ago,

All these storehouses of goods -
what's gonna happen to them?'
Meanwhile the poor son
was searching for food and clothes,

Going from town to town,
from country to country,
Sometimes he got something,
sometimes he got nothing,

Hungry and starving and thin,
his body covered with sores,
Step by step he traveled
till he came to his father's city,

Hiring himself out along the way,
finally reached his father's house.
Right then the old man
was inside his gate,

Under a great jeweled canopy,
sitting on a lion throne,
Surrounded by his household,
people attending and guarding him,

Some was calculating
gold and silver treasures,
Recording incoming and outgoing wealth,
making notes on ledgers.

The poor son saw his father -
so wealthy and honorable and stern -
Thought he must be a king
or somebody equal to a king,

Got scared, startled at himself,
wondering why he came to this place.
He said to himself:
'If I stay here long,

I might get pressed into service,
forced to work against my will.'
Soon as he thought that,
he turned and ran away,

Asked directions to the poor part of town,
wanted to go hire himself out.
Right then the old man
was sitting on that lion throne,

Saw his son from a distance,
recognized him without saying a word,
Immediately told his servants:
'Go chase him down and bring him here!'

The poor son cried out in fear,
fainted and fell to the ground:
'This man grabbing me
must be fixing to kill me -

Why I need food and clothes
if they bringing me here to die?'
The old man knew his son
was foolish and narrow-minded,

Wouldn't believe what he said,
wouldn't believe he was the father.
So he used skillful means,
sent some other people instead,

One-eyed and ugly,
didn't have no impressive appearance:
'Tell him we'll hire him,
say we'll pay him wages,

To clear away dung and garbage,
we'll pay him double price.'
The poor son heard this
and came along, happy,

Cleared away the dung,
cleaned out all the rooms.
The old man from his window
kept watching his son,

Thought about the boy's foolishness,
how he enjoyed lowly work.
So the old man
put on shabby dirty clothes,

Picked up a dung-clearing tool,
went to where his son was,
Used skillful means to get close,
told him to work hard:

'I'll raise your wages,
put oil on your feet,
Give you plenty to eat,
thick warm bedding,

Like this' - rough words -
'you better work hard!'
Then gentle words:
'You like my own son.'

The old man was wise,
gradually let him come and go,
For twenty years
he handled household business,

Showed him the gold and silver,
genuine pearls and crystal,
All the goods coming in and out -
let him know about all of it.

But he still stayed outside the gate,
sleeping in a grass hut,
Thinking his poor thoughts:
'I don't own none of this.'

The father knew his son's mind
was gradually growing bigger,
Wanted to give him the wealth,
so he gathered his relatives,

The king and great ministers,
nobles and householders.
Before this great assembly
he said: 'This is my son,

He left me and went away
for fifty years.
Since I saw my son return,
it's been twenty years,

Long ago in a certain city
I lost this boy,
Went searching everywhere,
finally came to this place.

Everything I own -
house and people -
I'm giving it all to him,
let him use it as he wishes.'

The son remembered his past poverty,
his low-down mentality,
Now at his father's place
he received great treasures,

Including the house
and all the wealth,
He was filled with joy,
something he never knew before.

The Buddha's like that too,
knew I loved small things,
Never came right out and said:
'Y'all gonna be Buddhas.'

Instead he said we
attained the outflows-free state,
Accomplished the Small Vehicle,
disciples who are hearers.

The Buddha commanded us
to preach the supreme path:
'Those who cultivate this
will become Buddhas.'

We followed the Buddha's teaching,
preached to the great Bodhisattvas,
Using all kinds of causes and conditions,
various parables,

Many different words,
teaching the supreme path.
The Buddha's children
heard the Dharma from us,

Thought about it day and night,
practiced diligently,
Then the Buddhas
gave them their prophecies:

'In a future age
you'll become Buddhas.'
All the Buddhas'
secret treasury teachings,

They just preached them to Bodhisattvas,
taught the real truth,
But didn't preach to us
these essential teachings.

Like that poor son
who got close to his father -
Even though he knew about all the goods,
his heart didn't wish to take them.

We preached
the Buddha's Dharma treasury,
But had no aspiration ourselves -
it was just like that.

Inside ourselves, we extinguished afflictions,
thought that was enough,
Only understood this one thing,
didn't think there was nothing else.

When we heard about
purifying Buddha lands,
Teaching and transforming beings,
we had no joy in it at all.

Why was that?
All dharmas
Are completely empty and still,
no birth and no death,

No great and no small,
no outflows, no conditioned action.
Thinking like this,
we didn't feel no joy.

For long nights
in the Buddha's wisdom
We had no greed, no attachment,
no aspirations at all,

And concerning the Dharma for ourselves,
we thought that was the ultimate.
For long nights
we cultivated empty dharmas,

Got free from the three realms'
suffering and afflictions,
Dwelling in the final body,
the remainder-nirvāṇa.

The Buddha's teaching
achieved the Way without fail,
We thought we'd already
repaid the Buddha's kindness.

Even though we taught
the Buddha's children
The Bodhisattva Dharma
for seeking the Buddha Way,

Regarding this Dharma
we never had no wish or joy.
The Guide Teacher let us be,
observed our minds,

Never pushed us at first
to talk about real benefit.
Like that rich old man
who knew his son's will was low,

Used skillful means
to soften his heart,
Then after that
gave him all the wealth.

The Buddha's like that too,
showing rare wonders,
Knowing those who love small things,
using skillful means

To tame their minds,
then teaching great wisdom.
We today
got something we never had,

Never hoped for it before,
but now we got it ourselves,
Like that poor son
receiving infinite treasures.

World-Honored One, today
we got the Way, got the fruit,
In the outflows-free Dharma
we got pure eyes.

For long nights
we kept the Buddha's pure precepts,
Only today
we got the fruit of that,

In the Dharma King's Dharma
we cultivated the holy life for ages,
Now we attained the outflows-free,
supreme great fruit.

We today
are truly hearers,
With the Buddha Way's voice
making everyone hear.

We today
are true Arhats,
Among all the world's
people and gods, māras and Brahmās,

Universally among them
we should receive offerings.
The World-Honored One's great kindness,
using rare wonders,

Showing pity, teaching and transforming,
benefiting us -
Through infinite millions of eons,
who could repay this?

Serving with hands and feet,
bowing with head to ground,
Every kind of offering
can't repay it.

Even if we carried him on our heads,
bore him on both shoulders,
For Ganges' sands of eons,
with wholehearted reverence,

And also offered fine food,
infinite precious robes,
All kinds of bedding,
various medicines,

Ox-head sandalwood
and all kinds of jewels,
Building stupas and temples,
spreading precious cloth on the ground,

All these things
used for making offerings,
For Ganges' sands of eons,
still couldn't repay him.

The Buddhas are rare,
infinite and limitless,
Inconceivable,
great supernatural power,

Outflows-free and unconditioned,
kings of all dharmas,
Able for the sake of the lowly
to endure these matters,

Taking up ordinary people clinging to marks,
teaching according to what's appropriate.
The Buddhas in the Dharma
got complete freedom,

Knowing all beings'
various desires and joys,
And their will-power,
according to what they can handle,

Using infinite parables
to teach the Dharma for them,
According to beings'
past good roots,

Also knowing those who are ripe
and those not yet ripe,
Calculating in various ways,
discriminating and knowing,

On the One Vehicle path,
teaching three according to what's appropriate.

TRANSLATOR'S NOTES:

This blues vernacular rendering of the Prodigal Son parable preserves the emotional architecture of Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese while translating it into the idiom of the blues tradition - a tradition that knows intimately about leaving home, hard times, shame, fear, fathers who wait, and unexpected inheritance.

Key metaphorical choices:
- "One day's wages" for nirvāṇa - the limited payment that seemed like everything
- "Dung-shoveling" as the humble spiritual work the disciples thought was all they were fit for
- The father's patient skillful means shown through concrete gestures: changing clothes, picking up the shovel, working alongside
- The son's "low-down feeling" and "poverty consciousness" as psychological realism
- The inheritance "coming naturally" without seeking - grace, not achievement

The parable tracks the journey from:
- Self-imposed limitation → recognition of true identity
- Day laborer → heir
- Poverty consciousness → knowing the wealth was always yours
- Shame and fear → joy and homecoming

This is the blues truth: sometimes what's keeping us poor ain't the world - it's what we think about ourselves. And sometimes there's a father who's been waiting all along, ready to give us everything, soon as we ready to receive it.
