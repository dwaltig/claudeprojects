CHAPTER EIGHT: WHEN THE FIVE HUNDRED FINALLY HEARD THEIR NAMES CALLED

Blues Interpretation from Classical Chinese by Kumārajīva

Listen now, this is the story of how five hundred disciples found out they'd been carrying diamonds in their pockets all along.

THE PREACHER MAN FINALLY UNDERSTANDS

Now when Full Son heard all this - Full Son, that's Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra, best preacher man in the whole congregation - when he heard the Buddha laying out that wisdom, talking about how you got to meet folks where they are, speaking their language, teaching by whatever means it takes... and when he heard how the big-time disciples were getting their names called, getting told they gonna be Buddhas themselves someday... and when he heard about all the old-time connections, all that history stretching way back... and when he heard about how the Buddhas got more power and freedom than you can shake a stick at...

Man, something he never felt before washed over him. His heart got clean and jumped up in his chest. He rose right up from his seat, walked straight to the Buddha, bowed down low - put his whole face to the Buddha's feet, you know - then stepped back to one side. And he stood there looking at the Buddha's face, couldn't take his eyes off him for nothing. And he thought to himself:

"Lord have mercy, this World-Honored One is something else entirely. What he does is rare as hen's teeth. He knows how to reach all kinds of different folks, all their different ways of being. He's got this skillful knowing, this way of seeing, and he teaches to match it. He pulls people out of all the places they get stuck, all the things they grasp onto that keep 'em trapped. We can't even put words to all the Buddha's done. Only the Buddha himself knows what we been carrying deep down in our hearts all along, what we been wishing for since before we can remember."

THE BUDDHA CALLS OUT HIS BEST PREACHER

Now the Buddha turned to all the monks and said: "Y'all see this Full Son, this Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra? I been saying it all along - among all the folks who can preach, he's number one. Nobody better. And I always been talking about all the different kinds of good he does - how hard he works, how he protects and holds up the teaching, how he helps me spread this Dharma. When it comes to teaching the four kinds of followers, he shows 'em the way, he teaches 'em right, he benefits 'em, he brings 'em joy. He can break down the Buddha's true teaching every which way, and he brings real benefit to everybody walking this holy path with him. Besides the Tathāgata himself, ain't nobody can match his way with words."

"Now don't y'all go thinking Full Son only been helping me preach my Dharma. No sir. He been doing this work with ninety billion Buddhas in the past - protecting and helping spread the Buddha's true teaching. And among all those preacher men with all those Buddhas, he was number one there too. And when it comes to those Buddhas teaching about emptiness, about how things don't have any fixed self - Full Son understood that clear as day, understood it all the way through. He got what they call the four unobstructed wisdoms. He could always preach steady and clean and clear, no doubts, no hesitation. He had all the Bodhisattva's supernatural powers. All through his life, however long he lived, he walked that pure holy path. The people in those Buddha-times, they all thought he was just a hearer-disciple, just a śrāvaka. But Full Son was using that as a skillful means, you understand, and through it he benefited hundreds of thousands of beings beyond counting. And he helped countless folks without number to establish themselves on the path to supreme perfect enlightenment. Because he wanted to purify Buddha-lands, he was always doing Buddha-work, always teaching and transforming beings."

"Now listen, monks - Full Son was the number one preacher among the seven Buddhas before me. And right now with me, he's number one among those who preach. And in the coming age, the good age to come with all its Buddhas - he gonna be number one among the preachers then too. And in every case, he gonna be protecting and helping spread the Buddha's Dharma. And in the future, he gonna keep on protecting and helping spread the Dharma of countless Buddhas beyond measure - teaching and benefiting beings without number, helping 'em establish themselves on the path to supreme perfect enlightenment. Because he wants to purify Buddha-lands, he gonna keep working hard, teaching and transforming beings, little by little fulfilling the whole Bodhisattva path."

"After countless, immeasurable, infinite ages pass, right here in this land he gonna attain supreme perfect enlightenment. His name gonna be Dharmaprabha Tathāgata - that means Dharma-Light Buddha. And he gonna have all ten titles: Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One."

THE LAND WHERE LAW-LIGHT BUDDHA GONNA REIGN

Now his Buddha-land gonna include three thousand great thousand worlds - as many as the sands in the Ganges River - all rolled into one Buddha-land. The ground gonna be made of seven kinds of precious things. The land gonna be flat as the palm of your hand - no mountains, no valleys, no streams running through ravines, no ditches. Gonna be pavilions and towers made of seven precious things filling up that whole place. The palaces where the gods live gonna be floating right there in the sky, close by. Heaven and earth gonna meet, people and gods gonna see each other face to face.

Won't be no evil paths there - no hell, no hungry ghosts, no animals suffering. Won't be no women there either. Every being gonna be born by transformation - just appear, you know. Won't be no sexual desire. They gonna have great supernatural powers. Their bodies gonna shine with light. They gonna fly around free as birds. Their will gonna be strong and steady. They gonna be full of effort and wisdom. Every single one gonna be golden-colored and marked with the thirty-two signs that show their dignity.

The beings in that land gonna eat two kinds of food. First kind: joy in the Dharma - that's law-food, teaching-food, truth-food. Second kind: the happiness that comes from meditation - that's the food you eat when you sit still and touch what's real. There gonna be countless thousands of myriads of millions of Bodhisattvas beyond measure - they gonna have great supernatural powers and the four unobstructed wisdoms, and they gonna be good at teaching all different kinds of beings. And the hearer-disciples there, you can't even count 'em - no arithmetic, no calculation can reach that number. Every one of 'em gonna have the six supernatural powers, the three clear knowledges, and the eight liberations complete.

That Buddha-land gonna be accomplished and adorned with countless limitless virtues like these. The age gonna be called Jewel-Bright. The country gonna be called Good-and-Pure. That Buddha gonna live for countless, limitless ages beyond measure. The true Dharma gonna last way longer than that. And the reflection of the Dharma - what we call the image-age - gonna last twice as long again. When the Dharma finally disappears, the gods and humans gonna grieve.

NOW THE BUDDHA GONNA SAY IT IN VERSE

Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say all this again, spoke in verse:

 Monks, you better listen close,
 to the road the Buddha's children chose.
 They learned the skillful way so well,
 it's beyond what thinking's mind can tell.

 They knew the crowd just wanted small,
 they feared the wisdom's great big call.
 So all those Bodhisattvas there
 played the part of disciples everywhere -

 Acting like hearers, acting small,
 using countless means to reach 'em all.
 They said, "We just disciples be,
 from Buddha-way we're far as far can be."

 But they delivered countless souls,
 made 'em whole, fulfilled their roles.
 Though people lazy, wanting less,
 slowly they'd lead 'em to Buddha-ness.

 Inside they kept the Bodhisattva way,
 outside they looked like disciples day to day.
 Seemed like they had small desires, hated birth and death,
 but really they were purifying Buddha-lands with every breath.

 They'd show themselves with greed and hate and ignorance,
 they'd even show themselves with views that didn't make sense.
 My disciples work like this, you see,
 with skillful means they set folks free.

 If I told you everything,
 all the shapes that they could bring,
 all the ways they'd transform and change,
 folks would hear and think it strange -

 They'd have doubts fill up their mind.
 But now, this Full Son, understand,
 with thousands of billions of Buddhas in ancient times,
 he walked the path, he climbed and climbed,

 He preached and he protected every Buddha's law,
 seeking that highest wisdom that he saw.
 With all those Buddhas, there he stood,
 showing he's a disciple, learned and good.

 He preached without a single fear,
 making all the crowd glad to hear.
 He never got tired, never got worn down,
 helping Buddha's work in every town.

 He done crossed over, got his supernatural powers complete,
 got the four unobstructed wisdoms, neat.
 Knew which folks were sharp, which ones were slow,
 always preached the pure Dharma, made it flow.

 Explaining meanings clear as clear can be,
 teaching thousands of billions, setting 'em free,
 making 'em dwell in the Great Vehicle way,
 and purifying his own Buddha-land, day by day.

 In the future too, he gonna serve
 countless Buddhas, never gonna swerve.
 Protecting, helping, preaching what is true,
 and purifying his Buddha-land too.

 Always using skillful means everywhere,
 preaching the Dharma without fear.
 He gonna save more folks than you can measure,
 help 'em all reach wisdom's treasure.

 Making offerings to all the Tathāgatas bright,
 protecting the Dharma-treasure day and night.
 After that, he gonna become a Buddha too,
 his name Law-Bright - Dharmaprabha, that's who.

 His country called Good-Pure, you see,
 made of seven precious things in harmony.
 His age called Jewel-Bright and fair,
 Bodhisattvas everywhere -

 Countless billions beyond all measure,
 crossed over with supernatural power beyond treasure,
 威威德德力力具具足足，，
 filled with awesome virtue and might,
 covering that whole land with light.

 Hearer-disciples countless there,
 with three clear knowings and liberations eight so rare,
 got four unobstructed wisdoms complete -
 these gonna be the congregation he gonna meet.

 All the beings in that nation,
 done cut off sexual inclination.
 Every one born by pure transformation,
 with fine marks adorning their formation.

 They gonna eat joy-in-law and meditation-bliss,
 won't think of any other food but this.
 Won't be no women anywhere,
 won't be no evil paths there.

 Full Son the monk, you understand,
 got all his virtues filled out grand.
 He gonna get this pure land here,
 with wise and holy folks so dear.

 Countless things like this there be,
 but I just told it briefly.

THE TWELVE HUNDRED START HOPING

Now at that time, those twelve hundred arhats - the ones who done got their minds free - they was thinking: "We're so happy, we ain't never felt nothing like this before. If the World-Honored One would call our names one by one, give us our prophecies like he done for those other big-time disciples, wouldn't that be something sweet?"

The Buddha knew what they was thinking in their hearts. He turned to Mahākāśyapa - that's Great Kāśyapa - and said: "I'm gonna call these twelve hundred arhats' names right here and now, one after another, and give 'em their prophecies of supreme perfect enlightenment."

"Now in this congregation here, my great disciple Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya - that's Understanding-Chen-Ru - he gonna make offerings to sixty-two thousand billion Buddhas, and after that, he gonna become a Buddha himself. His name gonna be Samantaprabha Tathāgata - that's Universal-Light Buddha. And he gonna have all ten titles: Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One."

"And those five hundred arhats - Uruvilva-Kāśyapa, Gaya-Kāśyapa, Nadi-Kāśyapa, Kālodayin, Udāyin, Aniruddha, Revata, Kapphina, Bakkula, Cunda, Svāgata, and the rest - every single one of 'em gonna attain supreme perfect enlightenment. Every one of 'em gonna share the same title, all gonna be called Samantaprabha - Universal-Light."

NOW THE BUDDHA GONNA SAY IT IN VERSE AGAIN

Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say this meaning again, spoke in verse:

 Understanding-Chen-Ru monk gonna see
 countless Buddhas endlessly.
 After ages past all measure time,
 he gonna reach enlightenment's peak and climb.

 Always gonna send out great big light,
 filled up with supernatural powers and might.
 His name gonna be famous through every direction,
 everyone gonna give him respect and affection.

 Always gonna preach the highest way,
 that's why they call him Universal-Light, they say.
 His Buddha-land gonna be pure and clean,
 Bodhisattvas brave like you ain't never seen.

 They gonna climb up wonderful towers high,
 travel to worlds in every part of the sky,
 with offerings supreme beyond all telling,
 presenting them to Buddhas in every dwelling.

 After they done made these offerings complete,
 their hearts filled up with joy so sweet,
 in just a moment they gonna fly back home -
 that's the kind of supernatural power they own.

 That Buddha gonna live sixty thousand ages long,
 the true Dharma gonna last twice that song.
 The image-Dharma twice that time again,
 when the Dharma dies, gods and humans feel the pain.

 Those five hundred monks, you understand,
 one by one gonna become Buddhas in this land.
 All of 'em gonna share the name Universal-Light,
 taking turns getting prophecies, that's right.

 "After I done passed away," the Buddha said,
 "So-and-so gonna be a Buddha instead.
 The world that he gonna teach and transform there
 gonna be just like mine everywhere.

 The purity of that Buddha-land,
 the supernatural powers so grand,
 the Bodhisattvas and hearers he gonna teach,
 the true Dharma and image-Dharma's reach,

 How long his life gonna measure out -
 all gonna be like what I been talking about.
 Kāśyapa, now you done learned and know
 about these five hundred who done been freed to go.

 As for all the other hearer-disciples here,
 they gonna be just like this, that's clear.
 Those who ain't in this meeting today,
 you gotta go and tell 'em what I say."

THE JEWEL SEWN IN THE ROBE - THE HEART OF IT ALL

Now when those five hundred arhats got their prophecies called out right there in front of the Buddha, they was so happy they was jumping up and down. They rose up from their seats, went right to the Buddha, bowed down with their faces to his feet, and they confessed, they repented, they held themselves accountable:

"World-Honored One, we been thinking all this time that we done reached the final destination, that we'd got to ultimate liberation. But now we see we was like folks with no sense, no wisdom at all. Why we say that? Because we should've got the Tathāgata's wisdom, but instead we settled for small wisdom and thought that was enough."

"World-Honored One, it's like this - it's like there was a man, and he went to his good friend's house. This was a close friend, a real friend. And he got drunk and passed out, just fell out sleeping. Now his friend, he had some official business he had to take care of, had to go handle something. So before he left, he took a priceless jewel - I mean priceless, worth more than you can count - and he sewed it into the lining of his friend's robe. Just sewed it right in there and left."

"Now that man, he was passed out drunk, didn't know nothing about it, didn't feel a thing. When he woke up, he hit the road, started traveling around, went to another country altogether. And he had to scrape for food, scrape for clothes to wear. He was working hard, straining and struggling, having it real rough. And if he managed to get just a little bit of something, he figured that was enough. He'd settle for that."

"Later on, that good friend happened to run into him and saw him living like this. And he said: 'Man! Brother! Why you out here struggling for food and clothes like this? Way back when, I wanted you to be comfortable, wanted you to have ease, wanted you to be able to enjoy all five kinds of pleasures however you wanted. On such-and-such a year, such-and-such a month, such-and-such a day, I sewed a priceless jewel into the lining of your robe. It's still right there! And here you are not knowing it, worrying and suffering and working yourself to death just to survive. That's foolish, man! You can take this jewel and trade it for whatever you need. You can live however you want, never have to worry about running short of nothing.'"

"The Buddha's just like that. When he was a Bodhisattva, he taught us, he helped us develop the mind that seeks all-knowing wisdom. But we forgot. We forgot all about it. We didn't know, didn't remember. When we got to the arhat path, we thought we'd reached liberation, thought we was done. Making it through life was hard. Getting a little bit seemed like enough. But that wish for all-knowing wisdom - it was still there, never lost."

"Now the World-Honored One woke us up, made us see. He said to us: 'Monks, what y'all got ain't the ultimate liberation. Long ago I had y'all plant Buddha-seeds, good roots that grow into Buddha-trees. I used skillful means to show y'all what looked like nirvāṇa, what looked like the final destination. And y'all thought you'd really reached ultimate liberation.'"

"World-Honored One, now we finally understand - we really are Bodhisattvas. We done received the prophecy of supreme perfect enlightenment. Because of this, we're happier than we ever been in our lives. This is joy we ain't never known before."

NOW THEY GONNA SAY IT IN VERSE

Then Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya and the others, wanting to say this meaning again, spoke in verse:

 We heard that highest, peaceful voice,
 telling us our names - we had no choice
 but to feel a joy we ain't never known,
 and bow to the Buddha with wisdom full-grown.

 Now here before the World-Honored One
 we confess what we done and ain't done.
 Though we had a share of Buddha-treasure beyond measure,
 we settled for a little bit of nirvāṇa-pleasure,

 Like foolish folks without good sense,
 we thought that little bit was immense.
 It's like a poor man, see,
 went to his good friend's place to be.

 That friend's house was mighty rich,
 had all kinds of food, every dish.
 He took a priceless jewel, you understand,
 and sewed it in the poor man's robe with his own hand,

 Gave it quiet-like and then was gone.
 The man was sleeping, didn't know what was going on.
 When that man woke up and rose,
 he traveled to another country, as the story goes.

 Looking for clothes and for food to get by,
 scraping to survive with many a sigh.
 Life was hard, so hard to bear,
 if he got a little something, he thought that was rare -

 He didn't wish for nothing better than that little bit.
 He didn't know that right there where he sit,
 sewn inside his robe's lining there
 was a priceless jewel beyond compare.

 The friend who gave that jewel back when,
 he saw this poor man struggling again.
 He scolded him hard, got after him good,
 and showed him the jewel sewn in where it stood.

 When the poor man saw that jewel shine,
 his heart was filled with joy so fine.
 He was rich! Had wealth to burn!
 Could enjoy five pleasures at every turn.

 We're just like that, every one.
 World-Honored One, through the long dark night you done
 always pitied us, always helped us see,
 made us plant seeds of the highest wish to be free.

 But we had no wisdom, didn't understand,
 didn't know it, didn't see what was in our hand.
 We got a little share of nirvāṇa, small and slight,
 thought that was enough, thought we was done right.

 Now the Buddha woke us up, you see,
 said what we got ain't real and final and free.
 When we get the Buddha's highest wisdom, that unsurpassed knowing,
 only then we gonna reach real liberation's showing.

 Now we done heard from the Buddha here
 about prophecies and adornments, made it all clear.
 And heard we gonna take our turns receiving the call,
 and our bodies and minds are full of joy, one and all.

END OF CHAPTER EIGHT: WHEN THE FIVE HUNDRED FINALLY HEARD THEIR NAMES CALLED

Blues Interpretation from Classical Chinese by Kumārajīva
---

INTERPRETATION NOTES:

This chapter is the heart of the Lotus Sutra's democratic revelation - the moment when the "ordinary" disciples discover they've been carrying Buddha-nature all along without knowing it. The central parable of the jewel sewn into the robe is one of the most powerful images in Buddhist literature, and it speaks directly to the blues tradition's understanding of hidden dignity, forgotten promise, and the shocking grace of recognition.

Key metaphorical choices:

1. "Full Son" for Pūrṇa - His name literally means "full" (pūrṇa), and "Maitrāyaṇīputra" means "son of Maitrāyaṇī," so "Full Son" captures both elements in vernacular English that sounds natural when spoken aloud.

2. "Preacher man" - Pūrṇa's designation as foremost in teaching the Dharma interprets naturally to the African American religious tradition's "preacher," a figure of respect and power.

3. "Getting drunk and passing out" - The original Chinese "醉酒而臥" is frank about intoxication. The blues tradition doesn't sanitize human weakness - it names it directly while holding space for redemption.

4. "Scraping for food and clothes" - The original describes arduous struggle for basic survival ("為衣食故，勤力求索，甚大艱難"). This directly parallels the blues tradition's unflinching acknowledgment of poverty and hard times.

5. "Man! Brother! Why you out here struggling like this?" - The original "咄哉、丈夫" is an exclamation of shock and dismay. The blues vernacular "Man! Brother!" captures that emotional directness.

6. "I sewed a priceless jewel into the lining of your robe" - This image is preserved exactly because it's already perfect - concrete, specific, shocking. The hidden wealth sewn into the garment of someone who doesn't know they're carrying it speaks across centuries and cultures.

7. Rhythm and repetition - The verse sections employ call-and-response patterns, internal rhyme, and rhythmic repetition that would work when sung or chanted. "One by one," "day by day," "that's right," "you see" - these create musical flow.

8. Direct address - The interpretation consistently uses "you" and "we," speaking person-to-person rather than lecturer-to-student, maintaining the oral tradition's intimacy.

The spiritual truth here is universal: we've been wandering in poverty thinking we're far from home, when all along we've been carrying everything we need. We settled for small blessings when infinite blessing was sewn into our very garments. The Buddha (like the true friend) doesn't give us something new - he reveals what we've had all along but forgot. This is the blues revelation: you been somebody all along, child. You just forgot. Now remember.
