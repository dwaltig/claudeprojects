THE LOTUS SUTRA
Chapter Twenty-Six: The Protection Songs
(陀羅尼品第二十六)

A Blues/Gospel Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese


WHEN MEDICINE KING STEPS UP

Now right then, Medicine King Bodhisattva—you remember him, the one who burned his own body to show his devotion—he stood up from his seat, put his robe over one shoulder the way you do when you're about to say something serious, pressed his palms together, and spoke to the Buddha:

"World-Honored One, listen now. If there's a good man or a good woman—I'm talking about anybody who's got the heart—if they can hold on to this Lotus teaching, if they can read it and speak it and know it through and through, if they can write it down with their own hand, tell me: How much blessing does that soul receive?"

And the Buddha said to Medicine King: "Let me ask you something first. If there was a good man or a good woman, and they made offerings to eight hundred myriads of millions of nayutas of Buddhas—as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River—what you think? Would their blessing be great, or would it be small?"

"It would be great, World-Honored One. Lord, it would be mighty great."

The Buddha said: "Now let me tell you something. If a good man or a good woman can hold on to even one four-line verse of this teaching—just four lines!—if they can read it and speak it and understand what it means, if they can practice what it says, their merit is GREATER THAN THAT. You hear what I'm saying? Greater than all that other merit combined."

Right then Medicine King said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I'm about to give a protection song—a dharani—to those who teach this Dharma. I'm gonna stand guard over them."

And he spoke the powerful words:

ANYE MANYE MANE MAMANE CHITE CHARITE
SHAME SHAMITARE SHANTE MUKTE MUKTAME
SAME AVISAME SAMASAME JAYE KSHAYE
AKSHINE SHANTE SHAME DHARANI
ALOKABHASHA PRATYAVEKSHANI NIDHIRU
ABHYANTARANIVISHTE ABHYANTARA PARI SHUDHI
UKKULE MUKKULE ARADE PARADE SUKAKSHI
ASAMASAME BUDDHAVILOKITE DHARMAPARIKSHITE
SANGHANIRGHOSHANI BHASHYA BHASHYA SHUHDI
MANTRA MANTRAAKSHAYATE RUTE RUTA KAUSHALYA
AKSHARA AKSHARA TYAYANTE ABHYAVAKARA AVALOKANI

"World-Honored One," Medicine King said, "this protection song, this powerful dharani, has been spoken by six hundred and twenty million Buddhas—as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges. Listen here: If anybody harms a teacher of this Dharma, they have harmed ALL THOSE BUDDHAS. You understand what I'm saying? You touch one of ours, you touch the whole family."


THE BUDDHA SAYS AMEN

Then Shakyamuni Buddha praised Medicine King, saying: "Good, good! Medicine King, you done right. Because you have compassion for these Dharma teachers, because you want to protect them, you spoke this dharani. And it's gonna bring great benefit to all living beings. Great benefit indeed."


WHEN BRAVE GIVER ADDS HIS VOICE

Right then, Brave Giver Bodhisattva spoke up to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I'm gonna add my protection too. I'm gonna give a dharani to guard those who read and recite and hold on to the Lotus teaching. If a Dharma teacher has this protection song, then listen:

"If a yaksha comes looking for trouble—can't touch 'em.
If a rakshasa demon comes sniffing around—can't touch 'em.
If a putana spirit comes hunting—can't touch 'em.
If a krtya curse comes creeping—can't touch 'em.
If a kumbhanda goblin comes prowling—can't touch 'em.
If a hungry ghost comes seeking—can't touch 'em.

"They'll be looking for a weak spot, but they won't find one. No sir, they won't find one."

And right there before the Buddha, he spoke the powerful words:

JVALE MAHAJVALE UKKE MUKKE ADE
ADAVATI NRTYE NRTYAVATI ITTINI
VITTINI CHITTINI NRTYANI NRTYAVATI

"World-Honored One, this dharani protection song has been spoken by as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. And all of them rejoiced in it. Listen here: If anybody harms a teacher of this Dharma, they have harmed ALL THOSE BUDDHAS. You hear what I'm saying?"


WHEN THE DEMON KINGS START PROTECTING

Right then, Vaishravana—that's the Heavenly King, the Guardian of the North, the Protector of the World—he spoke to the Buddha:

"World-Honored One, I too have compassion for living beings. I too want to protect these Dharma teachers. So I'm gonna speak this dharani."

And he spoke the powerful words:

ATYE NATYE VANATYE ANADA NADI KUNADI

"World-Honored One, with this powerful protection song I'm gonna guard these Dharma teachers. I myself will protect those who hold this teaching. For a hundred yojanas around them—that's a mighty long distance—there will be NO TROUBLE. No sickness, no disaster, no harm. I'm watching."


WHEN THE GUARDIAN OF THE EAST JOINS IN

Right then, Dhrtarashtra—that's the Heavenly King who Guards the East—he was in that assembly with ten thousand million nayutas of gandharva musicians all around him, showing respect. He came forward to where the Buddha was, pressed his palms together, and said:

"World-Honored One, I too will protect those who hold the Lotus teaching with a dharani protection song."

And he spoke the powerful words:

AGANE GANE GAURI GANDHARA CHANDALI
MATANGI JANGULE VRUSE PUKKASI BHARYE

"World-Honored One, this dharani protection song has been spoken by four hundred and twenty million Buddhas. If anybody harms a teacher of this Dharma, they have harmed ALL THOSE BUDDHAS. That's what I'm telling you."


WHEN THE YAKSHA GODDESSES SWEAR THEIR OATH

Right then there were ten yaksha goddesses—now these are fierce female spirits, you understand—and their names were:

Lambā (That means "Hanging Down")
Vilambā (That means "Hanging Way Down")
Crooked Teeth
Flower Teeth
Black Teeth
Many Locks
Never Satisfied
Wearing Necklaces
Kuntī
And the one called Stealer of the Life Force of All Living Beings

These ten yaksha goddesses came together with Hariti—that's the Mother of Demons herself, the one who used to eat children until the Buddha converted her—and they brought her children and all her attendants. They all came to where the Buddha was, and together, in one voice, they said:

"World-Honored One, we too want to protect those who read and recite and hold on to the Lotus teaching. We want to remove their troubles. If anyone is looking for a way to harm a Dharma teacher, they won't find it. We won't let them find it."

And right there before the Buddha, they spoke the powerful words:

ITTI MINI ITTI VINI ITTI VAINI CHITI VAINI NIVRI
NIVRI NIVRI NIVRI NIVRI
RUHE RUHE RUHE RUHE
TAHE TAHE TAHE
TUHE STUHE

And then they said—listen to this oath now, this is serious:

"Better they should walk on our heads—that's right, trample us down—than that they should trouble a Dharma teacher.

"If a yaksha comes—we're watching.
If a rakshasa comes—we're watching.
If a hungry ghost comes—we're watching.
If a putana comes—we're watching.
If a krtya comes—we're watching.
If a vetala corpse-demon comes—we're watching.
If a skandha child-demon comes—we're watching.
If an unmada madness-demon comes—we're watching.
If an apasmara epilepsy-demon comes—we're watching.
If a yaksha-krtya comes—we're watching.
If a human-krtya comes—we're watching.
If a fever comes—whether it's a one-day fever, or a two-day fever, or a three-day fever, or a four-day fever, all the way up to a seven-day fever, or even a constant fever—we're watching.
Whether the demon takes a man's form, or a woman's form, or a boy's form, or a girl's form—even in dreams, we say DON'T YOU TROUBLE THEM."

And right there before the Buddha, they spoke a verse:

If you don't respect our protection song,
If you trouble those who teach the Dharma,
Your head will split into seven pieces
Like branches breaking off the Arjaka tree.

Like the sin of killing your father and mother,
Like the disaster of pressing out oil with false measures,
Like cheating people with crooked scales,
Like Devadatta breaking up the Sangha—

That's the kind of disaster you'll bring on yourself
If you harm a teacher of this Dharma.


THE YAKSHA GODDESSES MAKE THEIR PROMISE

When those yaksha goddesses had spoken this verse, they said to the Buddha:

"World-Honored One, we ourselves will personally protect those who hold and read and recite and practice this teaching. We'll give them peace and security. We'll keep all troubles away. We'll neutralize all poisons."

And the Buddha said to those yaksha goddesses: "Good, good! Listen now: If you all can protect even someone who just holds on to the NAME of the Lotus teaching—just the name!—your merit is beyond measure. How much more if you protect someone who fully holds on to this teaching, who makes offerings to these written scrolls with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, with banners and canopies, with music, with all kinds of lamps—butter lamps, oil lamps, fragrant oil lamps, jasmine oil lamps, champaka flower oil lamps, varshika flower oil lamps, utpala water lily oil lamps—with these hundred thousand kinds of offerings!

"Kuntī, you and all your attendants should protect such teachers of the Dharma. You hear what I'm saying? Protect them."


WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY HEARD THIS

When this Protection Songs chapter was spoken, sixty-eight thousand people—that's right, sixty-eight thousand souls—attained the patience of non-arising. That means they reached the place where they knew: Nothing is born, nothing dies, it all just keeps flowing. They got free right then, just from hearing about this protection.

TRANSLATOR'S NOTES: ON FIERCE LOVE AND COSMIC PROTECTION

**From Gentle to Fierce: The Two Faces of Compassion**

Chapter 25 showed us Avalokiteshvara—gentle, responsive, taking whatever form is needed to save beings. That's one face of compassion: the tender mercy that meets you where you are.

Chapter 26 shows us the other face: FIERCE PROTECTION. This is the love that says, "You will not harm my children." This is the compassion that bares its teeth and says, "Touch them and you deal with me." Both are necessary. Both are real love.

In the blues/gospel tradition, we know both these faces. We know the gentle Jesus who welcomes children. And we know the fierce Jesus who overturns the tables in the temple. We know the mother's tender touch. And we know the mother who will fight a bear with her bare hands if you threaten her babies.

This chapter is about that second kind of love. The fierce kind. The protective kind. The kind that sets boundaries and enforces them with cosmic consequences.


**Why the Mantras Aren't Translated**

You notice I kept the dharani—the protection songs—in their original Sanskrit/Prakrit sounds, just cleaned up and transliterated. That's intentional.

These aren't words you translate. These are SOUNDS OF POWER. In the blues and gospel tradition, we understand this. Sometimes you don't sing words, you sing sounds:

"Aaahhhhh!"
"Mmmmmm-hmmm!"
"Oh! Oh! Oh!"

These aren't words with dictionary meanings. These are utterances that carry spiritual power. The sound itself does the work.

The dharani are like that. They're not poems to be understood intellectually. They're sonic weapons against harm. They're protection songs. You don't need to know what they "mean" in English. You need to hear them, speak them, let their sound create a field of protection around you.

In African American sacred tradition, there are holy utterances that work the same way. The congregation knows what they're doing even if they can't translate them. The power is in the sound, in the breath, in the collective speaking.


**The Cosmic Justice Principle**

"If you harm a teacher of this Dharma, you have harmed all those Buddhas."

This is the key principle of this chapter, repeated multiple times by different protectors. It's a statement of cosmic justice: You don't get to harm those who carry the teaching and walk away free. The universe itself responds.

This isn't petty revenge. This is the natural consequence principle written cosmic-scale. If you harm a bearer of truth, you're harming truth itself. And truth has a way of returning that harm to its source.

In blues terms, this is "What goes around comes around." It's "You reap what you sow." It's the recognition that the universe has moral structure, and violation of that structure brings consequences.

But more than that—it's the declaration that those who speak truth are BACKED UP. They don't stand alone. They stand with every Buddha, every Bodhisattva, every heavenly king, every protective deity that ever was. Touch one of them, you touch the whole family.

That's powerful. That's the kind of protection that lets you walk into danger with your head held high, because you know cosmic forces have your back.


**When Demons Become Protectors**

One of the most striking things about this chapter is WHO offers protection:

- Vaishravana, King of the Yakshas—originally a demon king
- Dhrtarashtra, Guardian of the East—commands the gandharvas, wild nature spirits
- Ten yaksha goddesses—fierce female demons
- Hariti, Mother of Demons—who used to eat children

These aren't angels. These aren't traditionally "good" beings. These are the wild ones, the scary ones, the ones who live at the edges of the cosmos and know how to fight.

And THEY step up to protect the Dharma teachers.

This tells us something profound: The teaching is so universal, so true, that even the forces we feared become its guardians. Even the demons recognize truth and pledge to protect it.

In blues/gospel terms, this is like when the tough guys in the neighborhood become protectors of the church. This is like when the ones everybody feared become the bodyguards for the preacher. This is redemption in action—the fierce ones using their fierceness for good.

It also tells us that protection isn't always pretty. Protection isn't always gentle. Sometimes you need the ones who know how to fight. Sometimes you need the fierce goddesses who will split heads and break bones if that's what it takes to keep harm away.


**The Oaths and Curses: How Serious This Is**

The yaksha goddesses don't just offer protection. They swear cosmic oaths with terrible consequences for violation:

"Your head will split into seven pieces like branches breaking off a tree."
"Like the sin of killing your father and mother."
"Like cheating with false scales."
"Like Devadatta breaking up the Sangha."

These are the worst sins imaginable in Buddhist culture:
- Patricide and matricide—violations of the most basic bonds
- Cheating with measures—exploitation of the poor and vulnerable
- Breaking the Sangha—destroying the community of practice

They're saying: Harming a Dharma teacher is AS BAD AS THESE. It carries consequences just as severe.

This is the language of covenant. This is oath-swearing. This is making sacred promises with your life on the line.

In the blues/gospel tradition, we understand this too. "Cross my heart and hope to die." "May God strike me dead if I'm lying." These are serious promises backed by cosmic enforcement.

The yaksha goddesses are making that kind of promise: We will protect. And if we fail, let our heads split. But also—if you harm those we protect, your head will split. This is covenant protection with teeth.


**Walking in Favor: The Blues/Gospel Understanding**

In African American sacred tradition, there's a concept of "walking in favor"—the sense that when you're doing God's work, when you're walking in truth, you move under divine protection.

This doesn't mean nothing bad ever happens. It means you're not alone. It means forces beyond your understanding are working on your behalf. It means the universe is tilted in your direction.

This chapter is teaching that same principle. If you hold on to this Lotus teaching, if you speak it, if you live it, you walk under cosmic protection. Medicine King protects you. Brave Giver protects you. The demon kings protect you. The fierce goddesses protect you.

"For a hundred yojanas around them, there will be no trouble."

You're walking in favor. You're moving under covering. Nothing can touch you without dealing with your protectors first.

This is the confidence that lets the preacher walk into hostile territory. This is the peace that lets the truth-teller sleep sound at night. This is the assurance that lets you keep speaking when speaking is dangerous.

You're not alone. You're never alone. The whole cosmos has your back.


**The Fierceness of Love**

The most important thing to understand about this chapter is that this fierce protection IS LOVE.

When the yaksha goddesses say, "Better walk on our heads than trouble a Dharma teacher," that's not ego. That's love. That's the love that says, "Harm me before you harm those I protect."

When they list all the demons and diseases they're watching out for, that's not just power—that's care. That's attentiveness. That's knowing all the ways harm can come and standing guard against every single one.

"Even in dreams," they say. Even in dreams, don't let trouble come.

That's the fierceness of love. That's love that doesn't sleep. That's love that stays vigilant. That's love that will fight whatever needs fighting to keep its people safe.

In the blues/gospel tradition, we sing about this kind of love:

"Trouble don't last always"—because love stands guard.
"Nobody knows the trouble I've seen"—but also, "Glory, hallelujah!" because protection is real.
"I shall not be moved"—because I'm standing on divine protection.

This chapter is teaching us to claim that protection. To know we have it. To walk in the confidence of it.


**Protection Isn't Passive**

Notice that this protection isn't just defensive. It's not just "nothing bad will happen." It's active:

"We'll remove their troubles."
"We'll neutralize all poisons."
"We'll give them peace and security."

The protectors aren't just blocking harm—they're actively creating conditions for flourishing. They're removing obstacles. They're turning poison into medicine. They're making a space where the Dharma teacher can do their work without fear.

This is like the gospel testimony: "God made a way out of no way." Protection isn't just absence of danger—it's presence of support. It's active intervention on behalf of those doing the work.


**Completing the Teaching: Compassion + Protection**

These last two chapters—25 and 26—work together as a complete teaching:

Chapter 25 (Avalokiteshvara): Compassion RESPONDS to suffering.
Chapter 26 (Dharani): Protection PREVENTS suffering.

You need both. You need the compassionate response when harm comes. And you need the fierce protection that keeps harm from coming in the first place.

Together they tell us: The universe is set up to support those who walk the path of truth. When you stumble, compassion catches you. And before you stumble, protection guards your way.

This is the full picture of divine support. This is what it means to be held by cosmic forces. You're responded to AND protected. You're caught when you fall AND guarded so you don't fall. You're met with gentle mercy AND fierce defense.

Both are love. Both are necessary. Both are yours if you hold on to this teaching.


**How This Applies to Us**

So what does this mean for us, trying to walk a truthful path in a difficult world?

It means:
1. When you speak truth, you don't speak alone.
2. When you carry wisdom, cosmic forces align to protect you.
3. Even the wild forces, the scary forces, recognize truth and become its guardians.
4. The universe has moral structure, and that structure supports those who walk in integrity.
5. You can afford to be brave, because protection is real.
6. Love is sometimes fierce, and fierce love is still love.
7. You're walking in favor—claim it.

This chapter is permission to stand up. Permission to speak out. Permission to teach truth without cowering.

Because when you do—Medicine King stands with you. Brave Giver stands with you. The demon kings stand with you. The fierce goddesses stand with you. And sixty-two billion Buddhas stand with you.

Touch you, they touch all of us. That's the message.

Walk in that protection. Walk in that favor. Walk with your head held high.

You got cosmic bodyguards. You got the whole universe watching your back.

That's what this chapter teaches. That's what it means.

Now walk like you believe it.

Blues/Gospel Translation by Claude
From Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese version (406 CE)
妙法蓮華經 Miàofǎ Liánhuá Jīng

This translation attempts to carry the fierce protective energy and cosmic chorus of this chapter into vernacular English that honors both the Buddhist teaching and the blues/gospel tradition of fierce love and divine favor.

The mantras are presented as sounds of power, not translated, because their effectiveness lies in the sound itself—like holy utterances in any tradition.

May all beings walk in protection. May all who speak truth know they're never alone. May the fierce love that guards the Dharma guard us all.

Thus have I heard. Thus have I sung. Thus may it be.
