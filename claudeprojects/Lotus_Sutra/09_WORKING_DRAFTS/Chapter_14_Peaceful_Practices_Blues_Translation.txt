Chapter 14: How to Keep Your Soul Clean When the World's Gone Wrong
(安樂行品 - The Peaceful Practices)

---

MAÑJUŚRĪ ASKS THE HARD QUESTION

Now at that time, Mañjuśrī—that prince of the Dharma, that great bodhisattva—he stood up and said to the Buddha:

"World-Honored One, these bodhisattvas here, they're something rare, you know? They respect you so much they done made a vow—a big vow, a serious vow—that when the evil age comes rolling in, when everything's corrupt and wrong, they gonna protect this Lotus teaching. They gonna read it, study it, teach it out loud.

But World-Honored One, I got to ask: When that evil age comes—and it's coming—how can these bodhisattvas teach this sutra without losing themselves? How they gonna speak the truth when lies run the world?"

And the Buddha said to Mañjuśrī:

"Listen now. If a bodhisattva wants to teach this sutra in the evil age to come, they got to rest themselves in four practices—four ways of being that keep you safe, keep you clean, keep you whole. The first one's about where you stand. The second's about who you stand with. You got to know your ground, and you got to know your company."


FIRST PRACTICE: THE GROUND YOU STAND ON

"Mañjuśrī, what do I mean by a bodhisattva's ground—their place to stand?

Listen: If you gonna teach in hard times, you got to dwell on the ground of patience. That means you gentle. You soft. You kind. You don't rush to anger, don't fly off the handle, don't let violence take root in your heart. You can't be jumping at every shadow, can't be scared of your own spirit.

And here's the deep part—listen close now: You don't cling to no ideas about the Dharma. You don't make the teaching into something you hold tight like property. No action, no grasping when it comes to spiritual things.

You look at everything according to its true nature. You see things as they really are—not what you want them to be, not what you fear they are, but what they truly are in their essence.

And you don't discriminate. You don't say 'this one's high, that one's low.' You don't divide reality into pieces and then fight over the pieces.

That's your ground. That's where you stand. On patience, on seeing clear, on letting things be what they are."


SECOND PRACTICE: WHO YOU DON'T RUN WITH

"Now Mañjuśrī, what do I mean by who you associate with—who you spend your time around?

Let me be plain: A bodhisattva teaching in evil times, they got to stay away from certain people. Not because you hate them—you got compassion for everybody—but because their energy will pull you down, will cloud your vision, will compromise your teaching.

Don't get close with kings and princes, with government officials and ministers, with the powerful and mighty. Power corrupts, and corrupt power corrupts faster. You can teach them if they come to you, but don't seek their favor, don't curry their approval, don't become their pet preacher.

Don't get tight with heretics and false teachers, with people teaching paths that lead nowhere, with those making up doctrines from their own confusion. Don't study worldly literature just to sound smart, don't get caught up in fancy words and clever arguments that go nowhere.

Don't go to violent entertainments—no wrestling matches, no fights, no games where people hurt each other for fun. Don't hang around places where violence is entertainment.

Don't associate with outcasts doing evil work—not the butchers, not the hunters, not the fishermen killing for profit. Not the people raising animals just to slaughter them. Not the people selling sex, selling bodies, selling what shouldn't be sold. These are hard livelihoods, bitter livelihoods, and you can't let that bitterness seep into your teaching.

And this is important—don't even get close with those monks and nuns who seeking their own little salvation, their own private enlightenment. Those śrāvakas content with their own liberation—don't live with them. If they come to you, teach them without expecting nothing back. But don't take up residence in their small vision.

Now about women—and this is practical wisdom for those times: Don't look at women with desire, don't smile showing all your teeth, don't display your body, don't get familiar with young women or widows or those confused about their own nature. Not because women are bad—no, no—but because desire will corrupt your teaching, will make people question your motives, will muddy the clear water of the Dharma.

Don't take on young disciples or little novices who you can't properly guide. Don't share teachers with those who might lead you astray.

Always love quiet places. Always be meditating, gathering your mind, keeping your spirit collected. Don't let yourself scatter like dust in the wind.

That's the first part of associations—who you don't run with."


SECOND PRACTICE, SECOND PART: THE GROUND OF EMPTINESS

"But there's a deeper part to this second practice, Mañjuśrī. It's not just about avoiding people. It's about understanding reality itself.

View all things—all dharmas, all phenomena—as empty according to their true nature. Empty like space is empty, not because there's nothing there, but because there's no fixed essence, no permanent self.

Things aren't twisted up wrong, aren't moving toward some goal, aren't retreating from some danger, aren't turning into something else. They just ARE, moment by moment, like space itself—no substance you can grab hold of.

All our talking about things—all our language and concepts—it all falls short. Nothing is being produced, nothing is arising fresh, nothing is starting up new.

No names capture it. No forms define it. Truth be told, there ain't nothing there to capture—nothing you can put your finger on and say 'this is it.'

Limitless it is. Boundless. Without obstacles or barriers.

We only talk about things because of causes and conditions, because of our confused, upside-down thinking. That's the only reason we say anything at all.

If you love to contemplate these truths—if you rest your mind in this understanding that everything is empty, fluid, free—that's the second ground for a bodhisattva. That's the second safe place to stand."


THE BUDDHA BREAKS IT DOWN IN RHYTHM

Then the World-Honored One, wanting to drive this teaching deep like a stake in the ground, spoke it again in rhythm:

If there's a bodhisattva
in the evil age to come
with no fear in their heart
wanting to teach this sutra,

They got to enter the right ground,
got to know the right associations.
Stay away from kings
and princes with their schemes,

From government officials
and violent entertainers,
from outcasts doing evil work,
from heretics preaching confusion.

Don't get close with prideful people,
those in love with small teachings,
those studying just to sound smart,
those breaking precepts behind closed doors.

Stay away from monks in name only,
from nuns who love to play around,
from laypeople deep in desires
seeking extinction for themselves.

If such people come to you
with good hearts and sincere questions,
wanting to hear the Buddha's Way,
then teach them without fear,

Teach them without hoping for reward,
without expecting praise or payment.
But don't seek them out,
don't make them your companions.

Stay away from widows and young women,
from those confused about their nature.
Don't get close with butchers and hunters,
with fishermen killing for money,

With people selling meat for a living,
selling bodies, selling shame.
Don't go near violent sports,
entertainments where people hurt each other,

Don't associate with prostitutes—
keep clear of all that.

Don't teach women alone in secret.
When you do teach, don't laugh loose and easy.
When you go to town for alms,
take another monk along.

If you got no monk to bring,
keep your mind on Buddha only.
These are your ground and your associations—
these two practices keep you safe,

Keep you able to teach with peace,
teach with joy, teach with freedom.

And beyond that: Don't hold to ideas
of high teachings or low teachings,
conditioned or unconditioned,
real or unreal—

Don't discriminate between
male and female in your mind.
Don't grasp at things as if they're solid,
don't act like you know when you don't,

Don't pretend to see what ain't visible.
That's the bodhisattva's ground.

All things are empty,
have no substance you can hold.
Nothing dwells forever,
nothing arises or ceases in truth.

This is what the wise ones know,
where the wise ones rest their minds.

Our confused discriminating thinking
divides things into real and unreal,
existent and non-existent,
born and unborn.

But you—you dwell in quiet places,
gathering your mind together,
stable and unmoving
like a mountain that won't shake.

View all phenomena
as having no substance,
like space itself,
without anything solid,

Not born, not emerging,
not moving, not retreating,
always abiding in one truth—
that's where you rest your mind.

If there's a monk
after I pass on
who enters this ground,
knows these associations,

When they teach this sutra
they won't have no fear.
Sometimes they'll go to a quiet room
and meditate properly,

Contemplate the meaning,
see the Dharma as it is.
Then they'll come out of meditation
to teach kings and princes,

Teach government officials,
teach priests and common people,
Opening up and sharing
this precious sutra,

Their heart at peace,
without any fear.
Mañjuśrī, this is the bodhisattva's
first peaceful practice—

Rest in this foundation,
and you can teach the Lotus
in the evil age to come
without losing yourself.


THIRD PRACTICE: HOW TO SPEAK AND WHAT TO HOLD IN YOUR HEART

"Now, Mañjuśrī, listen: After I'm gone, in the last age when the Dharma's dying out, if you want to teach this Lotus Sutra, you got to dwell in peaceful conduct.

Whether you're speaking it out loud or reading it quiet, don't talk bad about people and their failings. Don't speak about what's wrong with other sutras.

Don't look down on other teachers of the Dharma. Don't gossip about people's good points and bad points, their strengths and their shortcomings.

When it comes to those śrāvakas—those seeking their own enlightenment—don't call them out by name to shame them. Don't name them to praise them either. Don't breed resentment in your heart.

If you cultivate this peaceful mind, if you practice this kind of speaking, then people who come to hear you won't turn against you. And when they ask you hard questions, don't answer with small teachings—don't give them the little vehicle. Answer with the great vehicle, with the big vision that leads to complete wisdom, to knowing all that can be known."


THE BUDDHA SPEAKS IT IN RHYTHM AGAIN

Then the World-Honored One, wanting to make this meaning clear, spoke in rhythm:

The bodhisattva always loves
to teach in peace and safety.
They prepare a clean place,
set up a proper seat,

Anoint their body with oil,
wash off the dust and dirt,
put on fresh clean clothes—
clean outside and inside both.

Then they sit on the Dharma seat
and answer what they're asked.
If monks or nuns come,
if laymen or laywomen arrive,

If kings and princes show up,
if officials and common people gather,
They teach with subtle meaning,
with a gentle face and kind words.

If someone asks a hard question,
they answer according to the meaning.
They use causes and conditions,
they use parables and stories,

They explain and distinguish,
break it down so folks can understand.
By these skillful means
everyone's inspired,

Gradually they increase,
gradually they enter the Buddha Way.
Cast off your lazy mind,
throw away your slacking spirit,

Let go of your worries,
teach with a compassionate heart.
Day and night keep speaking
this supreme teaching,

Using countless causes,
innumerable parables,
Opening it up for all beings
so everyone rejoices.

Clothes and bedding,
food and medicine—
don't hope for any of that.
Just single-mindedly think:

"I teach for this reason only:
so I can achieve Buddhahood,
so all beings can achieve it too."
That's your great benefit,

That's your peaceful offering.
After I pass on,
if there's a monk who can teach
this wondrous Lotus Sutra,

Their heart won't hold jealousy,
hatred, or afflictions.
They won't have worries,
won't be cursed or insulted.

They won't fear
swords or sticks or violence.
They won't be driven out,
because they rest in patience.

The wise one practices like this,
cultivates their heart properly,
Dwells in peace and safety
just like I described.

That person's merit
over thousands of millions of ages—
you can't calculate it,
can't describe it with parables.


FOURTH PRACTICE: GREAT COMPASSION FOR THOSE WHO REJECT YOU

"Now, Mañjuśrī, there's one more practice—the fourth peaceful practice—for bodhisattvas teaching in the last age when the Dharma's dying out.

If you're teaching this Lotus Sutra, you got to keep your heart free from jealousy, from deceit, from lying. Don't look down on people learning the Buddha Way. Don't go searching for their faults.

Whether they're monks or nuns, laypeople, whether they're seeking the śrāvaka vehicle or the pratyekabuddha vehicle or the bodhisattva way—don't trouble them. Don't make them doubt themselves. Don't make them regret their path.

Don't say to them: 'You're far from the Way. You ain't never gonna reach complete knowledge. Why? Because you're lazy, that's why. Because you slack off on the path.'

And don't get into debates and arguments about the Dharma, don't get competitive about teaching.

Instead, toward all beings, generate great compassion. Toward all the Tathagatas—all the Buddhas—hold them as loving fathers in your mind. Toward all the bodhisattvas, see them as your great teachers.

Toward the great bodhisattvas in all ten directions, always maintain deep respect in your heart. Bow down to them with reverence.

When you teach, teach all beings equally. Don't teach more to those who love the Dharma more. Don't measure out your teaching according to people's enthusiasm. Teach according to the Dharma itself—not too much, not too little, just what's right.

Even toward those who deeply love the teaching, don't give them extra just because they're eager."


THE FOURTH PRACTICE BRINGS PROTECTION AND COMMUNITY

"Mañjuśrī, if a bodhisattva in the last age—when the Dharma's dying—accomplishes this third peaceful practice, then when they teach this sutra, nobody can trouble them.

They'll find good companions to read and recite this sutra with them. They'll find large crowds coming to listen. And when people hear it, they'll be able to hold it. When they hold it, they'll be able to recite it. When they recite it, they'll be able to explain it. When they explain it, they'll be able to write it down, or get others to write it.

They'll make offerings to the sutra scroll, treat it with respect and honor, praise it and treasure it."


THE BUDDHA MAKES IT RHYTHM ONE MORE TIME

Then the World-Honored One, wanting to make this meaning clear, spoke in rhythm:

If you want to teach this sutra,
cast off jealousy and hatred and pride,
Cast off deceit and lying,
always practice straight honest conduct.

Don't look down on people,
don't argue about the Dharma,
Don't make others doubt and regret,
don't tell them they can't reach Buddhahood.

When this child of Buddha teaches,
they're always gentle, patient,
Compassionate to everyone,
never slacking off.

The great bodhisattvas of ten directions,
they practice the Way out of compassion—
Generate respect for them,
say "These are my great teachers."

Toward all the Buddha World-Honored Ones,
hold them as supreme fathers.
Break down your prideful heart
and you'll teach without obstruction.

This third practice is like this—
the wise should guard it well.
Single-heartedly dwell in peaceful practice
and countless people will respect you.


FOURTH PRACTICE: THE DEEPEST COMPASSION

"Now, Mañjuśrī, there's more to say about bodhisattvas in the last age when the Dharma's dying, those who hold this Lotus Sutra.

Toward those who've left home and those still in the household life, generate great compassion. Toward those who aren't bodhisattvas, generate even greater compassion—a vast compassion.

You should think like this: 'These people, they suffering a great loss. The Tathagata teaches with skillful means according to what people need, but these folks—they don't hear it, don't know it, don't perceive it. They don't ask about it, don't believe it, don't understand it.

But even though they don't ask, don't believe, don't understand this sutra, when I reach complete perfect enlightenment, wherever they are, I'm gonna use my spiritual power and my wisdom power to draw them in, lead them here, make them dwell in this teaching.'

Mañjuśrī, if a bodhisattva after the Tathagata passes on accomplishes this fourth practice, when they teach this sutra they won't make no mistakes, won't fall into error.

They'll always be honored by monks and nuns, by laymen and laywomen, by kings and princes, by government officials and common people, by priests and householders. They'll receive offerings, respect, honor, and praise.

The gods in the sky, wanting to hear the teaching, will constantly attend them. Whether they're in a village or a city or in an empty forest, if someone comes wanting to challenge them with hard questions, the gods day and night will protect them for the sake of the Dharma. They'll make everyone who hears rejoice.

Why? Because this sutra is protected by the spiritual power of all Buddhas—past, future, and present.

Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra—in countless lands you can't even hear its name, much less see it, hold it, read it, or recite it!"


THE PARABLE OF THE KING'S CROWN JEWEL

"Mañjuśrī, let me tell you a story so you understand what I'm saying:

Imagine a powerful wheel-turning king—a king who rules with righteousness. He wants to bring all the nations under his rule using his authority. But some small kings won't submit to his command.

So this wheel-turning king raises up an army and goes to war against them. When he sees his soldiers fighting with courage, accomplishing difficult things, he's filled with joy. According to what they've accomplished, he gives rewards.

He gives them fields and houses, villages and cities. He gives them fine clothes and beautiful ornaments. He gives them all kinds of treasures—gold and silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, coral and amber. He gives them elephants and horses and carriages, slaves and servants, common people to work their lands.

But there's one thing he doesn't give: the bright jewel in his crown—the pearl on top of his head. Why? Because only the king has this one jewel, this unique treasure at the very crown of his head. If he gave it away, all his retinue would be shocked and amazed.

Well, Mañjuśrī, the Tathagata is like this. Through the power of meditation and wisdom, he gained the territory of the Dharma. He rules over the three realms. But the demon kings wouldn't submit.

So the Tathagata's worthy sages—his spiritual warriors—fought against those demons. When they showed great accomplishment, the Tathagata's heart was filled with joy.

In the assembly of the four groups, he taught all kinds of sutras to make their hearts rejoice. He gave them the treasures of meditation and liberation, of undefiled roots and powers, of various dharmas. He also gave them the city of nirvana, telling them they'd reached extinction. He guided their hearts and made them all rejoice.

But he didn't teach them this Lotus Sutra. Not yet.

Mañjuśrī, it's like when that wheel-turning king saw soldiers accomplish great things—things hard to believe—he was so joyful that he finally gave them that jewel that's hard to believe in, that pearl he kept so long in his crown, that treasure he never casually gave to anyone. Now he gives it.

The Tathagata is like this. In the three realms he's the great Dharma king. With teachings he educates all beings. He sees his army of sages fighting against the five-aggregate demon, the affliction demon, and the death demon. He sees them accomplish great merit—destroying the three poisons, escaping the three realms, breaking through the demon's net.

At that time the Tathagata is greatly joyful.

This Lotus Sutra can lead beings to complete wisdom. All the world finds it hard to believe—full of hatred for it, hard to trust. This is what he never taught before. But now he teaches it.

Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the first teaching among all the Tathagatas' teachings. Among all teachings, it's the most profound. At the very end he bestows it, just like that powerful king finally giving up that bright pearl he protected so long.

Mañjuśrī, this Lotus Sutra is the secret treasury of all Buddhas and Tathagatas. Among all sutras, it stands at the very top. Through the long night I've guarded it, never carelessly teaching it. But now today I give it to you all and expound it fully."


THE BUDDHA BRINGS IT HOME IN RHYTHM

Then the World-Honored One, wanting to make this meaning sink deep, spoke in rhythm:

Always practice patience,
have compassion for everyone—
Only then can you teach
this sutra the Buddha praises.

In the last age,
those who hold this teaching
Toward those in homes and those who left them,
toward those who aren't bodhisattvas,

Should generate compassion.
If they don't hear this,
Don't believe this sutra,
they're suffering a great loss.

When I achieve Buddhahood
I'll use skillful means
To teach them this dharma,
make them dwell in it.

It's like that powerful
wheel-turning king:
When soldiers fight with courage
he rewards them with everything—

Elephants, horses, carriages,
beautiful ornaments,
Fields and houses,
villages and cities,

Fine clothes
and all kinds of treasures,
Slaves and servants and wealth—
joyfully he gives it all.

But when someone shows real courage,
does something truly difficult,
The king takes off that crown jewel,
that bright pearl, and gives it to them.

The Tathagata is like this:
He's king of all the dharmas,
With the great power of patience,
with the treasure-house of wisdom,

With great compassion
he teaches the world according to truth.
Seeing all people
receiving suffering and trouble,

Wanting to seek liberation,
fighting against demons,
For these beings
he teaches all kinds of dharmas,

With great skillful means
he teaches various sutras.
Once he knows beings
have gained their power,

At the very end
he teaches this Lotus,
Like that king taking off his crown,
giving that bright pearl.

This sutra is most honored,
highest among all sutras.
I've always guarded it,
never carelessly revealed it.

Now is the right time
to teach it to you all.
After I pass on,
those seeking the Buddha Way,

Wanting to teach this sutra
in peace and safety,
Should draw near
to these four practices.

Those who read this sutra
will always be free from worry,
Also free from sickness,
their face bright and fresh.

They won't be born into poverty,
lowliness, or ugliness.
All beings love to see them,
admire them like sages.

The children of heaven
will serve and attend them.
Swords won't touch them,
poison can't harm them.

If someone tries to curse them,
that person's mouth will close up.
They'll walk without fear
like a lion king.

Their wisdom light will shine
bright as the sun itself.
And in their dreams
they'll see only wonderful things.


THE BEAUTIFUL DREAMS OF THE DHARMA HOLDER

They'll see the Tathagatas
sitting on lion thrones,
Surrounded by assemblies of monks,
teaching the Dharma.

They'll see dragons and spirits,
asuras and others,
Numerous as Ganges sands,
palms joined in respect.

They'll see themselves
teaching the Dharma to them all.
They'll see the Buddhas
with bodies colored like gold,

Radiating boundless light,
illuminating everything,
With brahma voices
expounding all the dharmas.

The Buddha teaching the four groups
the supreme dharma—
They'll see themselves standing there,
palms joined, praising Buddha,

Hearing the Dharma with joy,
making offerings,
Receiving dhāraṇī,
attaining wisdom that won't retreat.

The Buddha knows their mind
has entered deep into the Buddha Way,
So he gives them a prophecy,
tells them they'll achieve perfect enlightenment:

"You, good person,
in the age to come
Will gain the boundless wisdom,
the great Way of Buddha.

Your land will be pure,
vast and beyond compare.
You too will have four groups
with palms joined, hearing the Dharma."

They'll also see themselves
in mountain forests,
Practicing good dharmas,
realizing true reality,

Entering deep into meditation,
seeing Buddhas in ten directions—
Those Buddhas with golden bodies,
adorned with a hundred blessed marks.

Hearing the Dharma, teaching it to others—
always having these beautiful dreams.

They'll also dream they're a king
who renounces palace and family,
Gives up the supreme five desires,
goes to the place of enlightenment,

Sits under the bodhi tree
on a lion throne,
Seeks the Way for seven days,
obtains the wisdom of all Buddhas.

Having achieved the supreme Way,
they rise and turn the Dharma wheel,
Teaching the four groups
for thousands of millions of ages,

Teaching the undefiled wondrous Dharma,
liberating countless beings.
Then finally entering nirvana
like smoke disappearing, like a lamp going out.

If in the evil age
you teach this first dharma,
That person gains great benefit,
all these merits I've described.

CLOSING NOTE FROM THE TRANSLATOR:

This chapter is survival wisdom for spiritual teachers in corrupt times. The Buddha ain't talking theory here—he's giving practical instructions for how to keep your soul clean when the world's gone wrong.

The four practices are like concentric circles of protection:
1. Your inner ground (patience, non-grasping, seeing clearly)
2. Your outer associations (who you don't run with, what you don't do)
3. Your speech and heart (how you talk, what you hold inside)
4. Your ultimate compassion (even for those who reject you)

The crown jewel parable is central: The Lotus Sutra is what the Buddha held back until his spiritual warriors had proven themselves, until they'd fought through their own demons and poisons. It's the final gift, the supreme teaching, given only when folks are ready.

And the beautiful dreams at the end—that's confirmation. That's how you know you're on the right path. When you hold this teaching right, it holds you back. You walk protected. Your dreams become prophecies. Even sleep becomes teaching.

This is practical mysticism. This is how you teach the highest truth in the lowest times without becoming what you're fighting against.
