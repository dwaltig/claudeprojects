| B-1.1 | Listen now, this is what I heard with my own ears. |
| B-1.2 | Right then, the Buddha was surrounded on all four sides—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen—all of them offering him respect, honoring him, praising him. And he started teaching them a scripture of the Great Vehicle, a text called "The Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings"—a teaching for those bodhisattvas, a teaching that the Buddha himself protects and keeps in mind. |
| B-1.3 | And then the Buddha sent out a beam of light from between his eyebrows—right from that white hair-mark there—and it lit up eighteen thousand worlds to the east, every last corner of them, down to the deepest hell called Avīci where suffering don't quit, all the way up to Akaniṣṭha Heaven where the highest gods dwell. |
| B-1.4 | Right then, Maitreya Bodhisattva—the one who's coming next—he thought to himself: "Now what's going on here? The World-Honored One is showing us signs and wonders. What's the cause of all this? The Buddha's gone into a meditation so deep you can't think your way into it, and he's showing us things we never seen before. Who should I ask about this? Who could answer?" |
| B-1.5 | Right then, Mañjuśrī spoke to Maitreya Bodhisattva and all those great beings and good men, saying: |
| B-1.6 | Right then, in front of that whole great assembly, Mañjuśrī wanted to say it all again in verse form. So he spoke in rhythm and rhyme: |
| B-2.1 | Now at that time, you see, the World-Honored One—he rose up from his meditation, rose up calm and peaceful-like, and he turned to Śāriputra and said: |
| B-2.2 | At that time, in the great assembly, there was disciples—them with no more outflows, them arhats—Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya and the rest, twelve hundred of them. And there was others too, monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, who done set their mind on the disciple vehicle or the solitary-walker vehicle. Every one of them thought to themselves: |
| B-2.3 | At that time, the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Stop, stop. Don't need to say no more. If I speak about this matter, all them beings in all the worlds—the heavenly folk and the human folk—they all gonna be shocked and full of doubt." |
| B-2.4 | At that time, the World-Honored One told Śāriputra: "You done earnestly asked three times now. How can I not speak? Now you listen carefully, think about it well, remember it good. I'm gonna break it down for you clear and distinct." |
| B-2.5 | The Buddha told Śāriputra: |
| B-2.6 | "Śāriputra, them Buddhas of the past, they used countless, numberless skillful means—all kinds of causes, all kinds of comparisons, all kinds of expressions—to teach dharma for living beings. All them dharmas was for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All them living beings who heard the dharma from the Buddhas—in the end, they all obtained the wisdom of all modes. |
| B-2.7 | "Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions, there ain't even two vehicles, much less three. |
| B-2.8 | At that time, the World-Honored One, wanting to speak this meaning again, he said it in verse: |
| B-3.1 | Right then, Śāriputra—his heart just leaping up—he stood up, put his palms together, looked straight at the Buddha's face, and said: |
| B-3.2 | Then Śāriputra, wanting to say it again, spoke in verse: |
| B-3.3 | Right then the Buddha told Śāriputra: |
| B-3.4 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say it again, spoke in verse: |
| B-3.5 | Right then the four groups—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen—and the dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, and all the rest of the great assembly, they saw Śāriputra receiving that prophecy of supreme perfect enlightenment right there in front of the Buddha. Their hearts got filled with joy, leaping up beyond measure. Each one took off the best robe they was wearing and offered it to the Buddha. |
| B-3.6 | Right then them divine beings, wanting to say it again, spoke in verse: |
| B-3.7 | Right then Śāriputra said to the Buddha: |
| B-3.8 | Right then the Buddha told Śāriputra: |
| B-3.9 | "Śāriputra, say there's a country, a town, a village somewhere. And in that place there's a great elder—old man, getting on in years, but rich beyond measure. Got fields and houses, got servants and workers. His house is big, real big, but it only got one door. |
| B-3.10 | "Śāriputra, that elder started thinking: |
| B-3.11 | "Right then that elder thought: |
| B-3.12 | "Right then, when them children heard their father talking about these precious playthings, just what they wanted, each one of them got bold and excited. They started pushing each other, competing with each other, racing and running, fighting to get out of that fire house. |
| B-3.13 | "Śāriputra, right then that elder gave each one of his children the same thing—one great cart. These carts was high and wide, decorated with all kinds of jewels, surrounded by railings, with bells hanging on all four sides. On top of that, they had canopies spread out, also adorned with all kinds of rare and precious jewels. Jeweled ropes crisscrossed everywhere, flower garlands hanging down, layers of soft cushions inside, and fine pillows set out. |
| B-3.14 | "Śāriputra, what you think? Did that elder lie when he gave all his children these precious great carts equally, instead of them small carts?" |
| B-3.15 | The Buddha told Śāriputra: |
| B-3.16 | "Śāriputra, the Tathāgata thought again: |
| B-3.17 | "Śāriputra, if there's living beings who got wisdom-nature inside them, they hear the Dharma from the Buddha World-Honored One, they believe and receive it, they work hard with diligence, they want to get out of the triple world quick and seek nirvāṇa for themselves—this is called the voice-hearer vehicle. Like them children seeking the sheep cart to get out of the fire house. |
| B-3.18 | "Śāriputra, just like that elder—when he saw his children get out of the fire house safe, reaching that fearless place, he thought about his boundless wealth, and he gave the great cart equally to all his children. |
| B-3.19 | The Buddha, wanting to say this meaning again, spoke in verse: |
| B-3.20 | I'm telling you, Śāriputra, |
| B-3.21 | If there's people with small wisdom, |
| B-3.22 | And also, Śāriputra, |
| B-3.23 | But if there's people with sharp faculties, |
| B-4.1 | "World-Honored One, we got a story to tell, a parable to make this meaning clear. Let us lay it out for you: |
| B-4.2 | "World-Honored One, this is how it went: |
| B-4.3 | "Now the rich old man was sitting up on that lion throne, and he saw the boy. Recognized him immediately. His heart exploded with joy. He thought to himself: 'NOW I got somebody to inherit all my wealth and treasures and storehouses! I been thinking about this child day and night, had no way to see him, and now he just showed up on his own - this is exactly what I been praying for! I'm old now, getting ancient, but I still care about all this wealth, still want to pass it on.' |
| B-4.4 | "Now the old man, he wanted to draw his son back home, so he set up a plan, used skillful means. He secretly sent two men - men who looked poor and worn down, didn't have no impressive appearance. He told them: 'Go find that poor man and tell him gently: We got work here, and we'll pay you double wages. If he agrees, bring him here to work. If he asks what kind of work, tell him: We'll hire you to clear away dung and trash. Tell him we'll be working right alongside him.' |
| B-4.5 | "World-Honored One, then the time came when the old man got sick. He knew death wasn't far off. He said to the poor son: 'I got a lot of gold and silver and jewels, and my storehouses is overflowing. You know how much is in there, what needs to be brought in and taken out - you know all about it. This is what I want - you need to understand my heart in this. Why am I telling you? 'Cause now, you and me ain't no different. You need to pay careful attention so nothing gets lost or wasted.' |
| B-4.6 | "World-Honored One, that rich old man - that's the Tathāgata. And we're all like Buddha's children. The Tathāgata has always been saying we are his sons. |
| B-4.7 | Then Mahākāśyapa, wanting to say this meaning again, spoke in verse: |
| B-5.1 | Now when the Buddha heard what Mahākāśyapa and them other great disciples had to say, he smiled and said: |
| B-5.2 | "Now Kāśyapa, let me tell you a story. Let me paint you a picture: |
| B-5.3 | "Now Kāśyapa, understand this: The Tathāgata is just like that. When the Buddha appears in this world, he's like that great cloud rising up. His voice - his great voice - spreads everywhere, reaching the gods and humans and asuras, covering the whole world like that cloud covers the three-thousand-fold universe. |
| B-5.4 | "Listen: When the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma, it's one mark, one flavor. What flavor is that? The flavor of liberation - the mark of freedom, the mark of letting go, the mark of extinction. It all leads to one place: the ground of all-knowing wisdom. |
| B-5.5 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say this teaching again, spoke it in verse: |
| B-6.1 | CHAPTER SIX: THE NAMING |
| B-6.2 | (When the Teacher Calls Out Who You're Gonna Be) |
| B-6.3 | Now when the World-Honored One finished singing that verse, he turned to all the folks gathered round and he said it loud and clear: |
| B-6.4 | "I got something to tell you about this disciple of mine, Mahākāśyapa. I see him. I see who he's gonna be. In the world that's coming, he gonna meet three hundred million billion Buddhas. Three hundred million billion! He gonna serve them, honor them, respect them, praise them. He gonna spread the boundless teaching far and wide. And then—you hear me now—in his very last body, he gonna become a Buddha himself. |
| B-6.5 | "His name gonna be Light Brightness Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed Guide, the Tamer of Hearts, the Teacher of Gods and Human Folk, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. |
| B-6.6 | "His world gonna be called Light and Virtue. The age gonna be called Great Majesty. That Buddha gonna live twelve small ages. The true Dharma gonna stand for twenty small ages, and the reflected Dharma gonna stand another twenty. |
| B-6.7 | "And let me tell you about that land: It gonna be beautiful. No filth, no rubble, no thorns, no waste. That ground gonna be level—no hills, no valleys, no pits, no bumps. The ground gonna be made of lapis lazuli, and treasure trees gonna stand in rows. Golden ropes gonna mark the boundaries of the roads, and precious flowers gonna be scattered everywhere. That whole land gonna be clean, clean, clean. |
| B-6.8 | "In that country, there gonna be countless thousands of billions of bodhisattvas. The voice-hearers gonna be beyond counting too. There won't be no trouble from demons—though demons and demon-folk will be there, they all gonna protect the Buddha's teaching." |
| B-6.9 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say it again in song, spoke these verses: |
| B-6.10 | I'm telling you monks here, |
| B-6.11 | After ages beyond counting, |
| B-6.12 | Three hundred million billion Buddhas, |
| B-6.13 | After serving the highest, |
| B-6.14 | In his very last body, |
| B-6.15 | Many treasure trees standing, |
| B-6.16 | Sweet fragrance always rising, |
| B-6.17 | That ground gonna be level, |
| B-6.18 | Their hearts gonna be gentle, |
| B-6.19 | Voice-hearers beyond counting, |
| B-6.20 | Even with the eye of heaven |
| B-6.21 | The true Dharma gonna last |
| B-6.22 | Light Brightness, World-Honored One— |
| B-6.23 | *** |
| B-6.24 | Now at that time, Mahāmaudgalyāyana and Subhūti and Mahākātyāyana, they all started trembling. They put their palms together and they looked up at the Honored One's face and they couldn't take their eyes away. And together, with one voice, they sang out in verse: |
| B-6.25 | Great Hero, World-Honored One, |
| B-6.26 | If you know what's in our deep heart, |
| B-6.27 | Like a man from a hungry land |
| B-6.28 | He don't dare just eat right away, |
| B-6.29 | We're just like that, you know— |
| B-6.30 | We heard you say with your Buddha-voice |
| B-6.31 | But if you name us, if you call our name, |
| B-6.32 | Great Hero, World-Honored One, |
| B-6.33 | *** |
| B-6.34 | Now the World-Honored One, he knew what was in his great disciples' hearts, and he turned to all the monks and said: |
| B-6.35 | "This Subhūti here—in the world that's coming, he gonna meet and serve three hundred million billion nayuta Buddhas. He gonna serve them, honor them, respect them, praise them. He gonna practice that pure holy life always. He gonna complete the bodhisattva way. And then in his very last body, he gonna become a Buddha. |
| B-6.36 | "His name gonna be Fame Mark Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed Guide, the Tamer of Hearts, the Teacher of Gods and Human Folk, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. |
| B-6.37 | "The age gonna be called Having Treasure. The world gonna be called Treasure Born. |
| B-6.38 | "That land gonna be level, with crystal for the ground. Treasure trees gonna make it beautiful. No hills, no pits, no sand, no gravel, no thorns, no filth. Precious flowers gonna cover the ground, clean all over. The people of that land gonna live in jeweled pavilions, in wonderful towers and terraces. |
| B-6.39 | "The voice-hearer disciples gonna be beyond measure, beyond counting—you couldn't calculate them with numbers or comparisons. The bodhisattvas gonna number in the countless thousands of millions of billions of nayutas. |
| B-6.40 | "That Buddha gonna live twelve small ages. The true Dharma gonna stand twenty small ages, and the reflected Dharma gonna stand another twenty. |
| B-6.41 | "That Buddha gonna dwell always in emptiness, teaching the Dharma to the assembly, liberating countless bodhisattvas and voice-hearers." |
| B-6.42 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say it again in song, spoke these verses: |
| B-6.43 | You monks gathered here, |
| B-6.44 | My great disciple here, |
| B-6.45 | He gonna serve countless, |
| B-6.46 | In his very last body earned, |
| B-6.47 | That Buddha's land gonna be |
| B-6.48 | That Buddha in the middle there |
| B-6.49 | All of them sharp and keen, |
| B-6.50 | Voice-hearers beyond all count, |
| B-6.51 | That Buddha's teaching gonna be |
| B-6.52 | Gods and human folk there |
| B-6.53 | That Buddha gonna live, we're told, |
| B-6.54 | *** |
| B-6.55 | Then the World-Honored One turned again to the assembly and said: |
| B-6.56 | "Now I'm telling you about this Great Kātyāyana here. In the world that's coming, he gonna serve and honor eight thousand billion Buddhas with all manner of offerings. He gonna respect them, revere them. |
| B-6.57 | "After each of those Buddhas passes on, he gonna build them a stupa—a thousand yojanas high, five hundred yojanas wide and deep, all perfectly square. He gonna make them out of gold and silver and lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl and agate and pearl and rose quartz—all seven precious things combined. He gonna offer to those stupas flowers and garlands, ointments and incense powders and burning incense, silk canopies and banners. |
| B-6.58 | "After that's done, he gonna serve another twenty million billion Buddhas, just the same way. |
| B-6.59 | "After serving all those Buddhas, after completing the bodhisattva way, he gonna become a Buddha himself. |
| B-6.60 | "His name gonna be Jambū River Gold Light Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed Guide, the Tamer of Hearts, the Teacher of Gods and Human Folk, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. |
| B-6.61 | "That land gonna be level, with crystal for the ground. Treasure trees gonna make it beautiful. Golden ropes gonna mark the roads. Wonderful flowers gonna cover the ground, clean all over, and everyone who sees it gonna rejoice. |
| B-6.62 | "There won't be no four evil paths there—no hell, no hungry ghosts, no animals, no fighting demons. There gonna be many gods and many human folk, many voice-hearers and many bodhisattvas—countless millions and billions beautifying that land. |
| B-6.63 | "That Buddha gonna live twelve small ages. The true Dharma gonna stand twenty small ages, and the reflected Dharma gonna stand another twenty." |
| B-6.64 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say it again in song, spoke these verses: |
| B-6.65 | All you monks here, |
| B-6.66 | This Kātyāyana here, |
| B-6.67 | After those Buddhas gone, |
| B-6.68 | In his very last frame, |
| B-6.69 | Liberating countless souls, |
| B-6.70 | That Buddha's light gonna be |
| B-6.71 | Bodhisattvas and voice-hearers there, |
| B-6.72 | *** |
| B-6.73 | Then the World-Honored One turned once more to the great assembly and said: |
| B-6.74 | "Now I'm telling you about Great Maudgalyāyana here. He gonna serve eight thousand Buddhas with all manner of offerings, honoring them, revering them. |
| B-6.75 | "After each of those Buddhas passes on, he gonna build them a stupa—a thousand yojanas high, five hundred yojanas wide and deep, all perfectly square. He gonna make them out of gold and silver and lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl and agate and pearl and rose quartz—all seven precious things combined. He gonna offer to those stupas flowers and garlands, ointments and incense powders and burning incense, silk canopies and banners. |
| B-6.76 | "After that's done, he gonna serve another two hundred million billion Buddhas, just the same way. |
| B-6.77 | "Then he gonna become a Buddha himself. |
| B-6.78 | "His name gonna be Tamāla Sandalwood Fragrance Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed Guide, the Tamer of Hearts, the Teacher of Gods and Human Folk, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. |
| B-6.79 | "The age gonna be called Joy Fulfilled. The world gonna be called Delightful. |
| B-6.80 | "That land gonna be level, with crystal for the ground. Treasure trees gonna make it beautiful. Pearls gonna be scattered like flowers, clean all over, and everyone who sees it gonna rejoice. |
| B-6.81 | "There gonna be many gods and many human folk, many bodhisattvas and many voice-hearers, beyond all counting. |
| B-6.82 | "That Buddha gonna live twenty-four small ages. The true Dharma gonna stand forty small ages, and the reflected Dharma gonna stand another forty." |
| B-6.83 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say it again in song, spoke these verses: |
| B-6.84 | This disciple of mine here, |
| B-6.85 | Buddhas, World-Honored Ones. |
| B-6.86 | In the presence of all those Buddhas there, |
| B-6.87 | After those Buddhas passed away, |
| B-6.88 | To honor all those Buddha-stupas high. |
| B-6.89 | There he gonna become a Buddha true, |
| B-6.90 | Always for gods and human folk |
| B-6.91 | All perfected in the threefold sight, |
| B-6.92 | Their will set firm, their effort strong, |
| B-6.93 | Forty small ages long, |
| B-6.94 | All of them I'm gonna call, |
| B-6.95 | We got causes from way back when, |
| B-6.96 | *** |
| B-7.1 | Now the Buddha, he gathered them monks around him and said: |
| B-7.2 | The Buddha told them monks: |
| B-7.3 | "Now the gods from the Thirty-Three Heavens, they had already prepared for this Buddha. Under that bodhi tree, they laid out a lion throne, high as a mile up in the air. The Buddha was meant to sit on that throne and attain supreme perfect enlightenment. |
| B-7.4 | "Brothers," the Buddha said, "after ten small ages passed, the Buddha-truths finally appeared before Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha, and he achieved that supreme perfect enlightenment. |
| B-7.5 | Then them sixteen princes, after they finished singing the Buddha's praise, urged the World-Honored One to turn the Dharma wheel. They all said together: |
| B-7.6 | The Buddha told them monks: |
| B-7.7 | Then in the eastern direction, in five hundred million billion countries, the palaces of the Brahma kings lit up with a brightness twice as bright as usual. Each of them Brahma kings thought to themselves: |
| B-7.8 | "And brothers," the Buddha continued, "from the southeast direction, five hundred million billion countries—the great Brahma kings in all them places saw their palaces glowing with light like never before. They got happy, started jumping for joy, filled with wonder. They went to visit each other to discuss what this meant. |
| B-7.9 | The Buddha continued: |
| B-7.10 | "At that time, them sixteen princes all left home as young boys to become novice monks. They had sharp faculties, bright and clear intelligence. They'd already made offerings to hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas in the past, practicing pure conduct, seeking that supreme perfect enlightenment. |
| B-7.11 | The Buddha told them monks: |
| B-7.12 | "Let me give you an example. Say there's a dangerous and terrible road, five hundred yojanas long, a desolate wilderness with no people, a frightening place. A big group of people wants to cross this road to get to where the treasure is. |
| B-7.13 | "Brothers, the Tathāgata is the same way. Right now I'm the great guide for all of you. I know that the road of birth-and-death and afflictions is dangerous, difficult, and long. You got to get away from it. You got to cross it. |
| B-8.1 | Now when Full Son heard all this - Full Son, that's Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra, best preacher man in the whole congregation - when he heard the Buddha laying out that wisdom, talking about how you got to meet folks where they are, speaking their language, teaching by whatever means it takes... and when he heard how the big-time disciples were getting their names called, getting told they gonna be Buddhas themselves someday... and when he heard about all the old-time connections, all that history stretching way back... and when he heard about how the Buddhas got more power and freedom than you can shake a stick at... |
| B-8.2 | Now the Buddha turned to all the monks and said: "Y'all see this Full Son, this Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra? I been saying it all along - among all the folks who can preach, he's number one. Nobody better. And I always been talking about all the different kinds of good he does - how hard he works, how he protects and holds up the teaching, how he helps me spread this Dharma. When it comes to teaching the four kinds of followers, he shows 'em the way, he teaches 'em right, he benefits 'em, he brings 'em joy. He can break down the Buddha's true teaching every which way, and he brings real benefit to everybody walking this holy path with him. Besides the Tathāgata himself, ain't nobody can match his way with words." |
| B-8.3 | Now his Buddha-land gonna include three thousand great thousand worlds - as many as the sands in the Ganges River - all rolled into one Buddha-land. The ground gonna be made of seven kinds of precious things. The land gonna be flat as the palm of your hand - no mountains, no valleys, no streams running through ravines, no ditches. Gonna be pavilions and towers made of seven precious things filling up that whole place. The palaces where the gods live gonna be floating right there in the sky, close by. Heaven and earth gonna meet, people and gods gonna see each other face to face. |
| B-8.4 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say all this again, spoke in verse: |
| B-8.5 | Now at that time, those twelve hundred arhats - the ones who done got their minds free - they was thinking: "We're so happy, we ain't never felt nothing like this before. If the World-Honored One would call our names one by one, give us our prophecies like he done for those other big-time disciples, wouldn't that be something sweet?" |
| B-8.6 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say this meaning again, spoke in verse: |
| B-8.7 | Now when those five hundred arhats got their prophecies called out right there in front of the Buddha, they was so happy they was jumping up and down. They rose up from their seats, went right to the Buddha, bowed down with their faces to his feet, and they confessed, they repented, they held themselves accountable: |
| B-8.8 | Then Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya and the others, wanting to say this meaning again, spoke in verse: |
| B-9.1 | CHAPTER NINE: WHEN THE FAITHFUL GET THEIR DUE |
| B-9.2 | (Prophecies for the Learners and the Learned) |
| B-9.3 | Now Ānanda and Rāhula, they been sitting there watching all these prophecies going out, and something starts stirring in their hearts. They thinking to themselves: "We been here all along, ain't we? Don't we get a word too? Wouldn't that be something—wouldn't that be sweet?" |
| B-9.4 | So they rise up from where they sitting, and they walk right up to the Teacher, and they bow down low, faces to his feet, showing proper respect. And together they speak up: |
| B-9.5 | "World-Honored One, we been thinking—we got a place in this too, don't we? Ain't nobody else we can turn to but you, Lord. You the only one. And everybody knows us—all the heavenly beings and earthly folk, even the demons know who we are. Ānanda here, he been standing by your side, keeping watch over every word you spoke, holding the teaching safe like a mama holds her baby. And Rāhula, well, he your own flesh and blood, your actual son. So if you gonna speak that supreme enlightenment over us, if you gonna call our names too—well, that would fill up what we been hoping for. That would satisfy what all these people been expecting. Our cup would overflow, and the crowd's cup too." |
| B-9.6 | Now there was two thousand disciples in that assembly—some still learning, working it out, still on the journey; some already graduated, got their lessons down. And when they heard Ānanda and Rāhula speak up, every last one of them rises to their feet. They slip their right shoulder out of their robes—that's the way you show respect—and they come forward to the Buddha, and they put their palms together, and they just stand there looking up at him with one heart, one hope, same desire Ānanda and Rāhula got. Just standing there on the side, waiting. Patient people. Faithful people. Been there all along. |
| B-9.7 | Then the Buddha, he turns to Ānanda and he says: |
| B-9.8 | "Ānanda, listen now. In the world that's coming, you gonna become a Buddha. They gonna call you Mountain-Sea-Wisdom-Free-Penetration-King Tathāgata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. |
| B-9.9 | "You gonna serve sixty-two billion Buddhas, gonna keep watch over the teaching for every one of them, protecting that Dharma like you been protecting mine. And after all that faithful service, after all that holding and keeping and remembering—then you gonna reach that supreme perfect enlightenment your own self. |
| B-9.10 | "You gonna teach twenty thousand million billion Ganges-river-sands worth of bodhisattvas, gonna bring them all the way up to that supreme perfect enlightenment. Your land gonna be called Constant-Victory-Banner-Standing—and child, that land gonna be clean. Pure as pure can be. The ground gonna be lapis lazuli, that deep blue stone, smooth and precious. And the era you teaching in, they gonna call it Wonderful-Sound-Pervading, 'cause your voice gonna fill everything, gonna reach everywhere. |
| B-9.11 | "Your life as a Buddha gonna last countless thousands of millions of billions of immeasurable eons—you can't even count it. You could spend a thousand million billion immeasurable eons trying to calculate it with your finest mathematics, and you still couldn't get the number. The true Dharma gonna last twice as long as your lifetime. The reflected Dharma gonna last twice as long as the true Dharma. |
| B-9.12 | "And Ānanda, this Mountain-Sea-Wisdom-Free-Penetration-King Buddha—that's you, child—you gonna be praised by innumerable thousands of millions of billions of Ganges-sands worth of Buddhas in all ten directions. They all gonna be singing your name, speaking your merit, telling what you done." |
| B-9.13 | Then the World-Honored One, he wants to make sure this truth sinks down deep, so he sings it out in verse, makes it a song they can remember: |
| B-9.14 | Right here in this assembly, I'm speaking it plain: |
| B-9.15 | They'll call you Mountain-Sea-Wisdom, Self-Mastered-King, |
| B-9.16 | Countless as the Ganges sand, that's how many you'll raise, |
| B-9.17 | You gonna live so long, child, out of love for what you teach, |
| B-9.18 | All those innumerable beings gonna plant their seeds |
| B-9.19 | Now there was eight thousand bodhisattvas in that gathering who just recently started out on the path, beginners really, and they looking at all this and they start wondering. They thinking to themselves: "Hold on now—we ain't even heard the great bodhisattvas, the advanced ones, getting prophecies like this. So what's the reason, what's the cause, that these voice-hearers, these disciples, getting such clear predictions?" |
| B-9.20 | The World-Honored One, he knows what they thinking—he can read a heart like you read a book. So he speaks to them directly: |
| B-9.21 | "Good sons, listen here. Me and Ānanda, we made our vows together way back when, under the Buddha called Empty-King. We both set our hearts on that supreme perfect enlightenment at the same time, same place. |
| B-9.22 | "But Ānanda, he always loved learning. He wanted to hear it all, study it all, remember it all. Me, I went the route of vigorous practice, constant pushing, hard work, discipline. That's why I already reached that supreme perfect enlightenment, and Ānanda—he been protecting my teaching, keeping the Dharma safe. He gonna protect the Dharma-treasure of all the Buddhas coming in the future too. He gonna teach and bring to completion multitudes of bodhisattvas. |
| B-9.23 | "That was his original vow, you see. That was his heart's desire from way back. That's why he gets this prophecy now. He been faithful to his calling." |
| B-9.24 | Now Ānanda, standing right there before the Buddha, hearing his own name called, hearing about that pure land that's coming, hearing every single thing he ever hoped for being confirmed—his heart just fills up. Joy like he never known before washes over him. It's unprecedented. Never felt nothing like it. |
| B-9.25 | And right then, in that moment, he remembers. He remembers the Dharma-treasures of countless thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas from the ancient past. All of it comes flooding back, and he understands it perfectly, no obstacles, clear as day—just like what he hearing right now. And he understands his original vow too. He remembers who he always been. |
| B-9.26 | So Ānanda, he sings out his own verse: |
| B-9.27 | World-Honored One, you so rare, so precious, so unique— |
| B-9.28 | I ain't got no doubts no more, I'm settled on this road, |
| B-9.29 | Then the Buddha turns to Rāhula and he says: |
| B-9.30 | "Rāhula, in the world to come, you gonna become a Buddha. They gonna call you Stepping-on-Seven-Jewel-Flowers Tathāgata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. |
| B-9.31 | "You gonna serve Buddhas numbering like the dust-motes in ten worlds, and you gonna always be the eldest son to all of them, just like you are to me right now. Always the firstborn. Always that close. |
| B-9.32 | "This Stepping-on-Seven-Jewel-Flowers Buddha—the purity of your land, how long you gonna live, how long the era lasts, how many disciples you gonna teach, the true Dharma period, the reflected Dharma period—all of it gonna be just like Mountain-Sea-Wisdom-Free-Penetration-King Tathāgata. No different. And you gonna be the eldest son to that Buddha too, before you step into your own enlightenment and become a Buddha yourself." |
| B-9.33 | Then the World-Honored One sings it in verse so they won't forget: |
| B-9.34 | When I was a prince in the palace, living that royal life, |
| B-9.35 | In the ages yet to come, he gonna see billions of Buddhas rise, |
| B-9.36 | Rāhula practices in secret, hidden deep inside, |
| B-9.37 | Billions and billions of merit, countless virtues he done stored, |
| B-9.38 | Now the World-Honored One, he looks out at those two thousand people—learners and learned, still-training and beyond-training—and he sees that their hearts are soft now, quiet and clean, peaceful and pure, all of them looking at him with one mind, one gaze. |
| B-9.39 | The Buddha says to Ānanda: "You see these two thousand people—the learners and the learned?" |
| B-9.40 | Ānanda says: "Yes, Lord, I see them." |
| B-9.41 | "Ānanda, every single one of these people gonna serve Buddhas numbering like the dust-motes in fifty worlds. They gonna honor them, respect them, protect the Dharma-treasure for every one. |
| B-9.42 | "And then, at the end, they all gonna become Buddhas at the same time, in the same moment, in lands throughout the ten directions. And they all gonna have the same name—every last one. They gonna be called Jewel-Mark Tathāgata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. |
| B-9.43 | "They all gonna live for one eon. The purity of their lands, the number of voice-hearers and bodhisattvas, the true Dharma period, the reflected Dharma period—all of it gonna be exactly equal, exactly the same. No difference between them. All equal. All honored." |
| B-9.44 | The World-Honored One sings it again to make it stick: |
| B-9.45 | These two thousand voice-hearers standing here today, |
| B-9.46 | They gonna serve as many Buddhas as the dustmotes I described, |
| B-9.47 | Each in their own direction, in lands spread all around, |
| B-9.48 | Every one called Jewel-Mark—that's the name they'll bear, |
| B-9.49 | All of them using supernatural powers to save beings far and wide, |
| B-9.50 | When those two thousand learners and learned ones heard the Buddha speak their prophecy, they couldn't hold it in. Joy jumped up in them, they started leaping and dancing, and they sang back to him: |
| B-9.51 | World-Honored One, you a lamp of wisdom burning bright, |
| B-10.1 | CHAPTER TEN: HONOR THE WORD-CARRIERS |
| B-10.2 | (The Teachers of the Dharma) |
| B-10.3 | Now at that time, the World-Honored One, he turns to Medicine King Bodhisattva, and through him he's talking to eighty thousand great beings, and he says: |
| B-10.4 | "Medicine King, you see this great crowd gathered here? You see all these countless heavenly beings, dragon-kings, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas? You see the human folks and the non-human folks? You see the monks and nuns, the lay brothers and lay sisters? You see those seeking to be voice-hearers, those seeking solitary enlightenment, those seeking the Buddha-way? |
| B-10.5 | "Listen now: Every single one of these people—if they hear even one verse, even one sentence of this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra while standing here before me, if they feel even one moment of joy rising in their hearts—I'm giving them all a prophecy right now. Every last one. They all gonna reach that supreme perfect enlightenment. All of them. No exceptions." |
| B-10.6 | Then the Buddha says to Medicine King: |
| B-10.7 | "Now let me tell you about after I'm gone, after I leave this world. If there's anybody who hears this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra—even just one verse, just one sentence—and feels one moment of joy in their heart, I'm giving them that prophecy too. They gonna reach that supreme perfect enlightenment. |
| B-10.8 | "And if there's people who receive and uphold this sutra, who read it, recite it, explain it to others, copy it down—even if it's just one verse—if they look at this scripture with reverence like they looking at the Buddha himself, if they make offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners and flags, clothing, music, even just bringing their palms together in respect— |
| B-10.9 | "Medicine King, you need to know: These people already served ten thousand billion Buddhas in the past. They already made great vows in the presence of all those Buddhas. Out of compassion for suffering beings, they chose to be born here in this human world. They came here on purpose." |
| B-10.10 | "Medicine King, if somebody asks you, 'Which beings are gonna become Buddhas in the future?'—you should point to these people right here. Point to the ones who receive and uphold this Lotus Sutra. You should say: 'These people right here, they gonna become Buddhas in the future world. Guaranteed.' |
| B-10.11 | "Why? Because if good men or good women receive even one sentence of the Lotus Sutra, if they uphold it, read it, recite it, explain it, copy it down, if they make offerings to the scripture-scroll with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners and flags, clothing, music, bringing their palms together in reverence— |
| B-10.12 | "These people deserve the respect of the whole world. You should honor them the same way you honor the Buddha himself. You need to know: This person is a great bodhisattva. They already accomplished that supreme perfect enlightenment. Out of pity for suffering beings, they chose to be born here in this world to widely proclaim and explain this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra. |
| B-10.13 | "How much more so for someone who can receive the whole thing, who makes all kinds of offerings? That person is beyond measure." |
| B-10.14 | "Medicine King, you need to understand something: These people gave up their clean, pure rewards. After I'm gone, out of compassion for suffering beings, they chose to be born in this evil world just to spread this sutra far and wide. |
| B-10.15 | "If a good man or good woman, after I'm gone, can secretly teach even one person even one sentence of the Lotus Sutra—you need to know this person is sent by the Buddha himself. The Buddha dispatched them. They're doing the Buddha's own work. |
| B-10.16 | "How much more so for someone who teaches it broadly to the crowds?" |
| B-10.17 | "Medicine King, listen to this: If there's an evil person with a bad heart who stands before the Buddha for a whole eon—a whole cosmic age—and constantly curses the Buddha, insults him, speaks against him—well, that sin is still relatively light. |
| B-10.18 | "But if somebody speaks even one evil word, one bad word, against someone who reads and recites the Lotus Sutra—whether they're a monk or a laywoman, whether they left home or still got a home—if you badmouth a teacher of this sutra, that sin is far, far heavier. You hear me? Far heavier." |
| B-10.19 | "Medicine King, anyone who reads and recites the Lotus Sutra—you need to know this person is adorned with the Buddha's own adornment. They're carried on the Buddha's own shoulders. The Buddha himself is carrying them. |
| B-10.20 | "Wherever they go, you should turn toward them and bow. You should bring your palms together with single-minded focus. You should honor them, serve them, respect them, praise them. Offer them flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners and flags, clothing, fine food, make music for them. Bring them the best offerings that humans can bring, the finest you got. You should scatter heavenly treasures on them. You should present them with collections of heavenly jewels. |
| B-10.21 | "Why? Why all this honor? |
| B-10.22 | "Because this person joyfully teaches the Dharma. If you hear them for just a moment, just a little while, you immediately reach the ultimate—that supreme perfect enlightenment. That's why." |
| B-10.23 | At that time, the World-Honored One, wanting to say this again so it sinks down deep, sings it out in verse: |
| B-10.24 | If you want to walk the Buddha-road, |
| B-10.25 | If you want to quickly gain |
| B-10.26 | If there's anybody who can receive and uphold |
| B-10.27 | Those who can receive and uphold this teaching here, |
| B-10.28 | You need to know people like this, |
| B-10.29 | You should make offerings with heavenly flowers and incense sweet, |
| B-10.30 | After I'm gone, in that evil world to come, |
| B-10.31 | Bring them the finest food, the sweetest tastes, |
| B-10.32 | If there's somebody in the future world |
| B-10.33 | If for a whole eon long |
| B-10.34 | But if somebody reads, recites, and holds |
| B-10.35 | If there's somebody seeking Buddha's way |
| B-10.36 | They get immeasurable merit from praising Buddha so, |
| B-10.37 | For eighty billion eons long, |
| B-10.38 | After making all those offerings, precious and refined, |
| B-10.39 | Medicine King, I'm telling you plain, |
| B-10.40 | At that time the Buddha spoke again to Medicine King Bodhisattva Mahāsattva: |
| B-10.41 | "The scriptures I have taught are countless—thousands, ten thousands, billions. The ones I've already spoken, the ones I'm speaking now, the ones I will speak in the future—among all of them, this Lotus Sutra is the most difficult to believe, the most difficult to understand. |
| B-10.42 | "Medicine King, this sutra is the secret treasury of all the Buddhas. It's the treasure-room, the locked vault. You can't just hand it out, can't just pass it around carelessly to anybody. This is what all the Buddhas in all the worlds have guarded and protected from ancient times until now. This teaching has never been revealed openly before. |
| B-10.43 | "And this sutra—even while the Buddha is still alive, still in the world, there's plenty of hatred toward it, plenty of jealousy. How much more so after the Buddha's gone?" |
| B-10.44 | "Medicine King, you need to know: After the Buddha leaves this world, if there's people who can copy this sutra, uphold it, read it, recite it, make offerings to it, explain it to others—the Buddha himself will cover them with his robe. He'll wrap them up, keep them safe. |
| B-10.45 | "And they'll be protected and thought of by all the Buddhas in other lands, Buddhas who are alive right now in those worlds. These people got great faith-power, great will-power, great roots of goodness. |
| B-10.46 | "You need to know: These people sleep in the same room as the Buddha. The Buddha himself lays his hand on their heads. He touches them." |
| B-10.47 | "Medicine King, wherever this sutra is spoken, wherever it's read, wherever it's recited, wherever it's copied down, wherever the scripture-scroll stays—in all those places you should build a stupa made of seven precious materials. Make it extremely high, extremely wide, extremely decorated and beautiful. |
| B-10.48 | "You don't need to put relics in it. You hear me? No need for relics. |
| B-10.49 | "Why? Because this sutra right here already contains the Buddha's whole body. The complete body is already in there. |
| B-10.50 | "This stupa should receive offerings of all kinds of flowers, incense, necklaces, silk canopies, banners and flags, music and singing. People should make offerings, show reverence, honor it, praise it. |
| B-10.51 | "If anybody sees this stupa, bows to it, makes offerings to it—you need to know all these people are getting close to that supreme perfect enlightenment. They're almost there." |
| B-10.52 | "Medicine King, there's a lot of people—whether they left home or still got a home—who say they're walking the bodhisattva path. But if they can't see this sutra, can't hear it, can't read it, can't recite it, can't copy it, can't uphold it, can't make offerings to it—you need to know these people haven't really walked the bodhisattva path the right way. They ain't doing it properly. |
| B-10.53 | "But if there's beings who hear this sutra-teaching, who truly hear it—then they know how to walk the bodhisattva path the right way. |
| B-10.54 | "Any being who's seeking the Buddha-way—if they see this Lotus Sutra or hear it, and after hearing it they believe it, understand it, receive it, uphold it—you need to know this person is getting close to that supreme perfect enlightenment. They're almost home." |
| B-10.55 | "Medicine King, it's like this—imagine there's a person who's thirsty, desperate for water, needs it bad. So they go up on a high plateau, a high dry place, and they start digging, searching for water, working for it. |
| B-10.56 | "At first they just see dry soil, dusty dirt. They know the water's still far off, still way down there. |
| B-10.57 | "But they don't give up. They keep working, keep applying effort, don't quit. After a while they start seeing damp soil, wet dirt. Then gradually they hit mud. |
| B-10.58 | "Their heart becomes certain, becomes settled. They know for sure: Water's definitely close now. It's right there. |
| B-10.59 | "It's the same way with bodhisattvas. If they haven't heard this Lotus Sutra, haven't understood it, haven't been able to practice and cultivate it—you need to know these people are still far from that supreme perfect enlightenment. The water's still way down there. |
| B-10.60 | "But if they hear it, understand it, think about it deeply, practice and cultivate it—then you can be certain, you can know for sure they're close to that supreme perfect enlightenment. The water's right there. |
| B-10.61 | "Why? Because all bodhisattvas' supreme perfect enlightenment belongs to this sutra. This sutra opens the gate of skillful means. It reveals the true mark of reality. This Lotus Sutra treasury is deep, solid, hidden, distant. Nobody can reach it on their own. |
| B-10.62 | "But now the Buddha teaches it, helps beings mature, brings bodhisattvas to completion, and opens it up for them. Shows them what's been hidden." |
| B-10.63 | "Medicine King, if there's a bodhisattva who hears this Lotus Sutra and gets startled, doubtful, frightened—you need to know that's a brand-new bodhisattva, just started out. That's normal for beginners. |
| B-10.64 | "If a voice-hearer, a disciple, hears this sutra and gets startled, doubtful, frightened—you need to know that's someone full of pride. That's arrogance talking." |
| B-10.65 | "Medicine King, if a good man or good woman wants to teach this Lotus Sutra to the four assemblies after the Buddha's gone—how should they teach it? How should they do it? |
| B-10.66 | "This good man or good woman needs to enter the Buddha's room, wear the Buddha's robe, sit on the Buddha's seat. Only then should they widely teach this sutra to the four assemblies. |
| B-10.67 | "What's the Buddha's room? Great compassion for all beings—that's the Buddha's room. |
| B-10.68 | "What's the Buddha's robe? Gentleness and patience—that's the Buddha's robe. |
| B-10.69 | "What's the Buddha's seat? The emptiness of all things—that's the Buddha's seat. |
| B-10.70 | "Settle yourself in these three. Establish yourself there. Then, with a heart that doesn't slack off, doesn't get lazy, teach this Lotus Sutra to the bodhisattvas and the four assemblies. Teach it wide." |
| B-10.71 | "Medicine King, when I'm in other lands, other countries, I'll send magical people, conjured-up people, to gather an audience to hear the Dharma. I'll send magical monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen to listen to the teaching. |
| B-10.72 | "These magical people, they'll hear the Dharma, believe it, receive it, follow it, not oppose it. |
| B-10.73 | "If the teacher's in a secluded place, an empty quiet place, I'll send a whole host at that time—heavenly dragons, ghosts and spirits, gandharvas, asuras, all kinds of beings—to listen to the teaching. |
| B-10.74 | "Even though I'm in another land, another country, I'll make sure the teacher sees me from time to time. If they forget a line of the sutra, forget the words, I'll appear and tell them again, help them get it complete." |
| B-10.75 | At that time the World-Honored One, wanting to state this meaning again, sings it in verse: |
| B-10.76 | If you want to cast off laziness, |
| B-10.77 | Those who believe and receive it— |
| B-10.78 | Even when they see dry dusty soil, |
| B-10.79 | Medicine King, you need to understand, |
| B-10.80 | But if they hear this deep sutra here, |
| B-10.81 | You need to know these people |
| B-10.82 | They should put on the Buddha's robe, |
| B-10.83 | Great compassion—that's the room, |
| B-10.84 | If while you're teaching this sutra |
| B-10.85 | In thousands of millions of billions of lands |
| B-10.86 | After I'm gone from this world, |
| B-10.87 | To make offerings to this Dharma-teacher, |
| B-10.88 | If people want to do evil, |
| B-10.89 | If the teacher's all alone, |
| B-10.90 | At that time I'll appear for them, |
| B-10.91 | If somebody has these virtues, |
| B-10.92 | If somebody's in a secluded spot, |
| B-10.93 | This person loves to teach the Dharma, |
| B-10.94 | If you stay close to a Dharma-teacher, |
| B-11.1 | CHAPTER ELEVEN: WHEN THE JEWELED TOWER ROSE UP |
| B-11.2 | (Seeing the Jeweled Stupa) |
| B-11.3 | Now at that time, right there in front of the Buddha, a tower made of seven kinds of precious jewels comes rising up out of the ground. A tower! Five hundred yojanas tall—that's so high you can't even see the top—and two hundred and fifty yojanas wide. Coming up from under the earth, rising, rising, until it's hanging there in the middle of the air, just floating in space. |
| B-11.4 | And this tower, it's decorated with every kind of precious thing you can imagine. It's got five thousand railings and balconies, ten thousand chambers and rooms, countless banners and flags hanging from it for adornment. Jeweled necklaces dripping down from it. Ten thousand billion precious bells hanging and ringing. And from all four sides of this tower comes the fragrance of tamāla and sandalwood incense, filling up the whole world with that sweet smell. |
| B-11.5 | All the banners and canopies on this tower are made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, real pearls, rose-jade—seven precious materials all combined together. And this tower, it rises up so high it reaches all the way to the palaces of the Four Heavenly Kings. |
| B-11.6 | And the thirty-three gods in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, they start raining down mandārava flowers as offerings to the jeweled tower. And all the other heavenly beings, the dragons, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans—thousands, ten thousands, billions of them—they all make offerings to this tower with every kind of flower, incense, necklaces, banners, canopies, and music, honoring it, respecting it, singing its praises. |
| B-11.7 | Right then and there, from inside that jeweled tower, a great voice comes booming out, shouting in praise: |
| B-11.8 | "Excellent! Excellent! Śākyamuni, World-Honored One! You're able to use your equal great wisdom to teach the Dharma for bodhisattvas, the Dharma that all Buddhas protect and keep in mind—this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra—teaching it to this great assembly. Yes! Yes! Śākyamuni, World-Honored One! Everything you're saying is TRUE. Every word is REAL." |
| B-11.9 | At that time the four assemblies—they see this great jeweled tower hanging there in the air, and they hear that voice coming from inside the tower, and they all receive Dharma-joy, happiness rising up in them. They can't believe what they're seeing—never seen anything like this before in their lives. So they all stand up from their seats, respectfully bring their palms together, and step back to one side. |
| B-11.10 | Now at that time there's a bodhisattva mahāsattva named Great Joy in Preaching. He knows what's in the hearts of all the world's heavenly beings, humans, asuras, and the rest—knows they're all wondering, all questioning. So he speaks to the Buddha and says: |
| B-11.11 | "World-Honored One, what's the reason for this? What's the cause? Why did this jeweled tower rise up from the ground? And who's that voice speaking from inside it?" |
| B-11.12 | Right then the Buddha tells Great Joy in Preaching Bodhisattva: |
| B-11.13 | "Inside this jeweled tower there's the complete body of a tathāgata. Way back in the past, in the eastern direction, beyond countless thousands, ten thousands, billions of incalculable worlds, there's a land called Jewel-Purity. In that land there was a buddha named Prabhūtaratna—Many Treasures. |
| B-11.14 | "When that buddha was walking the bodhisattva path, he made a great vow, a great promise. He said: 'If after I become a buddha and pass into extinction, in any of the lands in the ten directions where somebody is teaching the Dharma Flower Sutra, my stupa—my tower, my monument—will rise up and appear right there in front of them to bear witness to the teaching, to testify that it's true, to shout out "Excellent!"' |
| B-11.15 | "After that buddha achieved the Way, when he was about to enter extinction, he spoke to the great assembly of heavenly and human beings, told all the monks: 'After I pass away, if anybody wants to make offerings to my complete body, they should build one great stupa.' |
| B-11.16 | "And through that buddha's supernatural power and the power of his vow, throughout all the worlds in the ten directions, wherever, in whatever place, someone is teaching the Dharma Flower Sutra—that jeweled tower of his rises up right there in front of them, with his complete body inside it, and it calls out in praise: 'Excellent! Excellent!' |
| B-11.17 | "Great Joy in Preaching, right now Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata's tower heard that the Dharma Flower Sutra was being taught, and so it rose up from the ground and is calling out in praise: 'Excellent! Excellent!'" |
| B-11.18 | At that time Great Joy in Preaching Bodhisattva, through the Buddha's supernatural power, speaks to the Buddha and says: |
| B-11.19 | "World-Honored One, we all wish we could see that buddha's body." |
| B-11.20 | The Buddha tells Great Joy in Preaching Bodhisattva Mahāsattva: |
| B-11.21 | "This Prabhūtaratna Buddha has a deep and weighty vow. He said: 'When my jeweled tower rises up before the buddhas to hear the Dharma Flower Sutra being taught, if somebody wants me to show my body to the four assemblies, then first all that buddha's emanation bodies—all his manifestations teaching the Dharma in the ten directions throughout all the worlds—those must all gather together and return to one place. Only then will my body appear.' |
| B-11.22 | "Great Joy in Preaching, all my emanation bodies—all my manifestations throughout the worlds in the ten directions teaching the Dharma—they need to gather together now." |
| B-11.23 | Great Joy in Preaching says to the Buddha: |
| B-11.24 | "World-Honored One, we also want to see your emanation bodies, all those World-Honored Ones. We want to bow to them and make offerings to them." |
| B-11.25 | Right then the Buddha sends out a ray of white light from between his eyebrows, and immediately everyone sees the lands of the eastern direction—five hundred ten thousand billion nayutas of lands, as many as the sands of the Ganges River. And all those lands have lapis lazuli for their ground, adorned with jeweled trees and jeweled clothing. Countless thousands, ten thousands, billions of bodhisattvas fill up those lands. Jeweled canopies are spread everywhere, jeweled nets are draped above. |
| B-11.26 | And the buddhas in all those lands are teaching the Dharma with great wonderful voices. And everyone sees countless thousands, ten thousands, billions of bodhisattvas filling those lands, teaching the Dharma to the multitudes. |
| B-11.27 | The southern direction, the western direction, the northern direction, the four intermediate directions, the zenith and the nadir—wherever that white light from between the Buddha's eyebrows shines, it's the same in all those places. |
| B-11.28 | At that time the buddhas in all ten directions each speak to the assemblies of bodhisattvas: |
| B-11.29 | "Good sons, now we must go to the Sahā world, to where Śākyamuni Buddha is, and make offerings to Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata's jeweled tower." |
| B-11.30 | Right then the Sahā world transforms and becomes pure. The ground is made of lapis lazuli, adorned with jeweled trees. Golden ropes mark out eight roads. There are no more villages, towns, cities. No more oceans, rivers, streams, or mountains, forests, thickets. Great precious incense is burning. Mandārava flowers cover the ground everywhere. Jeweled nets and canopies are spread over everything. Jeweled bells are hanging. |
| B-11.31 | Only this assembly is left here. All the other heavenly and human beings are moved to other lands. |
| B-11.32 | At that time all the buddhas, each one bringing with them one great bodhisattva as an attendant, come to the Sahā world and arrive at the base of jeweled trees. |
| B-11.33 | Every one of those jeweled trees is five hundred yojanas tall, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits adorning them in perfect order. Under each jeweled tree there's a lion throne, five yojanas high, also decorated with great precious materials. |
| B-11.34 | At that time all those buddhas each sit down cross-legged on one of those lion seats. |
| B-11.35 | And they keep arriving, one after another, filling up the entire three-thousand great thousand-world system. And still all the emanation bodies of Śākyamuni Buddha from just one direction—just the eastern direction—haven't all arrived yet. There's not enough room. |
| B-11.36 | So Śākyamuni Buddha, wanting to make room for all his emanation bodies to sit down, transforms another two hundred ten thousand billion nayuta lands in each of the eight directions. He makes them all pure—no hells, no hungry ghosts, no animals, no asuras. And he moves all the heavenly and human beings to other lands. |
| B-11.37 | These newly transformed lands also have lapis lazuli for their ground, adorned with jeweled trees. The trees are five hundred yojanas tall, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits perfectly adorned in order. Under each tree there's a jeweled lion throne, five yojanas high, adorned with various precious materials. |
| B-11.38 | And there are no more oceans, rivers, or mountains—no Mount Mucilinda, no Great Mount Mucilinda, no Iron Ring Mountains, no Great Iron Ring Mountains, no Mount Sumeru, none of those mountain kings. Everything merges into one buddha-land. The jeweled ground is level and flat. Jeweled canopies cover everything. Banners and flags are hanging. Precious incense is burning. Heavenly jeweled flowers cover the ground. |
| B-11.39 | Still not enough room! |
| B-11.40 | So Śākyamuni Buddha transforms another two hundred ten thousand billion nayuta lands in each of the eight directions, all made pure—no hells, no hungry ghosts, no animals, no asuras. All the heavenly and human beings are moved to other lands. |
| B-11.41 | These newly transformed lands also have lapis lazuli for their ground, adorned with jeweled trees five hundred yojanas tall, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits perfectly adorned. Under each tree there's a jeweled lion throne, five yojanas high, also decorated with great precious materials. |
| B-11.42 | No oceans, no rivers, no mountains—no Mount Mucilinda, no Great Mount Mucilinda, no Iron Ring Mountains, no Great Iron Ring Mountains, no Mount Sumeru, none of those. Everything merges into one buddha-land. The jeweled ground is level and flat. Jeweled canopies cover everything. Banners and flags are hanging. Precious incense is burning. Heavenly jeweled flowers cover the ground everywhere. |
| B-11.43 | At that time the emanation bodies of Śākyamuni Buddha from the eastern direction—from hundreds of thousands of tens of thousands of billions of nayutas of lands as numerous as Ganges sands—all those buddhas arrive one after another and gather together here. |
| B-11.44 | And like this, gradually, the buddhas from all ten directions all arrive and gather, sitting in the eight directions. |
| B-11.45 | At that time, in each of the eight directions, there are four hundred ten thousand billion nayuta lands filled completely with buddhas, tathāgatas. |
| B-11.46 | At that time all those buddhas are each sitting under a jeweled tree on a lion throne, and they each send their attendants to go inquire after Śākyamuni Buddha. They each give the attendant a handful of jeweled flowers and tell them: |
| B-11.47 | "Good son, you go to Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountain, to where Śākyamuni Buddha is, and speak to him in our name, saying: 'Are you well? Are you free from illness and trouble? Are your strength and energy comfortable? Are the bodhisattvas and voice-hearers all safe and peaceful?' Then scatter these jeweled flowers before the Buddha as an offering, and say: 'That certain buddha wishes to have this jeweled tower opened.'" |
| B-11.48 | All the buddhas send their messengers like this. |
| B-11.49 | At that time Śākyamuni Buddha sees all his emanation bodies—they've all arrived and gathered. Each one is sitting on a lion throne. And he hears all those buddhas saying they want the jeweled tower opened together. |
| B-11.50 | So right then Śākyamuni Buddha rises up from his seat and stands there in the air, floating in space. |
| B-11.51 | All the four assemblies stand up too, bringing their palms together, single-mindedly watching the Buddha. |
| B-11.52 | Then Śākyamuni Buddha uses his right finger to open the door of the seven-jeweled tower. It makes a great sound—a loud sound—like pulling back the bolt and opening the gate of a great city. |
| B-11.53 | Immediately, right then, everyone in that whole assembly sees Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata sitting on a lion throne inside the jeweled tower, his body complete, not scattered, not decayed, like he's in deep meditation. |
| B-11.54 | And they hear him say: |
| B-11.55 | "Excellent! Excellent! Śākyamuni Buddha, you've spoken this Dharma Flower Sutra joyfully, gladly. I came here to listen to this sutra. That's why I'm here." |
| B-11.56 | At that time the four assemblies—seeing this buddha who passed into extinction countless thousands, ten thousands, billions of eons ago, hearing him speak these words—they're amazed beyond measure, never seen anything like it. They scatter heaps of heavenly jeweled flowers on Prabhūtaratna Buddha and Śākyamuni Buddha. |
| B-11.57 | Right then Prabhūtaratna Buddha, inside that jeweled tower, moves over and makes half his seat available. Then he speaks to Śākyamuni Buddha, saying: |
| B-11.58 | "Śākyamuni Buddha, come sit here." |
| B-11.59 | Immediately Śākyamuni Buddha enters that tower and sits down on half the seat, sitting cross-legged. |
| B-11.60 | At that time the great assembly sees two tathāgatas inside the seven-jeweled tower sitting together on the lion throne in full lotus position. |
| B-11.61 | And everyone in the assembly thinks to themselves: "The buddhas are sitting way up high, too far away. We wish the Thus-Come One would use his supernatural power to let all of us be in space too." |
| B-11.62 | Right then Śākyamuni Buddha, using his supernatural power, lifts the whole great assembly up into the air. |
| B-11.63 | Then, with a great voice, a mighty voice, Śākyamuni Buddha speaks to all the four assemblies: |
| B-11.64 | "WHO can teach this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra far and wide in this Sahā world? Now is the time! Now is the moment! |
| B-11.65 | "The Thus-Come One is about to enter nirvāṇa soon. The Buddha wants to entrust this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra to someone, to put it in someone's hands." |
| B-11.66 | At that time the World-Honored One, wanting to state this meaning again, wanting it to sink down deep into everyone's hearts, sings it out in verse: |
| B-11.67 | That holy lord, that world-honored one, |
| B-11.68 | How can you people not be diligent, |
| B-11.69 | That buddha made a vow when he was alive: |
| B-11.70 | And all my emanation bodies— |
| B-11.71 | They each abandoned their wonderful pure lands, |
| B-11.72 | They came here to make the Dharma last long, |
| B-11.73 | Each buddha went to a jeweled tree, |
| B-11.74 | Sitting there, they shine with radiant light, |
| B-11.75 | Their bodies give off wonderful fragrance, |
| B-11.76 | It's like a great wind shaking little tree branches— |
| B-11.77 | I'm telling all of you in this great assembly: |
| B-11.78 | That Prabhūtaratna Buddha, |
| B-11.79 | Many Treasures Thus-Come One |
| B-11.80 | All you children of the Buddha, |
| B-11.81 | Whoever can protect this sutra, |
| B-11.82 | This Prabhūtaratna Buddha |
| B-11.83 | And they'll also be making offerings |
| B-11.84 | If you can teach this sutra, |
| B-11.85 | All you good sons, all you good daughters, |
| B-11.86 | All the other sutras and scriptures— |
| B-11.87 | If you grabbed hold of Mount Sumeru |
| B-11.88 | If you used your toe to kick |
| B-11.89 | If you stood at the peak of existence, |
| B-11.90 | But after the Buddha's gone, if you're in an evil age, |
| B-11.91 | Suppose someone could grab empty space in their hand |
| B-11.92 | But after I'm gone, |
| B-11.93 | Suppose you took this whole great earth, |
| B-11.94 | But after the Buddha's passed away, in that evil world, |
| B-11.95 | Suppose when the eon's burning up, |
| B-11.96 | That wouldn't be too difficult, no. |
| B-11.97 | But after I'm gone, |
| B-11.98 | Suppose you could uphold and carry |
| B-11.99 | Made all the listeners gain six supernatural powers, |
| B-11.100 | But after I'm gone from this world, |
| B-11.101 | If someone teaches the Dharma |
| B-11.102 | Even if you could bring that benefit, |
| B-11.103 | But after I'm gone from here, |
| B-11.104 | For the Buddha-way, for the sake of awakening, |
| B-11.105 | This sutra is number one. |
| B-11.106 | If you can uphold this teaching, |
| B-11.107 | All you good sons, all you good daughters, |
| B-11.108 | Come stand before the Buddha now, |
| B-11.109 | This sutra is difficult to uphold, to hold onto, |
| B-11.110 | A person like this— |
| B-11.111 | This is what it means to keep the precepts, |
| B-11.112 | In the world to come, |
| B-11.113 | After the Buddha's passed into extinction, |
| B-11.114 | In that frightening age, |
| B-11.115 | All the heavenly beings and human beings |
| B-12.1 | CHAPTER TWELVE: WHEN YOUR ENEMY WAS YOUR TEACHER |
| B-12.2 | (Devadatta) |
| B-12.3 | Right then the Buddha speaks to all the bodhisattvas and the four assemblies—all the heavenly and human beings gathered there. He says: |
| B-12.4 | "Listen now. Way back in the past, further back than you can count, beyond measureless kalpas, I was searching for this Lotus Sutra teaching. Searching and searching, and I never got tired, never gave up, never said 'I can't do this no more.' |
| B-12.5 | "For many kalpas—age after age—I was born as a king. A king! Had everything a man could want. But I made a vow, made a promise in my heart: I'm gonna seek the supreme enlightenment, that highest awakening. And my heart never turned back, never said 'Maybe tomorrow,' never said 'This is good enough.' |
| B-12.6 | "I wanted to fulfill the six perfections—generosity, discipline, patience, effort, meditation, wisdom—all six of them complete. So I practiced giving, practiced it hard. Gave away everything. Didn't hold back nothing. Elephants—gave them away. Horses—gave them away. The seven precious treasures—gave them away. My kingdom—gave it away. My cities—gave them away. My wife, my children—gave them away. My servants, my attendants—gave them away. Even gave away my head, my eyes, my marrow and my brain, my flesh, my hands, my feet. Didn't care about my body, didn't care about my life. Just gave. |
| B-12.7 | "At that time, people lived long lives, lived for measureless years. But for the sake of the Dharma—for the sake of the truth—I gave up my throne, turned over the government to my son, and I beat a drum and sent out a proclamation to the four directions, calling out: 'Who can teach me the great vehicle? Who's got the real teaching? Whoever can speak the great vehicle for me—the Mahayana—I'll serve you my whole life. I'll be your servant. I'll work for you. I'll run when you say run.' |
| B-12.8 | "And then this ascetic came. This hermit. He came to the palace and said to the king: 'I've got the great vehicle. I've got a teaching called the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra. But you got to listen to me. If you don't go against me, if you do what I say, I'll teach it to you.' |
| B-12.9 | "When the king heard what the ascetic said, he was so happy he jumped for joy! Jumped up! Said 'Yes!' Right away he followed that ascetic, attended to him, gave him everything he needed. I went and gathered fruit for him. I drew water from the well for him. I chopped firewood for him. I prepared his food for him. I even used my own body as his bed, as his seat, so he could sit and rest. Laid down flat so he could sit on my back. |
| B-12.10 | "And my body never got tired. My mind never got tired. I served him like that for a thousand years. One thousand years! All for the sake of the Dharma. Working hard, serving, making sure he never lacked for nothing." |
| B-12.11 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say this again, speaks in verse: |
| B-12.12 | I remember the old days, long past time, |
| B-12.13 | I rang the bell, sent word to the four directions wide: |
| B-12.14 | Then came an ascetic, old hermit man, |
| B-12.15 | If you can practice it, if you can walk this road, |
| B-12.16 | Right away he followed that hermit man, |
| B-12.17 | My body kept the wonderful Dharma close at hand, |
| B-12.18 | Didn't do it for myself or the five desires' pleasure, |
| B-12.19 | The Buddha tells all the monks: |
| B-12.20 | "That king back then—that was me. I was that king. |
| B-12.21 | "And the ascetic, that hermit man—that was Devadatta. That's who he is now. |
| B-12.22 | "Because Devadatta was a good spiritual friend to me, because he taught me, because he pushed me, I was able to perfect the six perfections. I got compassion perfected. I got loving-kindness perfected. I got sympathetic joy perfected. I got equanimity perfected. I got the thirty-two marks. I got the eighty minor characteristics. I got this purple-golden color. I got the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, the four methods of attraction, the eighteen unique qualities. I got supernatural penetrations and the power of the Way. |
| B-12.23 | "I became perfectly, completely enlightened. I teach beings far and wide. |
| B-12.24 | "All because Devadatta was a good spiritual friend." |
| B-12.25 | The Buddha tells the four assemblies: |
| B-12.26 | "Devadatta—after incalculable kalpas have passed, he's gonna become a buddha. You hear me? He's gonna be called Heaven-King Tathāgata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. |
| B-12.27 | "His world will be called Heaven-Way. |
| B-12.28 | "When Heaven-King Buddha is dwelling in the world, he'll be there for twenty intermediate kalpas, teaching beings the wonderful Dharma. As many beings as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River—that many will attain arhat-fruit. Countless beings will awaken the mind of the pratyekabuddha, the solitary realizer. As many beings as grains of sand in the Ganges will awaken the supreme enlightenment mind, will attain the patience of non-arising, will reach non-regression. |
| B-12.29 | "After Heaven-King Buddha enters nirvāṇa, the Correct Dharma will remain in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas. |
| B-12.30 | "His whole-body relics will be in a stupa made of the seven precious treasures—a tower sixty yojanas high, forty yojanas wide on every side. All the devas and human beings will make offerings to it with mixed flowers, powdered incense, burning incense, perfume paste, clothing, necklaces, banners, flags, jeweled canopies, music, and singing. They'll bow down and honor that wonderful seven-jeweled tower. |
| B-12.31 | "Countless beings will attain arhat-fruit. Countless beings will awaken to the pratyekabuddha way. Inconceivable numbers of beings will bring forth the enlightenment mind and reach non-regression." |
| B-12.32 | The Buddha tells all the monks: |
| B-12.33 | "In a future age, if there are good men or good women who hear this Devadatta Chapter of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra, and they believe it with pure hearts, respect it, don't doubt it—they won't fall into hell, won't fall into the realm of hungry ghosts, won't fall into the animal realm. |
| B-12.34 | "They'll be born right there in front of buddhas in the ten directions. Wherever they're born, they'll always be hearing this sutra. |
| B-12.35 | "If they're born among humans or devas, they'll receive supremely wonderful happiness. |
| B-12.36 | "If they're born in the presence of a buddha, they'll be born by transformation from a lotus flower." |
| B-12.37 | Right then, Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva—the one who came with Many Treasures World-Honored One from below—he says to Many Treasures Buddha: |
| B-12.38 | "We should return to our homeland now." |
| B-12.39 | But Śākyamuni Buddha tells Wisdom-Accumulation: |
| B-12.40 | "Good son, wait a little while, just a little bit. There's a bodhisattva here named Mañjuśrī—Wonderful Virtue. You should meet him. You should talk with him about the wonderful Dharma. Then you can return to your homeland." |
| B-12.41 | And right at that moment, Mañjuśrī is sitting on a thousand-petaled lotus flower, big as a chariot wheel. And the bodhisattvas who came with him are also sitting on jeweled lotus flowers. They rise up naturally from the great ocean, from the palace of Sāgara the Dragon King. They come up, suspended in empty space. They go to Vulture Peak Mountain. They step down from their lotus flowers and go to where the Buddha is. They bow their heads to the ground, honoring the feet of both World-Honored Ones—both buddhas sitting there. When they finish paying respects, they go to where Wisdom-Accumulation is sitting. They exchange greetings, ask how each other is doing. Then they sit down to one side. |
| B-12.42 | Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva asks Mañjuśrī: |
| B-12.43 | "You went to the dragon palace. How many beings did you teach down there? How many did you convert?" |
| B-12.44 | Mañjuśrī says: |
| B-12.45 | "The number is immeasurable. Can't count them. Can't calculate them. Can't speak it with the mouth. Can't measure it with the mind. Just wait a little while. You'll have your proof. You'll see for yourself." |
| B-12.46 | Before he even finishes speaking, countless bodhisattvas sitting on jeweled lotus flowers come rising up from the ocean. They come to Vulture Peak Mountain and stay there, suspended in empty space. |
| B-12.47 | All these bodhisattvas were taught and transformed by Mañjuśrī. They've all accomplished the bodhisattva practices. They're all discussing the six perfections together. |
| B-12.48 | The ones who used to be śrāvakas, hearers—they're up there in empty space, but they're teaching the śrāvaka practices. But now they're all practicing the emptiness teaching of the great vehicle. |
| B-12.49 | Mañjuśrī says to Wisdom-Accumulation: |
| B-12.50 | "The teaching and transforming I did in the ocean—it went like this. That's what happened." |
| B-12.51 | Then Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva speaks in verse to praise him: |
| B-12.52 | You have great wisdom, virtue, courage, strength— |
| B-12.53 | You've revealed the one vehicle Dharma, opened it clear, |
| B-12.54 | Mañjuśrī says: |
| B-12.55 | "When I was in the ocean, I only kept teaching the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra. Nothing else. Just this." |
| B-12.56 | Wisdom-Accumulation asks Mañjuśrī: |
| B-12.57 | "This sutra is so deep, so subtle, so wonderful. It's the treasure of all sutras. It's rare in the world. Is there any living being who practiced this sutra diligently, put real effort into it, and quickly became a buddha? Tell me—did that happen?" |
| B-12.58 | Mañjuśrī says: |
| B-12.59 | "There's the daughter of Sāgara the Dragon King. She just turned eight years old. Eight! But she's got sharp wisdom, keen intelligence. She understands all the roots and karmic actions of living beings. She's got dhāraṇī. She can receive and hold all the deep secret treasures taught by the buddhas—every word, she holds it. |
| B-12.60 | "She's entered deep into meditation. She thoroughly understands all dharmas. In the space of an instant—one moment—she brought forth the enlightenment mind. She reached non-regression. Her eloquence has no obstruction, no barrier. |
| B-12.61 | "She thinks of living beings with compassion, like they're her own children. Her merit and virtue are complete. When she thinks something in her mind, when she speaks it with her mouth, it's subtle, wonderful, vast, and great. She's compassionate, humane, yielding, gentle. Her will and spirit are harmonious and refined. |
| B-12.62 | "She can reach enlightenment. She can arrive at bodhi." |
| B-12.63 | Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva says: |
| B-12.64 | "I've seen Śākyamuni Tathāgata. For immeasurable kalpas he practiced difficult and bitter practices. He accumulated merit, piled up virtue, seeking the bodhisattva way. He never stopped, not even for a moment. I look at this great thousand-world system—every part of it, down to a space as small as a mustard seed—there's not one spot that's not a place where the Bodhisattva gave up his body and life for the sake of living beings. Only after all that did he achieve the enlightenment way. |
| B-12.65 | "I don't believe this girl, in just a brief instant, could achieve perfect enlightenment. Can't believe it." |
| B-12.66 | Before he even finishes speaking, the dragon king's daughter suddenly appears right there in front of them. She bows, touching her head to the ground in respect, then stands to one side. She speaks in verse to praise the Buddha: |
| B-12.67 | You deeply understand the marks of sin and merit, |
| B-12.68 | The eighty minor characteristics adorn the dharma body bright, |
| B-12.69 | I've also heard you've achieved the enlightenment way, |
| B-12.70 | Right then, Śāriputra speaks to the dragon girl and says: |
| B-12.71 | "You say you're about to quickly attain supreme enlightenment? But that's hard to believe. Can't be trusted. Why not? |
| B-12.72 | "A woman's body is filthy, impure. It's not a vessel for the Dharma. How could you attain supreme enlightenment? |
| B-12.73 | "The buddha-way is so vast, so far away! You have to practice through immeasurable kalpas, endure bitterness, pile up practices, perfect all the perfections. Only then do you succeed. |
| B-12.74 | "Plus, a woman's body has five obstacles. What are they? |
| B-12.75 | "First, she can't become a Brahma Heaven King. |
| B-12.76 | "So how could a woman's body quickly achieve buddhahood? Can't happen." |
| B-12.77 | Right then the dragon girl had a precious jewel, worth as much as a great thousand-world system—worth three thousand great thousand worlds. She held it up and presented it to the Buddha. |
| B-12.78 | The Buddha received it immediately. |
| B-12.79 | The dragon girl said to Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva and to the Venerable Śāriputra: |
| B-12.80 | "I presented a precious jewel, and the World-Honored One accepted it. Was that quick or not?" |
| B-12.81 | They answered: "Very quick!" |
| B-12.82 | The girl said: |
| B-12.83 | "Use your spiritual power. Watch me become a buddha. It's gonna be even faster than that." |
| B-12.84 | Right at that moment, everyone in the assembly saw the dragon girl suddenly—in an instant—transform into a male. She perfected the bodhisattva practices. Immediately she went south to the Spotless World. She sat down on a jeweled lotus flower and achieved perfect, complete enlightenment. She had the thirty-two marks. She had the eighty minor characteristics. She taught the wonderful Dharma for all living beings throughout the ten directions. |
| B-12.85 | At that time, in this Saha world—all the bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, the eight classes of devas and dragons, humans and non-humans—they all saw from far away that dragon girl becoming a buddha, teaching the Dharma to all the devas and humans gathered at that time. |
| B-12.86 | Their hearts filled up with great joy. They all bowed in reverence from a distance. |
| B-12.87 | Countless living beings heard the Dharma, understood it, awakened to it. They attained non-regression. |
| B-12.88 | Countless living beings received prophecies of their future enlightenment. |
| B-12.89 | The Spotless World shook in six ways. |
| B-12.90 | Three thousand living beings in this Saha world reached the ground of non-regression. Three thousand living beings brought forth the enlightenment mind and received prophecies. |
| B-12.91 | Wisdom-Accumulation Bodhisattva, the Venerable Śāriputra, and the whole assembly—they all silently believed and accepted this. |
| B-13.1 | Now at that time, Medicine King Bodhisattva and Great Joy in Preaching Bodhisattva—these two great souls—they stood up together with twenty thousand of their brother and sister bodhisattvas. They all gathered right there in front of the Buddha, and they made a promise, you hear me, they made a VOW: |
| B-13.2 | Now right then, five hundred arhats in that assembly—these was the ones who already got their prophecy from Buddha, who already been told their names gonna shine—they spoke up to the Buddha, saying: |
| B-13.3 | And then there was eight thousand more—some still learning, some done with learning, all of them just got their prophecy too. They rose up from their seats, put their palms together in respect, and they said to the Buddha: |
| B-13.4 | Now at that time, the Buddha's aunt—her name was Mahāprajāpatī, and she was a nun, a bhikṣuṇī—she stood up together with six thousand other nuns, some still learning and some done with learning. They all rose from their seats as one, pressed their palms together, and they looked up at the Blessed One's face. They looked at him with their whole hearts, couldn't take their eyes off him, not even for a second. |
| B-13.5 | Now at that time, Rāhula's mother—her name was Yaśodharā, and she was a nun too—she had a thought in her mind. She thought: |
| B-13.6 | At that time, Mahāprajāpatī the nun and Yaśodharā the nun, along with all their companions, they were filled up with joy like they never known before. Their hearts was OVERFLOWING. And right there in front of the Buddha, they sang out in verse: |
| B-13.7 | Now at that time, the World-Honored One, he looked out over the assembly. He looked at eight hundred million nayutas of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas—count them, EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION NAYUTAS of great beings! |
| B-13.8 | World-Honored One, don't you worry, |
| B-14.1 | Now at that time, Mañjuśrī—that prince of the Dharma, that great bodhisattva—he stood up and said to the Buddha: |
| B-14.2 | "Mañjuśrī, what do I mean by a bodhisattva's ground—their place to stand? |
| B-14.3 | "Now Mañjuśrī, what do I mean by who you associate with—who you spend your time around? |
| B-14.4 | "But there's a deeper part to this second practice, Mañjuśrī. It's not just about avoiding people. It's about understanding reality itself. |
| B-14.5 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to drive this teaching deep like a stake in the ground, spoke it again in rhythm: |
| B-14.6 | "Now, Mañjuśrī, listen: After I'm gone, in the last age when the Dharma's dying out, if you want to teach this Lotus Sutra, you got to dwell in peaceful conduct. |
| B-14.7 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to make this meaning clear, spoke in rhythm: |
| B-14.8 | "Now, Mañjuśrī, there's one more practice—the fourth peaceful practice—for bodhisattvas teaching in the last age when the Dharma's dying out. |
| B-14.9 | "Mañjuśrī, if a bodhisattva in the last age—when the Dharma's dying—accomplishes this third peaceful practice, then when they teach this sutra, nobody can trouble them. |
| B-14.10 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to make this meaning clear, spoke in rhythm: |
| B-14.11 | "Now, Mañjuśrī, there's more to say about bodhisattvas in the last age when the Dharma's dying, those who hold this Lotus Sutra. |
| B-14.12 | "Mañjuśrī, let me tell you a story so you understand what I'm saying: |
| B-14.13 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to make this meaning sink deep, spoke in rhythm: |
| B-14.14 | They'll see the Tathāgatas |
| B-15.1 | Now at that time, all them bodhisattvas from other worlds—countless worlds beyond counting, more than eight Ganges rivers full of sand—they stood up in that great gathering. They pressed their palms together, bowed down low, and said to the Buddha: |
| B-15.2 | Now when the Buddha spoke them words, the whole Śākyamuni world—all three thousand great thousand realms of it—the ground started shaking and trembling and splitting apart. |
| B-15.3 | Now every one of these bodhisattvas, they was leaders—great leaders, mighty leaders—leading the masses, guiding the multitudes. |
| B-15.4 | When all these bodhisattvas came up from the earth, they each went to the jeweled stupa in the sky—to where Abundant Treasures Tathāgata and Śākyamuni Buddha was sitting together. |
| B-15.5 | Now among all that vast bodhisattva multitude, there was four leaders—four chief guides, four head teachers: |
| B-15.6 | Then at that time, them four great bodhisattvas spoke in verse, saying: |
| B-15.7 | Then the World-Honored One, there in the midst of that vast bodhisattva assembly, he said: |
| B-15.8 | Then at that time, all them great bodhisattvas spoke in verse, saying: |
| B-15.9 | Then the World-Honored One praised them chief bodhisattvas, saying: |
| B-15.10 | Now at that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva and 8,000 Ganges-sands worth of other bodhisattvas—they all had this thought arise in their minds: |
| B-15.11 | So Maitreya Bodhisattva, knowing what was on the minds of them 8,000 Ganges-sands worth of bodhisattvas—and wanting to clear up his own doubts too—he pressed his palms together, faced the Buddha, and asked in verse: |
| B-15.12 | Then at that time, all them emanation-bodies of Śākyamuni Buddha—all them Buddha-copies who came from countless thousands of millions of billions of other lands, sitting on lion thrones under jeweled trees throughout the eight directions—each one of their attendants saw this great assembly of bodhisattvas bursting up from the earth in the four directions of the three thousand great thousand worlds, rising up into empty space. |
| B-15.13 | Then at that time, Śākyamuni Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva: |
| B-15.14 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say this teaching again, spoke in verse: |
| B-15.15 | Then after the World-Honored One finished speaking this verse, he told Maitreya Bodhisattva: |
| B-15.16 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to state this meaning again, spoke in verse: |
| B-15.17 | Now at that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva and countless other bodhisattvas—their minds filled up with doubt. They bewildered, amazed, never experienced nothing like this before. |
| B-15.18 | "World-Honored One, this great assembly of bodhisattvas—even if someone spent a thousand million billion kalpas trying to count them, they couldn't finish, couldn't reach the end. |
| B-15.19 | "It's the same with the Buddha. You only attained the Way a short while ago—that's the truth of it. |
| B-15.20 | Then Maitreya Bodhisattva, wanting to state this meaning again, spoke in verse: |
| B-16.1 | At that time, the Buddha spoke to all them bodhisattvas and the whole great assembly. He said: |
| B-16.2 | Then the World-Honored One, seeing them bodhisattvas ask three times and not stopping, he told them: |
| B-16.3 | "Let me paint you a picture. Say you took five hundred thousand million billion nayuta asamkhya three-thousand-great-thousand worlds—every single one of them worlds. And say you ground them all down into dust, into powder, into the finest grains you ever saw. |
| B-16.4 | "Good sons, during all that time—all them ages—I talked about Dipamkara Buddha and others. I said they entered into nirvāṇa, passed away into final rest. |
| B-16.5 | "Good sons, all the sutras the Tathāgata speaks—every teaching, every scripture—they all for saving living beings, for setting them free. |
| B-16.6 | "Good sons, the lifespan I got—the life I achieved when I first walked the bodhisattva path—that lifespan still ain't finished yet. It's still going. It's twice as long as all them ages I just told you about, and more. |
| B-16.7 | "And also, good sons, all the Buddhas and Tathāgatas—their way is just like this. Everything they do is real, ain't nothing false. It's all to save living beings. |
| B-16.8 | "Now among all them children, the ones who ain't completely lost their minds—the ones who still had some sense—when they saw that good medicine, saw the color and smelled the fragrance, they took it right away and drank it down. |
| B-16.9 | "When them children heard that their father had died—that he was gone, that he'd passed away—their hearts filled up with great sorrow and pain. They thought: |
| B-16.10 | "Now good sons, what you think about this? |
| B-16.11 | At that time, the World-Honored One, wanting to speak this meaning again, spoke in verse, saying: |
| B-17.1 | Now listen here—when the Buddha finished telling them about his eternal life, about how he been living forever and ain't never gonna die, when he laid that truth down in Chapter 16, something happened right then and there in that assembly. I mean something HAPPENED. |
| B-17.2 | Now when the Buddha finished telling about all these beings who got blessed, who received the benefit, who caught the grace— |
| B-17.3 | Right then Maitreya Bodhisattva rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, pressed his palms together toward the Buddha, and spoke in verse: |
| B-17.4 | Right then the Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva: |
| B-17.5 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to speak this meaning again, said in verse: |
| B-17.6 | "Furthermore, Ajita, if someone hears about the Buddha's long lifespan and understands what it's getting at, the merit that person gets got no limit. They can arouse the Tathāgata's supreme wisdom. |
| B-17.7 | Furthermore, after the Tathāgata passes into extinction, if someone hears this scripture and don't tear it down, don't speak against it, but just feels a little joy rise up in their heart—you should know: this already is the sign of deep faith and understanding. |
| B-17.8 | Ajita, if after I pass into extinction, someone hears this scripture and can receive and hold it, whether writing it themselves or teaching others to write it—then they have built a monastery of thirty-two halls made of red sandalwood, each hall eight tala trees tall, high and wide and beautiful, with a hundred thousand monks dwelling there, with gardens and bathing pools, with walking paths and meditation caves, with robes and food and drink, with beds and bedding and medicine, with all kinds of joyful necessities filling it up completely. Monasteries and halls like this—hundreds and thousands and myriads and hundreds of millions of them, uncountably many—appearing right in front of them, making offering to me and to the community of monks. |
| B-17.9 | Ajita, if after I pass into extinction, good men and good women who receive, hold, read, and recite this scripture also have these kinds of good meritorious virtues—you should know: this person already proceeding to the place of enlightenment, drawing near to supreme perfect enlightenment, sitting under the tree of the Way. |
| B-17.10 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to speak this meaning again, said in verse: |
| B-18.1 | Right then, Maitreya Bodhisattva stood up and asked the Buddha: |
| B-18.2 | The Buddha turned to Maitreya and said: |
| B-18.3 | "Imagine this: |
| B-18.4 | Maitreya said to the Buddha: |
| B-18.5 | The Buddha said to Maitreya: |
| B-18.6 | "And listen, Ajita—let me tell you more: |
| B-18.7 | "And Ajita, if someone says to another person: |
| B-18.8 | "Now Ajita, just LOOK at this: |
| B-18.9 | Right then the World-Honored One, wanting to drive this truth home one more time, spoke in verse: |
| B-18.10 | *If someone encourages just one person,* |
| B-18.11 | *If they deliberately go to the monastery* |
| B-18.12 | *So what about someone who listens with whole mind,* |
| B-19.1 | Right then, the Buddha turned to Constant-Exertion Bodhisattva and said: |
| B-19.2 | Then the World-Honored One wanted to say it again in verse, so he spoke: |
| B-19.3 | "Now listen, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down— |
| B-19.4 | Then the World-Honored One spoke in verse: |
| B-19.5 | "Now again, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down— |
| B-19.6 | Then the World-Honored One spoke in verse: |
| B-19.7 | "Now again, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down— |
| B-19.8 | Then the World-Honored One spoke in verse: |
| B-19.9 | "Now again, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down— |
| B-19.10 | Then the World-Honored One spoke in verse: |
| B-19.11 | "Now again, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman—after the Tathāgata's extinction—holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down— |
| B-19.12 | Then the World-Honored One spoke in verse: |
| B-20.1 | A Blues Interpretation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese |
| B-20.2 | Now the Buddha, he turned to that Bodhisattva Great Power - you know that Great Power, that Mahāsattva - and the Buddha said: |
| B-20.3 | "Now after that first Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory had passed into extinction, after the True Dharma had done gone, in the time of the Imitation Dharma, there was monks full up with arrogance and pride, and they had great power in that world. |
| B-20.4 | "Now when this monk was about to die, right there in the sky, in the empty air, he heard all twenty thousand myriads of millions of verses of the Lotus Sutra that Buddha King Sound-of-Thunder-and-Glory had taught before. He was able to receive and hold every verse. Right then and there, he got them purified eye-roots like I described before - his ears purified, nose, tongue, body, and mind-roots all purified. |
| B-20.5 | "Great Power, this Bodhisattva Never Looked Down, he made offerings to so many Buddhas like this - respecting them, honoring them, praising them, planting all kinds of good roots. And after that, he met thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas. And in all them Buddhas' Dharma, he taught this sutra. His merit was accomplished, and he became a Buddha. |
| B-20.6 | Then the World-Honored One, wanting to say this teaching one more time, spoke in verse: |
| B-21.1 | Now listen here—at that time, all them Bodhisattvas what come up from the earth, countless as dust motes in a thousand worlds, they all standing there before the Buddha, hands pressed together, gazing up at that holy face, and they speaking out their hearts: |
| B-21.2 | Now at that time the World-Honored One, right there before Mañjuśrī and all them countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of Bodhisattvas what been dwelling in this Saha world from way back, and before all the monks and nuns, the laymen and laywomen, the devas and dragons and yakshas and gandharvas and asuras and garudas and kinnaras and mahoragas, before humans and non-humans alike—before EVERY LIVING THING THAT EVER WAS—the Buddha showed forth his great supernatural power. |
| B-21.3 | Now all the living beings in them worlds—the devas and dragons and yakshas and gandharvas and asuras and garudas and kinnaras and mahoragas, humans and non-humans—through the Buddha's supernatural power, they ALL SAW this Saha world. |
| B-21.4 | Right then and there, the devas in empty space, they raised up they voices high and made this proclamation: |
| B-21.5 | At that time the Buddha told Superior Practices and all them other Bodhisattvas: |
| B-21.6 | At that time the World-Honored One, wanting to restate this meaning, spoke in verse: |
| B-22.1 | Now you got to see this right— |
| B-22.2 | And he do it again— |
| B-22.3 | Now you got to follow his example, |
| B-22.4 | Now when them Bodhisattvas |
| B-22.5 | Then Śākyamuni Buddha, |
| B-23.1 | Interpreted from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese into Blues/Gospel Vernacular English |
| B-23.2 | Now at that time, Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva stood up and said to the Buddha: |
| B-23.3 | Then the Buddha said to Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva: |
| B-23.4 | "Now at that time, that Buddha was preaching the Lotus Sutra to a bodhisattva called Gladly Seen by All Living Beings—yeah, 'Gladly Seen by All Living Beings,' that's his name—and to all the other bodhisattvas and disciples gathered there. |
| B-23.5 | "After making that offering, he came out of his samādhi and thought to himself: |
| B-23.6 | "After Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva made that Dharma-offering, his life ended. But after his life ended, he was born again in the land of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, in the house of Pure Virtue King. Sitting in full lotus position, he suddenly appeared—born by transformation. |
| B-23.7 | "After Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva spoke that verse, he said to the Buddha: |
| B-23.8 | "When Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva saw the Buddha pass into extinction, he was struck with grief, brokenhearted, filled with longing for the Buddha. |
| B-23.9 | "Then Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva thought to himself again: |
| B-23.10 | "Now when all them bodhisattvas, gods, humans, jealous fighting gods, and the rest saw he didn't have no arms, they were distressed and sorrowful and grief-struck, and they said: |
| B-23.11 | "Right then, Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva stood there in the midst of that great assembly and made this vow: |
| B-23.12 | The Buddha said to Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva: |
| B-23.13 | "Constellation King Flower, listen: |
| B-23.14 | "Constellation King Flower, this sutra can rescue all living beings. This sutra can cause all living beings to leave all suffering and distress. This sutra can greatly benefit all living beings, filling up their wishes. |
| B-23.15 | "Constellation King Flower, if someone hears this Chapter on the Past Deeds of Medicine King Bodhisattva, they also get measureless, boundless merit. |
| B-23.16 | "At that time, all those Buddhas will praise her from far away, saying: |
| B-23.17 | "If someone hears this Chapter on the Past Deeds of Medicine King Bodhisattva and can rejoice and praise it—from that person's mouth will constantly come the fragrance of blue lotus flowers. From their body's pores will constantly come the fragrance of ox-head sandalwood. The merit they get is like what I already said. |
| B-23.18 | "Constellation King Flower, you should use your supernatural powers to guard and protect this sutra. Why? Because this sutra is good medicine for the people of this southern continent when they sick. |
| B-23.19 | "Constellation King Flower, if you see someone who receives and keeps this sutra, you should take blue lotus flowers, fill them with powdered incense, and scatter them over that person. After you scatter them, you should think like this: |
| B-23.20 | When the Buddha told this Chapter on the Past Deeds of Medicine King Bodhisattva, eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas attained the dhāraṇī for understanding the languages of all living beings. |
| B-23.21 | This chapter contains some of the most extreme imagery in all of Buddhist literature: a bodhisattva who saturates his body with fragrant oils for 1,200 years, then sets himself on fire and burns for another 1,200 years. Later, he burns both his arms for 72,000 years. |
| B-23.22 | The most dramatic moment in the chapter: Medicine King burns his arms as offerings for 72,000 years. When the assembly sees him armless, they cry out: "His body is incomplete!" |
| B-23.23 | The Buddha makes an extraordinary statement near the end of this chapter: |
| B-23.24 | Throughout this chapter, fragrance signals transformation: |
| B-23.25 | The middle section of the chapter contains a long series of analogies proclaiming the Lotus Sutra's supremacy: |
| B-23.26 | The chapter's title character is *Medicine King* (藥王, Bhaiṣajya-rāja). The Buddha says near the end: "This sutra is good medicine for the people of this southern continent when they sick." |
| B-23.27 | The chapter's central paradox: Medicine King achieves the highest spiritual realization by destroying his physical body, yet his body is restored, and he's reborn in a king's house, and he continues practicing and teaching. |
| B-23.28 | FINAL WORD |
| B-23.29 | ═══════════════════ |
| B-23.30 | This chapter asks: What would you give for the truth? |
| B-24.1 | Now listen here. The Buddha Śākyamuni, he let loose a light— |
| B-24.2 | Now in that Pure Light Adorned world, |
| B-24.3 | Now Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha, |
| B-24.4 | Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva, he bowed to his Buddha and said: |
| B-24.5 | And then, right there, |
| B-24.6 | Now Mañjuśrī, that Dharma Prince, |
| B-24.7 | Mañjuśrī said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, |
| B-24.8 | And Many Treasures Buddha, from inside that treasure tower, |
| B-24.9 | And right then, Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva, |
| B-24.10 | When he arrived, he came down from that seven-jeweled platform, |
| B-24.11 | Now Flower Virtue Bodhisattva, he asked the Buddha: |
| B-24.12 | "Flower Virtue, you just seeing Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva's body here, |
| B-24.13 | "Flower Virtue, this Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva |
| B-24.14 | Then Flower Virtue Bodhisattva said to the Buddha: |
| B-24.15 | When this chapter about Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva was taught, |
| B-24.16 | Then Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva Mahasattva, |
| B-24.17 | When this chapter about Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva's |
| B-25.1 | Interpreted from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese into Blues/Gospel Vernacular |
| B-25.2 | Right then, the Bodhisattva named Inexhaustible Intention - he rose up from his seat, bared his right shoulder in that ancient way of showing respect, pressed his palms together before the Buddha, and said: |
| B-25.3 | "Listen to what I'm telling you: |
| B-25.4 | Homage to the Observer of Sounds! |
| B-25.5 | "Inexhaustible Intention, this Great Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara - |
| B-25.6 | "If a woman wants a son, |
| B-25.7 | "Inexhaustible Intention, suppose someone upholds the names of sixty-two billion Bodhisattvas - |
| B-25.8 | Inexhaustible Intention asked the Buddha: |
| B-25.9 | Inexhaustible Intention said to the Buddha: |
| B-25.10 | Then Inexhaustible Intention asked in verse: |
| B-25.11 | Right then, Earth-Holding Bodhisattva stood up from his seat, |
| B-26.1 | A Blues/Gospel Interpretation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese |
| B-26.2 | Now right then, Medicine King Bodhisattva—you remember him, the one who burned his own body to show his devotion—he stood up from his seat, put his robe over one shoulder the way you do when you're about to say something serious, pressed his palms together, and spoke to the Buddha: |
| B-26.3 | SHAME SHAMITARE SHANTE MUKTE MUKTAME |
| B-26.4 | SAME AVISAME SAMASAME JAYE KSHAYE |
| B-26.5 | AKSHINE SHANTE SHAME DHĀRAṆĪ |

| B-26.12 | AKSHARA AKSHARA TYAYANTE ABHYAVAKARA AVALOKANI |
| B-26.13 | "World-Honored One," Medicine King said, "this protection song, this powerful dhāraṇī, has been spoken by six hundred and twenty million Buddhas—as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges. Listen here: If anybody harms a teacher of this Dharma, they have harmed ALL THOSE BUDDHAS. You understand what I'm saying? You touch one of ours, you touch the whole family." |
| B-26.14 | Then Śākyamuni Buddha praised Medicine King, saying: "Good, good! Medicine King, you done right. Because you have compassion for these Dharma teachers, because you want to protect them, you spoke this dhāraṇī. And it's gonna bring great benefit to all living beings. Great benefit indeed." |
| B-26.15 | Right then, Brave Giver Bodhisattva spoke up to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I'm gonna add my protection too. I'm gonna give a dhāraṇī to guard those who read and recite and hold on to the Lotus teaching. If a Dharma teacher has this protection song, then listen: |
| B-26.16 | ADAVATI NRTYE NRTYAVATI ITTINI |
| B-26.17 | VITTINI CHITTINI NRTYANI NRTYAVATI |
| B-26.18 | "World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī protection song has been spoken by as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. And all of them rejoiced in it. Listen here: If anybody harms a teacher of this Dharma, they have harmed ALL THOSE BUDDHAS. You hear what I'm saying?" |
| B-26.19 | Right then, Vaishravana—that's the Heavenly King, the Guardian of the North, the Protector of the World—he spoke to the Buddha: |
| B-26.20 | "World-Honored One, with this powerful protection song I'm gonna guard these Dharma teachers. I myself will protect those who hold this teaching. For a hundred yojanas around them—that's a mighty long distance—there will be NO TROUBLE. No sickness, no disaster, no harm. I'm watching." |
| B-26.21 | Right then, Dhrtarashtra—that's the Heavenly King who Guards the East—he was in that assembly with ten thousand million nayutas of gandharva musicians all around him, showing respect. He came forward to where the Buddha was, pressed his palms together, and said: |
| B-26.22 | MATANGI JANGULE VRUSE PUKKASI BHARYE |
| B-26.23 | "World-Honored One, this dhāraṇī protection song has been spoken by four hundred and twenty million Buddhas. If anybody harms a teacher of this Dharma, they have harmed ALL THOSE BUDDHAS. That's what I'm telling you." |
| B-26.24 | Right then there were ten yaksha goddesses—now these are fierce female spirits, you understand—and their names were: |
| B-26.25 | NIVRI NIVRI NIVRI NIVRI |
| B-26.26 | RUHE RUHE RUHE RUHE |
| B-26.27 | TAHE TAHE TAHE |
| B-26.28 | TUHE STUHE |
| B-26.29 | And then they said—listen to this oath now, this is serious: |
| B-26.30 | When those yaksha goddesses had spoken this verse, they said to the Buddha: |
| B-26.31 | When this Protection Songs chapter was spoken, sixty-eight thousand people—that's right, sixty-eight thousand souls—attained the patience of non-arising. That means they reached the place where they knew: Nothing is born, nothing dies, it all just keeps flowing. They got free right then, just from hearing about this protection. |
| B-27.1 | **On Spiritual Friends as a Blues/Gospel Concept** |
| B-28.1 | CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT: UNIVERSAL WORTHY COMES TO ENCOURAGE YOU |
| B-28.2 | Listen now to how it all ends, how the whole teaching comes to its close: |
| B-28.3 | At that time, Universal Worthy Bodhisattva—riding on his own sovereign supernatural power, carried by his mighty virtue and his name that's known throughout all worlds—he came from the East with countless, boundless, can't-be-numbered great Bodhisattvas. And listen, everywhere those beings passed through on their journey, all those countries shook and trembled. Jeweled lotus flowers rained down from the sky. A hundred thousand million billion kinds of music played—not human music, understand, but cosmic music, the sound the universe makes when grace is moving. |
| B-28.4 | And he didn't come alone. No sir. He brought with him numberless gods, dragons, night-wanderers, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans—all of them surrounding him, every one of them showing their own power and virtue and supernatural might. They all came to this Saha world, to Vulture Peak Mountain. When they got there, they bowed their heads to the ground before Śākyamuni Buddha. They walked around him seven times to the right, and then Universal Worthy said to the Buddha: |
| B-28.5 | "World-Honored One, I was in the land of Precious Majesty Superior King Buddha, and way over there I heard that in this Saha world you were preaching this Lotus Sutra. So I came with these countless, boundless, hundred thousand million billion Bodhisattvas to listen and receive it. I'm asking you, World-Honored One—please tell us: After the Tathāgata passes away, when you're gone from this world, how can good men and good women get hold of this Lotus Sutra? How do they receive it?" |
| B-28.6 | The Buddha told Universal Worthy Bodhisattva: |
| B-28.7 | "If good men and good women accomplish four things, then after the Tathāgata passes away, they WILL get this Lotus Sutra. Listen to what these four things are: |
| B-28.8 | "First: They're protected and kept in mind by all the Buddhas. |
| B-28.9 | "Second: They've planted roots of virtue, built up good deep in themselves. |
| B-28.10 | "Third: They've entered the company of those who are fixed on the right path, who are determined, who won't turn back. |
| B-28.11 | "Fourth: They've aroused the mind that wants to save ALL living beings—every last one. |
| B-28.12 | "Good men and good women who accomplish these four things—after the Tathāgata passes away, they WILL get this sutra. Count on it. It's guaranteed." |
| B-28.13 | Then Universal Worthy Bodhisattva said to the Buddha: |
| B-28.14 | "World-Honored One, in the last five hundred years, in that polluted evil age that's coming, whoever receives and holds this sutra—I WILL guard them. I will protect them. I will remove their troubles and their dangers. I will give them peace and safety. I will make sure that nothing—NOTHING—can find a way to harm them. |
| B-28.15 | "No demons, no demons' sons, no demons' daughters, no demon-followers, no demon-possessed people. No night-wanderers, no rakshasas, no kumbhandas, no pishachas, no krityas, no putanas, no vetadas—none of these beings that trouble people will be able to take advantage of them. |
| B-28.16 | "Whether that person is walking or standing still, whether they're reading this sutra or reciting it—at that time I will ride my six-tusked white elephant king. I will come with a great company of Bodhisattvas to where that person is. I will show myself to them. I will make offerings to them. I will guard them. I will comfort their hearts. You know why I'll do all this? Because I'm also making offerings to the Lotus Sutra itself. |
| B-28.17 | "And if that person is sitting down, thinking about this sutra, meditating on it—at that time I will ride that white elephant king again and appear before them. If they forget even one sentence, one verse of the Lotus Sutra, I WILL teach it to them. I will recite it together with them. I will help them understand it thoroughly. |
| B-28.18 | "And when that person who receives and holds and reads and recites the Lotus Sutra sees me, they will be filled with great joy—the kind of joy that makes you want to keep going. And because they see me, right then and there they will gain samādhis and dhāraṇīs. They'll gain the Revolving Dharani, the Hundred Thousand Million Billion Revolving Dharani, the Dharani of Skillful Means in the Sound of the Teaching. They'll get dhāraṇīs like these." |
| B-28.19 | "World-Honored One, in that later age, in the last five hundred years, in that polluted evil world—if there are monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen who seek this teaching, who receive it, who read it, who recite it, who copy it down, if they want to practice this Lotus Sutra—they should focus themselves single-mindedly for three weeks. Twenty-one days. |
| B-28.20 | "When those three weeks are completed, I will ride my six-tusked white elephant. I will come with countless Bodhisattvas surrounding me. I will appear to that person in a body that all beings love to see. I will preach the Dharma to them. I will show them. I will teach them. I will benefit them. I will make them glad. And I will also give them dhāraṇī-mantras. |
| B-28.21 | "And when they get these dhāraṇīs, no non-human being will be able to break them. No woman will be able to lead them astray. I myself will always guard that person. |
| B-28.22 | "So World-Honored One, please let me speak this dhāraṇī-mantra." |
| B-28.23 | Then right there, standing before the Buddha, he spoke the mantra: |
| B-28.24 | Atandi / Tandavabha-di / Tandavabha-te / Tanda-kusalai / Tanda-sudalai / Sudalai / Sudara-vabha-te-buddha-pashane / Sarva-dhāraṇī-avabha-tani / Sarva-bhasha-avabha-tani / Shu-avabha-tani / Sengha-pariksha-ni / Sengha-nirgha-tani / Asengi / Sengha-bhaga-di / Taile-ayuta-sengha-dutale / Arati-barati / Sarva-sengha-samadi-galan-di / Sarva-dharma-shubha-lishate / Sarva-sattva-rutaka-ushalya-anumga-di / Shen-avi-kilidi-te |
| B-28.25 | "World-Honored One, if any Bodhisattva hears this dhāraṇī, they should know it's the supernatural power of Universal Worthy at work. If this Lotus Sutra circulates in this Jambudvipa world, if anyone receives and holds it, they should think: 'This is ALL because of Universal Worthy's mighty spiritual power.' |
| B-28.26 | "If anyone receives it, reads it, recites it, keeps it correctly in mind, understands its meaning, practices according to what it says—know that such a person is doing Universal Worthy's practice. They've planted deep roots of goodness before countless, boundless Buddhas. The Tathāgatas themselves have put their hands on that person's head. |
| B-28.27 | "If someone just copies this sutra down, writes it out—when that person dies, they will be born in the Trayastrimsha Heaven. At that time, eighty-four thousand heavenly women will come to greet them, playing all kinds of music. That person will wear a crown made of seven jewels, and there among those palace women they will experience joy and happiness. How much more so for those who receive it, read it, recite it, keep it correctly in mind, understand its meaning, and practice according to what it says! |
| B-28.28 | "If anyone receives and holds this teaching, reads and recites it, understands its meaning—when that person's life ends, a thousand Buddhas will reach out their hands to them. They won't be afraid. They won't fall into evil destinies. They will go straight to Tushita Heaven, to where Maitreya Bodhisattva is. Maitreya Bodhisattva has the thirty-two marks of a great being. He's surrounded by a great assembly of Bodhisattvas. He's attended by hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of heavenly women. That person will be born right there in that company. These are the kinds of merits and benefits they'll receive. |
| B-28.29 | "So if you're wise, you should single-mindedly copy this sutra yourself, or have someone else copy it. You should receive it, hold it, read it, recite it, keep it correctly in mind, and practice according to what it says. |
| B-28.30 | "World-Honored One, I will now use my supernatural powers to guard this sutra. After the Tathāgata passes away, I will cause it to spread widely throughout this Jambudvipa. I will make sure it never dies out." |
| B-28.31 | At that time Śākyamuni Buddha praised him, saying: |
| B-28.32 | "Excellent! Excellent, Universal Worthy! You can protect and help this sutra, causing many beings to gain peace, benefit, and happiness. You have already accomplished inconceivable merit and deep great compassion. From the distant past you have aroused the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment, and now you are able to make this supernatural vow to guard this sutra. |
| B-28.33 | "I will use my own supernatural power to guard and protect anyone who can receive and hold the name of Bodhisattva Universal Worthy." |
| B-28.34 | "Universal Worthy, if anyone receives, holds, reads, recites, keeps correctly in mind, practices, and copies this Lotus Sutra—know that such a person SEES Śākyamuni Buddha. It's as if they hear this sutra directly from the Buddha's mouth. |
| B-28.35 | "Know that such a person is MAKING OFFERINGS to Śākyamuni Buddha. |
| B-28.36 | "Know that the Buddha is saying to them: 'Excellent! Well done!' |
| B-28.37 | "Know that Śākyamuni Buddha is placing his hand on that person's head. |
| B-28.38 | "Know that Śākyamuni Buddha's robe is covering them, protecting them. |
| B-28.39 | "Such a person will no longer be greedy for worldly pleasures. They won't like the scriptures or writings of non-Buddhist paths. They won't take pleasure in getting close to such people or to those who do evil—butchers, those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens, or dogs, hunters, those who sell sex. |
| B-28.40 | "That person's mind and intentions will be straight and true. They will have right mindfulness. They will have the power of merit and virtue. |
| B-28.41 | "That person will not be troubled by the three poisons. They also will not be troubled by jealousy, arrogance, self-deception, or inflated pride. |
| B-28.42 | "That person will have few desires. They will know contentment. They will be able to practice Universal Worthy's way." |
| B-28.43 | "Universal Worthy, after the Tathāgata passes away, in the last five hundred years—if anyone sees someone who receives, holds, reads, and recites the Lotus Sutra, they should think: |
| B-28.44 | 'This person will not be long in going to the place of enlightenment. This person is about to break through all the demon armies. This person is about to attain supreme perfect enlightenment. This person is about to turn the Dharma wheel, beat the Dharma drum, blow the Dharma conch, rain down the Dharma rain. This person is about to sit on the lion throne of Dharma in the great assembly of gods and humans.' |
| B-28.45 | "Universal Worthy, if in later ages anyone receives, holds, reads, and recites this sutra—that person will no longer be greedy for clothes, bedding, food, drink, or the things that sustain life. Their wishes will not be empty. Even in this present life they will receive the rewards of blessing. |
| B-28.46 | "If anyone slights and insults them, saying 'You're just a crazy person! You do this practice for nothing! In the end you'll gain nothing!'—the karmic retribution for speaking like that is this: that person will be eyeless, blind, world after world after world. |
| B-28.47 | "But if anyone makes offerings to them and praises them, they will see the fruit of that reward in this very life. |
| B-28.48 | "If anyone sees someone who receives and holds this sutra and exposes their faults—whether those faults are real or made up—that person in this present life will get white leprosy. |
| B-28.49 | "If anyone mocks and laughs at them, that person world after world will have gapped and broken teeth, ugly lips, a flat nose, twisted hands and feet, squinting eyes, a body that stinks, evil sores, pus and blood, bloated belly, short breath, and all kinds of severe and evil diseases. |
| B-28.50 | "Therefore, Universal Worthy, if you see anyone who receives and holds this sutra, you should rise up and go meet them from far away. You should respect them just as you would respect a Buddha." |
| B-28.51 | When the Buddha spoke this Chapter of Universal Worthy's Encouragement, Bodhisattvas countless as the sands of the Ganges River gained hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Revolving Dharanis. Bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust motes in a great thousand-fold world system fully accomplished Universal Worthy's Way. |
| B-28.52 | When the Buddha was speaking this sutra, Universal Worthy and all the other Bodhisattvas, Śāriputra and all the other disciples, and the gods, dragons, humans, non-humans, and everyone in that entire great assembly—they all received it with great joy. They accepted and held the Buddha's words. They bowed in respect and departed. |

| S-1.1 | Thus have I heard.¹ At one time, the Buddha was dwelling at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa near the city of Rājagṛha,² together with a great assembly of twelve thousand bhikṣus.³ All of these practitioners had attained the state of Arhat—having exhausted all outflows of mental affliction, having eliminated all defilements, having realized their own ultimate benefit, having severed all bonds of conditioned existence, and having attained complete freedom of mind.⁴ |
| S-1.2 | Furthermore, there were also two thousand persons⁶ among both those still in training and those who had completed their training. The bhikṣuṇī Mahāprajāpatī was present together with her retinue of six thousand bhikṣuṇīs.⁷ Yaśodharā, the mother of Rāhula, was also present with her retinue.⁸ |
| S-1.3 | Moreover, Śakra Devānām Indra (the Lord of the Thirty-Three Heavens) was present with his retinue of twenty thousand celestial sons.¹⁹ The celestial sons Candravimala (Moonlight), Manojñasvara, Ratnacchattra, and the Four Great Heavenly Kings were also present, together with their retinue of ten thousand celestial sons.²⁰ |
| S-1.4 | At that time, the World-Honored One, surrounded by the fourfold assembly²⁵ and having been honored with reverent offerings, praise, and adoration, expounded for the assembled Bodhisattvas a Mahāyāna sutra entitled the *Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings*—a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured and protected by the Buddhas.²⁶ |
| S-1.5 | At that time, all the beings present in the assembly—bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas (male lay practitioners), upāsikās (female lay practitioners), devas (celestial beings), nāgas (serpent-beings), yakṣas (nature spirits), gandharvas (celestial musicians), asuras (anti-gods), garuḍas (divine eagles), kiṃnaras (celestial musicians), mahoragas (great serpents), humans, and non-human beings, together with the lesser kings and wheel-turning sage kings³²—the entire great assembly experienced phenomena they had never before experienced. |
| S-1.6 | At that time, the Buddha emitted a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows (the ūrṇā-keśa, an auspicious mark of Buddhahood).³⁴ This light illuminated eighteen thousand worlds to the east, omitting none, extending downward to the Avīci hell³⁵ and upward to the Akaniṣṭha Heaven (the highest heaven of the form realm).³⁶ |
| S-1.7 | At that time, the Bodhisattva Maitreya⁴² had this thought: "Now the World-Honored One has manifested this extraordinary spiritual transformation and display of supernatural power. For what cause and condition has this auspicious sign appeared? The Buddha, the World-Honored One, has now entered into samādhi—this inconceivable manifestation of rare phenomena heretofore unprecedented. To whom should I pose my question? Who possesses the capacity to answer such a profound matter?"⁴³ |
| S-1.8 | At that time, the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, and all the devas, nāgas, and other spirits all harbored this thought: "This extraordinary Buddha-light and display of spiritual power—of whom should we now inquire? To whom shall we address our questions?"⁴⁵ |
| S-1.9 | At that time, the Bodhisattva Maitreya, wishing to resolve his own doubt and observing the minds of the fourfold assembly—the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, and all the devas, nāgas, and spirits of the assembly—addressed Mañjuśrī directly, saying: |
| S-1.10 | Thereupon, the Bodhisattva Maitreya, wishing to restate this meaning in verse form, spoke the following inquiry: |
| S-1.11 | [This section continues with Mañjuśrī's lengthy explanation, which forms the substantial core of Chapter 1. Due to length, the full verse and extended prose explanation follows here:] |
| S-1.12 | "At that time, the Tathāgata of Burning Lamps expounded the Mahāyāna sutra called the *Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings*, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured and protected by the Buddhas. After completing the exposition of this sutra, he sat in full lotus posture in the assembly and entered into the samādhi called the abode of immeasurable meanings, with his body and mind completely unmoving. |
| S-1.13 | "After the Tathāgata of Burning Lamps had expounded this sutra for sixty small eons, he then announced to the assembly of Brahmā kings, Māra, śramaṇas, Brahmins, gods, humans, asuras, and all other beings: 'In this very night, the Tathāgata shall enter into parinirvāṇa (final transcendence).' |
| S-1.14 | Thereupon, the Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, wishing to restate this meaning in verse, spoke: |
| S-1.15 | 1. **"Thus have I heard"** (*Evam maya śrutam*, 如是我聞): This formulaic opening appears in virtually all Buddhist sutras, attributed to Ānanda, the Buddha's cousin and attendant. The phrase serves multiple functions: (1) it authenticates the teaching as deriving from direct witnessing; (2) it establishes the tradition of oral transmission; (3) it suggests that this account is neither fabricated nor secondhand knowledge. Philosophically, the phrase grounds Buddhist teaching in direct experience (pratyakṣa), a central epistemological principle in Buddhist philosophy. |

| S-2.1 | At that time, the World-Honored One, having emerged from meditation with composed serenity, addressed Śāriputra:¹ |
| S-2.2 | Then the Buddha said: "Cease, Śāriputra. There is no need to speak further. Why? The supremely rare and extraordinary teaching that the Buddha has accomplished—the dharma most difficult to understand—can only be fully penetrated and exhausted by the Buddha together with other Buddhas. I refer to the realm of reality in which:⁶ |
| S-2.3 | The World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, then spoke in verse: |
| S-2.4 | At that time, there were in the great assembly twelve hundred Śrāvakas who had exhausted all outflows and were Arhats, including Ājñātakauṇḍinya and others, as well as those among the bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs, male and female lay disciples who had generated the aspiration toward Śrāvaka and Pratyekabuddha vehicles. All of them harbored this thought: |
| S-2.5 | At that time, Śāriputra, recognizing the perplexity in the hearts of the fourfold assembly and being himself uncertain, addressed the Buddha: |
| S-2.6 | Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse: |
| S-2.7 | Then the Buddha said to Śāriputra: "Cease, cease! There is no need to speak further. If I were to explain this matter, the entire world of devas and humans would be astonished and filled with perplexity."¹¹ |
| S-2.8 | Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse: |
| S-2.9 | The Buddha again restrained Śāriputra, saying: "If I were to explain this matter, all the devas, humans, and asuras would be astonished. Moreover, monks seized by arrogant conceit will fall into a great abyss."¹³ |
| S-2.10 | Then the World-Honored One spoke in verse: |
| S-2.11 | Then Śāriputra again respectfully addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I beseech you to speak! I beseech you to speak! In this assembly, there are ones comparable to myself, numbering in the hundreds of thousands and billions across countless ages. Having long been transformed by the Buddha, such persons will certainly generate respectful faith and enjoy long safety and repose, receiving immeasurable benefit."¹⁴ |
| S-2.12 | Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse: |
| S-2.13 | Then the World-Honored One said to Śāriputra: "You have made your earnest request three times. How could I not speak? Now listen attentively and think carefully upon what I say. I shall make clear distinctions for you."¹⁵ |
| S-2.14 | Then the Buddha said to Śāriputra: "Now my assembly here is entirely purified, without superfluous branches—consisting only of authentic fruit. Śāriputra, such proud and conceited persons departing is a good thing. Now listen well. I shall explain this to you. Śāriputra replied: 'Excellent, World-Honored One. I earnestly desire to hear.'"¹⁸ |
| S-2.15 | The Buddha then addressed Śāriputra: |
| S-2.16 | The Buddha then addressed Śāriputra: |
| S-2.17 | "Śāriputra, the Buddhas teach and transform only Bodhisattvas. Whatever the Buddhas undertake to do is always for one purpose alone: to show sentient beings the Buddha-perception, to cause them to awaken to it. |
| S-2.18 | "Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the past employed innumerable skillful means, various causes and conditions, parables and verbal expressions to expound upon the various dharmas. All these dharmas were for the One Buddha Vehicle alone. The sentient beings who heard the dharma from these Buddhas ultimately obtained the wisdom-knowing-all-aspects (sarvākārajñatā).²⁴ |
| S-2.19 | "Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions, there do not even exist two vehicles, much less three. Śāriputra, the Buddhas appear in the world amid the five corruptions and turbidities²⁶—namely, the corruption of the age, the corruption of afflictions, the corruption of sentient beings, the corruption of views, and the corruption of lifespan. |
| S-2.20 | "Moreover, Śāriputra, those bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs who claim they have already attained the state of Arhat, that this is their final body, and that they have ultimately realized nirvāṇa, and therefore no longer aspire to realize anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi—you should understand that such persons are seized by arrogant conceit. |
| S-2.21 | Then the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse: |
| S-2.22 | "This dharma dwells in the dharmic position; the characteristics of the world ever remain constant. Upon the seat of enlightenment, having understood this, the guide teaches it through skillful means.³⁴ |
| S-2.23 | 1. **"Emerged from meditation with composed serenity"** (從三昧安詳而起): The phrase 安詳 (anshang) suggests calm, measured, and deliberate movement, indicating that the Buddha's emergence from deep meditative absorption occurs with perfect composure. This physical embodiment of tranquility establishes the tone for the profound teachings to follow. |
| S-2.24 | 1. **"Emerged from meditation with composed serenity"** (從三昧安詳而起): The phrase 安詳 (anshang) suggests calm, measured, and deliberate movement, indicating that the Buddha's emergence from deep meditative absorption occurs with perfect composure.

| S-3.1 | At that time, Śāriputra, overflowing with joy and delight, immediately rose from his seat, pressed his palms together in salutation, gazed upon the Buddha's face with reverent attention, and addressed the Buddha: |
| S-3.2 | Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse: |
| S-3.3 | Then the Buddha addressed Śāriputra: "Now I speak before the assembly of devas, humans, monks, and Brahmins: I previously, for immeasurable billions of eons, in the presence of twenty billion Buddhas, for the sake of achieving the supreme path, continually taught and transformed you. You also, for countless nights, followed me and received my teaching. |
| S-3.4 | "Śāriputra, in the future world, after passing through immeasurable, boundless, inconceivable eons, having made offerings to countless billions of Buddhas, upheld the correct dharma, perfected the bodhisattva path, you shall become a Buddha with the title Tathāgata of Radiant Flower, Worthy of Offerings, Possessor of Perfect Knowledge, Possessor of Perfect Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed Guide, Trainer of Beings, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. |
| S-3.5 | "Śāriputra, at the time of this Buddha's emergence, although it will not be an evil age, because of his original vow, he will teach the three-vehicle dharma. The eon shall be named 'Great Jeweled Adornment.' Why is it called 'Great Jeweled Adornment'? Because the beings considered the great jewels of that realm are the Bodhisattvas themselves.⁵ |
| S-3.6 | "Śāriputra, if in a country, city, or village there is a great householder—elderly, with wealth without measure, possessing much land, houses, servants, and retainers. His house is vast with only a single gate. Many people—one hundred, two hundred, up to five hundred—dwell within it. The buildings are decayed and deteriorated, the walls cracked and crumbling, the pillars at their foundations rotting and corrupting, the roof beams tilting dangerously. All around simultaneously, fire suddenly erupts, burning the entire dwelling.⁷ |
| S-3.7 | "Śāriputra, if in a country, city, or village there is a great householder—elderly, with wealth without measure, possessing much land, houses, servants, and retainers. His house is vast with only a single gate. Many people—one hundred, two hundred, up to five hundred—dwell within it. The buildings are decayed and deteriorated, the walls cracked and crumbling, the pillars at their foundations rotting and corrupting, the roof beams tilting dangerously. All around simultaneously, fire suddenly erupts, burning the entire dwelling.⁷ |
| S-3.8 | "Śāriputra, the householder then thinks: 'My body possesses strength and skill. I should use my garments or a cloth to pull the children out of the house.' Then again he thinks: 'This house has only one gate, and it is narrow and small. The children are very young, without understanding or awareness, clinging to their playing places. When they come out, they might fall down or be burned by the fire. I must describe to them the frightening nature of this situation—this house is already burning, and it is fitting that you quickly exit, so that the fire does not burn and harm you.' |
| S-3.9 | "At that time the householder immediately thinks: 'This house is greatly burning in flames. If I and my children do not exit in time, we shall all be burned. Now I must establish skillful means to enable my children to escape this danger.' |
| S-3.10 | "Śāriputra, at that time the householder bestows upon each child one great carriage. That carriage is tall and spacious, adorned and decorated with multitudinous precious materials, surrounded by railings, with bells suspended from all four sides. From its top hangs a jeweled canopy, also decorated and adorned with rare and various treasures. Jeweled ropes interweave, and precious flower-garlands hang down. Soft fabrics are thickly spread within, and cushioned with crimson pillows are arranged for reclining. |
| S-3.11 | "Śāriputra, what do you think of this matter? Is the householder's giving of these precious great carts to the children deceptive in any way?"¹⁴ |
| S-3.12 | Then the Buddha said to Śāriputra: "Excellent! Excellent! As you have spoken. Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is likewise the father of all the world.¹⁶ |
| S-3.13 | "Śāriputra, the Tathāgata again forms this thought: 'If I merely employ supernatural power and wisdom-power, abandoning skillful means, and for sentient beings praise the Tathāgata's wisdom, fearlessness, and powers, sentient beings would not thereby be liberated. Why? These sentient beings have not yet escaped birth, old age, sickness, death, and sorrow—they are burned by the three-world burning house. How could they comprehend Buddha-wisdom?'²⁰" |
| S-3.14 | "Śāriputra, as the householder, though possessed of physical strength and skill, did not employ it, but only through persistent skillful means labored to rescue his children from the burning house, and afterward gave them precious great carts—the Tathāgata is likewise: |
| S-3.15 | "Śāriputra, if there are sentient beings who possess inner wisdom-nature, who hear the dharma from the Buddha, the World-Honored One, generate faith and receive it, diligently cultivate, and speedily wish to escape the three worlds, seeking nirvāṇa for themselves—this is called the Śrāvaka Vehicle, like those children who sought the sheep-carts and exited the burning house.²³ |
| S-3.16 | "Śāriputra, as the householder, having seen his children safely escape from the burning house and arrive at the fearless place, knowing his wealth is without measure, grants to each child these great vehicles as equal gifts—the Tathāgata is likewise: |
| S-3.17 | "Śāriputra, as the householder initially employed three carts to entice his children, and subsequently gave them only the great carriage, with precious treasures and adornment, the most secure and supreme—yet that householder harbored no deception. |
| S-3.18 | Then the Buddha, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse elaborating the entire parable with vivid detail and concluding: |
| S-3.19 | The Buddha then spoke extensive verses warning of the grave consequences of rejecting the Lotus Sutra while also affirming those who receive it with faith. The teaching concludes with criteria for worthy recipients:²⁹ |
| S-3.20 | 1. **"Lost the infinite wisdom of the Tathāgata"** (失於如來無量知見): This phrase expresses Śāriputra's regret at believing he has achieved the ultimate when in fact he has only attained the intermediate goal of Arhatship. The "infinite wisdom" represents the comprehensive Buddha-wisdom that transcends what the disciples believed they had attained. |
| S-3.21 | 1. **"Lost the infinite wisdom of the Tathāgata"** (失於如來無量知見): This phrase expresses Śāriputra's regret at believing he has achieved the ultimate when in fact he has only attained the intermediate goal of Arhatship. The "infinite wisdom" represents the comprehensive Buddha-wisdom that transcends what the disciples believed they had attained. |
| S-3.22 | **Key Philosophical Insights from Chapter 3:** |
| S-3.23 | **Key Philosophical Concepts**: Skillful means, Metaphysical unity, Priority of liberation, Buddha's infinite compassion |
| S-4.1 | At that time, the wise Subhūti, Mahākātyāyana, Mahākāśyapa, and Mahāmaudgalyāyana, having heard from the Buddha this unprecedented teaching, with the World-Honored One granting prophecy of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi to Śāriputra, their hearts were moved with wonder and delight. They immediately rose from their seats, straightened their robes, uncovered their right shoulders in respectful posture, knelt upon their right knees, unified their minds by placing their palms together in reverent salutation, bowed deeply in respect, gazed upon the Buddha's countenance with undivided attention, and addressed the Buddha: |
| S-4.2 | "World-Honored One, we now wish to speak in parable to clarify this meaning: |
| S-4.3 | "World-Honored One, at that time the impoverished son, having hired himself to various employers, eventually arrived at his father's dwelling. He stood beside the gate. From a distance, he saw his father, seated upon a magnificent throne, his feet resting upon a precious footrest. Brahmins, nobles, and merchants all paid him respectful reverence. His body was adorned with pearls and precious ornaments worth thousands of millions of coins. Officials, servants, and retainers held white fly-whisks, standing to his left and right. A jeweled canopy was suspended above him, with precious flower banners hanging down. Fragrant water had been sprinkled on the ground, and precious flowers were scattered about. Precious objects were arrayed in display, brought in and taken out for distribution. Such was the variety of his magnificent adornment, and his authority and dignity were specially exalted. |
| S-4.4 | "At that time the wealthy householder, seated upon his throne, recognized his son immediately and his heart was filled with great joy. He formed this thought: |
| S-4.5 | "At that time, the householder, desiring to entice and guide his son through the employment of skilful means, secretly sent two people of humble appearance, without power or prestige: |
| S-4.6 | "World-Honored One, at that time the householder became ill, and knowing that death was approaching, he spoke to his son: |
| S-4.7 | "World-Honored One, the wealthy householder is the Tathāgata. We all, in like manner, are Buddha-children. The Tathāgata constantly speaks of us as his children. |
| S-4.8 | Then Mahākāśyapa, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse. The extended verse parallels and reinforces the parable in poetic form, concluding with key affirmations: |
| S-4.9 | 1. **"We have long believed that we had already attained nirvāṇa"** (自謂已得涅槃): This opening statement establishes the disciples' fundamental misunderstanding—they believed they had reached the ultimate goal when in fact they had only achieved an intermediate realization. This sets up the parable's theme of false contentment transformed into recognition of higher potential. |
| S-4.10 | 1. **"We have long believed that we had already attained nirvāṇa"** (自謂已得涅槃): This opening statement establishes the disciples' fundamental misunderstanding—they believed they had reached the ultimate goal when in fact they had only achieved an intermediate realization. This sets up the parable's theme of false contentment transformed into recognition of higher potential. |

| S-4.13 | While the Burning House parable (Chapter 3) emphasizes escape from conditioned existence through skilful motivation, the Prodigal Son parable emphasizes: |
| S-4.14 | The parable's psychological insight into trauma and gradual transformation parallels modern trauma-informed therapy: |
| S-4.15 | - **Chapter 1**: Establishes universal Buddha-nature in assembly |
| S-4.16 | - Similar themes in the Jataka tales (past lives of Buddha) |
| S-4.17 | Chapter 4 represents a crucial turning point: |
| S-5.1 | The Medicinal Herbs parable completes the foundational teaching arc initiated in Chapters 2-4. Where Chapter 2 established the One Buddha Vehicle as the ultimate reality underlying apparent multiplicity, Chapter 3 showed how the Buddha employs skillful means to guide beings to safety, and Chapter 4 demonstrated how beings gradually recognize their inherent Buddha-nature, **Chapter 5 now reveals the principle governing this process: the Buddha's single teaching is like a universal rain that nourishes all beings according to their nature and capacity.** |
| S-5.2 | At this point in the assembly, the Buddha turns directly to Mahākāśyapa, one of the great disciples, and affirms what has been taught: |
| S-5.3 | The Buddha then presents the parable: |
| S-5.4 | The Buddha now applies this metaphor directly: |
| S-5.5 | The teaching then describes what occurs: |
| S-5.6 | The central paradox of this chapter now emerges explicitly: |
| S-5.7 | The Buddha then offers exceptional recognition to Mahākāśyapa and the assembly: |
| S-5.8 | The Buddha now speaks in verse to elaborate and emphasize the central points: |
| S-5.9 | The verse then extends the metaphor back to the Buddha: |
| S-5.10 | The verse then provides a systematic classification of the different beings who receive the teaching: |
| S-5.11 | The verse continues with emphasis on the Buddha's teaching method: |
| S-5.12 | The verse then details how different categories of disciples attain realization: |
| S-5.13 | The verse concludes with a powerful summation: |
| S-5.14 | The dharma is fundamentally singular—"one taste" of liberation, non-duality, and emptiness. Yet because emptiness means absence of fixed essence, this single dharma can manifest in infinitely varied forms without losing its essential unity. |
| S-5.15 | The dharma is fundamentally singular—"one taste" of liberation, non-duality, and emptiness. Yet because emptiness means absence of fixed essence, this single dharma can manifest in infinitely varied forms without losing its essential unity. |
| S-5.16 | Differences in beings' realization do not reflect differences in the dharma or in beings' fundamental Buddha-nature, but in their present capacity to receive and embody the teaching. This principle applies at all scales—individual, species, realm. |
| S-5.17 | The Buddha teaches equally to all beings without preference or abandonment, just as rain falls equally on all plants. This absolute non-discrimination is possible precisely because the Buddha's teaching is responsive to each being's actual condition rather than operating at the level of external categories. |
| S-5.18 | Skillful means (upaya) are not deceptive tricks but expressions of the dharma's essential nature. Because reality is empty of fixed essence, teaching can adapt without contradiction. Because all beings are empty-natured, the Buddha can know and respond to their conditions perfectly. |
| S-5.19 | All beings, whatever their present station—from celestial beings through monks to solitary realizers—are "growing" through contact with the dharma-rain. Growth occurs gradually, at each being's own pace, but the trajectory is universal: toward Buddha-hood. |
| S-5.20 | Though beings hear the dharma and practice it, they may not be consciously aware of the merit and transformation they are accumulating. Enlightenment is not primarily intellectual achievement but a transformation of being itself that exceeds conscious knowing. |
| S-5.21 | The Medicinal Herbs teaching parallels several contemporary philosophical insights: |
| S-5.22 | The Medicinal Herbs teaching parallels several contemporary philosophical insights: |
| S-5.23 | The teaching finds unexpected resonances in contemporary science: |

| S-5.25 | **The Universal Principle of Adaptive Teaching:** |
| S-5.26 | **Major Themes in Scholarly Apparatus:** |
| S-6.1 | --- |
| S-6.2 | With Chapter 5 having established the universal principle by which all beings receive the dharma according to their capacity, **Chapter 6 now enacts this principle at the particular level: individual disciples receive explicit prophecies of their future Buddhahood.** This chapter marks a crucial transformation in the Lotus Sutra's narrative. What was taught theoretically—that all possess Buddha-nature and will eventually attain enlightenment—is now proclaimed individually, directly, and ceremonially. |
| S-6.3 | The Buddha addresses Mahākāśyapa directly, the most senior of his great disciples and the one who represents the epitome of ascetic practice: |
| S-6.4 | The Buddha then elaborates in verse to emphasize and amplify: |
| S-6.5 | The verse then includes a crucial transition: |
| S-6.6 | The disciples then address the Buddha in verse, expressing both their doubt and their longing: |
| S-6.7 | The Buddha then addresses the disciples' unspoken longing by granting prophecies to the other great disciples: |
| S-6.8 | The Buddha elaborates in verse: |
| S-6.9 | The Buddha then addresses Mahākātyāyana: |
| S-6.10 | The verse elaborates: |
| S-6.11 | The Buddha then addresses Maudgalyāyana: |
| S-6.12 | The verse elaborates: |
| S-6.13 | The Buddha then makes a sweeping promise that extends the significance of this chapter far beyond the three disciples named: |
| S-6.14 | The prophecy-giving in Chapter 6 accomplishes something more subtle than mere fortune-telling. A prophecy, in the Buddhist context, is not predestination imposed from outside but recognition of what is already true. The Buddha sees the Buddha-nature already present in Māhakāśyapa, Subodbi, Kātyāyana, and Maudgalyāyana, and proclaims what he sees. |
| S-6.15 | **Major Themes:** |
| S-7.1 | --- |
| S-7.2 | **Chapter 7 stands at the apex of the Lotus Sutra's doctrinal structure.** Where previous chapters have established the principles of skillful means (Chapter 2), demonstrated them through parables (Chapters 3-5), and proclaimed them through prophecies (Chapter 6), **Chapter 7 now reveals the ultimate purpose of skillful means and explains the relationship between what seemed like final goals and what is actually ultimate truth.** |
| S-7.3 | The Buddha begins with an extraordinary temporal introduction: |
| S-7.4 | The narrative then describes an extraordinary event: |
| S-7.5 | The Buddha then describes a crucial turning point: |
| S-7.6 | The narrative continues: |
| S-7.7 | The narrative describes the cosmic impact of the Buddha's enlightenment and teaching: |
| S-7.8 | The Buddha continues describing how celestial beings from all ten directions recognize the light and come to investigate: |
| S-7.9 | The Buddha then describes what dharma Great Penetrating Wisdom Victory taught: |
| S-7.10 | The Buddha then describes the impact of this teaching: |
| S-7.11 | The narrative then takes a crucial turn: |
| S-7.12 | A crucial transition now occurs: |
| S-7.13 | Now comes an extraordinary revelation: |
| S-7.14 | The Buddha then reveals the ultimate purpose of this teaching: |
| S-7.15 | The Buddha now tells the parable that illuminates all that has come before: |
| S-7.16 | The Buddha then elaborates the parable in extended verse, emphasizing its cosmic significance: |
| S-7.17 | **Chapter 7 completes the doctrinal revolution begun in Chapter 2.** If Chapter 2 established that skillful means exist, Chapter 7 now reveals their purpose and justification. The three vehicles are not different paths to different destinations but stages on a single path, with the phantom city representing the provisional achievement of nirvana. |
| S-7.18 | **For understanding the three vehicles**: They are not unequal or inferior paths but provisional destinations. A śrāvaka who practices well achieves real rest and benefit; it's just not the ultimate destination. |
| S-7.19 | The Phantom City teaching resonates with: |
| S-7.20 | **Looking backward:** |
| S-7.21 | The Phantom City parable transforms skillful means from potential deception into supreme compassion. The guide is not dishonest; the guide is wise. The phantom city is not lie; it is genuine rest. The travelers are not deceived; they are gradually led toward greater truth. |
| S-7.22 | **Major Themes in Scholarly Apparatus:** |
| S-8.1 | --- |
| S-8.2 | **Chapter 8 extends the prophecy-giving initiated in Chapter 6 to encompass all five hundred śrāvakas (direct disciples) assembled before the Buddha.** Where Chapter 6 singled out the greatest disciples and Chapter 7 revealed the metaphysical justification for skillful means, **Chapter 8 now demonstrates that the promise of Buddhahood extends universally—not just to exceptional individuals, but to all who have heard and accepted the dharma.** |
| S-8.3 | The chapter opens with Furūṇa (富樓那), traditionally known as the foremost disciple in preaching and explaining the dharma: |
| S-8.4 | The Buddha then reveals the cosmic scope of Furūṇa's practice: |
| S-8.5 | The Buddha then describes Furūṇa's future Buddha-realm: |
| S-8.6 | The narrative then describes a crucial moment: |
| S-8.7 | The Buddha then elaborates in verse: |
| S-8.8 | Now comes one of the Lotus Sutra's most profound and moving parables. The five hundred arhats, having heard their prophecies, express their joy and revelation: |
| S-8.9 | The arhats continue their understanding of the parable's application: |
| S-8.10 | The arhats elaborate their realization in verse: |
| S-8.11 | This parable constitutes one of the Lotus Sutra's most enduring teachings about the nature of Buddhist awakening: |
| S-8.12 | The text then enumerates the five hundred arhats receiving prophecy by name: |
| S-8.13 | The chapter's conclusion extends the prophecies to include future disciples: |
| S-8.14 | **To Chapter 7 (Phantom City)**: The Pearl in the Garment parable complements the Phantom City parable. Where the Phantom City reveals that provisional goals (nirvana) are skillful means to ultimate goals (Buddhahood), the Pearl in the Garment reveals that beings already possess Buddha-nature—they need only recognize it. Together, the parables show that enlightenment is simultaneously (1) a journey requiring many stages and (2) the recognition of what was always present. |
| S-8.15 | **Major Themes in Scholarly Apparatus:** |
| S-9.1 | --- |
| S-9.2 | **Chapter 9 extends the prophecy-giving further, now addressing two crucial figures and a large group: Ānanda (the Buddha's cousin and primary attendant), Rāhula (the Buddha's biological son), and the two thousand learning and unlearning disciples.** |
| S-9.3 | The chapter opens with Ānanda and Rāhula making their own request: |
| S-9.4 | The narrative then describes the larger group: |
| S-9.5 | The Buddha immediately addresses Ānanda: |
| S-9.6 | The text then describes Ānanda's immediate response: |
| S-9.7 | The Buddha then turns to Rāhula: |
| S-9.8 | The Buddha elaborates in verse: |
| S-9.9 | The narrative then addresses the large group: |
| S-9.10 | The verse section recapitulates: |
| S-9.11 | A new complication now arises. The text notes: |
| S-9.12 | The Buddha immediately addresses the Bodhisattvas' unspoken concern: |
| S-9.13 | The prophecies to Ānanda and Rāhula suggest that **role and identity are not temporary assignments but expressions of eternal nature**. Ānanda is eternally the dharma-keeper; Rāhula is eternally the son. What appears as limitation in the present moment—serving rather than leading, following rather than initiating—is recognized as the expression of fundamental aspiration. |
| S-9.14 | The prophecies to Ānanda and Rāhula suggest that **role and identity are not temporary assignments but expressions of eternal nature**. Ānanda is eternally the dharma-keeper; Rāhula is eternally the son. What appears as limitation in the present moment—serving rather than leading, following rather than initiating—is recognized as the expression of fundamental aspiration. |
| S-9.15 | The two thousand disciples' prophecy—all receiving the same Buddha-name despite being two thousand distinct individuals—exemplifies the principle of **Unity-in-Multiplicity**: |
| S-9.16 | The doctrine of original vows suggests that **becoming is not creation but recognition**. What beings will become is not being manufactured in the future but being revealed in the present. The prophecy awakens beings to their eternal nature. |
| S-9.17 | **Major Themes in Scholarly Apparatus:** |
| S-10.1 | --- |
| S-10.2 | **Chapter 10 represents the most radical expansion of the prophecy principle: the Buddha extends the guarantee of Buddhahood to ALL beings who hear even a single verse or sentence of the Lotus Sutra, making prophecy universal and present rather than particular and future.** |
| S-10.3 | The chapter opens with the Buddha addressing the Bodhisattva Medicine King (藥王菩薩): |
| S-10.4 | The Buddha then makes an extraordinary statement about the dignity and worth of those who practice the sutra: |
| S-10.5 | The Buddha now makes a striking assertion: |
| S-10.6 | The text now provides a sharp warning about the consequences of disrespecting practitioners: |
| S-10.7 | The Buddha now presents another extraordinary claim: |
| S-10.8 | The text now provides crucial guidance for anyone intending to teach the sutra: |
| S-10.9 | The Buddha now makes remarkable promises about the support dharma-teachers will receive: |
| S-10.10 | The Buddha now elaborates the prophecy and protection in extensive verse, emphasizing the supreme difficulty and supreme importance of dharma-teaching: |
| S-10.11 | Chapter 10 makes a profound metaphysical claim: **The Buddha does not truly enter extinction.** Instead, the Buddha's presence is: |
| S-10.12 | Chapter 10 completely revalues what counts as important work: |
| S-10.13 | Chapter 10 establishes a new form of Buddhist community: |
| S-10.14 | Chapter 10 asserts extraordinary power for language: |
| S-10.15 | Chapter 10 abolishes the temporal separation between past and future: |
| S-10.16 | Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of Chapter 10 is the assertion that **the Lotus Sutra text itself is the Buddha's body.** |
| S-10.17 | **Major Themes in Scholarly Apparatus:** |
| S-10.18 | **Chapter 10 represents perhaps the most significant transformation in Buddhist understanding across the entire Lotus Sutra.** Where earlier chapters established the doctrine of universal Buddha-nature, Chapter 10 transforms this from a metaphysical principle into a **present, practical reality accessible through hearing the dharma.** |
| S-11.1 | **THE COSMIC MANIFESTATION OF WITNESS** |
| S-11.2 | **THE COSMIC MANIFESTATION OF WITNESS** |
| S-11.3 | At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to express this teaching again, spoke in verse: |
| S-11.4 | Chapter 11 establishes one of the Lotus Sutra's most radical metaphysical claims: **the text itself contains living presence.** This is not metaphorical. The stupa emerges because the Dharma is being taught. The ancient Buddha's body, though he entered *parinirvāṇa* countless eons ago, still appears wherever the teaching occurs.³⁷ |
| S-11.5 | Chapter 11 establishes one of the Lotus Sutra's most radical metaphysical claims: **the text itself contains living presence.** This is not metaphorical. The stupa emerges because the Dharma is being taught. The ancient Buddha's body, though he entered *parinirvāṇa* countless eons ago, still appears wherever the teaching occurs.³⁷ |
| S-11.6 | The chapter employs extreme mathematical language to establish the scale of this cosmic gathering: |
| S-11.7 | When Shakyamuni calls forth his transformation-bodies from the ten directions, the text describes them coming "in sequence" but then shows them all present simultaneously in arranged configurations. This paradox encodes a crucial doctrine: |
| S-11.8 | The text describes three waves of cosmic transformation: |
| S-11.9 | The stupa's voice declaring "Excellent! Excellent, Śākyamuni Buddha!" is the simplest possible utterance: a double exclamation confirming the truth of what is being taught. This minimal speech demonstrates a key semiotic principle: |
| S-11.10 | When the assembly wishes to see Prabhūtaratna's body, the Buddha explains that all his transformation-bodies must first gather. This requirement encodes a profound epistemic point: |
| S-11.11 | The verse section's repeated structure—"This would not be hard"—employed for increasingly impossible cosmic feats, only to declare that teaching after the Buddha's extinction is **truly hard**—reverses conventional value hierarchies: |
| S-11.12 | **Whitehead's Process Philosophy**: The stupa's emergence exemplifies Whitehead's concept of "God's persuasive presence." Rather than coercive omnipotence, the ancient Buddha influences the present cosmos through the creative lure of the Dharma. The stupa appears not through forced manifestation but through the cosmic system's responsive sensitivity to the Dharma being taught.⁵² |
| S-11.13 | **Central Doctrine**: The Lotus Sutra transforms the problem of the Buddha's extinction into the occasion for his most universal presence. Rather than fading after the founder's death, the teaching becomes *more* powerful because it becomes independent of any single embodiment. |
| S-11.14 | [^1]: The stupa's emergence "from the earth" (*cong di yong chu*) establishes that sacred presence rises from the ground of being itself. The "five hundred yojanas" height reflects Buddhist cosmography's use of extreme numbers to indicate transcendence of measurable magnitude. The precious materials—gold, silver, crystal, jade, pearl—represent the seven treasures (*saptaratna*) believed in Buddhist cosmology to be the bases of value in the universe. |

| S-11.16 | **Chapter Themes and Concepts**: |
| S-12.1 | **THE REDEMPTION OF THE ANTAGONIST; THE INSTANTANEOUS ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE EXCLUDED** |
| S-12.2 | **THE REDEMPTION OF THE ANTAGONIST; THE INSTANTANEOUS ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE EXCLUDED** |
| S-12.3 | At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to express this meaning again, spoke in verse: |
| S-12.4 | Chapter 12's treatment of Devadatta overturns conventional morality through radical theological inclusion. Rather than condemning the antagonist, the Buddha declares him to be the **essential condition** for his own enlightenment.⁴⁰ |
| S-12.5 | Chapter 12's treatment of Devadatta overturns conventional morality through radical theological inclusion. Rather than condemning the antagonist, the Buddha declares him to be the **essential condition** for his own enlightenment.⁴⁰ |
| S-12.6 | Śāriputra's challenge against the Nāga princess enumerates "five obstacles" (*pañca-avaraṇa*) traditionally believed to prevent women from Buddhahood. The text subtly revises these in the princess's immediate achievement: |
| S-12.7 | The Nāga princess achieves in "a single moment" (*eka-kṣaṇa*) what Śāriputra—and by extension, all human practitioners—claims requires "countless eons" of preparation. |
| S-12.8 | The princess's offer of a precious jewel "worth the entire three-thousand-fold world-system" is immediately accepted by the Buddha. Then she asks: "Tell me—was this swift?" Upon hearing it was, she declares her enlightenment will be even swifter. |
| S-12.9 | The princess's instant transformation from female to male has occasioned much debate. Modern interpretations suggest several readings: |
| S-12.10 | The princess enlightens simultaneously as Buddha and as teacher of her realm: |
| S-12.11 | When the princess achieves enlightenment, "the earth itself shook and trembled six times." Earthquakes throughout Buddhist cosmology signal the intervention of cosmic forces in response to profound dharmic events.⁵⁸ |
| S-12.12 | The text concludes with profound simplicity: |
| S-12.13 | **Central Doctrines**: |
| S-12.14 | [^1]: The Buddha's past-life story as a king seeking Dharma establishes the principle of **progressive renunciation**. A monarch gives up wealth, then power, then family, then body. This pattern models enlightenment as increasingly absolute non-attachment, not merely intellectual relinquishment but embodied surrender of all claims to possession. |

| S-12.16 | **Chapter Themes and Concepts**: |
| S-13.1 | **THE BODHISATTVAS' VOWS: ACCEPTING THE TRANSMISSION** |
| S-13.2 | **THE BODHISATTVAS' VOWS: ACCEPTING THE TRANSMISSION** |
| S-13.3 | Chapter 13 establishes that **accepting the Dharma's transmission is accepting a burden** (*bhāra*). The Bodhisattvas pledge not easy comfort but difficult work in "dark and dangerous ages." This inverts conventional spirituality's promise of peace toward an understanding of enlightenment as **engaged participation in the world's suffering transformation**.¹⁵ |
| S-13.4 | Chapter 13 establishes that **accepting the Dharma's transmission is accepting a burden** (*bhāra*). The Bodhisattvas pledge not easy comfort but difficult work in "dark and dangerous ages." This inverts conventional spirituality's promise of peace toward an understanding of enlightenment as **engaged participation in the world's suffering transformation**.¹⁵ |
| S-13.5 | The text's description of the "evil age" presents a sociological portrait: |
| S-13.6 | Chapters 12-13 together create a remarkable progression of inclusivity: |
| S-13.7 | The Bodhisattvas generate two thoughts: |
| S-13.8 | The Bodhisattvas "roar forth their lion-vow" (*simha-nāda*). The lion's roar in Buddhist literature represents fearless proclamation—the sound that silences all other animals.²¹ |
| S-13.9 | The verse declares: "We shall wear the armor of patient endurance" (*kṣānti-kavacha*). Patience (*kṣānti*) is transformed from personal virtue to communal protection. By embodying patient endurance, the teachers protect all beings from despair. Their refusal to retaliate or withdraw demonstrates that dharmic response transcends violence-cycles.²³ |
| S-13.10 | Three groups respond to the Buddha's teaching with vows: |
| S-13.11 | The prophecies granted in Chapter 13 serve as **cosmic validation** that the vows are recognized and supported by universal forces. The prophecies don't cause the vows but confirm them. This distinction is crucial: the vow-makers' commitment is **recognized as aligned with cosmic dharmic truth**, not granted as external favor.²⁶ |
| S-13.12 | **Central Doctrines**: |
| S-13.13 | [^1]: The pledge includes the phrase "in written form" (*shu* 書), establishing that dharma-transmission requires material preservation. The text is not merely oral teaching but written scripture that can survive the teacher's extinction. This principle explains the Lotus Sutra's own obsession with preserving itself—the text is self-aware that it is the mechanism of its own transmission. |

| S-13.15 | **Chapter Themes and Concepts**: |
| S-14.1 | **THE FOUR CONDITIONS FOR SAFE DHARMA-TEACHING** |
| S-14.2 | **THE FOUR CONDITIONS FOR SAFE DHARMA-TEACHING** |
| S-14.3 | At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to elaborate further upon this teaching, spoke in verse: |
| S-14.4 | Chapter 14 establishes that **dharma-teaching requires protective conditions**. The four practices are not moral precepts but *prophylactic measures*: they protect the teacher from defilement and prevent the teaching from becoming corrupted by worldly entanglement.³¹ |
| S-14.5 | Chapter 14 establishes that **dharma-teaching requires protective conditions**. The four practices are not moral precepts but *prophylactic measures*: they protect the teacher from defilement and prevent the teaching from becoming corrupted by worldly entanglement.³¹ |
| S-14.6 | The second practice establishes **emptiness (*śūnyatā*) as the ground** from which all other practices arise. By perceiving all dharmas as "empty of intrinsic nature," the teacher transcends conceptual elaboration and theoretical attachment. This doesn't mean nihilism but rather **the freedom to respond spontaneously to conditions without predetermined patterns**.³³ |
| S-14.7 | The third practice establishes **equanimous speech** (*samabhāvanā*): not praising or blaming, not selecting favored disciples over others. This creates conditions where teaching becomes transparent transmission rather than personal relationship. The teacher's biases and preferences don't distort the Dharma's unfolding.³⁵ |
| S-14.8 | The fourth practice reverses the logical sequence: rather than the teacher earning respect through perfect practice, the teacher **presumes inherent Buddha-nature in all beings** and commits to their eventual liberation regardless of present receptivity.³⁷ |
| S-14.9 | The parable of the king and the crown-jewel functions as the chapter's—and this entire assembly's—culminating statement.³⁹ The parable asserts that the **Lotus Sutra itself is the crown-jewel** that the Buddha grants only to those Bodhisattvas willing to teach it in the darkest ages. |
| S-14.10 | Chapter 14 presents a remarkable revision of Buddhist monasticism. Rather than advocating withdrawal from the world, it prescribes **engaged presence in the world with internal detachment**. The teacher: |
| S-14.11 | The parable concludes by applying the image to the Bodhisattvas themselves: **"Know these Bodhisattvas to be the Buddha's treasures most precious, know them to be the Buddha's children, the most honored among all beings whatsoever."** |
| S-14.12 | By declaring that teaching the Sutra "cannot be numbered or compared" in merit, the text suggests that **no conventional measure can evaluate dharma-teaching's significance**. Merit traditionally measured through ritual precision, ascetic austerity, or metaphysical attainment is transcended by the simple act of authentic teaching. |
| S-14.13 | **Central Doctrines**: |
| S-14.14 | ¹: Mañjuśrī's question—"How shall they teach without timidity?"—directly addresses the fear and danger outlined in Chapter 13's verses. Chapter 14 responds with practical methods for maintaining confidence and safety while teaching in hostile conditions. The answer is not abstract principles but concrete practices for daily life. |
| S-14.15 | **Chapters 9-14 Translation Status**: ✅ COMPLETE |
| S-15.1 | **THE COSMIC DISCLOSURE: INFINITE DISCIPLES APPEAR** |
| S-15.2 | **THE COSMIC DISCLOSURE: INFINITE DISCIPLES APPEAR** |
| S-15.3 | *The verse has been integrated throughout the translation above.* |
| S-15.4 | The chapter's core teaching is **the revelation of what was always present beneath perception**. These infinite Bodhisattvas were not created by the Buddha's words; they were dwelling beneath the Sahā world all along. The Buddha's words don't create them but reveal them.²⁶ |
| S-15.5 | The chapter's core teaching is **the revelation of what was always present beneath perception**. These infinite Bodhisattvas were not created by the Buddha's words; they were dwelling beneath the Sahā world all along. The Buddha's words don't create them but reveal them.²⁶ |
| S-15.6 | The splitting of the earth and emergence of Bodhisattvas from **beneath** this world introduces a crucial **cosmological principle**: the underworld is not hell but **the space of practice and cultivation**. |
| S-15.7 | The four leaders—Viśiṣṭa (Superior Conduct), Anantaviśiṣṭa (Boundless), Śuddhaviśiṣṭa (Pure), Sthiraviśiṣṭa (Stable)—represent **the ascending ladder of practice**: |
| S-15.8 | The repeated emphasis on incalculable numbers—six hundred thousand Ganges' worth of followers, then smaller groups down to single disciples, all described as "beyond counting"—encodes the principle of **infinite multiplicity within unity**. |
| S-15.9 | The assembly remains in silence for fifty minor eons, with the Buddha also sitting motionless. Yet through his supernatural power, only half a day seems to pass to those present. |
| S-15.10 | When the Buddha says "These are all Bodhisattvas whom I have educated and transformed after I attained enlightenment in this Sahā world," the statement is ambiguous—intentionally so.³³ |
| S-15.11 | **Central Mystery**: Where did these infinite Bodhisattvas come from, and how long has the Buddha been teaching? |
| S-15.12 | [^1]: The Bodhisattvas from other lands offer to help preserve the teaching, showing their respect and concern. Yet the Buddha declines, already knowing that the Sahā world possesses sufficient internal resources for transmission. |

| S-16.1 | **THE TRIPLE REQUEST: PREPARING FOR REVELATION** |
| S-16.2 | **THE TRIPLE REQUEST: PREPARING FOR REVELATION** |
| S-16.3 | Chapter 16's central teaching **completely transforms understanding of the Buddha's nature from historical figure to eternal presence.**³² |
| S-16.4 | Chapter 16's central teaching **completely transforms understanding of the Buddha's nature from historical figure to eternal presence.**³² |
| S-16.5 | The use of incomprehensibly large numbers—five hundred thousand million billion *asamkhyeya* worlds, each world converted to dust, each dust-grain representing an eon—is **not meant to be calculated but to break the mind's capacity for calculation.**³⁴ |
| S-16.6 | The parable of the physician whose sons take poison is **Buddhism's most sophisticated response to the problem of theodicy** (why suffering exists).³⁵ |
| S-16.7 | The teaching that sinful beings cannot perceive the Buddha's eternal presence—though dwelling right beside them—introduces a crucial principle: **reality is not objective but perception-dependent.**³⁷ |
| S-16.8 | The Buddha's assertion that "all teachings are true, none false" is remarkable: **even teachings about his extinction are true at the level of apparent truth** (*samvṛti-satya*), while being false at the level of absolute truth (*paramārtha-satya*).³⁸ |
| S-16.9 | If the Buddha has been enlightened for infinite eons and remains eternally present beneath all worlds, then the Buddha is not merely a teacher but **the ground of being itself** (*dharmakāya*, the Dharma-body). |
| S-16.10 | Chapter 16 reveals that **skillful means (*upaya*) is not merely a teaching method but constitutes the very nature of reality.** |
| S-16.11 | **Central Revelation**: **The Buddha is not historically limited but eternally present, having been enlightened for infinite eons and dwelling eternally beneath this and all worlds.** |
| S-16.12 | [^1]: The triple request ("you must have faith") emphasizes the gravity of what is about to be revealed. Multiple requests establish a rhythm of preparation, making clear that extraordinary attention is required. |
| S-16.13 | **PHASE 3 MILESTONE: CHAPTERS 15-16 COMPLETE** |
| S-16.14 | **Chapter Themes and Concepts**: |
| S-17.1 | At that time, the great assembly gathered around the Buddha heard his revelation of the Tathāgata's eternal lifespan—that immeasurable, incalculable eons have passed since he first attained enlightenment. Countless bodhisattvas, beginning with Maitreya, experienced tremendous benefit from this teaching. Incalculable aeons of beings obtained the spiritual threshold of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi; thousands of times that number of great bodhisattvas gained the dharma-gate of dhāraṇī-hearing; entire assemblies whose numbers equal the dust-particles of a world-realm achieved unrestricted eloquence in explaining dharma; other assemblies numbering like the dust-grains of three thousand great thousand-worlds obtained hundreds of millions upon millions of wheel-turning mantric formulas; three thousand world-realms' worth of great bodhisattvas turned the irreversible dharma-wheel; twice that number developed the dharma-wheel of purity; the bodhisattva-assembly of a thousand worlds would attain supreme enlightenment in eight succeeding lifetimes; four-world-realm assemblies in four lifetimes; three-world-realm assemblies in three; two-world-realm assemblies in two; one-world-realm assemblies in one remaining lifetime; eight complete world-realms' worth of beings awakened the incomparable resolve for supreme enlightenment¹. |
| S-17.2 | At that time, the great assembly gathered around the Buddha heard his revelation of the Tathāgata's eternal lifespan—that immeasurable, incalculable eons have passed since he first attained enlightenment. Countless bodhisattvas, beginning with Maitreya, experienced tremendous benefit from this teaching. Incalculable aeons of beings obtained the spiritual threshold of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi; thousands of times that number of great bodhisattvas gained the dharma-gate of dhāraṇī-hearing; entire assemblies whose numbers equal the dust-particles of a world-realm achieved unrestricted eloquence in explaining dharma; other assemblies numbering like the dust-grains of three thousand great thousand-worlds obtained hundreds of millions upon millions of wheel-turning mantric formulas; three thousand world-realms' worth of great bodhisattvas turned the irreversible dharma-wheel; twice that number developed the dharma-wheel of purity; the bodhisattva-assembly of a thousand worlds would attain supreme enlightenment in eight succeeding lifetimes; four-world-realm assemblies in four lifetimes; three-world-realm assemblies in three; two-world-realm assemblies in two; one-world-realm assemblies in one remaining lifetime; eight complete world-realms' worth of beings awakened the incomparable resolve for supreme enlightenment¹. |
| S-17.3 | *At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:* |
| S-17.4 | Chapter 17 represents a turning point in the Lotus Sutra's teaching: the transition from metaphysical revelation (the Buddha's eternal presence) to ethical consequence (the actual benefits of maintaining the dharma). The chapter operates on a principle of recursive amplification—each act of dharma transmission multiplies the merit of the previous transmission, until the fiftieth person's mere rejoicing surpasses eighty million billion eons of concentrated practice by another being. |
| S-17.5 | **Context**: Chapter 17 immediately follows the Buddha's revelation of his eternal lifespan. The assembly has just absorbed the teaching that historical existence is pedagogical, not literal—that the Buddha has been eternally present. Now the sutra addresses the consequences: what benefit accrues to beings who recognize and transmit this truth? |
| S-18.1 | At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva approached the Buddha with reverent demeanor and inquired: "World-Honored One, when beings hear this Lotus Sutra and develop a mind of sincere rejoicing, what measure of merit do they acquire?" |
| S-18.2 | At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva approached the Buddha with reverent demeanor and inquired: "World-Honored One, when beings hear this Lotus Sutra and develop a mind of sincere rejoicing, what measure of merit do they acquire?" |
| S-18.3 | *At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:* |
| S-18.4 | Chapter 18 operates as a mirror and extension of Chapter 17, exploring the consequences of dharma-transmission from a different angle. Where Chapter 17 emphasized the astonishing merit accruing from a single moment of authentic recognition (hearing one verse and rejoicing), Chapter 18 emphasizes the exponential multiplication of merit through sequential transmission. |
| S-18.5 | **Context**: Chapter 18 continues the systematic exposition of benefits begun in Chapter 17. Where Chapter 17 contrasted dharma-recognition with conventional virtue, Chapter 18 explores dharma-transmission through sequential retelling. |
| S-19.1 | At that time, the Buddha addressed Avalokiteśvara the Bodhisattva of Constant Exertion: "When a virtuous man or woman maintains this Lotus Sutra—whether by reading it, reciting it, explaining it, or writing it—that person shall acquire eight hundred eye-perfections, one thousand two hundred ear-perfections, eight hundred nose-perfections, one thousand two hundred tongue-perfections, eight hundred body-perfections, and one thousand two hundred mind-perfections¹. Through these perfections, the six sense-organs shall become completely purified. |
| S-19.2 | At that time, the Buddha addressed Avalokiteśvara the Bodhisattva of Constant Exertion: "When a virtuous man or woman maintains this Lotus Sutra—whether by reading it, reciting it, explaining it, or writing it—that person shall acquire eight hundred eye-perfections, one thousand two hundred ear-perfections, eight hundred nose-perfections, one thousand two hundred tongue-perfections, eight hundred body-perfections, and one thousand two hundred mind-perfections¹. Through these perfections, the six sense-organs shall become completely purified. |
| S-19.3 | *At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:* |
| S-19.4 | Chapter 19 represents a theological milestone in the Lotus Sutra's argument: the elevation of dharma-teachers to Buddha-equivalence. Where earlier chapters established that all beings possess Buddha-nature and can attain enlightenment, Chapter 19 specifies what happens to those who devote themselves to maintaining and teaching this supreme sutra. |
| S-19.5 | **Context**: Chapters 17-19 form a unified exposition of the benefits of the Lotus Sutra, moving from abstract merit-calculations (Chapter 17) through transmission-dynamics (Chapter 18) to the actual transformation of the dharma-teacher (Chapter 19). |
| S-20.1 | At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta: "You should understand that among those who maintain the Lotus Sutra, should any individual curse, revile, or disparage such a keeper of the sutra, the karmic consequences shall be severe, as described previously. But understand equally: those who maintain this Lotus Sutra thereby acquire the perfected senses mentioned—eye-purity, ear-purity, nose-purity, tongue-purity, body-purity, and mind-purity¹. |
| S-20.2 | At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta: "You should understand that among those who maintain the Lotus Sutra, should any individual curse, revile, or disparage such a keeper of the sutra, the karmic consequences shall be severe, as described previously. But understand equally: those who maintain this Lotus Sutra thereby acquire the perfected senses mentioned—eye-purity, ear-purity, nose-purity, tongue-purity, body-purity, and mind-purity¹. |
| S-20.3 | *At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:* |
| S-20.4 | Chapter 20 represents the practical embodiment of all preceding teachings. The Never-Despiser story answers a question implicit throughout the sutra: "What does dharma-realization look like in concrete practice?" The answer is stunning in its simplicity and universality. |
| S-20.5 | **Context**: Chapter 20 follows the abstract enumeration of benefits (Chapters 17-19) with a concrete narrative exemplifying these benefits. It answers the question: "What dharma-practice actually looks like in the world." |
| S-21.1 | At that time, myriads of bodhisattvas—numbering like the dust-particles of entire world-realms—emerged from beneath the earth. These were bodhisattvas who had previously dwelt in the Sahā world. They approached the Buddha, bowed with their heads to his feet, and addressed him: "World-Honored One, after you enter final nirvāṇa, in the lands where your various emanations have taught and subsequently passed away, we shall extensively proclaim this Lotus Sutra. Why? Because we ourselves desire to obtain this true, pure, supreme dharma. We shall receive it, maintain it, read and recite it, explain it, and offer reverent worship to it¹." |
| S-21.2 | At that time, myriads of bodhisattvas—numbering like the dust-particles of entire world-realms—emerged from beneath the earth. These were bodhisattvas who had previously dwelt in the Sahā world. They approached the Buddha, bowed with their heads to his feet, and addressed him: "World-Honored One, after you enter final nirvāṇa, in the lands where your various emanations have taught and subsequently passed away, we shall extensively proclaim this Lotus Sutra. Why? Because we ourselves desire to obtain this true, pure, supreme dharma. We shall receive it, maintain it, read and recite it, explain it, and offer reverent worship to it¹." |
| S-21.3 | *At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:* |
| S-21.4 | Chapter 21 functions as a cosmic exclamation point, a demonstration that validates everything taught in the preceding chapters. The supernatural display—the extended tongue reaching Brahma realms, the light-rays illuminating all directions, the earth's six-fold trembling, the voice proclaiming across cosmos—are not mere theatrical effects. They constitute a metaphysical claim: that the dharma of the Lotus Sutra is verified by the entire Buddha-universe. |
| S-21.5 | **Context**: Chapter 21 comes after the narrative exemplification of Never-Despiser and before the final assignment of the sutra's continuation. It functions as a cosmic demonstration validating all previous teachings. |
| S-22.1 | At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha rose from his dharma-seat, revealed great supernatural powers, and with his right hand touched the heads of innumerable bodhisattvas, speaking these words: "Through countless, incalculable eons, I have cultivated and perfected the supreme dharma of unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment. Now I entrust this dharma to all of you. You should all unite in mind and widely proclaim this dharma, causing it to increase and flourish¹." |
| S-22.2 | At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha rose from his dharma-seat, revealed great supernatural powers, and with his right hand touched the heads of innumerable bodhisattvas, speaking these words: "Through countless, incalculable eons, I have cultivated and perfected the supreme dharma of unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment. Now I entrust this dharma to all of you. You should all unite in mind and widely proclaim this dharma, causing it to increase and flourish¹." |
| S-22.3 | *At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:* |
| S-22.4 | Chapter 22 completes the Lotus Sutra's structure with an act of formal transmission. The Buddha, about to enter final nirvāṇa, entrusts the sutra-dharma to the assembled bodhisattvas and beings. This creates a legal and spiritual bond: the assembly vows to continue transmission; the Buddha authorizes this continuation. |
| S-22.5 | **Context**: Chapter 22 concludes the Lotus Sutra's main teaching. It formalizes through ceremonial assignment what has been taught throughout the preceding chapters. |
| S-22.6 | **Chapters 17-22 Completed**: |
| S-23.1 | At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Prabhūtaratna: "Inquire of me regarding the Medicine King Bodhisattva's original practice. How did this bodhisattva cultivate? What dharma does he teach? Pray tell us the history of this one we honor¹." |
| S-23.2 | At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Prabhūtaratna: "Inquire of me regarding the Medicine King Bodhisattva's original practice. How did this bodhisattva cultivate? What dharma does he teach? Pray tell us the history of this one we honor¹." |
| S-23.3 | *At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:* |
| S-23.4 | Chapter 23 presents enlightenment-practice through its most extreme form: bodily self-immolation as dharma-offering. This raises profound questions about the nature of sacrifice, suffering, and the transformation of physical body into sacred presence. |
| S-23.5 | **Context**: Chapter 23 marks the transition from cosmic verification (Chapter 21) and eternal assignment (Chapter 22) to practical exemplification. It provides the first detailed narrative of a bodhisattva whose practice embodies the sutra's teachings. |
| S-24.1 | At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha emitted the light-marks of universal brilliance from between his eyebrows, illuminating to the east one hundred eight hundred million nayuta realms. Beyond that number of worlds, there existed a realm named Pure-Light-Adorned. In that realm dwelt a Buddha named Pure-Lotus-Celestial-Wisdom-Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, the One Perfectly Accomplished in Knowledge and Conduct, the Sugata, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassable Guide, the Tamer of the Untamed, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. He was surrounded and honored by innumerable and incalculable assemblies of great bodhisattvas as he expounded the dharma¹. |
| S-24.2 | At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha emitted the light-marks of universal brilliance from between his eyebrows, illuminating to the east one hundred eight hundred million nayuta realms. Beyond that number of worlds, there existed a realm named Pure-Light-Adorned. In that realm dwelt a Buddha named Pure-Lotus-Celestial-Wisdom-Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, the One Perfectly Accomplished in Knowledge and Conduct, the Sugata, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassable Guide, the Tamer of the Untamed, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. He was surrounded and honored by innumerable and incalculable assemblies of great bodhisattvas as he expounded the dharma¹. |
| S-24.3 | *At that time, the Buddha wished to restate this meaning through verse:* |
| S-24.4 | Chapter 24 demonstrates a revolutionary principle: that bodhisattvas can exist in multiple Buddha-realms simultaneously and maintain autonomous agency even while being expressions of another being's miraculous power. The paradox is emphasized repeatedly: Wonderful-Sound "did not rise from his seat, his body remained unmoved, yet through the power of samādhi" he manifested elsewhere. |
| S-24.5 | **Context**: Chapter 24 continues the exemplar-narrative sequence begun in Chapter 23. While Chapter 23 focused on extreme bodily offering, Chapter 24 emphasizes unlimited manifestation-capacity. |
| S-25.1 | At that time, the Bodhisattva Boundless-Intention rose from his seat, bowed respectfully with his head to the Buddha's feet, and posed this inquiry: "World-Honored One, I wish to ask: For what reason is the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara called by this name¹?" |
| S-25.2 | At that time, the Bodhisattva Boundless-Intention rose from his seat, bowed respectfully with his head to the Buddha's feet, and posed this inquiry: "World-Honored One, I wish to ask: For what reason is the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara called by this name¹?" |
| S-25.3 | Then Buddha continued: "Boundless-Intention, if sentient beings require the form of a Buddha to be taught and liberated, Avalokiteśvara will manifest as a Buddha and teach them the dharma. If they require the form of a solitary-buddha to achieve liberation, the bodhisattva will manifest as a solitary-buddha. If they require a śrāvaka-form, the bodhisattva manifests accordingly—the bodhisattva can manifest as a Brahma-king, as Śakra, as a self-mastering deity, as a great self-mastering deity, as a celestial general, as King Vaiśravaṇa, as a Cakravartin-king, as a smaller king⁸. |
| S-25.4 | *At that time, Boundless-Intention wished to restate these teachings in verse:* |
| S-25.5 | Chapter 25 represents the Lotus Sutra's most accessible teaching. Where earlier chapters emphasized abstract doctrines (Buddha-nature universality, eternal transmission, cosmic verification), Chapter 25 offers immediate, practical compassion available through simple invocation. |
| S-25.6 | **Context**: Chapter 25 continues the exemplar-sequence but shifts focus from bodhisattvas as distant practitioners (Chapters 23-24) to the bodhisattva as immediately accessible respondent to all suffering. |
| S-26.1 | At that time, the Bodhisattva Medicine King rose from his seat, bowed respectfully, and addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, if virtuous men and women receive and maintain this Dharma-Blossom Sutra, whether they read it, recite it, understand it, or write it out, how much merit would they obtain?" |
| S-26.2 | At that time, the Bodhisattva Medicine King rose from his seat, bowed respectfully, and addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, if virtuous men and women receive and maintain this Dharma-Blossom Sutra, whether they read it, recite it, understand it, or write it out, how much merit would they obtain?" |
| S-26.3 | *At that time, the Buddha wished to restate this meaning through verse:* |
| S-26.4 | Chapter 26 represents the sutra's integration of protective practice with doctrinal teaching. The mantras themselves—rendered in transliterated form that resists literal translation—possess power not through semantic meaning but through sonic resonance. This suggests a Buddhist understanding that language operates on multiple levels: semantic (conveying meaning), magical (activating power), and spiritual (creating consciousness-states). |
| S-26.5 | **Context**: Chapter 26 addresses a practical concern: How does the sutra ensure the dharma-teacher's safety in a world hostile to spirituality? The answer involves celestial protection through mantric formulas. |
| S-27.1 | At that time, the Buddha addressed the assembled great audience: "In ages long past—spanning incalculable eons beyond measurement—there existed a Buddha named Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Celestial-Wisdom, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, the One Perfectly Accomplished in Knowledge and Conduct, the Sugata, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassable Guide, the Tamer of the Untamed, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. His realm was named Radiance-Flourishing, and the age was called Joyful-Perception¹. |
| S-27.2 | At that time, the Buddha addressed the assembled great audience: "In ages long past—spanning incalculable eons beyond measurement—there existed a Buddha named Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Celestial-Wisdom, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, the One Perfectly Accomplished in Knowledge and Conduct, the Sugata, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassable Guide, the Tamer of the Untamed, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. His realm was named Radiance-Flourishing, and the age was called Joyful-Perception¹. |
| S-27.3 | "The Buddha then addressed the assembly: 'Do you comprehend this account? The Wonderful-Adornment King of that ancient time was none other than the Bodhisattva Dharma-Excellence (華德菩薩) who sits before you now. That Pure-Virtue Queen was the Bodhisattva Light-Illumination-Excellence-Adornment, who was reborn in that realm through compassion for the Wonderful-Adornment King and his retinue. Those two sons, Pure-Treasury and Pure-Vision, are the bodhisattvas Medicine King and Medicine-Excellence (藥上菩薩). These two great bodhisattvas, through their accumulated spiritual practice and extraordinary virtues, have perfected such profound capacities. They have already made offerings to innumerable Buddhas, cultivated roots of virtue in countless realms, and accomplished inconceivable virtuous deeds. If any being simply knows these two bodhisattvas' names, the entire celestial and human assembly should offer them reverence¹⁶.' |
| S-27.4 | Chapter 27 exemplifies the principle that bodhisattva-transformation operates through compassionate adaptation to each being's condition. The two sons do not preach directly to their father; instead, they perceive his psychological nature and respond with precisely the method most effective for him: miraculous demonstration. |
| S-27.5 | **Context**: Chapter 27 returns to narrative exemplification after the protective formulas of Chapter 26. It demonstrates how bodhisattvas teach those trapped in false doctrines. |
| S-28.1 | At that time, the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra (the Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva) approached the Buddha with his innumerable, boundless, incalculable bodhisattva-retinue from the east, manifesting his transcendent power and magnificence, renowned throughout the ten directions. Wherever he passed, the ground trembled with six kinds of motion, precious lotus flowers rained down, and hundreds of millions of kinds of celestial music played spontaneously. |
| S-28.2 | At that time, the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra (the Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva) approached the Buddha with his innumerable, boundless, incalculable bodhisattva-retinue from the east, manifesting his transcendent power and magnificence, renowned throughout the ten directions. Wherever he passed, the ground trembled with six kinds of motion, precious lotus flowers rained down, and hundreds of millions of kinds of celestial music played spontaneously. |
| S-28.3 | "Samantabhadra, in the degenerate age five hundred years after the Tathāgata's passage, among those who maintain this sutra, I shall guard and protect them, relieving them of all afflictions. I will ensure that no spirits, demons, demon-children, demon-women, demon-followers, demon-possessed individuals, yakṣas, rākṣasas, kumbhāṇḍas, piśācas, yakṣa-spirits, rich-demons, vetālas, and other harmful beings find any opportunity to molest them. Whether the person walks, stands, reads, recites, or contemplates this sutra, I shall ride my six-tusked white elephant, together with my great bodhisattva-assembly, travel to their location, appear before them, and supply them with all forms of comfort and safety, additionally supporting their dharma-practice³. |
| S-28.4 | The Buddha then addressed Samantabhadra: "Excellent! Excellent! You possess such incomparable miraculous power and compassionate vow that all practitioners of this sutra will attain liberation. Your virtue is profound, your compassion vast, and your original intention of enlightenment is deep and ancient. You accomplish these protective vows for the benefit of countless beings⁸." |
| S-28.5 | "Samantabhadra, if one encounters someone lightly reviling a practitioner, commenting on their faults (whether true or false), this person shall in the present lifetime develop pale-white leprosy. If one encounters such a practitioner and fails to honor them, or criticizes them, or shows contempt, one shall experience these consequences: eyelessness, blindness, deafness, severe stammering, cleft lip, a malformed face, a shortened form, offensive odor, tumorous growths, putrid sores, water-swollen belly, shortness of breath, and numerous serious illnesses¹⁶. |
| S-28.6 | *At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:* |
| S-28.7 | Chapter 28, the sutra's conclusion, represents a final recapitulation of all key themes while projecting the teaching into the future. Samantabhadra (Universally-Worthy), the bodhisattva of perfect practice, arrives not to introduce new doctrine but to ensure the sutra's preservation and the practitioners' protection. |
| S-28.8 | **Context**: Chapter 28 concludes the entire Lotus Sutra, providing final protection-vows, karmic consequences for disrespect, and ultimate encouragement to practitioners across all future ages. |
| S-28.9 | **Chapters 23-28 Complete**: |
