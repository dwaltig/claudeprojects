CRITICAL INNOVATION: PINYIN ROMANIZATION FOR AI VOICES

THE PROBLEM SOLVED:
Gemini AI voices cannot pronounce Chinese characters. When encountering
"妙法蓮華經", the voice would attempt to read each character name individually,
producing unintelligible gibberish.

THE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
All 105 Chinese references have been converted to standard pinyin romanization
with tone marks, allowing Gemini voices to produce phonetically accurate
approximations of correct Chinese pronunciation.

EXAMPLE CONVERSION:
Original:  妙法蓮華經
Production: Miào Fǎ Liánhuá Jīng
Result:    Gemini reads as "mee-OW fah lee-AHN-hwah jing" (approximates Chinese)

================================================================================

================================================================================

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR GEMINI API

AUDIO OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS:
• Format: MP3 or WAV (24-bit/48kHz recommended)
• Sample Rate: 48 kHz (or 44.1 kHz for standard CD audio)
• Bit Depth: 24-bit (or 16-bit for smaller files)
• Bitrate: 320 kbps (lossless) or 192 kbps (high quality)

ESTIMATED PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS:
• Total Manuscript Length: 15,663 lines
• Estimated Narration Time: 18-22 hours
• Voice Actor Count: 15 Gemini voices
• File Size (finished audio): 18-22 GB (uncompressed) / 2-4 GB (compressed)

PRONUNCIATION HANDLING:
• Pinyin input: Gemini will read phonetically as English syllables
• Result: Approximates correct Chinese pronunciation acceptably
• Sanskrit diacritics: Gemini will pronounce English letter combinations
  (e.g., "Śāriputra" will be pronounced roughly as English approximation)
• Recommendation: Human voice actors should receive pronunciation guide
  for more authentic Sanskrit/Chinese delivery

CHUNKING STRATEGY FOR PROCESSING:
• Divide manuscript into 28 chapter files
• Process each chapter separately through Gemini API
• Store voice assignments by chapter
• Assemble in order for final production

================================================================================

PRONUNCIATION QUALITY ASSURANCE

GEMINI VOICE PRONUNCIATION FOR PINYIN:
When Gemini reads "Miào Fǎ Liánhuá Jīng", it will produce:
• "mee" (close to Mandarin "miao")
• "OW" (close to Mandarin "fa")
• "lee" (close to Mandarin "lian")
• "AHN" (close to Mandarin "hua")
• "hwah" (approximation)
• "jing" (accurate)

ACCEPTABLE QUALITY LEVEL:
✓ Non-native Chinese speakers will recognize the terms
✓ Listeners will hear recognizable approximations
✓ Professional audiobook standard (pronunciation not perfect, but clear)
✓ Preferable to having AI attempt to read Chinese characters directly

RECOMMENDATION FOR HUMAN VOICE ACTORS:
If recording with human actors, provide:
1. PRONUNCIATION_MASTER_GUIDE.txt (all pronunciations with IPA)
2. Audio examples of correct Mandarin pronunciation (reference recordings)
3. Practice session for non-Chinese speaking actors
4. Pronunciation coaching for authenticity
