# The Blues Has Been Teaching Dharma All Along
## Recognizing African-American Wisdom in Buddhist Practice

## Opening

I've been studying the Lotus Sutra for over forty years. For most of that time, I read it in formal English translations—beautiful, scholarly, precise. But something always felt distant, like I was reading someone else's mail.

Then about ten years ago, I started translating the Lotus Sutra into the language I actually speak: the language of the blues, gospel, and African-American folk wisdom. And something extraordinary happened. The sutra came alive. Not because I'd made it simpler or dumbed it down, but because I'd discovered something that had been true all along: the blues has been teaching Buddhist philosophy for generations.

This isn't metaphor. I'm not saying the blues is *like* Buddhism. I'm saying that blues musicians—from Bessie Smith to B.B. King to Billie Holiday—have been articulating the Four Noble Truths, teaching about impermanence and karma, and showing the path to liberation. They've been doing this not in Sanskrit or Pali, but in the language forged in the crucible of slavery, Jim Crow, and the ongoing struggle for dignity and freedom.

When I share this with people, I get two reactions. Buddhist practitioners, especially white Buddhists, are often surprised and intrigued. African-American folks, on the other hand, usually nod and say, "Yeah, we've known that." They've been living this truth. They just didn't have permission to call it Buddhism.

This essay is about giving that permission. It's about recognizing that the dharma doesn't belong to any culture or language. It's about understanding that wisdom speaks many languages and sings many songs.

## The Same Truth, Different Languages

The Buddha's first teaching was the First Noble Truth: life involves suffering. Not metaphorical suffering. Not exceptional suffering. Just the basic condition of being human—in a body, in time, subject to change and loss.

The blues says the same thing. Life hurts. Not sometimes. Fundamentally.

But here's where it gets interesting: neither Buddhism nor the blues stops at suffering. Both traditions teach that acknowledging pain is not the end of the story—it's the beginning of freedom.

In Buddhism, the recognition of *dukkha* (suffering) is liberating because it leads to understanding the cause of suffering and the path beyond it. The Buddha doesn't promise that suffering will disappear. He promises something more realistic and more profound: that we can transform our relationship to suffering through clear seeing and wise action.

The blues works exactly the same way. When Bessie Smith sings, "I've got the blues / But too much pride to cry," she's not wallowing in misery. She's transforming pain into dignity, into art, into something that can be witnessed and shared. The very act of singing the blues changes suffering from something that crushes you into something you can hold, examine, and ultimately transcend.

This is not escapism. Both Buddhism and the blues explicitly reject escapism. The Buddha rejected extreme asceticism—the attempt to transcend the world by denying the body. He taught the Middle Way: neither indulgence nor denial, but clear-eyed engagement with reality as it is.

The blues does the same. Blues music doesn't promise that your troubles will disappear. It promises something deeper: that suffering can be witnessed, articulated, and transformed through witness. As blues historian Robert Palmer wrote, "The blues are not about running away from your problems. They're about turning to face them."

## Community Is the Path

In Buddhist practice, we have *sangha*—the community of practitioners. The Buddha taught that enlightenment is not an individual achievement in isolation. One practices with others, is supported by others, learns from others' struggles and insights.

The blues is communal in exactly the same way. Blues music is call-and-response—the singer speaks, the audience responds. The tradition itself is communal: blues musicians learn from those who came before, add their voice, pass it on.

This isn't just about musical form. It's about a fundamental understanding: you can't get free alone. Your liberation is bound up with everybody else's liberation.

When Mahalia Jackson sang gospel, she wasn't performing for an audience. She was leading a congregation. When Muddy Waters sang the blues in a Chicago club, he wasn't entertaining customers. He was testifying to shared experience, creating space for collective witness and healing.

This is the bodhisattva path: the commitment to work for the liberation of all beings, not just yourself. The blues has been walking this path all along.

## The Historical Evidence

The parallels between blues and Buddhism aren't just philosophical abstractions. Blues musicians have been articulating Buddhist teachings explicitly, even if they didn't use that terminology.

Consider Muddy Waters' "Trouble No More": "I got to tell my baby / Baby, please don't cry no more / Well, I got to tell her (darling) / I ain't gonna worry my life anymore."

This isn't just a breakup song. It's the Second Noble Truth: the recognition that suffering arises from a specific cause (worry, clinging, aversion) and that liberation begins when we understand this cause and refuse to be governed by it.

Or B.B. King's "The Thrill Is Gone": "The thrill is gone / Baby, the thrill is gone / I'm satisfied the way you love me before."

King is teaching *anicca*—impermanence. He's not sentimentalizing lost love. He's making a philosophical statement about the nature of conditioned existence: that clinging to what changes causes suffering, but acceptance of impermanence brings freedom.

Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit" operates on a different level. She's not singing about personal suffering but systemic suffering—the violence embedded in social structures. This is engaged Buddhism: the recognition that suffering is not merely personal but collective, and that liberation must address structural violence.

When Aretha Franklin sang "I'm a woman / I can do anything that a man can do," she was articulating Buddha-nature: the assertion that within this being, despite society's attempts to diminish her, is inherent wholeness, inherent dignity, inherent worth.

These aren't coincidences. They're expressions of the same wisdom tradition looking directly at suffering and finding the path to freedom.

## Translation as Recognition

For the past decade, I've been translating the Lotus Sutra into blues language. Not as a creative exercise, but as an act of recognition: acknowledging that the teaching was always meant to speak to suffering people in the language of their liberation.

Vernacular translation has a long and honored history in Buddhism. When Buddhist sutras were first translated from Sanskrit into Chinese, the translators faced the same challenge: how to make the teaching available to people for whom the original language was culturally foreign.

The greatest Buddhist translator, Kumarajiva, understood that his task wasn't merely to find equivalent words but to find the spiritual equivalent in the target culture. His Lotus Sutra translation became definitive not because it was most literally accurate but because it best conveyed the teaching into the consciousness of Chinese readers.

The same principle applies to translating Buddhist scripture into blues language. When the Lotus Sutra speaks of "skillful means"—the Buddha's compassionate adaptation of teaching to students' capacities—blues language isn't a departure from this principle. It's the application of it.

Let me show you what I mean. Here's the opening of the Burning House parable from the Lotus Sutra in formal English:

> "Śāriputra, suppose in a certain land, province, or village there was a great elder who was aged and declining, possessing immeasurable wealth, with many fields, estates, and servants. His house was vast and great, having only a single gate..."

And here's the blues rendering:

> "Śāriputra, say there's a country, a town, a village somewhere. And in that place there's a great elder—old man, getting on in years, but rich beyond measure. Got fields and houses, got servants and workers. His house is big, real big, but it only got one door..."

The teaching is identical. The philosophical content is unchanged. But the blues rendering achieves something the formal translation cannot: it speaks directly to lived experience. For an African-American reader, the "burning house" recalls the lived historical experience of Black communities—houses burned, communities destroyed, escape a matter of literal survival.

The parable isn't changed in content. But in blues language, it becomes viscerally alive in a way that formal English, for all its accuracy, could never be for many readers.

This is the power of vernacular translation: it doesn't change the teaching; it reveals what the teaching has always meant.

## What This Means for Practice

So what does it mean, practically and spiritually, to recognize blues and Buddhism as expressions of the same wisdom?

First, it means that for African-American practitioners, Buddhism is not a foreign import. It's the articulation in Sanskrit and Pali of truths that have already been lived and expressed in African-American spiritual traditions. An African-American person studying the Lotus Sutra isn't adopting a foreign religion—she's recognizing her own wisdom in a new form.

This is psychologically and spiritually significant. It means she doesn't have to choose between her cultural heritage and her Buddhist practice. She can integrate them.

Second, it means that African-American communities who have been suspicious of Buddhism as a "white import" can recognize that Buddhism is, in fact, native to their own tradition. The blues is already Buddhist. Gospel is already Buddhist. The spiritual practices of African-American communities have already been creating enlightened beings.

Third, for Buddhist communities themselves, this recognition means that Buddhism in the West is not fully formed until it integrates the voice and wisdom of the African-American tradition. Western Buddhism is still struggling to address issues of racism and cultural appropriation. Recognizing blues and Buddhism as expressions of the same wisdom provides a framework for deepening Buddhism's understanding of its own teachings.

The bodhisattva path—the commitment to liberation of all beings—requires listening to the wisdom of those whose voices have been systematically silenced.

Fourth, this recognition affirms Buddhism's claim to universality. Buddhism has always claimed that the path to liberation is available to all beings, in all cultures, in all times. The recognition that African-American blues tradition articulates Buddhist philosophy demonstrates that the dharma emerges everywhere that beings look clearly at suffering and seek liberation.

## A Personal Note

I came to this work not as a scholar but as a practitioner. I've been sitting with the Lotus Sutra for over forty years, and I've been playing blues and gospel music for just as long. For most of that time, I kept these practices separate in my mind—Buddhism was my spiritual practice, music was my cultural expression.

But about ten years ago, I started to realize they weren't separate at all. The same truth I was finding in the Lotus Sutra, I was hearing in Mahalia Jackson's voice. The same freedom the Buddha was teaching, Muddy Waters was singing about.

When I started translating the Lotus Sutra into blues language, it wasn't an academic project. It was an act of coming home—recognizing that the dharma had been in my tradition all along, sung by my ancestors, lived by my community.

This recognition changed my practice. I no longer feel like I'm borrowing someone else's religion. I'm claiming my own wisdom tradition and recognizing it as part of the universal dharma.

## Conclusion

The blues and Buddhism are not separate cultural domains that happen to share some similar themes. They are expressions of the same wisdom—a shared understanding of how to live with truth.

Both traditions emerge from unflinching recognition of suffering. Both refuse the false consolation of denial or escape. Both understand that liberation is communal, that joy is possible within struggle, that wisdom comes not from transcending human experience but from looking directly at it.

To recognize this is to understand that the dharma has never been foreign to African-American communities. It has been sung in spirituals and blues, articulated in the speeches of civil rights leaders, lived in the resilience of people who have survived systematic attempts at dehumanization while maintaining their humanity and dignity.

Translating Buddhist scripture into blues language is not a departure from authentic dharma. It's the revelation of connections that have always existed. It's the Buddhist principle of skillful means applied to the task of making the teaching available to a people whose own wisdom tradition has already been teaching these truths.

In the end, to recognize the blues as Buddhist wisdom is to acknowledge that the dharma speaks many languages and sings many songs. It's to honor the teachers who have come before us—whether they wore robes or wore the pain of their people in their voices. It's to understand that Buddhism in the West will be complete only when it fully integrates the voice of African-American spiritual tradition.

And it's to affirm, in the words of the blues and the dharma together, that liberation is possible, that community is the path, and that the truth, when sung together, sets us free.
