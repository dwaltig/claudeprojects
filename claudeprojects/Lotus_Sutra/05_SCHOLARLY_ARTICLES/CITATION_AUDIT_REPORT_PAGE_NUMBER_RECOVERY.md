## SECONDARY CITATIONS (Referenced but No Direct Quotes)

These are cited in your Works Cited but appear without page numbers in endnotes. For these, you have two options:

1. **Add a specific page number** if you can locate the relevant passage
2. **Leave as general book citations** without page numbers (acceptable for general references in Chicago style, though less preferred)

### 5. Gayle F. Wald, _Shout, Sister, Shout: The Life of Sister Rosetta Tharpe_
**Publisher**: Beacon Press (2007)
**Note [6]**: About Sister Rosetta Tharpe's life and theological position

**Current status**: Works Cited entry exists, endnote lacks page reference
**Recommendation**: If you have a specific passage where Tharpe's theology is discussed, add the page number. Otherwise, the general citation is acceptable.

**Chicago format** (with page if you find one):
```
6. Gayle F. Wald, Shout, Sister, Shout: The Life of Sister Rosetta Tharpe
(Boston: Beacon Press, 2007), [PAGE NUMBER] (or no page if general reference).
```

---

### 6. Maurice Merleau-Ponty, _Phenomenology of Perception_
**Publisher**: Routledge (2012 translation by Donald A. Landes)
**Note [20]**: About embodied knowledge and lived body

**Current status**: Works Cited entry exists, endnote lacks page reference
**Recommendation**: This is a dense philosophical text. If you have a specific section on embodied knowledge, add the page. Otherwise, a general citation is acceptable.

**Chicago format** (with page if you find one):
```
20. Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception, trans. Donald A. Landes
(New York: Routledge, 2012), [PAGE NUMBER] (or no page if general reference).
```

---

### 7. Charles S. Prebish, _Luminous Passage: The Practice and Study of Buddhism in America_
**Publisher**: University of California Press (1999)
**Note [36]**: About Buddhist institutions in America remaining predominantly white and Asian
**ISSUE**: Currently paired with Pew Research Center URL in note [36] - these should be SEPARATE citations

**Current status**: This needs to be split into two separate endnotes

**What you need**:
- Locate the specific page where Prebish discusses Buddhist institutional demographics
- Separate this into its own endnote [before or after Pew Research, depending on flow]

**Chicago format**:
```
[New number]. Charles S. Prebish, Luminous Passage: The Practice and Study of Buddhism in America
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), [PAGE NUMBER].
```

**Where to find**:
- Library: Buddhism/religion section
- Online: University of California Press website may have preview
- This is a well-known book in Buddhist studies

## WHAT TO DO WITH PAGE NUMBERS ONCE YOU FIND THEM

### Critical Quotes (Oliver, Palmer, Jackson, Trungpa):

1. **Find the exact page number** in your source
2. **Verify the quote matches** word-for-word
3. **Update the endnote** in the manuscript to include page number
4. **Format in Chicago style**: Always include page number in parentheses

**Example**:
```
Before: Robert Palmer noted, "The blues are not about running away from your problems..."[10]
Note [10]: Robert Palmer, Deep Blues (New York: Viking Press, 1981).

After: Robert Palmer noted, "The blues are not about running away from your problems..."[10]
Note [10]: Robert Palmer, Deep Blues: A Musical and Cultural History of the Mississippi Delta
(New York: Viking Press, 1981), 247.
```

### Secondary References (Wald, Merleau-Ponty, Prebish):

1. **Find the relevant page(s)** if possible
2. **Add to endnote** or leave as general reference (Chicago style permits both)
3. **Separate Prebish from Pew Research** - these are two different citations
