Re: Manuscript Submission - "The Dharma Sings the Blues: A Comprehensive Scholarly Analysis of Vernacular Buddhist Translation through the Lens of African-American Idiom"

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit the enclosed manuscript, "The Dharma Sings the Blues: A Comprehensive Scholarly Analysis of Vernacular Buddhist Translation through the Lens of African-American Idiom," for consideration for publication in Contemporary Buddhism.

This article examines an innovative translation methodology: rendering the Lotus Sutra from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese into African-American Blues vernacular. Drawing on translation theory (Nida, Venuti), Blues philosophy (Murray, Ellison, Baraka), and scholarship on African-American Buddhism (Willis, Johnson, hooks), the article argues that this vernacular translation represents a legitimate form of cultural transcreation grounded in the Mahayana concept of upāya (skillful means).

The article contributes to ongoing conversations in:

• Buddhist translation studies and methodology
• Contemporary applications of classical Buddhist texts
• The adaptation of Buddhism in American cultural contexts
• Vernacular interpretation of sacred texts
• African-American religious studies and lived Buddhism

I believe this manuscript is well-suited for Contemporary Buddhism's interdisciplinary focus and its interest in ethnographic studies of lived Buddhism, popular culture, and often-neglected perspectives in Buddhist studies. The article bridges translation theory, African-American cultural criticism, and Buddhist philosophy to explore how the Dharma might speak authentically in American vernacular traditions.

This manuscript is approximately 7,800 words (including references), has not been submitted elsewhere, and is original work. I confirm that this work complies with the journal's ethical guidelines.

I have attached both the complete manuscript and a blind version suitable for peer review.

Thank you for considering this submission. I look forward to hearing from you.

Respectfully,
