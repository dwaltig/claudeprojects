## 📝 Cover Letter Template: Contemporary Buddhism

```
Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit "The Dharma Sings the Blues: A Comprehensive Scholarly 
Analysis of Vernacular Buddhist Translation through the Lens of African-American 
Idiom" for consideration in Contemporary Buddhism.

This article examines an innovative translation methodology: rendering the Lotus 
Sutra from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese into African-American Blues vernacular. 
Drawing on translation theory (Nida, Venuti), Blues philosophy (Murray, Ellison, 
Baraka), and scholarship on African-American Buddhism (Willis, Johnson), the 
article argues that this vernacular translation represents a legitimate form of 
cultural transcreation grounded in the Mahayana concept of upāya (skillful means).

The article contributes to ongoing conversations in:
- Buddhist translation studies and methodology
- Contemporary applications of classical Buddhist texts
- The adaptation of Buddhism in American cultural contexts
- Vernacular interpretation of sacred texts

This manuscript is approximately 8,000 words, has not been submitted elsewhere, 
and is original work.

Thank you for considering this submission.

Respectfully,
William Altig
Independent Scholar
