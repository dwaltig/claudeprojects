Dear Dr. Perkins,

I am submitting for peer review the manuscript "The Blues as Buddhist
Epistemology: How African-American Musical Tradition and Mahayana Buddhist
Philosophy Address Suffering and Liberation" (5,000 words).

This essay argues that African-American blues tradition and Mahayana Buddhist
philosophy share a fundamental epistemological foundation. Both traditions
emerge from unflinching recognition of human suffering, both offer pathways
to transcendence without denying pain, and both understand liberation as
communal rather than individual achievement.

This work fills a gap in comparative philosophy scholarship: while much work
examines East-West dialogue, little addresses the parallel philosophical
systems within African-American spiritual traditions and Buddhist thought.
Through textual analysis, historical evidence, and vernacular translation
theory, the essay demonstrates that blues musicians have been articulating
Buddhist philosophy for generations—a recognition with significant implications
for both traditions.

The manuscript has not been previously published and is not under consideration
elsewhere. I believe it makes a timely and substantive contribution to
Buddhist Studies, Comparative Philosophy, and African-American Studies.

Thank you for considering this submission.

Sincerely,
William Altig

## WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR

From the journal's scope statement, they prioritize:

✓ Articles on Asian philosophy and comparative philosophy
✓ Work that illuminates "distinctive characteristics" of Eastern and Western traditions
✓ Relevance of philosophy to "art, literature, science, and social practice"
✓ "Intercultural" philosophical perspectives
✓ Rigorous, peer-reviewed scholarship

**Your article matches these criteria because:**
- ✓ Comparative (blues/African-American tradition ↔ Buddhist philosophy)
- ✓ Illuminates distinctiveness (blues as valid epistemology)
- ✓ Relevant to lived practice (implications for contemporary spiritual seekers)
- ✓ Intercultural dialogue
- ✓ Rigorous scholarship with citations and evidence
