# Tricycle Submission - UPDATED Process

## IMPORTANT: Tricycle Requires Query First

Tricycle does NOT accept full manuscript submissions. Their process:

1. **Submit one-page query** outlining your idea
2. **Wait for response** (within 1 month, sometimes longer)
3. **If interested, they'll request full manuscript**

## Updated Submission Package

### What to Submit NOW:
- ✅ **Query Letter**: `ARTICLE_4_TRICYCLE_QUERY_LETTER.txt` (one page)
- ✅ **Author Photo**: `William_Altig_Author_Photo.jpg` (optional with query)

### What to HOLD for later (if they request it):
- ⏸️ **Full Article**: `ARTICLE_4_TRICYCLE_VERSION.txt` (3,800 words)
- ⏸️ **Cover Letter**: Not needed for query stage

## Submission Instructions

**Method**: Electronic form on their website (NOT email)
- They accept submissions electronically only
- No physical manuscripts
- No email submissions
- Use their online submission form

**What to include in query**:
- One-page proposal outlining your idea
- Your Buddhist and writing background
- Your familiarity with the subject
- Writing samples/clips (if you have them)

**Preferred article length**: 500-2,000 words (they rarely publish over 4,000)
- Your article at 3,800 words is acceptable but on the longer side
- Be prepared to cut if requested

## Deadlines for Specific Issues

- **Spring** (February release) – September 15
- **Summer** (May release) – December 15 ← **NEXT DEADLINE**
- **Fall** (August release) – April 15
- **Winter** (November release) – July 15

**Current date**: December 1, 2025
**You just missed**: Summer issue deadline (December 15)
**Next deadline**: Fall issue (April 15, 2026)

## Response Timeline

- **Official**: Within 1 month
- **Reality**: Can be longer due to volume
- Don't be surprised if it takes 6-8 weeks

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Query letter is ready
2. ⬜ Find Tricycle's online submission form
3. ⬜ Submit query through their form
4. ⬜ Wait for response (1-2 months)
5. ⬜ If they request full manuscript, send the 3,800-word article

## Alternative: Lion's Roar

While waiting for Tricycle's response, consider also submitting to **Lion's Roar**:
- Faster response (4-8 weeks)
- Accepts full manuscripts
- Larger readership
- Lower pay but faster publication

You could query Tricycle AND submit full manuscript to Lion's Roar simultaneously.
