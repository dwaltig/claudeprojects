# PROSPECTUS: The Sacred Architecture of the Buddhist Canon
## Numerological Coherence in the Lotus Sutra, Bodhicaryāvatāra, and Dhammapada

**Status:** Concept Phase
**Target Venue:** *Religions* (MDPI) or *Journal of Indian Philosophy*
**Working Title:** *The Liturgical Constant: Lunar and Solar Architectures in Foundational Mahāyāna Texts*

### 1. The Core Thesis
This paper argues that the "canonical" versions of key Buddhist texts did not settle into their final forms arbitrarily. Instead, they were sculpted by the living oral tradition into precise "liturgical vessels" that mirror the cycles of time used by the practitioner community. Specifically, it posits a dual system:
*   **The Solar/Structural Temple (28):** Representing completeness and the "Perfect Number." Found in the *Lotus Sutra* and the reconstructed *Dhammapada*.
*   **The Lunar/Rhythmic Path (27):** Representing the sidereal lunar month (*Nakshatra* cycle). Found in the verse count of the *Bodhicaryāvatāra*.

### 2. Case Study A: The Solar Temple (Number 28)
*   **The Lotus Sutra:** The canonical Kumārajīva translation has exactly **28 Chapters**. The number 28 is a "Perfect Number" (equal to the sum of its divisors) and represents the 4-week solar month.
*   **The Dhammapada:** Identifying the structural anomaly of Chapter 26 (*Brāhmaṇavagga*) and the missing *Nirvana* chapter suggests an original or intended **28-Chapter structure**, creating a "Twin Temple" with the Lotus.

### 3. Case Study B: The Lunar Path (Number 27)
*   **The Bodhicaryāvatāra:** The canonical recension settled at **912 verses**.
*   **The Math:** 912 verses / 27 days = **33.77 verses/day**.
*   **The Insight:** This allows for a perfect monthly recitation cycle matched to the *Nakshatra* (lunar mansion) calendar used at Nalanda. The text is not just a book; it is a clock.

### 4. Argument: The "Settling" of the Dharma
We do not argue that the original authors (Shakyamuni, Śāntideva) necessarily drafted these counts. Rather, we argue for **Liturgical Natural Selection**:
*   Texts that didn't fit the rhythm of the monastery were "rubbed smooth" over centuries of chanting until they settled into these stable, sacred numbers.
*   The "Canonical" versions are the ones that "sing" in time with the cosmos.

### 5. Conclusion
 Recognizing this "Sacred Architecture" changes how we translate and read these texts. They are not linear arguments; they are temporal mandalas designed to be walked (or chanted) in time with the sun and moon.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Compile verse statistics for *Bodhicaryāvatāra* (Chapter by Chapter).
2.  Synthesize the *Dhammapada* 28-chapter reconstruction evidence.
3.  Draft the Introduction connecting Nalanda astronomy to liturgical practice.
