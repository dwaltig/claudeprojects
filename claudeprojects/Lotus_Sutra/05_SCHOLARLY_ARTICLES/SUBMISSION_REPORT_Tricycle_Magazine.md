## IMPORTANT: VERIFY PAYMENT BEFORE INVESTING TIME

**I made an error in earlier communication**: I claimed Tricycle pays $500-1,500 for articles without verifying this against current policy.

### Before You Write This Version:

**Contact Tricycle directly to confirm:**
1. Do they pay contributors for accepted articles?
2. What is their typical payment range?
3. What length articles do they pay for?
4. What is their current payment schedule?

**How to contact**:
- Email: submissions@tricycle.org (or check their website for current contact)
- Website: https://tricycle.org
- Look for "Submit" or "Contact" section on their site

**Recommended**: Email them asking: "Do you pay writers for accepted feature articles? If so, what is the typical payment range and what word length qualifies?"

## MANUSCRIPT REQUIREMENTS

### Length
- **Preferred**: 3,500-4,500 words (SHORTER than academic version)
- **Note**: This should be a rewritten version for general audience, NOT the philosophy journal version
- **Why shorter**: Magazine space is limited; readers prefer accessible length

### Tone & Style
- **NOT academic** (no jargon, no endnotes)
- **Conversational** (you're speaking to practitioners, not scholars)
- **Personal** (include why YOU care about this topic)
- **Accessible** (explain Buddhist concepts without assuming technical knowledge)
- **Relevant** (emphasize practical implications for readers' spiritual lives)

### Formatting
- [ ] Double-spaced or 1.5-spaced (whichever is readable)
- [ ] Standard font (Times New Roman or similar, 12pt)
- [ ] Minimal endnotes (magazines dislike extensive notes)
- [ ] Integrate citations smoothly into text where possible
- [ ] Use subheadings to break up sections (improves readability)

### Example Section Rewrite (Academic → Magazine)

**ACADEMIC VERSION (Philosophy East and West)**:
```
The fundamental insight of Buddhism is the First Noble Truth: dukkha—often
translated as "suffering" but better understood as the pervasive unsatisfactoriness
of conditioned existence. The Buddha's teaching begins with this unflinching
statement: life, as ordinarily lived, involves suffering.
```

**MAGAZINE VERSION (Tricycle)**:
```
Here's where Buddhism starts: with the simple, hard truth that life involves
suffering. Not just bad luck, not just sad moments, but the basic texture of
being alive in a body, in time. The Buddha called this dukkha—usually translated
as "suffering," though it really means something closer to "unsatisfactoriness."
It's what we all feel when we want something we can't have, or when we lose
something we love.

And here's the thing: this isn't depressing. It's liberating.
```

## WHAT MAKES A GOOD TRICYCLE SUBMISSION

Tricycle editors look for:

✓ **Relevance to practitioners** - How does this help someone on the path?
✓ **Clear writing** - Can educated non-specialist readers understand it?
✓ **Authentic voice** - Does the author have genuine experience/authority?
✓ **Contemporary connection** - How does this address current issues?
✓ **Emotional resonance** - Does it touch readers' hearts, not just minds?
✓ **Cultural sensitivity** - Respectful engagement with traditions

**Your article has strong potential because:**
- ✓ Speaks directly to African-American practitioners seeking Buddhist connection
- ✓ Validates blues/gospel traditions as serious philosophy
- ✓ Offers accessible entry point to dharma teaching
- ✓ Addresses real gap in Buddhist communities
- ✓ Personally authentic

## SUBMISSION PACKAGE FOR TRICYCLE

### 1. Manuscript File
- **Filename**: `Altig_Blues_Buddhism_Tricycle.docx`
- **Content**: Rewritten version for general audience (3,500-4,500 words)
- **Format**: Word document, readable formatting

### 2. Cover Letter

**Customize this template:**

```
Dear Tricycle Editorial Team,

I'm submitting a feature article for consideration: "The Blues as Buddhist
Epistemology: Recognizing African-American Wisdom in Buddhist Practice"
(approximately 4,200 words).

This essay speaks directly to Tricycle's interest in Buddhism and engaged life.
As Buddhism grows in Western culture, it remains predominantly white and Asian.
Meanwhile, African-American communities—through blues, gospel, and folk
wisdom—have developed sophisticated responses to suffering that go unrecognized
as serious philosophy.

This essay bridges that gap by showing that blues musicians have been teaching
dharma for generations. For African-American practitioners and spiritual seekers,
this recognition is transformative: Buddhism is not a foreign import but the
articulation in Sanskrit of truths already lived in African-American tradition.

The piece combines intellectual rigor with spiritual depth, suitable for
Tricycle's readers who want to deepen their practice while understanding
Buddhism's universality and relevance to contemporary American life.

The article has not been previously published and is not under simultaneous
consideration elsewhere.

Best regards,
William Altig

## CRITICAL DECISION POINT

**Before you invest time rewriting for Tricycle:**

**You MUST verify payment status and submission requirements directly with Tricycle.**

1. Visit https://tricycle.org
2. Find submission guidelines
3. Email submissions@tricycle.org asking:
   - Do you pay contributors for feature articles?
   - What is typical payment range?
   - What word length qualifies?
   - Current submission process?

**Why?**
- Don't spend a week rewriting if they don't accept submissions
- Don't expect payment if they don't pay
- Don't waste time on formatting if requirements have changed

---

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION

### Option A: Focus on Primary Target Only
- **Just submit to Philosophy East and West** (peer-reviewed, builds academic credentials)
- **Skip Tricycle** (unless you verify they meet your needs)
- **Reason**: Tricycle is optional; PEW is essential for building credentials as unknown author

### Option B: Dual Submission (Recommended)
- **Submit to Philosophy East and West** (academic credibility)
- **AND rewrite + submit to Tricycle** (reach practitioners, build platform)
- **Reason**: Different audiences, different articles, can submit simultaneously
- **Caveat**: Only do this if you verify Tricycle's requirements and payment policy

### Option C: Wait for PEW Decision
- **Submit to Philosophy East and West** first
- **Wait 6 months for decision**
- **Then consider Tricycle** if you want additional platform
- **Reason**: Safer, less work upfront, but slower

## NEXT WEEK'S DECISION

Before you start working on Tricycle version, you need to decide:

**Will you:**
1. **Just do Philosophy East and West** (focus on academic credentials)
2. **Do both PEW and Tricycle** (broader approach, more work)
3. **Wait to hear from PEW** before considering Tricycle

**If you choose option 2 or 3:**
- First, verify Tricycle's submission requirements and payment policy
- Then decide if it's worth the extra work

**Recommendation**: Start with Philosophy East and West (that's your priority for building credentials). Tricycle is valuable but secondary.
