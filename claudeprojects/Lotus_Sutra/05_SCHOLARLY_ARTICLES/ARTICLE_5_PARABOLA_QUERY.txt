Subject: Submission: The Dharma Singing the Blues

Dear Editors,

I am writing to submit an essay for consideration titled "The Diamond Sutra in Blues Language."

The spiritual search often leads us to the same "naked truth," regardless of the tradition we start from. This essay explores the surprising resonance between two distinct wisdom traditions: the Mahayana Buddhism of ancient India and the Blues music of the American South.

I detail my own journey of discovering that the Diamond Sutra's teaching on emptiness is not a dry philosophical concept, but a "song" that has been sung on American porches for a century. By rendering the Sutra's verses into the Blues idiom, I explore how the "sword of wisdom" and the "crossroads" meet. It is an exploration of how truth demands to be sung, and how the "song" of liberation remains the same, even when the lyrics change languages.

I am an author and musician based in Houston, Texas, and my work focuses on the intersection of spirituality, creativity, and vernacular language.

Thank you for considering this contribution to the ongoing conversation about the traditions that shape our inner lives.

Sincerely,

William Altig
