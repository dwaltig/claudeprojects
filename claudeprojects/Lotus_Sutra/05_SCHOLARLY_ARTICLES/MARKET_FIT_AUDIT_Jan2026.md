# MARKET FIT AUDIT: "The Dharma Sings the Blues"
**Agent:** Miriam Steinberg (Publishing Industry Critic)
**Date:** January 2, 2026
**Status:** URGENT PIVOT RECOMMENDED

## 1. The Executive Verdict
**Stop spinning your wheels.** You are oscillating between journals based on their *titles* rather than their *contents*. 

I have reviewed the last 12 months of Table of Contents (TOCs) for your targets. Here is the cold reality: **The "Journal of Global Buddhism" (JGB) is a methodological mismatch.** You are trying to sell a *literary/hermeneutical* paper to a *social science* journal. 

## 2. Market Analysis (Based on 2024-2025 Data)

### A. Literature and Theology (Oxford UP)
*   **The Vibe:** High theory, form, textuality, "The Closed Book," "Theology and the Body."
*   **What They Buy:** They buy arguments about *how texts mean things*. They love cross-disciplinary work that treats "Theology" as a mode of reading.
*   **Your Paper's Fit:** **PERFECT (BUY).** Your paper essentially argues that *translating* into Blues is a *theological act* of "fingering the jagged grain." This is exactly the kind of "Form = Theology" argument they devour.
*   **Verdict:** **BUY.** This is your Prestige Target.

### B. Journal of Global Buddhism (JGB)
*   **The Vibe:** Ethnography, Sociology, Lived Religion. Titles like "Making Waste: Environmental Sustainability," "Religious Tourism," "Dying Buddhish."
*   **What They Buy:** They buy data. They buy field reports. They want to know what *actual people in Thailand* are doing with plastic waste, or how Australians are dying.
*   **Your Paper's Fit:** **RISKY (HOLD).** Your paper is a *textual analysis* of a translation that (currently) largely exists as a literary project, not a mass social movement. You don't have "field data" on 500 Blues Buddhists. You have the text.
*   **Risk:** They will bounce this as "out of scope" or "too theoretical/literary."

### C. Journal of Africana Religions
*   **The Vibe:** Tradition-specific. "Maleness of God in Igbo," "Ritual Economies in Vodun."
*   **What They Buy:** Deep dives into specific Africana repertoires. 
*   **Your Paper's Fit:** **SELL.** It's too Buddhist for them. It's an interesting outlier, but you'll get stuck in "Reviewer Hell" trying to find a Buddhist scholar on their board.

### D. Religion & the Arts (Boston College)
*   **The Vibe:** Visual arts, literature, aesthetic theory.
*   **Your Paper's Fit:** **STRONG BUY (SAFETY).** It's a safe home. It fits the "Arts" mandate perfectly. But it has lower impact than *Literature & Theology*.

## 3. Miriam's Strategy Recommendation

You have a "Literature & Theology" paper dressed up in "Global Buddhism" clothes. **Take the clothes off.**

### The Pivot Plan:
1.  **Primary Target (The "Reach"):** **Literature and Theology**.
    *   *Why:* Higher impact, better methodological fit. They *want* deep textual theory.
    *   *Action:* Use the cover letter hooks about "Vernacular Hermeneutics" and "Blues as Textual Form."
    
2.  **Secondary Target (The "Safety"):** **Religion & the Arts**.
    *   *Why:* Guaranteed fit.
    
3.  **Drop JGB:** Unless you want to rewrite the paper to pretend you did an ethnography (don't do that), JGB is a trap.

## 4. Next Steps
I have the *Literature and Theology* cover letter draft you made earlier. It was good. I can sharpen it.

**My advice:**
**Submit to *Literature and Theology* immediately.** Forget the "Global Buddhism" reformatting you just did. It was a waste of time, but better to waste time than burn a submission.
