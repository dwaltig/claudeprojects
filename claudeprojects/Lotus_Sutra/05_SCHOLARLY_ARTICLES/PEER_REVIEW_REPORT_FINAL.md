## REVIEWER 1: THE COMPARATIVE PHILOSOPHER
**Perspective:** Rigor, logical structure, avoidance of essentialism.

**Verdict:** **Accept with Minor Revisions**

**Comments:**
The author has successfully navigated the "essentialist trap" that plagues many comparative studies. The shift from claiming "identity" to "structural homology" (homologous, parallel, functionally equivalent) is the saving grace of this manuscript. It allows the argument to breathe without forcing a false sameness.

*   **Strengths:**
    *   The definition of epistemology (Method/Source/Validity) is a robust analytical framework. It moves the paper beyond "these lyrics sound like this sutra" into a genuine philosophical investigation.
    *   The use of the *Kalama Sutta* [35] to ground the argument in Buddhist scripture is brilliant. It provides the necessary "permission" from the Pali canon to engage in this kind of vernacular validation.

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Robert Johnson/Karma:** The revised section on the crossroads is much safer. Acknowledging that it "differs from karmic causality... yet articulates a parallel principle" is defensible.
    *   **Tone:** The tone is still slightly soaring in places ("truth, when sung together, sets us free"). For *Philosophy East and West*, this is acceptable in the conclusion but borders on the homiletic. It's a stylistic choice I am willing to accept given the subject matter.

## REVIEWER 2: THE BUDDHIST STUDIES SCHOLAR
**Perspective:** Textual accuracy, historical lineage, understanding of Dharma.

**Verdict:** **Accept**

**Comments:**
I was prepared to be skeptical of a "Blues Buddhism" paper, expecting a "Beat Zen" style dilution. I was pleasantly surprised. The author demonstrates a solid grasp of Mahayana concepts (*upaya*, *tathata*, *anicca*) and uses standard translations (Reeves, Watson, Bodhisattva Bhumi).

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Translation Theory:** The comparison to Kumarajiva is historically astute. Citing Zürcher [14] and Lombardo [13] shows the author has done the homework on how Buddhism actually adapts. This is not just "opinion"; it is grounded in the history of transmission.
    *   **The "Burning House" Parable:** The side-by-side comparison is undeniable. The blues vernacular captures the *urgency* (*samvega*) of the original parable better than the "standard" translation. This alone justifies the article's publication.

*   **Minor Note:**
    *   The distinction between "institutional authority" and "experiential verification" (Kalama Sutta) is well-handled. It avoids the "Protestant Buddhism" trap of ignoring the vast tradition of monastic hierarchy, by explicitly naming it as a *parallel* strand.

## REVIEWER 3: THE ETHNOMUSICOLOGIST / AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES SCHOLAR
**Perspective:** Representation of Black culture, historical accuracy, resistance to appropriation.

**Verdict:** **Accept with Affirmation**

**Comments:**
This reviewer's primary concern was "colonization"—the idea that the author might be using Buddhism to "validate" the Blues, as if the Blues needed external validation. The revised manuscript avoids this effectively.

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **"Independent Discovery":** The phrasing "African-American spiritual traditions have independently arrived at..." is crucial. It grants sovereignty to the Blues. It says: "We didn't need the Buddha to tell us this, but it's cool that he agrees."
    *   **Tharpe & Jackson:** The handling of the sacred/secular divide in the lives of Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Mahalia Jackson is historically accurate.
    *   **B.B. King / "The Thrill is Gone":** Reading this song as a text on impermanence is a fresh and powerful interpretation that respects the gravity of the Blues. It doesn't treat the lyrics as "mere pop," but as philosophy.

*   **Suggestion:**
    *   In Section 4, the claim that this integration helps *Western Buddhism* deal with racism is a strong political point. It positions the Blues not just as "material to be studied" but as a "teacher to be heard." This power dynamic reversal is excellent.

## EDITOR'S SYNTHESIS & DECISION

**Decision:** **ACCEPT FOR PUBLICATION**

**Summary:**
This manuscript has matured significantly. The "Red Flags" identified in previous audits (essentialism, theological imperialism, loose terminology) have been systematically addressed.
*   The shift to **"homologous/parallel"** terminology secures the philosophical argument.
*   The **"independent discovery"** framing secures the cultural integrity argument.
*   The **Kalama Sutta** citation secures the theological argument.

The manuscript is now a rigorous, interdisciplinary contribution that fits squarely within the scope of *Philosophy East and West*. It bridges the gap between text-historical studies and contemporary comparative philosophy without sacrificing the dignity of either tradition.

**Recommendation to Author:**
Proceed to final formatting (checking the Python script output for visual perfection) and submit. No further substantive changes are required.
