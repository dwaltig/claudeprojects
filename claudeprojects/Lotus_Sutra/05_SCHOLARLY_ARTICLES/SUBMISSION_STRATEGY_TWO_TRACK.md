# Buddhist Magazine Submission Strategy - CORRECTED

## IMPORTANT: No Simultaneous Submissions

Lion's Roar, Buddhadharma, and Tricycle do NOT allow simultaneous submissions. You must submit to one at a time and wait for a response before submitting elsewhere.

---

## Sequential Submission Strategy

### PRIORITY 1: Lion's Roar (SUBMIT FIRST)

**Why submit here first:**
- ✅ **Perfect mission fit** - Explicitly seeking diverse voices on race/ethnicity
- ✅ **Faster response** - 8 weeks (vs. Tricycle's 1-2 months for query alone)
- ✅ **Simpler process** - Full manuscript accepted (vs. Tricycle's query-then-manuscript)
- ✅ **Larger readership** - 100,000+ readers
- ✅ **Your article directly addresses their stated mission**

**Submission Details:**
- **Email to**: sandi.rankaduwa@lionsroar.com
- **Subject**: Article Submission: The Blues Has Been Teaching Dharma All Along
- **Attach**: Full article (3,800 words) + author photo
- **Body**: Cover letter

**Files Ready:**
- ✅ `ARTICLE_4_LIONS_ROAR_COVER_LETTER.txt`
- ✅ `ARTICLE_4_TRICYCLE_VERSION.txt` (the article)
- ✅ `William_Altig_Author_Photo.jpg`

**Timeline:**
- Submit: This week
- Response: 8 weeks (by late January/early February 2026)
- If no response after 6 months: Free to submit elsewhere

---

### PRIORITY 2: Tricycle (IF LION'S ROAR REJECTS OR NO RESPONSE)

**When to submit:**
- If Lion's Roar rejects (they'll email)
- OR if no response after 6 months (June 2026)

**Submission Details:**
- Submit query through their online form
- Wait 1-2 months for query response
- If interested, they'll request full manuscript

**Files Ready:**
- ✅ `ARTICLE_4_TRICYCLE_QUERY_LETTER.txt`
- ✅ `ARTICLE_4_TRICYCLE_VERSION.txt` (for later if they request)

**Advantages:**
- Higher pay ($500-1,500 vs. $400-800)
- More literary/intellectual audience

**Disadvantages:**
- Slower (query + manuscript review)
- Your article is 3,800 words (near their 4,000 max)

---

### PRIORITY 3: Buddhadharma (IF BOTH REJECT)

**When to submit:**
- If both Lion's Roar and Tricycle reject

**Details:**
- More scholarly/practitioner-focused than Lion's Roar
- Part of Lion's Roar Foundation
- Use their online submission form

---

### PRIORITY 4: Contemporary Buddhism (ACADEMIC BACKUP)

**When to submit:**
- If all popular magazines reject

**Details:**
- Academic journal (peer-reviewed)
- Taylor & Francis publisher
- 30-40% acceptance rate
- 4-6 months review time
- No payment, but academic credibility

## Recommended Action Plan

### Week 1 (This Week - December 2025)
- ✅ Submit to Lion's Roar
- ⏸️ Hold Tricycle query

### Weeks 2-8 (December 2025 - January 2026)
- ⏳ Wait for Lion's Roar response

### Week 8-10 (Late January/Early February 2026)
- **If Lion's Roar accepts**: Celebrate! You're done.
- **If Lion's Roar rejects**: Immediately submit query to Tricycle
- **If no response**: Wait (they said 8 weeks but can be longer)

### Month 3-4 (March-April 2026)
- If still no response from Lion's Roar, submit query to Tricycle anyway
- Lion's Roar said "6 months" but most respond within 2-3 months

### Month 6+ (June 2026 onward)
- If no response from Lion's Roar after 6 months, you're free to submit elsewhere
- If Tricycle rejects, try Buddhadharma or Contemporary Buddhism

## Why This Order Makes Sense

1. **Lion's Roar is the best fit** - Your article directly addresses their diversity mission
2. **Fastest response** - Know in 8 weeks vs. 2-4 months
3. **Simpler process** - One submission vs. query-then-manuscript
4. **If rejected, you have time** - Can still hit Tricycle's Fall issue deadline (April 15)

## Next Action

**Submit to Lion's Roar this week:**

1. Open email to sandi.rankaduwa@lionsroar.com
2. Subject: "Article Submission: The Blues Has Been Teaching Dharma All Along"
3. Copy/paste cover letter from `ARTICLE_4_LIONS_ROAR_COVER_LETTER.txt`
4. Attach `ARTICLE_4_TRICYCLE_VERSION.txt` (rename to something cleaner if you want)
5. Attach `William_Altig_Author_Photo.jpg`
6. Send!

Then wait 8 weeks. Mark your calendar for late January 2026 to check status.
