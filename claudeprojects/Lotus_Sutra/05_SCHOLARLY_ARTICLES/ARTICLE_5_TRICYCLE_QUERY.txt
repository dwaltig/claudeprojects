Subject: Query: The Diamond Sutra in Blues Language

Dear Editors,

How do we make the "Vajra" cut through the noise of modern American life?

I am writing to query about an essay titled "The Diamond Sutra in Blues Language: When the Buddha's Most Radical Teaching Found Its Voice."

THE PITCH:
The Diamond Sutra is Buddhism's most radical text—and for many Western practitioners, its most impenetrable. I argue that the American Blues tradition offers a unique vehicle for unlocking its teaching. Blues and the Prajñaparamita share fundamental DNA: both strip truth down to the bone; both testify to suffering without wallowing in it; both point to freedom through letting go.

This is not a novelty piece. It is a serious inquiry into "Vernacular Dharma"—the historical necessity of dressing the Buddha's teachings in local clothes to ensure authentic transmission. Drawing parallels to Kumārajīva's translation work in China and Luther's Bible vernacular, I examine how the Blues voice navigates the Diamond Sutra's famous paradoxes with a natural ease that academic English often lacks.

The essay includes:
- The Bodhisattva Vow rendered in blues vernacular
- Subhūti's tears (Chapter 14) as a "blues breakdown"
- The Parable of the Raft reimagined as the musician's relationship to the song
- The First Noble Truth (Dukkha) connected directly to the blues tradition

ABOUT ME:
I am an independent scholar and musician based in Houston, Texas. I have practiced Buddhism for over forty years and have created blues vernacular interpretations of the Lotus Sutra, Heart Sutra, Diamond Sutra, and Dhammapada—all available on major streaming platforms and ElevenReader.

LENGTH: The completed essay is approximately 2,300 words.

I believe this piece would resonate with Tricycle readers interested in the intersection of American culture, the arts, and Buddhist philosophy. I would be happy to send the full manuscript upon request.

Warmly,
