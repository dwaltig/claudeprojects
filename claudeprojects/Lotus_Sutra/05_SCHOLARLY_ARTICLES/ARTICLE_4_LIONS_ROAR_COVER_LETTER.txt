LION'S ROAR COVER LETTER

Dear Sandi Rankaduwa,

I am submitting for your consideration "The Blues Has Been Teaching Dharma All Along: Recognizing African-American Wisdom in Buddhist Practice," a 2,250-word feature article for Lion's Roar magazine.

This piece directly addresses Lion's Roar's mission to "produce content that represents a multitude of traditions, ages, abilities, and interests" and your progressive approach to matters of race and ethnicity in Buddhism.

The Article

The article explores the profound philosophical connections between African-American blues tradition and Mahayana Buddhist philosophy. Rather than treating these as separate cultural domains, I demonstrate how blues musicians—from Bessie Smith to B.B. King to Billie Holiday—have been articulating the Four Noble Truths, teaching about impermanence and karma, and showing the path to liberation for generations.

The piece opens with my personal story: forty years of studying the Lotus Sutra in formal English translations, then discovering that when I interpreted it through blues language, the sutra came alive. This recognition—that the blues has been teaching Buddhist philosophy all along—has profound implications for diversity in American Buddhism.

The article includes:
- Concrete examples of blues lyrics articulating Buddhist teachings
- A side-by-side translation comparison showing how the Lotus Sutra transforms in blues language
- Practical implications for making Buddhist practice accessible to African-American communities
- Personal narrative woven throughout, grounding philosophical insights in lived experience

Why This Matters for Lion's Roar Readers

As you noted in your mission statement, Buddhism in the West has historically been "more like 'The Upper-Middle Way.'" This article addresses that gap directly. It shows that African-American communities have developed sophisticated spiritual responses to suffering that deserve recognition as serious philosophical systems. When we recognize blues and Buddhism as expressions of the same wisdom, we open pathways to Buddhist practice that would otherwise seem culturally inaccessible.

This isn't about cultural appropriation or superficial diversity. It's about recognizing that the dharma has been present in African-American spiritual traditions all along—sung in spirituals and blues, lived in the resilience of people who have survived systematic dehumanization while maintaining their humanity and dignity.

About Me

I am an independent Buddhist scholar, musician, and retired educator based in Houston, Texas. I have maintained a dedicated practice with the Lotus Sutra for over forty years and have completed blues-gospel interpretations of the Lotus Sutra trilogy, the Diamond Sutra, the Heart Sutra, and portions of the Nirvana Sutra. As a musician, my blues-folk interpretations of Buddhist teachings have reached over 2,500 listeners across multiple streaming platforms.

My work emerges from a decade of interpretation work and a lifetime of practice in both Buddhist meditation and blues/gospel music. This article represents the intersection of these two paths.

The article is complete at 2,250 words and ready for your review. I have attached the full manuscript and an author photo.

Thank you for considering this submission. I believe this work makes a timely contribution to Lion's Roar's mission of representing diverse voices in American Buddhism.

Sincerely,

William Altig
