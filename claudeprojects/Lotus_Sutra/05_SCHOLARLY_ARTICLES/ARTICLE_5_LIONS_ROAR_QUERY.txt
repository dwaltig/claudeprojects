Subject: Submission: The Diamond Sutra in Blues Language – When the Dharma Sings

Dear Sandi,

I am writing to submit an essay titled "The Diamond Sutra in Blues Language: When the Buddha's Most Radical Teaching Found Its Voice" for consideration in Lion's Roar.

For many practitioners, the Diamond Sutra can feel cold—like reading a quantum physics textbook. In this essay, I explore how translating this text into the American Blues vernacular transforms it from abstract philosophy into a "midnight confession." I argue that the Blues and the Prajñaparamita teachings share a fundamental DNA: the spiritual "nakedness" of truth stripped down to the bone.

The piece offers concrete examples, contrasting standard translations of the Bodhisattva Vow and the "Abide Nowhere" teaching with a "Blues rendering." It demonstrates how the language of the Mississippi Delta can unlock the heart of the Dharma for American ears in a way that academic language sometimes fails to do.

I am an independent scholar, author, and musician based in Houston, Texas. My work focuses on "vernacular Dharma," and I have written Blues interpretations of the Lotus Sutra, Heart Sutra, and Dhammapada.

Thank you for your time and consideration. The full manuscript is attached.

Sincerely,

William Altig
