TRICYCLE QUERY LETTER
The Blues Has Been Teaching Dharma All Along

Dear Tricycle Editors,

I am proposing a 2,250-word feature article titled "The Blues Has Been Teaching Dharma All Along: Recognizing African-American Wisdom in Buddhist Practice."

THE ARTICLE

This piece explores the profound philosophical connections between African-American blues tradition and Mahayana Buddhist philosophy. Rather than treating these as separate cultural domains, the article demonstrates how blues musicians—from Bessie Smith to B.B. King to Billie Holiday—have been articulating the Four Noble Truths, teaching about impermanence and karma, and showing the path to liberation for generations.

The article opens with my personal story: forty years of studying the Lotus Sutra in formal English translations, then discovering that when I translated it into blues language, the sutra came alive. This isn't metaphor—the blues has been teaching Buddhist philosophy all along, using the language forged in the crucible of slavery, Jim Crow, and the ongoing struggle for dignity and freedom.

The piece includes:
- Concrete examples of blues lyrics articulating Buddhist teachings (Muddy Waters on the Second Noble Truth, B.B. King on impermanence, Billie Holiday on engaged Buddhism)
- A side-by-side translation comparison showing how the Lotus Sutra's Burning House parable transforms in blues language
- Practical implications for contemporary Buddhist practice and diversity in American Buddhism
- Personal narrative woven throughout, grounding philosophical insights in lived experience

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR TRICYCLE READERS

As Buddhism continues to grow in Western culture, it remains predominantly white and Asian. Meanwhile, African-American communities have developed sophisticated spiritual responses to suffering that go largely unrecognized as philosophical systems. This creates a tragic missed opportunity: people from African-American communities who might find Buddhism deeply resonant often experience Buddhist institutions as culturally foreign.

This article addresses Tricycle's ongoing interest in diversity, accessibility, and the universality of dharma teaching. It offers both intellectual depth and personal warmth, showing how recognizing blues and Buddhism as expressions of the same wisdom can enrich both traditions and make Buddhist practice more accessible to African-American communities.

MY BACKGROUND

I am an independent Buddhist scholar, musician, and retired educator based in Houston, Texas. I have maintained a dedicated practice with the Lotus Sutra for over forty years and have completed a 131,000-word vernacular translation of the Lotus Sutra trilogy into American blues-gospel language. As a musician, my blues-folk interpretations of Buddhist teachings have reached audiences of over 2,500 listeners across multiple streaming platforms through projects including The William Altig Choir.

My work explores the intersection of African-American spiritual traditions and Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, with particular focus on making dharma teachings accessible through vernacular cultural forms. This article emerges from a decade of translation work and a lifetime of practice in both Buddhist meditation and blues/gospel music.

FAMILIARITY WITH SUBJECT

My expertise in this subject comes from three sources:

1. **Buddhist Practice**: Over forty years of study and practice with the Lotus Sutra, including extensive work with classical translations and commentaries.

2. **Musical Background**: Lifelong engagement with blues and gospel music, both as a listener and performer, giving me deep familiarity with the tradition's philosophical and spiritual dimensions.

3. **Translation Work**: A decade-long project translating the Lotus Sutra into blues language, which revealed the profound philosophical parallels between these traditions.

WRITING SAMPLES

I have not previously published in Buddhist magazines, though I have completed scholarly work on this topic. This article represents my first submission to a popular Buddhist publication, intentionally written in an accessible, personal style that matches Tricycle's editorial voice.

TIMING

The article is complete and ready for review. At 2,250 words, it falls within Tricycle's preferred range. I am flexible on timing and happy to work with your editorial calendar.

Thank you for considering this proposal. I believe this work makes a timely contribution to conversations about diversity in American Buddhism and the universality of dharma teaching.

Sincerely,

William Altig
