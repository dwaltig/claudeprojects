# Publication Monetization Strategy
## Targeting $600-800/Month Through Writing

**Author**: William Altig  
**Date**: December 12, 2025  
**Goal**: Generate $600-$800/month through Buddhist writing and publications

---

## Executive Summary

**Is $600-800/month realistic?** 

**Yes, but it requires a multi-stream approach.** Magazine articles alone won't get you there consistently—the Buddhist publication market is small and competitive. The realistic path combines:

1. **Magazine articles** (irregular: $250-500 per piece)
2. **Newsletter/Substack** (recurring: $350-500/month at 100 subscribers)
3. **ElevenReader royalties** (passive: $50-100/month)
4. **Speaking/workshops** (periodic: $200-500 per gig)

**Timeline to $600-800/month**: 4-6 months of consistent effort

## Part 1: Income Analysis

### Paying Markets for Buddhist Writing

| Publication | Payment | Word Count | Fit for Your Work |
|-------------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Tricycle** | $250-500+ | 500-4,000 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| **Parabola** | $250-400 | 1,500-5,000 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good (mythology focus) |
| **Religion & Ethics** | $200-400 | 1,000-2,000 | ⭐⭐⭐ Possible |
| **Academic journals** | $0 | 6,000-10,000 | ⭐⭐⭐ (builds credibility, no pay) |
| **Lion's Roar** | $0 (mostly) | 1,500-3,000 | ⭐⭐⭐ (exposure only) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Reality Check**: Tricycle is your primary paying market. They pay ~$0.30/word for features. A 2,000-word piece earns ~$600. But they receive hundreds of submissions—expect 20-30% acceptance rate for quality pitches.

## Part 5: Pitch Templates Ready to Use

### Tricycle Query (Diamond Sutra)

```
Subject: Query: The Diamond Sutra in Blues Language

Dear Tricycle Editors,

"Let that go, baby. It ain't what you think it is." This is how emptiness 
(śūnyatā) sounds in the Blues vernacular of the Diamond Sutra.

I'm proposing a 2,000-word feature exploring how the Diamond Sutra's 
teachings on letting go translate naturally into Blues idiom—and why this 
matters for contemporary American practitioners.

I'm an independent scholar whose Blues interpretation of the Lotus Sutra 
is published on ElevenReader, with articles under review at Contemporary 
Buddhism and Buddhist-Christian Studies.

Would this fit your current editorial needs?

Best regards,
William Altig

### Substack Launch Post

```
# Welcome to Blues Dharma

What if the Buddha spoke like B.B. King?

For the past year, I've been translating Buddhist sutras into African-American 
Blues vernacular. Not as parody—as genuine dharma transmission.

The Blues is an epistemology. It's a way of facing suffering directly, 
"fingering the jagged grain" (as Ralph Ellison said), and transforming 
that pain into something that makes you *feel* alive.

That's exactly what Buddhism teaches.

This newsletter explores where the Blues meets the Dharma—through sutra 
translations, cultural analysis, and the occasional song.

Free subscribers get weekly insights.
Paid subscribers get exclusive chapter previews and deep dives.

Let's get free together.
