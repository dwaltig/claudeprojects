Dear Drs. Cattoi and Largen,

I am pleased to submit the attached manuscript, "Singing the Dharma True: Vernacular Interpretation as Rigorous Scholarship," for consideration in Buddhist-Christian Studies.

This article presents a methodology for validating vernacular interpretations of Buddhist sacred texts, using as its primary example a Blues/Gospel English rendering of the Lotus Sutra and Heart Sutra. The article addresses the central question: How do we know when a vernacular interpretation remains faithful to the original teaching?

The contribution is threefold:

1. **Methodological**: I present a three-layer validation process—AI-powered semantic verification, scholarly critique for doctrinal accuracy, and vernacular review for cultural authenticity—that demonstrates rigorous engagement with source texts while enabling creative adaptation.

2. **Comparative Theological**: I argue that African American Blues tradition and Mahayana Buddhist philosophy share a fundamental epistemology of suffering and liberation, drawing on James H. Cone's Black Liberation Theology to establish a "third space" where Buddhist and Christian wisdom converge.

3. **Translation Theoretical**: Building on Eugene Nida's distinction between formal and dynamic equivalence, I argue that vernacular interpretation—when properly validated—constitutes authentic dharma transmission in the lineage of Kumārajīva and Luther.

The manuscript is approximately 6,600 words and has not been submitted elsewhere. I confirm that this is original work and that I am the sole author.

I believe this article falls within Buddhist-Christian Studies' scope of interest in comparative theology, interreligious dialogue, and the intersection of Buddhist and Christian practice in contemporary contexts. The article's engagement with Black Liberation Theology and African American religious traditions offers a perspective that may resonate with your readers.

Thank you for considering this submission. I look forward to your response.

Respectfully submitted,
