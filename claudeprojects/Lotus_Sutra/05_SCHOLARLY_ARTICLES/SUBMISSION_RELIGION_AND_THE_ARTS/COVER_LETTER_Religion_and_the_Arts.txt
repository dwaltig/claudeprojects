Dear Professor Hart,

I am pleased to submit my manuscript, "The Dharma Sings the Blues: A Comprehensive Scholarly Analysis of Vernacular Buddhist Translation through the Lens of African-American Idiom," for consideration in *Religion & the Arts*.

As a journal dedicated to the "creative exploration of the religious dimension of the arts," I believe *Religion & the Arts* is the ideal venue for this work. This article explores the intersection of two distinct artistic and spiritual traditions: the Mahayana literary tradition of the *Lotus Sutra* and the African-American musical tradition of the Blues.

The paper analyzes a groundbreaking vernacular translation project that renders Kumārajīva’s Classical Chinese *Lotus Sutra* into an African-American Blues idiom. By engaging with the translation theories of Eugene Nida and Lawrence Venuti, as well as the aesthetic philosophies of Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray, I argue that the Blues constitutes a sophisticated "epistemology of suffering" that parallels the Buddhist concept of *dukkha*. The article demonstrates how this "Blues translation" functions not merely as a linguistic exercise, but as a form of cultural transcreation that bridges ancient Asian wisdom with the visceral spiritual landscape of the American experience.

This interdisciplinary study contributes to current conversations in translation studies, Buddhist modernism, and the emerging field of Black Buddhism. It challenges the boundaries between "high" liturgical language and "low" vernacular, arguing that the artistic resilience of the Blues offers a valid and powerful vehicle for Dharma transmission.

This article is approximately 5,400 words. It has not been published previously and is not under consideration by any other journal. I have no competing interests to declare.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
