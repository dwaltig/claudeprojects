Dear Editors of *Literature and Theology*,

I am pleased to submit this manuscript, "The Dharma Sings the Blues: A Comprehensive Scholarly Analysis of Vernacular Buddhist Translation through the Lens of the Blues Idiom," for consideration as a Research Article.

This article proposes a novel hermeneutical framework: reading the *Lotus Sutra* through the phenomenological lens of the Blues tradition. Specifically, the article demonstrates how the **Blues spiritual tradition**—with its unique theological handling of suffering ("The Blues") and transcendence ("making it over")—offers a more rigorous soteriological parallel to Mahayana concepts like *dukkha* and *upāya* than standard "Protestantized" English translations.

Engaging in close textual reading, this paper demonstrates how the "Blues Lotus Sutra" operates as a form of "cultural transcreation." It aligns with *Literature and Theology*'s focus on interdisciplinary critique, employing translation theory (Nida, Venuti) and literary criticism (Ellison, Murray) to challenge standard academic demarcations between "sacred text" and "secular music." It posits that the Blues is, structurally and functionally, a form of American Dharma.

The article is approximately 6,000 words, formatted in Chicago Style with footnotes, and has been anonymized for blind review. This is original work and is not under consideration elsewhere.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
