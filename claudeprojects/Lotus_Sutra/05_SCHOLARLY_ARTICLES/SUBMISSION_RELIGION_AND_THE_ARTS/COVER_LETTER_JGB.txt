Dear Editors of the *Journal of Global Buddhism*,

I am pleased to submit "The Dharma Sings the Blues: A Comprehensive Scholarly Analysis of Vernacular Buddhist Translation through the Lens of African-American Idiom" for consideration as a Research Article.

This article examines a unique instantiation of the "globalization of the Dharma": the translation of the *Lotus Sutra* from Classical Chinese into African-American Blues vernacular. Situating this project within the historical lineage of Buddhist transmission—from the *sakāya niruttiyā* (vernacular dialect) injunction to Kumārajīva's Chinese hybridization—the article argues that the Blues functions not merely as a musical form but as a rigorous "indigenous American epistemology" for processing *dukkha*.

By engaging with Eugene Nida's dynamic equivalence and the "Street Dharma" movement, the paper presents a case study in **cultural transcreation** and **upāya** (skillful means). It argues that the adaptation of Buddhism into the Blues idiom represents a vital form of "American Buddhism" that bridges the gap between Asian canonical authority and the visceral reality of the African-American experience.

We believe this aligns perfectly with the *Journal of Global Buddhism*'s mission to explore the transmission, adaptation, and globalization of Buddhist teachings in contemporary contexts.

The manuscript is approximately 6,000 words, formatted in Modified Chicago Author-Date style (using colons for page numbers), and has been anonymized for blind peer review. This is original work and is not under consideration elsewhere.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
