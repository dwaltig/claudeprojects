CHAPTER SIX: BESTOWAL OF PROPHECY

At that time, after the World-Honored One spoke these verses, he addressed the great assembly, proclaiming these words: "This disciple of mine, Mahākāśyapa, in a future age shall be able to make offerings to and behold three hundred myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, World-Honored Ones, serving them with offerings, reverence, honor, and praise. He will extensively proclaim the immeasurable great Dharma of all Buddhas. In his final body, he shall accomplish Buddhahood, with the name Raśmiprabhāsa Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land will be called Raśmiguṇa, and the kalpa will be called Mahāvyūha. The lifespan of that Buddha will be twelve intermediate kalpas. The True Dharma will abide in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas, and the Semblance Dharma will likewise abide for twenty intermediate kalpas. His land will be magnificently adorned, without any defilements or evil things, without tiles, stones, thorns, or brambles, or excrement and impurity. The land will be level and even, without any high or low places, pits, valleys, or mounds. The ground will be of lapis lazuli. Jeweled trees will be arrayed in rows. Golden ropes will border the paths. Scattered precious flowers will be everywhere, all pure and clean. The Bodhisattvas of that land will number immeasurable thousands of koṭis. The assembly of śrāvakas will likewise be immeasurable. There will be no activities of Māra, though Māra and Māra's subjects will be present—all will protect the Buddha-Dharma."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"I announce to the bhikṣus:
With the Buddha-eye
I see this Kāśyapa—
In a future age,

"After immeasurable kalpas,
He shall accomplish Buddhahood.
In ages to come
He will make offerings to and behold

"Three hundred myriads of koṭis
Of Buddhas, World-Honored Ones.
For the sake of Buddha-wisdom,
Purely cultivating the holy practices,

"Having made offerings to the most supreme
Two-Legged Honored Ones,
He will cultivate and learn
All the unsurpassed wisdom.

"In his final body
He shall accomplish Buddhahood.
His land will be pure,
With lapis lazuli for ground.

"Many jeweled trees
Will be arrayed along the paths,
Golden ropes bordering the ways,
Pleasing to all who see them.

"Constantly emitting fine fragrances,
Scattering all kinds of renowned flowers,
Various wondrous things
Serving as adornments.

"The land will be level and even,
Without any hills or pits.
The assembly of Bodhisattvas
Will be incalculable—

"Their minds gentle and compliant,
Having attained great spiritual powers,
Upholding all Buddhas'
Mahāyāna scriptures.

"The assembly of śrāvakas—
Outflow-free, in their final bodies,
Sons of the Dharma King—
Will also be incalculable,

"Such that even with the divine eye
They cannot be counted.
The lifespan of that Buddha
Will be twelve intermediate kalpas.

"The True Dharma abiding in the world
Will be twenty intermediate kalpas.
The Semblance Dharma will likewise abide
For twenty intermediate kalpas.

"Raśmiprabhāsa, the World-Honored One—
Such are his circumstances."

At that time Mahāmaudgalyāyana, Subhūti, Mahākātyāyana, and others all trembled with trepidation. With palms joined as one, they gazed up at the Honored Countenance, their eyes not leaving him for an instant. Together they spoke in unison with these verses:

"Great Hero, Mighty World-Honored One,
King of the Dharma of all the Śākyas,
Out of compassion for us,
Bestow upon us the Buddha's voice!

"If you know our deep minds
And see fit to bestow prophecy upon us,
It will be like sweet-dew being sprinkled,
Removing heat and bringing coolness.

"Like one coming from a famished land
Who suddenly encounters a great king's feast—
The mind still harbors doubt and fear,
Not daring immediately to eat.

"If again one receives the king's command,
Only then does one dare to eat.
We are also like this—
Constantly considering the faults of the Small Vehicle,

"Not knowing how we could
Attain the unsurpassed Buddha-wisdom.
Though we hear the Buddha's voice
Saying 'You shall all become Buddhas,'

"Our minds still harbor anxiety and fear,
Like not yet daring to eat.
If we receive the Buddha's prophecy,
Then we shall be swiftly at peace and happy.

"Great Hero, Mighty World-Honored One,
Who always desires to bring peace to the world,
We pray you bestow prophecy upon us,
Like the famished who need the command to eat!"

At that time the World-Honored One, knowing the thoughts in the minds of all the great disciples, addressed the bhikṣus: "This Subhūti, in a future age, shall make offerings to and behold three hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Buddhas, serving them with offerings, reverence, honor, and praise. He will constantly cultivate the holy practices and perfect the Bodhisattva Way. In his final body, he shall accomplish Buddhahood, with the name Śāstādarśana Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa will be called Ratnasaṃbhava, and the land will be called Ratnasaṃbhava. The land will be level and even, with crystal for ground. Jeweled trees will serve as adornments. There will be no hills, pits, sand, gravel, thorns, brambles, or impurities of excrement. Jeweled flowers will cover the ground, everywhere pure and clean. The people of that land will all dwell on jeweled platforms and wondrous precious pavilions. The śrāvaka disciples will be immeasurable and limitless, such that calculation, analogy, and comparison cannot know their number. The assembly of Bodhisattvas will number immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas. The lifespan of that Buddha will be twelve intermediate kalpas. The True Dharma abiding in the world will be twenty intermediate kalpas, and the Semblance Dharma will likewise abide for twenty intermediate kalpas. That Buddha will constantly dwell in empty space, expounding the Dharma for the assembly, liberating immeasurable Bodhisattvas and the śrāvaka assembly."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"O assembly of bhikṣus,
Now I announce to you—
All should with single mind
Listen to what I expound.

"My great disciple
Subhūti
Shall accomplish Buddhahood,
With the name Śāstādarśana.

"He shall make offerings to countless
Myriads of koṭis of Buddhas,
Following the Buddhas' practices,
Gradually perfecting the Great Way.

"In the final body he will attain
The thirty-two marks,
Upright, beautiful, and wondrous,
Like a jeweled mountain.

"The land of that Buddha
Will be most magnificently pure.
Living beings who see it
Will all love and delight in it.

"The Buddha, within it,
Will liberate immeasurable multitudes.
In that Buddha's Dharma
There will be many Bodhisattvas—

"All of sharp faculties,
Turning the irreversible wheel.
That land will constantly
Be adorned with Bodhisattvas.

"The assembly of śrāvakas
Will be beyond calculation—
All will have attained the three clear knowledges,
Possess the six spiritual powers,

"Abide in the eight liberations,
And possess great spiritual authority.
The exposition of Dharma by that Buddha
Will manifest immeasurable

"Spiritual transformations
Beyond conception.
Devas and human beings,
Numerous as Ganges' sands,

"Will all join their palms
To listen and receive the Buddha's words.
The lifespan of that Buddha
Will be twelve intermediate kalpas.

"The True Dharma abiding in the world
Will be twenty intermediate kalpas.
The Semblance Dharma will likewise abide
For twenty intermediate kalpas."

At that time the World-Honored One again addressed the assembly of bhikṣus: "I now tell you: This Mahākātyāyana, in a future age, will serve and make offerings to eight thousand koṭis of Buddhas with various offering articles, showing reverence and honor. After the extinction of those Buddhas, he will erect stūpas and temples for each—one thousand yojanas in height, five hundred yojanas in length and breadth, perfectly square—all composed of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, carnelian, pearl, and rose quartz, these seven precious materials. With multitudes of flowers, necklaces, paste incenses, powdered incenses, burning incenses, silk canopies, and banners, he will make offerings to the stūpas and temples. After this, he will again make offerings to twenty thousand koṭis of Buddhas, likewise in the same manner."

"After making offerings to these Buddhas, he will perfect the Bodhisattva Way and shall accomplish Buddhahood, with the name Jambūnadābhāsakusumādhipatijñānābhijña Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His land will be level and even, with crystal for ground. Jeweled trees will serve as adornments. Golden ropes will border the paths. Wondrous flowers will cover the ground, everywhere pure and clean—all who see it will rejoice. There will be no four evil destinies: no hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras. There will be many devas, humans, śrāvakas, and Bodhisattvas—immeasurable myriads of koṭis adorning that land. The lifespan of that Buddha will be twelve intermediate kalpas. The True Dharma abiding in the world will be twenty intermediate kalpas, and the Semblance Dharma will likewise abide for twenty intermediate kalpas."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"O assembly of bhikṣus,
All listen with single mind!
As I expound,
Truly without difference.

"This Kātyāyana
Shall, with various
Wondrous and fine offering articles,
Make offerings to all Buddhas.

"After the extinction of all Buddhas,
He will erect stūpas of the seven precious materials,
Also with flowers and incenses
Making offerings to the śarīra.

"In his final body,
He will attain Buddha-wisdom
And accomplish Perfect Enlightenment.
His land will be pure,

"Liberating immeasurable
Myriads of koṭis of living beings,
All receiving offerings
From the ten directions.

"The Buddha's light
Will be unexcelled by any.
That Buddha will be called
Jambūnadābhāsa.

"Bodhisattvas and śrāvakas,
Severing all existence,
Immeasurable and countless,
Will adorn that land."

At that time the World-Honored One again addressed the great assembly: "I now tell you: This Mahāmaudgalyāyana shall, with various offering articles, make offerings to eight thousand Buddhas, showing reverence and honor. After the extinction of those Buddhas, he will erect stūpas and temples for each—one thousand yojanas in height, five hundred yojanas in length and breadth, perfectly square—all composed of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, carnelian, pearl, and rose quartz, these seven precious materials. With multitudes of flowers, necklaces, paste incenses, powdered incenses, burning incenses, silk canopies, and banners, he will use them to make offerings. After this, he will again make offerings to two hundred myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, likewise in the same manner. He shall accomplish Buddhahood, with the name Tamālapatracandanagandhābhijña Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa will be called Prītimaṇḍita, and the land will be called Manoratha. The land will be level and even, with crystal for ground. Jeweled trees will serve as adornments. Scattered pearls and flowers will be everywhere pure and clean—all who see it will rejoice. There will be many devas, humans, Bodhisattvas, and śrāvakas, immeasurable in number. The lifespan of that Buddha will be twenty-four intermediate kalpas. The True Dharma abiding in the world will be forty intermediate kalpas, and the Semblance Dharma will likewise abide for forty intermediate kalpas."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"This disciple of mine,
Mahāmaudgalyāyana,
Having cast off this body,
Shall behold eight thousand

"Two hundred myriads of koṭis
Of Buddhas, World-Honored Ones.
For the sake of the Buddha-Way,
He will serve them with offerings and reverence.

"In the presence of all Buddhas
He will constantly cultivate the holy practices.
Throughout immeasurable kalpas
He will uphold the Buddhas' Dharma.

"After the extinction of those Buddhas,
He will erect stūpas of the seven precious materials,
With tall columns and golden poles,
With flowers, incenses, and music,

"Making offerings thereby
To the stūpas and temples of all Buddhas.
Gradually perfecting
The Bodhisattva Way,

"In the land Manoratha
He shall accomplish Buddhahood,
Named Tamālapatraca
ndana Fragrance.

"The lifespan of that Buddha
Will be twenty-four kalpas.
Constantly for devas and humans
He will expound the Buddha-Way.

"Śrāvakas, immeasurable
As Ganges' sands,
With the three clear knowledges and six powers,
With great spiritual authority—

"Bodhisattvas, countless,
Firm in resolve and vigorous,
Regarding Buddha-wisdom
All irreversible—

"After the Buddha's extinction,
The True Dharma shall abide
For forty intermediate kalpas.
The Semblance Dharma will be likewise.

"My various disciples,
Complete in spiritual authority,
Numbering five hundred,
Shall all receive prophecy.

"In future ages
All shall accomplish Buddhahood.
I and you
Have causes and conditions from former lives—

"I shall now expound this.
Listen well, all of you!"

### Philosophical Implications

The prophecy-bestowal mechanism enacted in Chapter 6 operates as a complex philosophical technology that bridges Buddhist metaphysics with contemporary philosophical concerns in phenomenology, process philosophy, systems theory, and cognitive science. At its foundation lies the principle of recognition as ontological transformation: the Buddha's proclamation does not create Buddha-nature in the disciples but recognizes and manifests what is already present yet latent. This parallels phenomenological insights from Heidegger's concept of Entbergung (unconcealment)—truth as disclosure rather than correspondence. When the Buddha grants prophecy to Mahākāśyapa, he does not impose a future state but reveals the presencing of Buddhahood already operative within the disciple's practice. The disciples' trembling response—their "fear and doubt" giving way to "comfort and joy"—marks the phenomenological shift from abstract knowledge (Buddha-nature as doctrine) to lived recognition (Buddha-nature as experiential reality). This distinction maps precisely onto Husserl's differentiation between empty intention (Leerintention) and fulfilling intuition (erfüllende Anschauung): the disciples possessed the concept of universal Buddhahood but required the Buddha's direct validation to move from conceptual understanding to existential certainty.

From a systems-theory perspective, the chapter instantiates the principle that universal structure manifests through particular nodes while remaining irreducible to any single manifestation. Each disciple receives a distinct prophecy—Mahākāśyapa becomes "Radiant Light" Buddha in the "Radiant Virtue" realm; Subhūti becomes "Renowned by Name" Buddha; Mahākātyāyana becomes "Jambu-Gold-Radiance" Buddha; Mahāmaudgalyāyana becomes "Tamalapatri, Sandalwood-Fragrance" Buddha in the "Joyful Intention" land. These variations are not arbitrary but reflect each disciple's unique karmic history and practice-orientation, demonstrating how the single dharma-body (dharmakāya) differentiates into infinite manifestation-bodies (nirmāṇakāya) without fragmentation. This parallels contemporary network theory's insight that complex systems exhibit both global coherence and local variation: the universal Buddha-nature functions as the underlying attractor state toward which all practitioners evolve, yet each practitioner's trajectory expresses this convergence through unique parameters. The "five hundred disciples" mentioned collectively at chapter's end represent the entire sangha—suggesting that the Buddha-network is complete only when every node's potential is recognized and activated. No single Buddha exhausts Buddhahood; rather, Buddhahood is the totality of all realized potentials across the system.

Process philosophy, particularly Whitehead's metaphysics, provides another illuminating lens for Chapter 6's prophecy mechanism. In Whitehead's system, actual occasions become determinate through the process of concrescence—the growing-together of potentials into actuality through prehension and decision. The Buddha's prophecy functions as what Whitehead terms a "lure for feeling": it presents the disciples with a definite future possibility (their Buddhahood) that exerts causal influence backward onto their present practice by functioning as a teleological attractor. The disciples' practice is no longer aimless accumulation of merit but becomes purposive orientation toward a recognized goal. This transforms karma from mechanical causation to teleological development—not deterministic fate but creative advance toward recognized potential. Significantly, each prophecy specifies not only a future Buddha-name but also the intermediate kalpas of practice, the number of Buddhas to be served, and the characteristics of the future Buddha-land. These specifications are not arbitrary decorations but constitute what Whitehead calls the "subjective form" of the disciples' becoming: the quality and texture of their future enlightenment is already latent in their present practice and is recognized (not created) by the Buddha's proclamation.

The chapter also engages existentialist concerns regarding authenticity, recognition, and the Other. The disciples' "fear and doubt" before receiving prophecy—their comparison of themselves to "one who comes from a land of famine and suddenly encounters the great king's meal" yet "still harbors fear and doubt, not yet daring to take the food"—expresses the existential crisis of self-worth and imposter syndrome that arises when one's deepest potential is suddenly validated. This parallels Sartre's analysis of mauvaise foi (bad faith), wherein one disavows one's own freedom and potential due to the weight of past self-definitions. The disciples have identified themselves as "final arhats," a self-concept that, while honorable, limits their horizon of possibility. The Buddha's prophecy shatters this limited self-concept and thrusts the disciples into the anxiety (Angst) of unlimited potentiality. Yet this is not nihilistic anxiety but creative anxiety—the recognition that one's being is always ahead of itself (Sein-zum-Tode becomes Sein-zum-Buddhahood). The Buddha's validation functions as the Hegelian moment of recognition (Anerkennung): the disciples' Buddha-nature becomes real for them only when recognized by the Other who embodies that nature. This is relational ontology: the self's potentials become actualized through being witnessed and validated in relationship.

Finally, from the perspective of cognitive science and psychology, the prophecy mechanism operates as a profound intervention in self-concept and identity formation. Contemporary research on the "Pygmalion effect" and self-fulfilling prophecy demonstrates that individuals' performance and development are significantly influenced by the expectations communicated to them by authoritative figures. The Buddha's prophecy functions as the ultimate positive expectation: not merely "you can become a Buddha" (conditional possibility) but "you shall become a Buddha" (certain destiny). This shifts the disciples' self-narrative from potential failure (the risk of falling short) to inevitable success (the question is not if but when). Moreover, the detailed specifications—the future Buddha-name, the realm, the assembly—provide what cognitive science terms a "future self-schema": a concrete, imaginable future identity that guides present action. The disciples can now visualize themselves not merely as arhats who cease but as Buddhas who endlessly teach, surrounded by infinite assemblies in jeweled realms. This future vision reorganizes present practice from renunciation-toward-cessation to cultivation-toward-transformation. The chapter thus demonstrates that karma-transformation operates through recognition and validation: beings do not change merely through effort but through having their hidden potential recognized by one who embodies the realized state, thereby activating the latent Buddha-nature already present.

### Apparatus Summary

Primary Theme: The particularization of universal Buddha-nature through individual prophecy-bestowal, demonstrating that doctrinal universality must manifest through personal recognition to transform consciousness. The chapter enacts the principle established in Chapter 5 (the single dharma-rain nourishing all plants according to capacity) by showing how the universal teaching of Buddha-nature becomes efficacious through particular, individualized validation.

Key Figures: Mahākāśyapa (摩訶迦葉)—foremost in ascetic practice, representative of the old teaching's ideal of renunciation; Subhūti (須菩提)—foremost in understanding emptiness (śūnyatā), represents the analytical wing of the sangha; Mahākātyāyana (摩訶迦旃延)—foremost in doctrinal analysis and debate, represents precision teaching; Mahāmaudgalyāyana (摩訶目犍連)—foremost in supernatural powers (ṛddhi), represents compassionate skillful means; Five Hundred Disciples (五百弟子)—symbolic representation of the entire sangha, establishing that prophecy extends universally to all practitioners. These figures collectively span the spectrum of Buddhist practice, demonstrating that all paths—ascetic, analytical, doctrinal, and miraculous—culminate in Buddhahood.

Central Teaching: Prophecy (vyākaraṇa, 授記) is not fortune-telling but ontological recognition: the Buddha's proclamation reveals the already-present Buddha-nature within each disciple and activates its manifestation through validation. The teaching resolves the tension between universal Buddha-potential (all beings possess Buddha-nature) and particular achievement (why are some enlightened and others not?) by showing that potentiality becomes actuality through recognition within relationship. The Buddha's prophecy operates as both descriptive (revealing what is) and performative (activating what is revealed), collapsing the distinction between knowledge and transformation. The chapter establishes that karma-transformation occurs through validation: beings change not merely through individual effort but through having their hidden potential recognized by an authoritative Other, thereby shifting self-concept from limitation to infinite possibility.

Structural Function: Chapter 6 completes the first major arc (Chapters 1-8: "Foundational Arc") by moving from cosmic setup (Chapter 1), through theoretical exposition (Chapters 2-3), to parabolic teaching (Chapters 4-5), culminating here in direct application to the Buddha's immediate disciples. This chapter transitions from universal teaching to particular enactment, establishing the pattern that will dominate Chapters 7-12: exposition followed by prophecy-bestowal followed by celebratory affirmation. Structurally, Chapter 6 serves as the hinge between doctrine and narrative—the abstract principle of universal Buddhahood (Chapters 2-5) now becomes concretely embodied in named disciples with specified futures. The chapter also foreshadows the expansion of Buddha-nature recognition to increasingly marginalized groups: if the great male disciples receive prophecy in Chapter 6, subsequent chapters will extend this recognition to women (Chapter 12: the nāga princess), to the Buddha's antagonist Devadatta (Chapter 12), and ultimately to all beings across the ten directions. Chapter 6 thus initiates the progressive democratization of enlightenment that defines the Lotus Sutra's revolutionary soteriology.
