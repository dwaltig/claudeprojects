# Chapter 15: Emerging from the Earth

*從地湧出品第十五*

At that time, the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas who had come from other lands, exceeding the sands of eight Ganges Rivers in number, arose in the great assembly, pressed their palms together, made obeisance, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, if you permit us, after the Buddha's extinction, in this Sahā world, to diligently and vigorously protect, read, recite, write out, and make offerings to this sutra, we shall broadly expound it in this land." At that time, the Buddha told the assembly of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas: "Stop, good men. There is no need for you to protect this sutra. Why is this? In my Sahā world, there are already bodhisattva-mahāsattvas equal to the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers. Each bodhisattva has a retinue equal to the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers. After my extinction, these persons shall be able to protect, read, recite, and broadly expound this sutra."

When the Buddha spoke these words, throughout the Sahā world's great trichiliocosm, the earth everywhere split open and from within it, immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas simultaneously surged forth. The bodies of these bodhisattvas were all golden-hued, with the thirty-two marks and immeasurable brilliance. Previously they had all been dwelling below this Sahā world, in the empty space beneath this realm. These bodhisattvas, hearing the sound of Śākyamuni Buddha's voice, arose from below. Each bodhisattva was the foremost leader among the great multitude, each leading retinues equal to the sands of sixty thousand Ganges Rivers—not to mention those leading retinues equal to fifty thousand, forty thousand, thirty thousand, twenty thousand, or ten thousand Ganges' sands. Not to mention those leading retinues equal to one Ganges' sands, half a Ganges' sands, one quarter, or even one out of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas. Not to mention those with thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of retinues. Not to mention those with koṭis of myriads of retinues. Not to mention those with thousands of myriads, hundreds of thousands, or even ten thousand. Not to mention those with one thousand, one hundred, or even ten. Not to mention those leading five, four, three, two, or one disciple. Not to mention those alone, delighting in solitary practice. Such as these and more, immeasurable and boundless, beyond what calculations or parables can know.

When these bodhisattvas had emerged from the earth, they each proceeded to the jeweled stūpa in empty space where Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata and Śākyamuni Buddha were. Having arrived, they bowed their heads to the ground, paying homage to the feet of the two World-Honored Ones. They also went to the Buddhas beneath the jeweled trees on lion thrones and likewise made obeisance, circumambulating them three times to the right, pressing their palms together in reverence. With various bodhisattva methods of praise, they offered praise and then stood to one side, joyfully gazing up at the two World-Honored Ones. These bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, from their initial emergence, offered praise to the Buddhas with various bodhisattva methods of praise. The time that passed was fifty minor kalpas. At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha sat in silence, and the fourfold assembly likewise sat in silence for fifty minor kalpas. Through the Buddha's spiritual power, he caused the great assembly to perceive it as if only half a day. At that time, through the Buddha's spiritual power, the fourfold assembly also saw the bodhisattvas filling the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of lands' empty space.

Among this assembly of bodhisattvas were four leaders. The first was named Viśiṣṭacāritra, the second named Anantacāritra, the third named Viśuddhacāritra, and the fourth named Supratiṣṭhitacāritra. These four bodhisattvas were the foremost leaders and teachers among the multitude. Before the great assembly, they each pressed their palms together, gazed upon Śākyamuni Buddha, and inquired, saying: "World-Honored One, are you in good health, with few ailments and few troubles? Do you dwell at ease? Are those who are to be saved receiving your teachings easily? Do they not cause the World-Honored One to become weary and tired?"

At that time, the four great bodhisattvas spoke in verse:

"Is the World-Honored One at ease,
With few ailments and few troubles?
In teaching and converting beings,
Are you without weariness?

"And do the various beings
Receive the teaching easily?
Do they not cause the World-Honored One
To become weary and tired?"

At that time, the World-Honored One, in the midst of the great assembly of bodhisattvas, spoke thus: "Just so, just so, good men. The Tathāgata is at ease, with few ailments and few troubles. The various beings are easy to convert and save, without causing weariness. Why is this? These various beings, life after life since time without beginning, have constantly received my teaching and conversion. They have also revered and honored past Buddhas, planting various wholesome roots. When these various beings first saw my body and heard what I expounded, they all immediately believed and accepted, entering into the Tathāgata's wisdom—except for those who previously cultivated and studied the Lesser Vehicle. Even such persons as these I now also cause to hear this sutra and enter into the Buddha's wisdom." At that time, the various great bodhisattvas spoke in verse:

"Excellent, excellent!
Great Hero, World-Honored One—
The various beings
Are easy to convert and save.

"Able to inquire about
The profoundly deep wisdom of the Buddhas,
Having heard, they believe and practice—
We rejoice along with them."

At that time, the World-Honored One praised the foremost great bodhisattvas: "Excellent, excellent, good men! You are able to rejoice along with the Tathāgata." At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva and the assembly of bodhisattvas numbering as the sands of eight thousand Ganges Rivers all thought thus: "From time immemorial until now, we have never seen or heard of such a great assembly of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas emerging from the earth, standing before the World-Honored One with palms pressed together, making offerings and inquiring after the Tathāgata."

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva, knowing the thoughts in the minds of the bodhisattvas numbering as the sands of eight thousand Ganges Rivers, and also wishing to resolve his own doubts, pressed his palms together toward the Buddha and inquired in verse:

"Immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis—
A great multitude of bodhisattvas
Such as has never before been seen—
We pray the Two-Footed Honored One will explain:

"From where have they come?
For what causes and conditions have they assembled?
With gigantic bodies and great spiritual powers,
Wisdom inconceivable,

"Their resolute wills firm,
Possessing great powers of patient acceptance—
Beings delight in seeing them.
From where have they come?

"Each of these bodhisattvas
Leads retinues
Whose number is immeasurable,
Like Ganges' sands.

"Some great bodhisattvas
Lead retinues of sixty thousand Ganges' sands.
Such great multitudes as these,
Single-mindedly seeking the Buddha-Way.

"These great teachers,
Numbering sixty thousand Ganges' sands,
Have all come to make offerings to the Buddha
And to protect this sutra.

"Those leading fifty thousand Ganges' sands—
Their numbers exceed even these.
Those leading forty thousand, thirty thousand,
Twenty thousand, down to ten thousand,

"One thousand, one hundred, and so on,
Down to one Ganges' sands,
Half, and three-quarters,
One out of myriads of koṭis—

"Thousands of myriads of nayutas,
Myriads of koṭis of disciples,
Down to half a koṭi—
Their numbers further exceed the above.

"From hundreds of thousands down to ten thousand,
One thousand and one hundred,
Fifty and down to ten,
Down to three, two, or one—

"Alone, without retinues,
Delighting in solitary dwelling,
All have come to the Buddha's presence—
Their numbers further exceed the above.

"Of such great multitudes as these,
If a person were to calculate with counting-rods
For kalpas exceeding Ganges' sands,
Still they could not fully know them.

"This great assembly
Of bodhisattvas of majestic virtue and vigor—
Who expounded the Dharma for them,
Teaching and perfecting them?

"Under whom did they first generate the aspiration?
What Buddha-Dharma did they praise?
Whose sutras did they receive and uphold?
What Buddha-Way did they cultivate?

"Such bodhisattvas as these,
With spiritual powers and great wisdom-power—
The earth in the four directions split open
And all surged forth from within.

"World-Honored One, from times past until now,
I have never seen such a thing.
We pray you will explain from where they came—
The name of their land.

"I constantly travel throughout various lands,
Yet never have I seen this assembly.
Among this multitude,
I do not recognize a single person.

"Suddenly they have emerged from the earth—
We pray you will explain the causes and conditions.
In this great assembly now,
Immeasurable hundreds of thousands of koṭis—

"All these bodhisattvas
Wish to know about this matter.
Concerning the original causes and conditions
Of this assembly of bodhisattvas,

"O World-Honored One of immeasurable virtue,
We only pray you will resolve the assembly's doubts."

At that time, the emanation Buddhas of Śākyamuni who had come from immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of other lands were seated in cross-legged posture upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees in the eight directions. The attendants of those Buddhas each saw this great assembly of bodhisattvas emerging from the earth in the four directions of the great trichiliocosm and abiding in empty space. Each addressed their Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, from where has this immeasurable, boundless, asaṃkhyeya great assembly of bodhisattvas come?" At that time, the various Buddhas each told their attendants: "Good men, wait a moment. There is a bodhisattva-mahāsattva named Maitreya, to whom Śākyamuni Buddha has bestowed a prediction that he shall next become a Buddha. He has already inquired about this matter, and the Buddha is now answering him. You should all hear it through this."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva: "Excellent, excellent, Ajita! You are able to inquire of the Buddha about such a great matter. You should all single-mindedly don the armor of vigor and generate firm resolve. The Tathāgata now wishes to display and proclaim the wisdom of the Buddhas, the Buddhas' self-mastered spiritual power, the Buddhas' lion-like vigorous power, and the Buddhas' awesome and mighty power of great authority."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Be vigorous and single-minded—
I wish to expound this matter.
Do not harbor doubts or regrets;
The Buddha's wisdom is inconceivable.

"Now put forth the power of faith,
Abiding in patience and goodness.
The Dharma you have never heard before,
You shall now all be able to hear.

"I now give you comfort;
Do not harbor doubts or fears.
The Buddha speaks no false words;
His wisdom is immeasurable.

"The foremost Dharma he has obtained
Is profoundly deep and difficult to discern.
As it is, I shall now expound it—
All of you, listen with single minds."

When the World-Honored One had spoken this verse, he addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva: "I now proclaim to you and this great assembly: Ajita, these great bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, immeasurable and countless asaṃkhyeyas, who have emerged from the earth and whom you have never seen before—after I attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi in this Sahā world, I taught, converted, guided, and led these bodhisattvas, tamed their minds, and caused them to generate the aspiration for the Way. These bodhisattvas all dwell in the empty space beneath this Sahā world. Regarding the various sutras, they read, recite, penetrate, and comprehend them, contemplate and discriminate them, and correctly keep them in mind. Ajita, these good men do not delight in dwelling among multitudes or in speaking much. They constantly delight in quiet places, diligently practicing with vigor, never resting. Nor do they abide relying upon humans or devas. They constantly delight in profound wisdom, without any obstructions. They also constantly delight in the Dharmas of all Buddhas, single-mindedly and vigorously seeking the unsurpassed wisdom."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Ajita, you should know:
These great bodhisattvas,
From immeasurable kalpas past,
Have cultivated the Buddha's wisdom.

"They are all those I have converted,
Causing them to generate the aspiration for the great Way.
These are my sons,
Relying upon and abiding in this world.

"They constantly practice dhūta austerities,
Delighting in quiet places,
Abandoning the clamor of great multitudes,
Not delighting in much speaking.

"Sons such as these
Study and practice my Way and Dharma,
Day and night constantly vigorous,
For the sake of seeking the Buddha-Way.

"They dwell in the empty space
Below the Sahā world.
Firm in will and mindfulness-power,
They constantly, diligently seek wisdom,

"Expounding various wondrous dharmas,
Their minds without any fear.
At Gayā city,
Seated beneath the bodhi tree,

"I achieved perfect enlightenment
And turned the unsurpassed Dharma-wheel.
Then I taught and converted them,
Causing them first to generate the aspiration for the Way.

"Now they all abide in non-retrogression;
All shall achieve Buddhahood.
I now speak true words—
All of you, believe with single minds:

"From the long and distant past,
I have taught and converted this multitude."

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva and the immeasurable assembly of bodhisattvas gave rise to doubt in their minds—a strange and unprecedented occurrence—and they thought thus: "How could the World-Honored One in such a short time have taught and converted such an immeasurable, boundless, asaṃkhyeya great assembly of bodhisattvas, causing them to abide in anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi?" They immediately addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, when the Tathāgata was a crown prince, he departed from the Śākya palace. Not far from Gayā city, he sat at the place of the Way and attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. From that time until now, only slightly more than forty years have passed. World-Honored One, how, in this short time, could you have accomplished such great Buddha-work? Through the Buddha's power and the Buddha's merit, how could you have taught and converted such an immeasurable great assembly of bodhisattvas to attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi?"

"World-Honored One, this great assembly of bodhisattvas—even if a person were to count them for thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas, they could not exhaust their number or reach their limit. These have, from the distant past, planted wholesome roots in the presence of immeasurable, boundless Buddhas, perfected the bodhisattva path, and constantly cultivated pure conduct. World-Honored One, such matters as these are difficult for the world to believe. It is as if there were a person, youthful in appearance with black hair, twenty-five years of age, who pointed to a hundred-year-old person and said, 'This is my son.' And the hundred-year-old person also pointed to the youth and said, 'This is my father who gave birth to and raised me.' Such a matter would be difficult to believe."

"The Buddha is also like this. Having attained the Way, in truth it has not been long. Yet this great assembly of bodhisattvas have, for immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas, for the sake of the Buddha-Way, diligently practiced with vigor, skillfully entering, emerging from, and abiding in immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of samādhis, attaining great spiritual powers, cultivating pure conduct for a long time, skillfully and in proper sequence practicing various wholesome dharmas, skillful in questions and answers—precious among people, extremely rare in all the world. Today the World-Honored One merely says that when he attained the Buddha-Way, he first caused them to generate the aspiration, taught, converted, guided, and directed them toward anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. The World-Honored One attained Buddhahood not long ago, yet he has been able to accomplish such great meritorious works. Though we believe that what the Buddha says accords with circumstances and that the words spoken by the Buddha are never false, and that the Buddha's knowledge penetrates all—nevertheless, newly-aspiring bodhisattvas, after the Buddha's extinction, if they hear such words, perhaps will not believe or accept them and shall thereby generate the karmic causes and conditions for breaking the Dharma. Therefore, World-Honored One, we pray you will explain and remove our doubts. And in future ages, when good men hear of this matter, they also shall not generate doubts."

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"In the past, the Buddha departed from the Śākya clan,
Left home near Gayā,
And sat beneath the bodhi tree—
From then until now, not long ago.

"These sons of the Buddha,
Whose number is immeasurable,
Have long practiced the Buddha-Way,
Abiding in spiritual powers.

"They have skillfully studied the bodhisattva path,
Unstained by worldly dharmas,
Like lotuses in water.
They have emerged from the earth,

"All generating minds of reverence,
Standing before the World-Honored One.
Such matters are difficult to conceive—
How can they be believed?

"The Buddha attained the Way very recently,
Yet his accomplishments are very many.
We pray you will remove the assembly's doubts
And explain according to reality.

"Suppose there were a youthful person,
Just twenty-five years of age,
Who pointed to a hundred-year-old child,
With white hair and wrinkled face,

"Saying: 'These are born of me.'
And the child also said: 'This is my father.'
Father young and child old—
This is not believed by the whole world.

"The World-Honored One is also like this—
He attained the Way very recently.
Yet these bodhisattvas,
Firm in will, without timidity,

"From immeasurable kalpas past
Have practiced the bodhisattva path,
Skillful in difficult questions and answers,
Their minds without any fear.

"Patient and accepting, minds determined,
Upright, possessed of awesome virtue,
Praised by Buddhas of the ten directions,
Able to discriminate skillfully in expounding.

"Not delighting in dwelling among people,
Always preferring meditative concentration,
For the sake of seeking the Buddha-Way,
They dwell in the empty space below.

"We, hearing from the Buddha,
Have no doubts about this matter.
We pray the Buddha, for the sake of the future,
Will expound so they may understand.

"If there are those who, regarding this sutra,
Generate doubts and do not believe,
They shall immediately fall into evil paths.
We pray you will now explain:

"These immeasurable bodhisattvas—
How, in such a short time,
Were they taught and converted, causing them to generate the aspiration
And abide on the stage of non-retrogression?"
