# Chapter 9: Prediction for Those Learning and Beyond

*授學無學人記品第九*

At that time Ānanda and Rāhula had this thought: "We often reflected to ourselves: if we could receive predictions, would this not also be most gratifying!" Immediately they arose from their seats, proceeded to the Buddha's presence, bowed their heads at his feet, and together addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, regarding this we also should have a share. There is only the Tathāgata to whom we belong and take refuge. Moreover, we are recognized and known by all in the world—devas, humans, and asuras. Ānanda has constantly served as attendant, guarding and maintaining the Dharma-treasury. Rāhula is the Buddha's son. If the Buddha would bestow upon us the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, our vows would be fulfilled and the expectations of the multitude would also be satisfied."

At that time the two thousand śrāvaka disciples—those learning and those beyond learning—all arose from their seats, bared their right shoulders, proceeded to the Buddha's presence, single-mindedly joined their palms, and gazed up at the World-Honored One. Like Ānanda and Rāhula, they cherished the same wish, and stood to one side. At that time the Buddha addressed Ānanda: "In a future age you shall attain Buddhahood with the name Sāgaravaradhara-buddhi-vikrīḍitābhijña Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna, Sugata, Lokavid, Anuttara, Puruṣa-damya-sārathi, Śāstā-deva-manuṣyāṇāṃ, Buddha, Bhagavat. You shall make offerings to sixty-two koṭis of Buddhas, guard and maintain the Dharma-treasury, and afterward attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. You shall teach and transform twenty thousand myriads of koṭis of Ganges' sands of Bodhisattvas, causing them to accomplish anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Your land shall be named Sadāparibhūta-patadraja-pratyutthita. That land shall be pure, with lapis lazuli for its ground. The kalpa shall be named Manojñasvara-ghoṣa-abhigarjita. That Buddha's lifespan shall be immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya kalpas. If a person, through thousands of myriads of koṭis of immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, were to calculate and reckon, he could not come to know it. The True Dharma shall abide in the world for twice that lifespan. The Semblance Dharma shall abide in the world for twice the True Dharma. Ānanda, this Sāgaravaradhara-buddhi-vikrīḍitābhijña Buddha shall be jointly praised by immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of Ganges' sands and more of Buddhas, Tathāgatas throughout the ten directions, who shall proclaim his meritorious virtues."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"I now proclaim in the midst of the saṅgha:
Ānanda, the upholder of the Dharma,
Shall make offerings to all Buddhas,
And afterward accomplish perfect enlightenment.

"His name shall be Sāgaravaradhara-buddhi
Vikrīḍitābhijña Buddha.
His land shall be pure,
Named Sadāparibhūta-patadraja-pratyutthita.

"He shall teach and transform Bodhisattvas
In number like Ganges' sands.
The Buddha shall possess great majesty and virtue;
His fame shall fill the ten directions.

"His lifespan shall be without measure,
Through compassion for living beings.
The True Dharma shall be twice his lifespan;
The Semblance Dharma shall again be twice that.

"Living beings equal to Ganges' sands,
Immeasurable in number,
Within this Buddha's Dharma
Shall plant causes and conditions for the Buddha-Way."

At that time the eight thousand newly-aspiring Bodhisattvas in the assembly all had this thought: "We have not even heard of the great Bodhisattvas receiving such predictions. For what causes and conditions have these śrāvakas received such predictions?"

At that time the World-Honored One, knowing the thoughts in the minds of those Bodhisattvas, addressed them, saying: "Good sons, Ānanda and I, in the presence of the Buddha Bhīṣmagarjita-svara-rāja, at the same time aroused the mind of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Ānanda constantly delighted in much learning; I constantly applied vigorous energy. Therefore I have already accomplished anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, while Ānanda guards and maintains my Dharma, and also guards and maintains the Dharma-treasury of Buddhas yet to come, teaching, transforming, and perfecting the multitudes of Bodhisattvas. Such was his original vow, and therefore he has obtained this prediction."

When Ānanda, before the Buddha, personally heard his prediction and the adornments of his land, his vows were completely fulfilled. His mind was greatly joyful; he attained what he had never before attained. Immediately he recalled the Dharma-treasuries of past immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, penetrating them without obstruction, as if what he now heard. He also recognized his original vow. At that time Ānanda spoke in verse:

"The World-Honored One is exceedingly rare,
Causing me to recall the past,
The Dharma of immeasurable Buddhas,
As if what I hear today.

"I now have no further doubts,
Peacefully abiding in the Buddha-Way—
Expediently serving as attendant,
Guarding and maintaining the Dharma of all Buddhas."

At that time the Buddha addressed Rāhula: "In a future age you shall attain Buddhahood with the name Saptaratnapadmavikrānta-gāmin Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna, Sugata, Lokavid, Anuttara, Puruṣa-damya-sārathi, Śāstā-deva-manuṣyāṇāṃ, Buddha, Bhagavat. You shall make offerings to Buddhas, Tathāgatas equal in number to the atoms of ten world-systems, constantly being the eldest son of those Buddhas, just as you are now. The adornments of the land of this Saptaratnapadmavikrānta-gāmin Buddha, the number of kalpas in his lifespan, the disciples he transforms, the True Dharma, and the Semblance Dharma shall also be no different from those of Sāgaravaradhara-buddhi-vikrīḍitābhijña Tathāgata. He shall also be the eldest son of that Buddha. After this has passed, he shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"When I was crown prince,
Rāhula was my eldest son.
Now I have accomplished the Buddha-Way;
He receives the Dharma as a Dharma-son.

"In a future age,
He shall see immeasurable koṭis of Buddhas,
Being the eldest son of them all,
Single-mindedly seeking the Buddha-Way.

"Rāhula's secret practice—
Only I am able to know it.
He manifests as my eldest son,
Showing this to living beings.

"Immeasurable koṭis, thousands, and myriads
Of merits beyond calculation—
He peacefully abides in the Buddha's Dharma,
Seeking the supreme Way."

At that time the World-Honored One, seeing the two thousand—those learning and those beyond learning—whose minds were gentle and soft, tranquil and pure, single-mindedly gazing at the Buddha, addressed Ānanda: "Do you see these two thousand—those learning and those beyond learning?" "Yes, I have already seen them." "Ānanda, these persons shall make offerings to Buddhas, Tathāgatas equal in number to the atoms of fifty world-systems, revering and honoring them, guarding and maintaining the Dharma-treasury. Ultimately, at the same time, throughout the lands of the ten directions, they shall each accomplish Buddhahood, all sharing the same name: Ratnacandrābha Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Vidyācaraṇa-saṃpanna, Sugata, Lokavid, Anuttara, Puruṣa-damya-sārathi, Śāstā-deva-manuṣyāṇāṃ, Buddha, Bhagavat. Their lifespans shall be one kalpa. The adornments of their lands, the śrāvakas and Bodhisattvas, the True Dharma and Semblance Dharma—all shall be completely equal."

At that time the World-Honored One, restating this meaning, spoke in verse:

"These two thousand śrāvakas
Now standing before me—
To all of them I bestow predictions:
In the future they shall become Buddhas.

"The Buddhas to whom they make offerings,
As described above in number of atoms,
After guarding and maintaining those Dharma-treasuries,
Afterward they shall accomplish perfect enlightenment.

"Each throughout the lands of the ten directions,
All sharing the same name,
Simultaneously sitting in the places of enlightenment,
Realizing the supreme wisdom—

"All being named Ratnacandrābha.
Their lands and disciples,
The True Dharma and Semblance Dharma,
All equal without difference.

"All through various spiritual powers
Liberating beings throughout the ten directions,
Their fame universally pervading everywhere,
Gradually entering nirvāṇa."

At that time the two thousand—those learning and those beyond learning—hearing the Buddha bestow predictions, were joyful and exultant, and spoke in verse:

"World-Honored One, lamp of wisdom bright—
We have heard the sound of the bestowal of predictions;
Our minds are filled with joy,
As if sprinkled with sweet dew."
