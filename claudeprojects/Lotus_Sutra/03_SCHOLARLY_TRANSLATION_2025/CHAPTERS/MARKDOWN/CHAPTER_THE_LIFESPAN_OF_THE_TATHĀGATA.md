# Chapter 16: The Lifespan of the Tathāgata

*如來壽量品第十六*

At that time, the Buddha addressed the bodhisattvas and the entire great assembly: "Good men, you should believe and understand the Tathāgata's true and honest words." Again he addressed the great assembly: "You should believe and understand the Tathāgata's true and honest words." And again he addressed the various great assemblies: "You should believe and understand the Tathāgata's true and honest words." At that time, the great assembly of bodhisattvas, with Maitreya as their head, pressed their palms together and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we only pray you will expound. We shall believe and accept the Buddha's words." Having thus spoken three times, they again said: "We only pray you will expound. We shall believe and accept the Buddha's words."

At that time, the World-Honored One, knowing that the bodhisattvas' three requests would not cease, addressed them, saying: "All of you, listen carefully to the Tathāgata's secret spiritual powers. All the worlds—devas, humans, and asuras—all say that the present Śākyamuni Buddha departed from the Śākya palace, and not far from Gayā city, sat at the place of the Way and attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. However, good men, in truth, since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kalpas."

"Suppose there were a person who ground into dust five hundred thousand myriad koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeyas of great trichiliocosms. Passing eastward through five hundred thousand myriad koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeya lands, he deposits one mote of dust. Proceeding eastward in this way until all the dust-motes are exhausted. Good men, what is your opinion? Can these worlds be conceived of, calculated, and their number known?"

Maitreya Bodhisattva and the others all addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, these worlds are immeasurable and boundless, beyond what calculations can know or the power of mind can reach. All śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, with their undefiled wisdom, cannot conceive of or know their numerical limit. Though we abide on the stage of avaivartika, regarding this matter we also cannot comprehend it. World-Honored One, such worlds as these are immeasurable and boundless."

At that time, the Buddha addressed the great assembly of bodhisattvas: "Good men, I shall now clearly proclaim to you: All these worlds, whether or not they received a dust-mote—take them all and reduce them to dust. One dust-mote equals one kalpa. Since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been more than this by hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeya kalpas. From that time onward, I have constantly been in this Sahā world expounding the Dharma and teaching. Also in other places, in hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeya lands, I have guided and benefited beings."

"Good men, during this intermediate period, I have spoken of Dīpaṅkara Buddha and others, and moreover said that they entered nirvāṇa. All this was discriminated through expedient means. Good men, when beings come to me, with the Buddha-eye I observe whether their faith and other faculties are sharp or dull. According to what is appropriate for their salvation, I declare in various places my name to be different, my age to be greater or smaller, and also indicate that I shall enter nirvāṇa. Moreover, through various expedient means, I expound the subtle and wondrous Dharma, able to cause beings to generate joyful minds. Good men, when the Tathāgata sees beings who delight in lesser dharmas, who possess scant virtue and heavy defilement, for such persons I say that when young I left home and attained anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. However, in truth, since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been as long and distant as this. But through expedient means, I teach and convert beings, causing them to enter the Buddha-Way, and thus I speak."

"Good men, the sutras expounded by the Tathāgata are all for the sake of saving and liberating beings. Whether speaking of my own body or others' bodies, whether revealing my own body or others' bodies, whether revealing my own affairs or others' affairs—all that is said is true and not false. Why is this? The Tathāgata knows and sees the marks of the triple realm according to reality. There is no birth or death, no retreating or emerging. There is neither existence in the world nor extinction. Neither real nor unreal, neither thus nor otherwise. Not as the triple realm sees the triple realm. In such matters as these, the Tathāgata sees clearly without error or delusion. Because beings have various natures, various desires, various conduct, and various thoughts and discriminations, wishing to cause them to generate wholesome roots, through various causes and conditions, parables, words, and phrases, and various expounding of the Dharma, the Buddha-work I perform has never ceased for even a moment. Thus, since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been extremely long and distant. My lifespan is immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas, constantly abiding and never extinguished."

"Good men, the lifespan I originally achieved through practicing the bodhisattva path has not yet been exhausted and is still double the above number. However, though now I do not truly enter extinction, I nevertheless proclaim that I shall enter extinction. The Tathāgata uses this expedient means to teach and convert beings. Why is this? If the Buddha abides in the world for a long time, persons of scant virtue will not plant wholesome roots. Poor, lowly, and greedy for and attached to the five desires, they shall enter into the nets of false thoughts and inverted views. If they see that the Tathāgata constantly abides without extinction, they shall become arrogant, self-indulgent, weary, and lazy, unable to generate thoughts of difficulty in encountering him or minds of reverence. Therefore, the Tathāgata uses expedient means to speak, saying: 'Bhikṣus, you should know that encountering the emergence of Buddhas in the world is difficult.' Why is this? Throughout immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas, persons of scant virtue may see a Buddha, or may not. For this reason, I speak thus: 'Bhikṣus, the Tathāgata is difficult to encounter and see.' When these beings hear such words, they shall certainly generate thoughts of the difficulty of encountering, their minds harboring longing and thirst for the Buddha. They shall then plant wholesome roots. Therefore, though the Tathāgata does not truly enter extinction, he speaks of entering extinction."

"Moreover, good men, the Dharmas of all Buddhas and Tathāgatas are all thus—for the sake of saving beings, all are true and not false. Suppose there were a skilled physician, wise and intelligent, thoroughly versed in medicinal formulas, skillful in curing all illnesses. This person has many sons—perhaps ten, twenty, or even a hundred. Due to certain matters, he travels afar to another land. After his departure, his sons drink other people's poison. When the poison takes effect, they writhe in confusion and agony upon the ground. At that time, their father returns home. Among the sons who have drunk the poison, some have lost their original minds, while others have not. Seeing their father from afar, they all greatly rejoice, kneel down, bow, and inquire: 'How excellent that you have returned safely! We were foolish and mistakenly took poison. We pray you will save and heal us, restoring our lifespans.' The father, seeing his sons suffering thus, according to various medical texts seeks fine medicinal herbs, perfect in color, fragrance, and flavor, grinds, sifts, and mixes them together, and gives them to his sons to take, speaking these words: 'This great fine medicine possesses perfect color, fragrance, and flavor. All of you should take it. It shall swiftly remove your suffering and troubles, and you shall have no further afflictions.'"

"Among those sons who have not lost their minds, seeing this fine medicine with its perfect color and fragrance, they immediately take it and are completely cured and healed. The others who have lost their minds, though they also rejoice upon seeing their father and inquire after him, seeking healing for their illness, when they are given the medicine they refuse to take it. Why is this? The poison has deeply entered, causing them to lose their original minds. Regarding this medicine of fine color and fragrance, they consider it unpleasant. The father thinks: 'These sons are pitiable. Poisoned and confused, their minds are all inverted. Though they rejoice upon seeing me and seek salvation and healing, they refuse to take such fine medicine. I should now employ expedient means to cause them to take this medicine.' He immediately speaks these words: 'You should know that I am now aged and decrepit. The time of my death has arrived. This fine medicine I now leave here. You may take it—do not worry that it will not cure you.' Having given these instructions, he again departs to another land and sends a messenger back to announce: 'Your father has died.' At that time, the sons, hearing that their father had died and they were orphaned, feel great sorrow and distress and think thus: 'If our father were alive, he would pity us and be able to save and protect us. Now he has abandoned us and died far away in another land.' They consider themselves solitary and bereft, without anyone to rely upon. Constantly harboring grief and sorrow, their minds finally awaken and they realize that this medicine possesses excellent color, flavor, and fragrance. They immediately take it, and the poison and illness are all cured. Their father, hearing that his sons have all recovered, soon returns home so that all may see him."

"Good men, what is your opinion? Could anyone say that this skilled physician committed the offense of falsehood?" "No, World-Honored One." The Buddha said: "I am also like this. Since I achieved Buddhahood, it has been immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of asaṃkhyeya kalpas. For the sake of beings, through the power of expedient means, I say that I shall enter extinction. Yet there is no one who could, according to the Dharma, speak of me as committing the offense of falsehood."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"Since I attained Buddhahood,
The number of kalpas that have passed
Is immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads
Of koṭis and asaṃkhyeyas.

"I have constantly expounded the Dharma and taught
Immeasurable koṭis of beings,
Causing them to enter the Buddha-Way.
Since then, immeasurable kalpas have passed.

"For the sake of saving beings,
I skillfully manifest nirvāṇa,
Yet in truth I do not become extinct—
I constantly abide here expounding the Dharma.

"I constantly abide here,
Through various spiritual powers
Causing inverted beings,
Though near, not to see me.

"The multitudes, seeing my extinction,
Broadly make offerings to my relics.
All harbor longing and thirst,
Generating minds of yearning.

"When beings have become faithful and compliant,
Upright and gentle in intent,
Single-mindedly wishing to see the Buddha,
Not sparing their own bodies or lives,

"At that time, I and the assembly of monks
All appear on Vulture Peak Mountain.
I then tell the beings
That I constantly abide here without extinction,

"Through the power of expedient means,
I manifest extinction and non-extinction.
In other lands there are beings
Who are reverent, faithful, and joyful—

"Among them also
I expound the unsurpassed Dharma.
You do not hear of this
And merely think that I have entered extinction.

"I see the various beings
Drowning in suffering and trouble.
Therefore I do not manifest my body,
Causing them to generate thirst and yearning.

"When their minds harbor longing and thirst,
I then emerge to expound the Dharma.
My spiritual power is like this:
Throughout asaṃkhyeya kalpas,

"I constantly abide on Vulture Peak Mountain
And in various other dwelling places.
When beings see the kalpa ending,
The great fire burning all,

"My land is peaceful and secure,
Constantly filled with devas and humans.
Gardens, groves, halls, and pavilions,
Adorned with various jewels,

"Jeweled trees full of flowers and fruits—
Beings sport and enjoy themselves there.
The devas strike celestial drums,
Constantly making various kinds of music,

"Raining māndārava flowers,
Scattering them upon the Buddha and the great assembly.
My Pure Land is not destroyed,
Yet the multitudes see it burned to exhaustion,

"Filled with worry, fear,
And various sufferings and troubles.
These various sinful beings,
Through evil karmic causes and conditions,

"Pass asaṃkhyeya kalpas
Without hearing the name of the Three Jewels.
All those who cultivate merit and virtue,
Who are gentle, upright, and honest,

"All see my body
Abiding here expounding the Dharma.
At times, for this multitude,
I expound that the Buddha's lifespan is immeasurable.

"For those who see the Buddha only after a long time,
I explain that encountering the Buddha is difficult.
My wisdom-power is like this—
The light of my wisdom illuminates immeasurably.

"My lifespan is immeasurable kalpas,
Obtained through long cultivation of karma.
You who possess wisdom,
Do not generate doubts about this.

"You should cause them to be forever exhausted—
The Buddha's words are true and not false.
Like a physician using skillful expedients,
To cure his deranged sons,

"Though truly alive, he speaks of death—
None can speak of him as false.
I am also the father of the world,
Saving those with various sufferings and troubles.

"Because ordinary beings are inverted,
Though truly present, I speak of extinction.
Because they constantly see me,
They generate arrogant and self-indulgent minds,

"Unrestrained, attached to the five desires,
They fall into evil paths.
I constantly know all beings—
Whether they practice the Way or not.

"According to what is appropriate for their salvation,
I expound various dharmas for them.
Each time, I think thus:
'How can I cause beings

"'To enter the unsurpassed wisdom
And swiftly achieve the Buddha-body?'"
