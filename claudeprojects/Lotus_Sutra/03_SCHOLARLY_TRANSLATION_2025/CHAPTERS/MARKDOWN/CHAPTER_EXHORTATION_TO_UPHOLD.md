# Chapter 13: Exhortation to Uphold

*勸持品第十三*

At that time, Medicine King Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva and Mahāpratibhāna Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva, together with twenty thousand bodhisattvas as their retinue, all made this vow before the Buddha: "We only pray that the World-Honored One will not be troubled. After the Buddha's extinction, we shall receive, uphold, read, recite, and expound this sutra. In the future evil age, beings' wholesome roots shall diminish and many shall increase in arrogance, coveting offerings and increasing unwholesome roots, becoming far removed from liberation. Though they shall be difficult to teach and convert, we shall summon up great powers of patient acceptance to read, recite, uphold, expound, write, and make various offerings to this sutra, not sparing body or life."

At that time, the five hundred arhats in the assembly who had received predictions addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we also make this vow ourselves: we shall broadly expound this sutra in other lands." Again, there were eight thousand learning and post-learning persons who had received predictions. They arose from their seats, pressed their palms together toward the Buddha, and made this vow: "World-Honored One, we also shall broadly expound this sutra in other lands. Why is this? In this Sahā land, people are many, evil, and corrupt, harboring arrogance. Their merit is shallow and slight. They are wrathful, turbid, flattering, and crooked, their minds insincere."

At that time, the Buddha's maternal aunt, Mahāprajāpatī Bhikṣuṇī, together with six thousand learning and post-learning bhikṣuṇīs, arose from their seats, single-mindedly pressed their palms together, gazed up at the Honored Countenance, and their eyes did not leave him for an instant. At that time, the World-Honored One addressed Gautamī: "Why do you gaze at the Tathāgata with a troubled expression? Does your mind perhaps think that I have not spoken your name and bestowed upon you the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi?"

"Gautamī, previously when I spoke in general that all śrāvakas have already received predictions, if now you wish to know your prediction: in the future age, you shall become a great Dharma teacher among the Dharma teachings of sixty-eight thousand koṭis of Buddhas, and the six thousand learning and post-learning bhikṣuṇīs shall also be Dharma teachers. Thus shall you gradually perfect the bodhisattva path. You shall attain Buddhahood with the name Sarvasattvapriyadarśana Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Humans, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. Gautamī, this Sarvasattvapriyadarśana Buddha and the six thousand bodhisattvas shall in turn receive predictions and attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

At that time, Yaśodharā Bhikṣuṇī, the mother of Rāhula, thought thus: "The World-Honored One in bestowing predictions has alone not spoken my name." The Buddha addressed Yaśodharā: "In a future age, among the Dharma teachings of hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, you shall cultivate the bodhisattva practices and be a great Dharma teacher, gradually perfecting the Buddha-Way. In the good land you shall attain Buddhahood with the name Raśmiśatasahasraparipūrṇadhvaja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Humans, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The Buddha's lifespan shall be immeasurable asaṃkhyeya kalpas."

At that time, Mahāprajāpatī Bhikṣuṇī and Yaśodharā Bhikṣuṇī, together with their retinues, all rejoiced greatly, having gained what they had never had before. Immediately before the Buddha they spoke in verse:

"World-Honored One, our guide,
Who brings peace to devas and humans—
We, hearing this prediction,
Have peace of mind and complete fulfillment."

When the bhikṣuṇīs had spoken this verse, they addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we also are able to broadly proclaim this sutra in other lands." At that time, the World-Honored One gazed upon the eighty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas. These bodhisattvas were all avaivartika, who turn the irreversible Dharma-wheel and who had attained the various dhāraṇīs. They immediately arose from their seats, approached the Buddha, single-mindedly pressed their palms together, and thought thus: "If the World-Honored One commands us to uphold and expound this sutra, we shall do as the Buddha teaches and broadly proclaim this Dharma." They thought again: "The Buddha now remains silent and does not command us. What should we do?"

At that time, these bodhisattvas, reverently following the Buddha's intention and also wishing to fulfill their original vows, made a lion's roar before the Buddha and uttered this vow: "World-Honored One, after the Tathāgata's extinction, we shall travel back and forth throughout the worlds of the ten directions, enabling beings to write out this sutra, receive, uphold, read, recite it, explain its meaning, practice according to the Dharma, and maintain correct mindfulness—all through the Buddha's awesome power. We only pray that the World-Honored One, abiding in other regions, will watch over and protect us from afar." At that moment, the bodhisattvas all raised their voices in unison and spoke in verse:

"We only pray that you will not be troubled.
After the Buddha's extinction,
In the frightful and evil age,
We shall broadly proclaim.

"There shall be ignorant people
Who speak evil words of abuse
And who threaten us with swords and staves—
All these we shall patiently endure.

"In the evil age, bhikṣus
Of deviant wisdom, with minds flattering and crooked,
Who have not attained yet claim attainment,
Their minds filled with arrogance—

"Or forest-dwelling hermits
Wearing ragged robes in secluded places,
Claiming to practice the true Way
While despising those in the world—

"Greedy for gain and offerings,
They expound the Dharma to the white-robed
And are revered by the world
As though they were six-powered arhats.

"These persons harbor evil minds,
Always thinking worldly thoughts.
Borrowing the name of forest-dwellers,
They delight in proclaiming our faults,

"Speaking words such as these:
'These bhikṣus,
For the sake of greed for gain and offerings,
Expound the doctrines of non-Buddhists

"'And themselves compose these sutras
To delude the people of the world.
Seeking fame and renown,
They discriminatingly expound this sutra.'

"Always amidst great assemblies,
Wishing to defame us,
Before kings and great ministers,
Brahmins and householders,

"And other assemblies of bhikṣus,
They slander and speak evil of us,
Saying we are persons of deviant views
Who expound the doctrines of non-Buddhists.

"Out of reverence for the Buddha,
We shall patiently endure all these evils.
Those who speak contemptuously, saying:
'You are all Buddhas'—

"Such words of contempt
We shall all patiently accept.
In the turbid kalpa and evil age,
There shall be many things to fear.

"Evil spirits shall enter their bodies,
Reviling and defaming us.
We, revering and believing in the Buddha,
Shall don the armor of patient acceptance.

"For the sake of expounding this sutra,
We shall endure these difficulties.
We love not body or life,
But cherish only the unsurpassed Way.

"We, in the future age,
Shall protect what the Buddha has entrusted.
The World-Honored One himself should know:
The evil bhikṣus of the turbid world

"Know not the Buddha's expedient means,
The Dharma expounded according to circumstances.
With evil words and frowning faces,
They shall repeatedly expel us,

"Banishing us far from stūpas and monasteries.
All such various evils,
Mindful of the Buddha's commands,
We shall patiently endure all these things.

"In various villages and cities,
Should there be those seeking the Dharma,
We shall go to wherever they are
And expound the Dharma the Buddha has entrusted.

"We are the World-Honored One's emissaries,
Dwelling among assemblies without fear.
We shall skillfully expound the Dharma—
May the Buddha abide in peace.

"Before the World-Honored One
And the Buddhas who have come from the ten directions,
We make such vows as these—
The Buddha himself knows our minds."
