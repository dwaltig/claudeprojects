# Chapter 19: The Merits of the Dharma Teacher

*法師功德品第十九*


At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ever Diligent, saying: "If a good man or good woman receives and upholds this Lotus Sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, that person shall obtain eight hundred merits of the eye faculty, twelve hundred merits of the ear faculty, eight hundred merits of the nose faculty, twelve hundred merits of the tongue faculty, eight hundred merits of the body faculty, and twelve hundred merits of the mind faculty. Through these merits, the six sense faculties shall be adorned and made perfectly pure. This good man or good woman, with the pure physical eyes received from their parents, shall see throughout the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds—all the mountains, forests, rivers, and seas, both within and without. From the Avīci Hell below to the Summit of Existence above, they shall also see all sentient beings therein, as well as their karmic causes and conditions, their karmic recompense, and the places of their rebirth. All this they shall see and all this they shall know."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If one in the great assembly,
With a mind free from fear,
Expounds this Lotus Sutra—
Hear now of such merits.

That person obtains eight hundred
Meritorious and supreme eyes,
And being thus adorned,
Their vision becomes most pure.

With eyes received from parents,
They see the thousand triple cosmos entire—
Mount Sumeru within and without,
Sumeru and the Iron Ring Mountains,

Together with all other mountain forests,
The great seas and the flowing rivers.
From the Avīci Hell below
To the Summit of Existence above,

All sentient beings therein—
These they completely perceive.
Though not yet possessing the divine eye,
The power of the physical eye is thus."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall obtain twelve hundred merits of the ear faculty. With these pure ears, they shall hear throughout the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds, from the Avīci Hell below to the Summit of Existence above, all the various words and sounds within and without: the sounds of elephants, horses, cattle, and carriages; the sounds of weeping and lamentation; the sounds of conches, drums, bells, and chimes; the sounds of laughter and speech; the sounds of men and women, boys and girls; the sounds of Dharma and non-Dharma; the sounds of suffering and joy; the sounds of ordinary beings and noble ones; the sounds of delight and displeasure; the sounds of deities, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas; the sounds of fire, water, and wind; the sounds of hell beings, animals, and hungry ghosts; the sounds of monks and nuns; the sounds of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; the sounds of bodhisattvas and Buddhas. In brief, all sounds whatsoever within and without the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds—though not yet having obtained the divine ear, with the pure ordinary ear received from their parents, they shall hear and know all. Thus distinguishing the various kinds of sounds, their ear faculty shall remain unimpaired."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"The ear received from parents,
Pure and without defilement—
With this ordinary ear they hear
The sounds of the thousand triple worlds.

Sounds of elephants, horses, chariots, and oxen,
Sounds of bells, chimes, conches, and drums,
Sounds of lutes, zithers, and harps,
Sounds of flutes and pipes—

The pure and beautiful sounds of songs
They hear without attachment.
Countless varieties of human speech
They hear and fully comprehend.

They also hear the voices of the deities,
The wondrous sounds of their songs,
And hear the voices of men and women,
The voices of boys and girls.

In mountain ravines and perilous valleys,
The call of the kalaviṅka bird,
The jīvajīvaka and other birds—
All their sounds they hear.

The many suffering torments of hell,
The various anguished cries,
The hungry ghosts oppressed by hunger and thirst,
Their voices seeking food and drink—

The asuras and others
Dwelling at the ocean's edge,
When they converse among themselves,
Emitting great sounds—

Thus does the Dharma teacher,
Abiding safely in this realm,
Hear these many sounds from afar,
Yet their ear faculty remains unimpaired.

In the worlds of the ten directions,
When birds and beasts call to one another,
The person who expounds the Dharma
Hears all of these.

In the Brahma heavens above,
The Ābhāsvara and Śubhakṛtsna realms,
And up to the Summit of Existence,
The sounds of speech—

The Dharma teacher, dwelling here,
Hears them all.
All the assembly of monks
And all the nuns,

Whether reading or reciting scriptures,
Or teaching them to others—
The Dharma teacher, dwelling here,
Hears them all.

Moreover, the bodhisattvas,
Reading and reciting the Dharma of the sutras,
Or teaching it to others,
Compiling commentaries and explaining its meaning—

All such sounds as these
They completely hear.
The Buddhas, Great Holy Honored Ones,
Teachers and transformers of sentient beings,

In the midst of great assemblies,
Expounding the wondrous Dharma—
The upholder of this Lotus Sutra
Hears it all.

Throughout the thousand triple great cosmos,
All sounds within and without,
From the Avīci Hell below
To the Summit of Existence above—

They hear all these sounds
While their ear faculty remains unimpaired.
Because their ears are keen and sharp,
They can distinguish and know all.

The upholder of this Lotus Sutra,
Though not yet having the divine ear,
But using only the ear they were born with—
Such are their merits already."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall perfect eight hundred merits of the nose faculty. With this pure nose faculty, they shall smell all the various fragrances throughout the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds, above and below, within and without: the fragrance of sumanas flowers, jāti flowers, mallikā flowers, campaka flowers, pāṭala flowers, red lotus flowers, blue lotus flowers, white lotus flowers; the fragrance of flowering trees and fruit trees; the fragrance of sandalwood, aloeswood, tamālapattra, and tagara; and thousands upon thousands of kinds of blended incenses, whether powdered, formed into pellets, or prepared as ointments. The upholder of this sutra, dwelling in this realm, shall be able to distinguish them all. Moreover, they shall separately know the fragrances of sentient beings: the scent of elephants, horses, cattle, sheep, and so forth; the scent of men and women, boys and girls; and the scent of grasses, trees, thickets, and forests. Whether near or far, all these fragrances they shall perceive and distinguish without error. Though the upholder of this sutra dwells here, they shall also smell the fragrances of the deities in heaven: the fragrance of the pārijāta and kovidāra trees; the fragrance of mandārava flowers and mahā-mandārava flowers; the fragrance of mañjūṣaka flowers and mahā-mañjūṣaka flowers; sandalwood and aloeswood; various powdered incenses; and the fragrance of various mixed flowers. The fragrances produced by blending all such celestial incenses—none of these shall remain unknown. They shall also smell the bodily fragrances of the deities: the fragrance of Śakra Devānām Indra when in the Hall of Victory, delighting in the five desires and sporting there; his fragrance when in the Hall of Wondrous Dharma, expounding the Dharma to the Trāyastriṃśa deities; his fragrance when roaming in various parks; and the bodily fragrances of other male and female deities—all these they shall smell from afar. Thus continuing upward through the Brahma realms and reaching to the Summit of Existence, the bodily fragrances of all the deities they shall smell. They shall also smell the fragrances of incense burned by the deities, as well as the fragrances of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and the bodily fragrances of Buddhas—all these they shall smell from afar and know where they are. Though smelling these fragrances, their nose faculty shall neither be impaired nor confused. If they wish to distinguish and explain them to others, their recollection shall be without error."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"That person's nose is pure;
In this world,
Whether fragrant or foul things—
All varieties they perceive and know.

Sumanas and jāti,
Tamālapattra and sandalwood,
Aloeswood and cassia fragrance,
Various flower and fruit fragrances,

And they know sentient beings' scents—
The scent of men and women.
The teacher of the Dharma, dwelling far away,
Smells the fragrance and knows their location.

Great wheel-turning kings,
Lesser wheel-turning kings and their sons,
Ministers and palace attendants—
Smelling their fragrance, they know where they are.

The precious jewels adorning their bodies,
And treasures buried in the earth,
The jeweled maidens of wheel-turning kings—
Smelling their fragrance, they know where they are.

The ornaments adorning people's bodies,
Their garments and necklaces,
The various ointments they apply—
Smelling their fragrance, they know whose body.

Whether the deities walk or sit,
Sport or perform spiritual transformations—
The upholder of this Lotus Sutra,
Smelling their fragrance, knows it all.

The flowers, fruits, and seeds of trees,
And the fragrance of ghee and oil—
The sutra upholder, dwelling here,
Knows exactly where they are.

In the deep and perilous places of mountains,
Where sandalwood trees flower in bloom,
And sentient beings dwell therein—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

In the Iron Ring Mountains, the great seas,
And sentient beings within the earth—
The sutra upholder smells their fragrance
And knows exactly where they are.

Male and female asuras
And all their retinues,
When fighting or at play—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

In wilderness and dangerous narrow places,
Lions, elephants, tigers, wolves,
Wild oxen, water buffalo, and so forth—
Smelling their fragrance, they know where they are.

If someone is pregnant,
Before the sex is determined,
Whether lacking faculties or inhuman—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

By the power of smelling fragrance,
They know of the first conception,
Whether it will come to completion or not,
And whether a blessed child will be safely born.

By the power of smelling fragrance,
They know the thoughts of men and women—
Their lustful, deluded, or angry minds,
And also know those who cultivate goodness.

The many hidden treasures in the earth—
Gold, silver, and various jewels
Stored in copper vessels—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

Various kinds of necklaces
Whose value no one can assess—
Smelling their fragrance, they know their worth,
Their origin and location.

The various flowers of heaven—
Mandāravas and mañjūṣakas,
The pārijāta tree—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

The celestial palaces of heaven,
Their superior, middle, and inferior distinctions,
Adorned with multitudes of jewels and flowers—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

The celestial gardens, forests, and splendid halls,
The various towers and Halls of Wondrous Dharma,
Those taking pleasure therein—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

Whether the deities listen to the Dharma
Or receive the five desires,
Coming and going, walking, sitting, or lying—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

The garments worn by celestial maidens,
Beautifully adorned with fine flowers and fragrances,
As they move about at play—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

Thus continuing upward by degrees,
Even to the Brahma realm,
Those entering and emerging from meditative absorption—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

The Ābhāsvara and Śubhakṛtsna heavens,
And up to the Summit of Existence—
Those first born there and those departing—
Smelling their fragrance, they know them all.

The assembly of monks
Ever diligent in the Dharma,
Whether sitting or walking in meditation,
Or reading and reciting scriptures,

Or beneath forest trees,
Concentrating in meditative absorption—
The sutra upholder smells their fragrance
And knows exactly where they are.

Bodhisattvas of firm resolve,
Whether sitting in meditation or reciting,
Or teaching the Dharma to others—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

The World-Honored Ones in all directions,
Revered by all,
Having compassion and teaching the Dharma—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

Sentient beings in the Buddha's presence,
Hearing the sutra, all rejoicing,
Practicing according to the Dharma—
Smelling their fragrance, they know it all.

Though not yet having obtained the bodhisattva's
Undefiled Dharma-born nose,
This sutra upholder
First obtains these nasal characteristics."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall obtain twelve hundred merits of the tongue faculty. Whether good or bad, beautiful or not beautiful, or even bitter and astringent things—when they come to their tongue faculty, all are transformed into supreme flavors, like heavenly ambrosia, with nothing that is not delicious. If, with their tongue faculty, they expound the Dharma before a great assembly, they shall emit profound and wondrous sounds that can penetrate the hearts of all, causing all to rejoice and be delighted. Moreover, the sons and daughters of the deities, Śakra, Brahmā, and the various deities, hearing these profound and wondrous sounds and this orderly exposition and discourse, shall all come to listen. The nāgas and nāga maidens, yakṣas and yakṣa maidens, gandharvas and gandharva maidens, asuras and asura maidens, garuḍas and garuḍa maidens, kinnaras and kinnara maidens, mahoragas and mahoraga maidens—all, for the sake of hearing the Dharma, shall come to draw near, show reverence, and make offerings. Monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, kings, princes, ministers, and retinues, lesser wheel-turning kings, great wheel-turning kings with their seven treasures and thousand sons, and their inner and outer retinues, shall all ride in their palaces and come together to hear the Dharma, because the bodhisattva teaches the Dharma well. Brahmins, householders, and the people of the land shall, for their entire lives, attend and make offerings. Moreover, śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas shall always delight in seeing them. In whatever direction this person dwells, all Buddhas shall turn toward that place and teach the Dharma. They shall be able to receive and uphold all the Buddha's teachings, and also be able to emit profound and wondrous Dharma sounds."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"That person's tongue faculty is pure;
They shall never receive evil flavors.
Whatever they eat
All becomes like ambrosia.

With profound, pure, and wondrous voice,
They teach the Dharma to the great assembly.
Through various causes and parables,
They guide the minds of sentient beings.

All who hear rejoice
And present supreme offerings.
The deities, nāgas, yakṣas,
Asuras, and others—

All with reverent minds
Come together to hear the Dharma.
This teacher of the Dharma,
If wishing with wondrous sounds

To pervade the thousand triple cosmos,
Can accomplish this at will.
Great and lesser wheel-turning kings
And their thousand sons and retinues,

With palms joined and reverent minds,
Always come to hear and receive the Dharma.
The deities, nāgas, yakṣas,
Rākṣasas, and piśācas—

Also with joyful minds,
Always delight in making offerings.
The King of the Brahma Heaven, the King of Māra,
Īśvara and Maheśvara—

Such hosts of deities as these
Always come to that place.
The Buddhas and their disciples,
Hearing the sound of that one's Dharma teaching,

Always think of and protect them,
And sometimes manifest their bodies."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall obtain eight hundred merits of the body faculty. They shall obtain a pure body like pure lapis lazuli, which sentient beings delight to see. Because their body is pure, all sentient beings of the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds—at the time of their birth and death, whether superior or inferior, beautiful or ugly, born in good or evil destinies—all shall be manifested therein. The Iron Ring Mountain, the Great Iron Ring Mountain, Mount Sumeru, Mount Mahāsumeru, and all such mountains, as well as the sentient beings therein, all shall be manifested therein. From the Avīci Hell below to the Summit of Existence above, all that exists and all sentient beings shall be manifested therein. If śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas expound the Dharma, their forms and images shall all be manifested within that body."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If one upholds the Lotus Sutra,
Their body becomes most pure,
Like that pure lapis lazuli—
All sentient beings delight to see them.

And like a pure, bright mirror
That reflects all forms and images,
The bodhisattva, in their pure body,
Sees all that exists in the world,

They alone clearly perceive this;
Others cannot see it.
Throughout the thousand triple cosmos,
All the multitudes of living beings—

Deities, humans, and asuras,
Hell beings, ghosts, and animals—
All such forms and images
Are manifested within their body.

The palaces of the deities and so forth,
Even up to the Summit of Existence,
The Iron Ring and Sumeru Mountains,
Mount Mahāsumeru,

The great seas and waters—
All are manifested within their body.
The Buddhas and the śrāvakas,
The Buddha's sons, the bodhisattvas,

Whether alone or in assemblies,
Teaching the Dharma—all are manifested.
Though not yet having obtained the undefiled
Wondrous body of the Dharma nature,

With their pure ordinary body,
All is manifested therein."


"Furthermore, Ever Diligent, if a good man or good woman, after the Tathāgata's parinirvāṇa, receives and upholds this sutra, whether reading, reciting, expounding, or copying it, they shall obtain twelve hundred merits of the mind faculty. With this pure mind faculty, upon hearing even a single verse or phrase, they shall penetrate limitless and boundless meanings. Having understood these meanings, they shall be able to expound upon a single phrase or verse for one month, four months, or even a full year. All the teachings they expound, in accordance with their meaning and purport, shall never contradict true reality. If they teach worldly classics, governmental discourse, or matters of livelihood and occupation, all shall accord with the correct Dharma. As for the sentient beings of the six destinies throughout the great manifold cosmos of a thousand million worlds—the movements of their minds, the actions of their minds, the conceptual elaborations of their minds—all shall be known. Though not yet having obtained the wisdom free from defilements, yet their mind faculty shall be pure to this extent. Whatever this person thinks, deliberates upon, or speaks about shall all be the Buddha's teaching, without anything false, and shall also be what was spoken by previous Buddhas in the sutras."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"That person's mind is pure,
Bright, sharp, and without defilement.
With this wondrous mind faculty,
They know superior, middling, and inferior teachings.

Upon hearing even a single verse,
They penetrate limitless meanings.
In proper sequence they teach according to the Dharma,
For a month, four months, or up to a year.

Within and without this world,
All sentient beings—
Whether deities, nāgas, or humans,
Yakṣas, ghosts, spirits, and so forth—

Those in the six destinies,
Their various thoughts and intentions—
As recompense for upholding the Lotus Sutra,
They know them all at once.

The countless Buddhas of the ten directions,
With the marks adorned by a hundred merits,
Teaching the Dharma to sentient beings—
They hear all and can receive and uphold it.

They contemplate limitless meanings
And teach the Dharma also without limit,
From beginning to end without forgetting or erring—
Because they uphold the Lotus Sutra.

They fully know the marks of all dharmas,
Understand their sequence according to meaning,
Comprehend names, words, and expressions,
And teach them as they are known.

What this person expounds
Is all the Dharma of previous Buddhas.
Because they expound this Dharma,
Before assemblies they have nothing to fear.

The upholder of the Lotus Sutra
Has a mind faculty pure like this.
Though not yet having the undefiled state,
They first possess these characteristics.

This person upholding this sutra
Abides in a rare and wondrous state,
And for the sake of all sentient beings,
They are joyfully loved and revered.

Able to use thousands upon thousands of kinds
Of skillful expressions,
They distinguish and expound the Dharma—
Because they uphold the Lotus Sutra."
