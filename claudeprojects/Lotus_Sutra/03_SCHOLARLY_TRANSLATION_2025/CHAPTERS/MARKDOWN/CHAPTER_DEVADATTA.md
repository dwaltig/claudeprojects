# Chapter 12: Devadatta

*提婆達多品第十二*

At that time, the Buddha addressed all the bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly of devas and humans, saying: "In past kalpas immeasurable, I sought the Lotus Sutra without slackening or wearying. Throughout many kalpas I constantly served as a king, making vows to seek the unsurpassed bodhi, my mind never retreating or turning back. Wishing to fulfill the six pāramitās, I diligently practiced giving, my mind without stinginess—elephants, horses, the seven precious things, my kingdom, cities, wife and children, servants and attendants, head, eyes, marrow and brain, body, flesh, hands and feet—I did not spare even my own life. At that time, the people's lifespans were immeasurable. For the sake of the Dharma, I renounced my royal position, entrusted governance to the crown prince, struck the drum and issued a proclamation throughout the four directions, seeking the Dharma: 'Whoever can expound the Mahāyāna to me, I shall serve and attend throughout my life.' At that time, there was a seer who came and addressed the king, saying: 'I possess the Mahāyāna, named the Lotus Sutra. If you do not disobey me, I shall expound it for you.' The king, hearing the seer's words, rejoiced and leaped with joy, immediately following the seer and providing all that he needed—gathering fruit, drawing water, collecting firewood, preparing food—even using his own body as a seat, his body and mind without weariness. Thus he served for a thousand years, all for the sake of the Dharma, diligently attending and serving so that nothing was lacking."

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"I recall past kalpas
When, seeking the Great Dharma,
Though I served as world-king,
I coveted not the pleasures of the five desires.

"I struck the bell, announcing to the four directions:
'Who possesses the Great Dharma?
If one can expound it for me,
My body shall serve as slave and servant.'

"At that time, there was the seer Asita
Who came and addressed the great king:
'I possess the subtle, wondrous Dharma,
Rare in this world.

"'If one can cultivate and practice it,
I shall expound it for you.'
The king, hearing the seer's words,
In his mind arose great joy and delight.

"Immediately he followed the seer,
Providing all that he needed—
Gathering firewood and fruits,
Respectfully offering them at the proper times.

"For the sake of cherishing the wondrous Dharma,
Body and mind were without slackening or wearying.
Universally for the sake of all beings,
He diligently sought the Great Dharma—

"Not for his own body
Or for the pleasures of the five desires.
Thus, as the great king of a nation,
Through diligent seeking he obtained this Dharma,

"And thereby achieved Buddhahood—
Now I expound it for you."

The Buddha told the bhikṣus: "At that time, the king was none other than myself. The seer was the present Devadatta. Through Devadatta as a good spiritual friend, I was able to fulfill the six pāramitās—loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity, the thirty-two marks, the eighty secondary characteristics, the purple-golden hue, the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, the four methods of gathering, the eighteen dharmas exclusive to Buddhas, spiritual penetrations and the power of the Way. Having achieved perfect enlightenment and broadly saving beings—all this was due to Devadatta as a good spiritual friend."

The Buddha addressed the fourfold assembly: "Devadatta, after immeasurable kalpas have passed, shall attain Buddhahood. His name shall be Devarāja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Humans, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His world shall be named Devaloka. At that time, Devarāja Buddha shall abide in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas, broadly expounding the wondrous Dharma for beings. Beings numerous as the sands of the Ganges shall attain the fruit of arhatship. Immeasurable beings shall awaken to the mind of pratyekabuddhas. Beings numerous as the sands of the Ganges shall generate the mind of the unsurpassed Way, attain the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas, and reach the stage of non-retrogression."

"When Devarāja Buddha enters parinirvāṇa, the True Dharma shall abide in the world for twenty intermediate kalpas. His complete bodily relics shall be enshrined in a stūpa of the seven precious things, sixty yojanas in height and forty yojanas in breadth. All devas and humans shall make offerings with various flowers, powdered incense, burning incense, paste incense, garments, necklaces, banners, canopies, music and songs, worshiping and making offerings to this stūpa of the seven precious things. Immeasurable beings shall attain the fruit of arhatship. Immeasurable beings shall awaken to pratyekabuddhahood. Inconceivable numbers of beings shall generate the mind of bodhi and reach the stage of non-retrogression."

The Buddha told the bhikṣus: "In a future age, should there be good men and good women who, hearing the Devadatta Chapter of the Lotus Sutra, believe and revere it with pure minds without generating doubts, they shall not fall into the hells, the realm of hungry ghosts, or the realm of animals, but shall be born before Buddhas of the ten directions. In whatever place they are born, they shall constantly hear this sutra. If born among humans or devas, they shall receive supremely wondrous pleasures. If in the presence of a Buddha, they shall be born by transformation from lotus flowers."

At that time, from below, a bodhisattva who had accompanied the World-Honored Prabhūtaratna, named Prajñākūṭa, addressed Prabhūtaratna Buddha: "We should return to our original land." Śākyamuni Buddha said to Prajñākūṭa: "Good man, wait a moment. There is here a bodhisattva named Mañjuśrī. You may meet with him and discuss the wondrous Dharma, then return to your original land."

At that time, Mañjuśrī was seated upon a thousand-petaled lotus flower, large as a cart-wheel. The bodhisattvas who had accompanied him were also seated upon jeweled lotus flowers. They arose naturally from the palace of Sāgara, the dragon-king, in the great ocean, abiding in empty space. They proceeded to Vulture Peak Mountain, descended from their lotus flowers, and approached the Buddha. They bowed their heads to the ground, paying homage to the feet of the two World-Honored Ones. Having completed these courtesies, they went to Prajñākūṭa, exchanged greetings with each other, and withdrew to sit to one side.

Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva asked Mañjuśrī: "When you went to the dragon palace, how many beings did you convert?" Mañjuśrī said: "Their number is immeasurable, incalculable, beyond what words can declare or the mind can fathom. Wait but a moment and evidence shall naturally appear." Before his words were finished, innumerable bodhisattvas seated upon jeweled lotus flowers surged forth from the sea, proceeded to Vulture Peak Mountain, and abided in empty space. These bodhisattvas had all been converted by Mañjuśrī. They had perfected the bodhisattva practices and all discoursed together on the six pāramitās. Those who had originally been śrāvakas discoursed in empty space on śrāvaka practices, but now all cultivated the practice of the Mahāyāna's emptiness teaching. Mañjuśrī said to Prajñākūṭa: "The work of teaching and conversion in the sea was thus." At that time, Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva spoke in verse in praise:

"O Great One of wisdom, virtue, valor, and strength,
Who has converted immeasurable multitudes—
This great assembly here
And I have all now seen.

"You have proclaimed the meaning of true reality,
Opened and revealed the One Vehicle Dharma,
Broadly guiding all beings
To swiftly achieve bodhi."

Mañjuśrī said: "While in the sea, I constantly expounded only the Lotus Sutra." Prajñākūṭa asked Mañjuśrī, saying: "This sutra is profoundly subtle and wondrous, a jewel among sutras, rare in the world. Are there any beings who, through diligent and vigorous practice of this sutra, have swiftly attained Buddhahood?" Mañjuśrī said: "There is the daughter of Sāgara, the dragon-king. She has just reached the age of eight years. Her wisdom is sharp and keen. She well knows the roots, conduct, and karma of all beings. She has attained dhāraṇī. All the profoundly secret treasuries expounded by the Buddhas she can fully receive and uphold. She has deeply entered meditative concentration and thoroughly comprehends all dharmas. In the space of an instant, she generated the mind of bodhi, attained the stage of non-retrogression, and her eloquence is unobstructed. Compassionately mindful of beings as though they were her own infants, her merit is complete. What her mind conceives and her mouth proclaims is subtle, wondrous, vast, and great. Compassionate, benevolent, and yielding, her intent and spirit are harmonious and refined. She is able to reach bodhi."

Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva said: "I have seen Śākyamuni Tathāgata throughout immeasurable kalpas practicing difficult and painful austerities, accumulating merit and amassing virtue, seeking the bodhisattva path without ever ceasing. Observing the great trichiliocosm, there is not even a spot the size of a mustard seed that was not a place where the Bodhisattva cast aside body and life for the sake of beings. Only thereafter did he attain the bodhi Way. I do not believe that this girl could, in the space of an instant, achieve perfect enlightenment." Before his words were finished, the dragon-king's daughter suddenly appeared before them, bowed her head to the ground in reverence, and then withdrew to stand to one side. She spoke in verse in praise:

"Deeply penetrating the marks of crime and merit,
Illuminating universally the ten directions,
The subtle, wondrous, pure Dharma-body
Is endowed with the thirty-two marks.

"With the eighty secondary characteristics
Adorning the Dharma-body,
Revered and looked up to by devas and humans,
Dragons and spirits all pay homage with respect.

"Among all categories of beings,
There are none who do not honor and serve.
Again I have heard that in achieving bodhi,
Only Buddha can bear witness and know.

"I expound the teaching of the Mahāyāna,
Delivering beings from suffering."

At that time, Śāriputra addressed the dragon-girl, saying: "You say that in no long time you shall attain the unsurpassed Way. This is difficult to believe. Why is this? A woman's body is filthy and defiled, not a vessel for the Dharma. How could you attain unsurpassed bodhi? The Buddha-Way is vast and remote. Throughout immeasurable kalpas, through diligent and painful practice of various austerities and the complete cultivation of the pāramitās—only thereafter can one succeed. Moreover, a woman's body still has five obstructions: first, she cannot become a Brahmā god-king; second, Śakra; third, Māra-king; fourth, a wheel-turning sage-king; fifth, a Buddha-body. How could a woman's body swiftly attain Buddhahood?"

At that time, the dragon-girl possessed a precious jewel worth an entire great trichiliocosm. She held it up and presented it to the Buddha. The Buddha immediately received it. The dragon-girl addressed Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva and the Venerable Śāriputra, saying: "I offered the precious jewel and the World-Honored One accepted it. Was this matter swift or not?" They answered: "Very swift." The girl said: "Through your spiritual power, observe my attainment of Buddhahood—it shall be even swifter than this." At that moment, the entire assembly beheld the dragon-girl suddenly transform into a male body, perfect the bodhisattva practices, immediately proceed to the Vimalā world in the southern direction, sit upon a jeweled lotus flower, and achieve perfect enlightenment. With the thirty-two marks and the eighty secondary characteristics, she universally expounded the wondrous Dharma for all beings throughout the ten directions. At that time, in the Sahā world, bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, the eight classes of dragons and spirits, humans and non-humans all beheld from afar that dragon-girl attain Buddhahood and universally expound the Dharma for the assembly of devas and humans at that time. Their minds rejoiced greatly and all made obeisance from afar. Immeasurable beings heard the Dharma, awakened understanding, and attained the stage of non-retrogression. Immeasurable beings received predictions of the Way. The Vimalā world trembled and quaked in six ways. In the Sahā world, three thousand beings abided on the stage of non-retrogression. Three thousand beings generated the mind of bodhi and received predictions. Prajñākūṭa Bodhisattva, Śāriputra, and the entire assembly all silently believed and accepted.
