# Chapter 28: The Encouragement of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra

*普賢菩薩勸發品第二十八*

At that time, the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, through his power of sovereign spiritual penetration, his majestic virtue and renown, together with great bodhisattvas immeasurable, boundless, and beyond reckoning, came from the east. In all the lands through which he passed, the earth universally quaked and trembled, jeweled lotus flowers rained down, and immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kinds of music were played. Moreover, accompanied by innumerable devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans and nonhumans, and others, a great assembly surrounded him, each manifesting the power of majestic virtue and spiritual penetration. Arriving at this Sahā world, at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa, he bowed his head to the feet of Śākyamuni Buddha, circumambulated him seven times to the right, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, from the land of the Buddha Jewel Majestic Virtue Superior King, I heard from afar that in this Sahā world the Dharma Flower Sutra was being expounded. Together with immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of bodhisattvas, I have come to hear and receive it. I only pray that the World-Honored One will expound it for us. If, after the extinction of the Tathāgata, good sons and good daughters wish to obtain this Dharma Flower Sutra, how may they do so?"

The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra: "If good sons and good daughters fulfill four dharmas, after the extinction of the Tathāgata they shall obtain this Dharma Flower Sutra. First, they shall be protected and kept in mind by the buddhas. Second, they shall plant the roots of all virtues. Third, they shall enter the assembly of those fixed in correctness. Fourth, they shall arouse the mind to save all sentient beings. Good sons and good daughters who fulfill these four dharmas in this way shall, after the extinction of the Tathāgata, unfailingly obtain this sutra."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, in the latter five hundred years, in the evil and turbid age, whoever receives and upholds this sutra, I shall guard and protect, removing their decline and afflictions, causing them to obtain peace and stability, making it so that none who seek opportunity to harm them shall succeed—whether māras, māra-sons, māra-daughters, māra-subjects, those possessed by māras, yakṣas, rākṣasas, kumbhāṇḍas, piśācas, kṛtyas, pūtanas, vetāḍas, and others who harass people—none shall gain advantage. When this person, whether walking or standing, recites this sutra, I shall at that time mount my six-tusked white elephant king and, together with the assembly of great bodhisattvas, proceed to that place and manifest my body, making offerings, guarding and protecting them, and comforting their minds, also for the sake of making offerings to the Dharma Flower Sutra. If this person sits and contemplates this sutra, at that time I shall again mount my white elephant king and appear before that person. If that person has forgotten even a single phrase or verse of the Dharma Flower Sutra, I shall teach it to them, reciting it together with them, causing them to become thoroughly proficient again. At that time, those who receive, uphold, recite, and chant the Dharma Flower Sutra shall see my body and experience great joy, and through this shall progress with even greater vigor. Because they see me, they shall immediately attain samādhi and dhāraṇīs—namely, the Revolving Dhāraṇī, the Dhāraṇī of Hundreds of Thousands of Myriads of Koṭis of Revolutions, and the Dhāraṇī of Skillful Means in the Dharma Voice. They shall obtain dhāraṇīs such as these."

"World-Honored One, if in the latter age, in the latter five hundred years, in the evil and turbid age, there are bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, or upāsikās who seek, who uphold, who recite and chant, who copy, and who wish to cultivate this Dharma Flower Sutra, they should, for twenty-one days, single-mindedly advance with vigor. After the full twenty-one days have passed, I shall mount my six-tusked white elephant and, surrounded by immeasurable bodhisattvas, with a body pleasing to the sight of all sentient beings, appear before that person and expound the Dharma for them, showing, teaching, benefiting, and gladdening them. I shall moreover give them dhāraṇī spells. Having obtained this dhāraṇī, no nonhuman shall be able to destroy them, nor shall they be deluded and confused by women. I myself shall also always protect this person. I only pray that the World-Honored One will permit me to speak this dhāraṇī spell."

Then, in the presence of the Buddha, he spoke a spell, saying:

adaṇḍe daṇḍapati daṇḍāvarte daṇḍakuśale daṇḍasudhāri sudhāri sudhārapati buddhapaśyane sarvadhāraṇyāvartani sarvabhāṣyāvartani suāvartani saṃghaparīkṣaṇi saṃghanirghātani asaṃge saṃgāpanate tryadhvasaṃgate ratriprāpte saṃgharahūte ārati pratihate sarvasaṃghasamatikrānte sarvadharmasuparīkṣite sarvasattvarutakauśalyānugate siṃhavikrīḍite

"World-Honored One, if there are bodhisattvas who hear this dhāraṇī, they should know this to be the spiritual power of Samantabhadra. If the Dharma Flower Sutra circulates in Jambudvīpa and there are those who uphold it, they should think thus: 'This is all due to the majestic spiritual power of Samantabhadra.' If there are those who uphold, recite and chant, correctly retain in memory, understand its meaning and purport, and cultivate practice according to what is spoken, know that such persons practice the practices of Samantabhadra. In the presence of immeasurable, boundless buddhas, they have deeply planted roots of goodness, and the Tathāgatas have placed their hands upon their heads. If they merely copy it, when this person's life ends, they shall be born in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven. At that time, eighty-four thousand heavenly maidens, playing all kinds of music, shall come to welcome them. That person shall immediately don a crown of seven treasures and, amidst the palace ladies, experience pleasure and delight. How much more so for those who uphold, recite and chant, correctly retain in memory, understand its meaning and purport, and cultivate practice according to what is spoken! If there are persons who uphold, recite and chant, and understand its meaning and purport, when this person's life ends, they shall be received in the hands of a thousand buddhas, so that they feel no fear and do not fall into the evil destinies. They shall proceed immediately to the Tuṣita Heaven, to the place of the Bodhisattva Maitreya. The Bodhisattva Maitreya possesses the thirty-two marks and is surrounded by a great assembly of bodhisattvas. He has hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of heavenly maiden attendants, and one is born in their midst. Such are the meritorious virtues and beneficial advantages. Therefore, the wise should single-mindedly copy it themselves or cause others to copy it, upholding, reciting and chanting, correctly retaining in memory, and cultivating practice according to what is spoken."

"World-Honored One, I now, through my power of spiritual penetration, guard and protect this sutra so that, after the extinction of the Tathāgata, it may be widely propagated throughout Jambudvīpa and never be cut off."

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha spoke words of praise, saying: "Excellent, excellent, Samantabhadra! You are able to protect and assist this sutra, causing multitudes of sentient beings to obtain peace, advantage, and benefit. You have already accomplished inconceivable meritorious virtues and profound great compassion. From the remote past, you aroused the intention toward anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, and you are able to make this vow of spiritual penetration to guard and protect this sutra. I shall, through my power of spiritual penetration, guard and protect those who are able to uphold the name of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra."

"Samantabhadra, if there are those who uphold, recite and chant, correctly retain in memory, cultivate and practice, and copy this Dharma Flower Sutra, know that such persons then see Śākyamuni Buddha. It is as if they heard this sutra from the mouth of the Buddha. Know that such persons make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha. Know that such persons are praised as 'excellent' by the Buddha. Know that such persons have their heads rubbed by the hand of Śākyamuni Buddha. Know that such persons are covered by the robe of Śākyamuni Buddha. Such persons no longer greedily crave worldly pleasures. They do not delight in the scriptures and writings of non-Buddhist paths, nor do they take pleasure in approaching such persons or any who are evil—whether butchers, those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens, or dogs, hunters, or those who peddle feminine charms. The minds and intentions of such persons are upright and honest. They possess correct mindful retention and the power of merit and virtue. Such persons are not afflicted by the three poisons, nor are they afflicted by jealousy, self-conceit, arrogant conceit, or overweening conceit. Such persons have few desires, know contentment, and are able to cultivate the practices of Samantabhadra."

"Samantabhadra, if after the extinction of the Tathāgata, in the latter five hundred years, there are persons who see those who uphold, recite, and chant the Dharma Flower Sutra, they should think thus: 'This person shall before long proceed to the place of enlightenment, defeat the hosts of māras, attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, turn the wheel of the Dharma, beat the drum of the Dharma, blow the conch of the Dharma, rain the rain of the Dharma, and shall sit upon the lion throne of the Dharma amidst the great assembly of devas and humans.'"

"Samantabhadra, if in a latter age there are those who uphold, recite, and chant this sutra, such persons shall no longer greedily crave clothing, bedding, food and drink, or the necessities of life. Their vows shall not be in vain, and they shall moreover obtain their blessed reward in the present world. If there are persons who disparage them, saying, 'You are a madman! You perform these practices in vain and shall ultimately gain nothing'—the karmic retribution for such offense shall be to be without eyes, world after world. If there are those who make offerings and speak their praises, they shall in the present world obtain manifest rewards. If, moreover, one sees those who uphold this sutra and exposes their faults, whether real or unreal, such a person shall in the present world contract white leprosy. If there are those who ridicule them with scorn, such persons shall, world after world, have gaps in their teeth, ugly lips, a flat nose, hands and feet that are twisted and gnarled, eyes that squint, a body that is foul and fetid, evil sores, pus and blood, water belly, shortness of breath, and all manner of severe and evil diseases. Therefore, Samantabhadra, if one sees those who uphold this sutra, one should rise up and go to greet them from afar, and one should revere them as one reveres the Buddha."

When this chapter on the Encouragement of Samantabhadra was spoken, bodhisattvas immeasurable and boundless as the sands of the Ganges River obtained hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of revolving dhāraṇīs, and bodhisattvas equal in number to the dust motes of a great trichiliocosm perfected the practices of Samantabhadra. When the Buddha spoke this sutra, Samantabhadra and other bodhisattvas, Śāriputra and other śrāvakas, as well as the devas, nāgas, humans and nonhumans, and others—the entire great assembly—all rejoiced greatly. Receiving and upholding the Buddha's words, they bowed in reverence and departed.
