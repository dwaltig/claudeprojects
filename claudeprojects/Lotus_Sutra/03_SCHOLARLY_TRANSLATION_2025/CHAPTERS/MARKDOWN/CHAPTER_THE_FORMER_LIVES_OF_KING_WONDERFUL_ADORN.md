# Chapter 27: The Former Lives of King Wonderful Adornment

*妙莊嚴王本事品第二十七*

At that time, the Buddha addressed the great assembly: "Long ago in the past, beyond immeasurable, boundless, inconceivable, incalculable asamkhyeya kalpas, there was a Buddha named Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom, Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-sambuddha. His land was called Luminous Adornment, and the kalpa was called Joyful Vision."

"In the Dharma of that Buddha, there was a king named Wonderful Adornment. The king's consort was named Lady Pure Virtue. He had two sons: one named Pure Repository and the other named Pure Eye. These two sons possessed great spiritual powers, blessings, virtue, and wisdom. For a long time they had cultivated the bodhisattva path—namely, the perfection of giving, the perfection of moral discipline, the perfection of patience, the perfection of vigor, the perfection of meditation, the perfection of wisdom, and the perfection of skillful means. They had mastered loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity, and even the thirty-seven factors conducive to enlightenment—all these they thoroughly comprehended and penetrated. Moreover, they had attained the bodhisattva's Pure Samādhi, the Constellation Samādhi, the Pure Light Samādhi, the Pure Form Samādhi, the Pure Illumination Samādhi, the Long Adornment Samādhi, and the Great Majestic Virtue Repository Samādhi—in all these samādhis they were thoroughly penetrating."

"At that time, that Buddha, wishing to guide King Wonderful Adornment and out of compassion for all living beings, expounded this Lotus Sutra. Then the two sons, Pure Repository and Pure Eye, went to their mother, pressed their ten fingers together with palms joined, and said: 'We pray that our mother will go to the place where Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha dwells. We too shall attend upon you, draw near, make offerings, and pay reverence. Why is this so? Because this Buddha, in the midst of all the assemblies of gods and humans, expounds the Lotus Sutra. It is fitting that we should listen and receive it.' Their mother told her sons: 'Your father believes in and accepts the heterodox paths, being deeply attached to the Brahmanical teachings. You should go and speak to your father, so that we may all go together.' Pure Repository and Pure Eye pressed their ten fingers together with palms joined and addressed their mother: 'We are sons of the Dharma King, yet we have been born into this household of wrong views.' Their mother told her sons: 'You should be concerned for your father. Manifest spiritual transformations for him. If he is able to see them, his mind will certainly become pure, and he may allow us to go to the Buddha's place.'"

"Thereupon, the two sons, out of concern for their father, rose up into the sky to a height of seven tāla trees and manifested various spiritual transformations. In the sky they walked, stood, sat, and reclined. From the upper part of their bodies they emitted water, and from the lower part they emitted fire. From the lower part of their bodies they emitted water, and from the upper part they emitted fire. Sometimes they manifested great bodies that filled the sky, and then manifested small bodies again; from small bodies they again manifested great bodies. They disappeared in the sky and suddenly appeared on the ground. They entered the earth as if it were water, and walked upon water as if it were earth. Manifesting such various spiritual transformations, they caused their father the king's mind to become pure and to develop faith and understanding. When the father saw the spiritual powers of his sons, his mind was filled with great joy, having obtained what he had never had before. He joined his palms and addressed his sons: 'Who is your teacher? Whose disciples are you?' The two sons replied: 'Great King, that Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha is now seated upon the Dharma seat beneath the jeweled bodhi tree of seven treasures. In the midst of all the assemblies of gods and humans throughout the world, he extensively expounds the Lotus Sutra. He is our teacher, and we are his disciples.' The father said to his sons: 'I too now wish to see your teacher. We may go together.' Thereupon, the two sons descended from the sky and went to their mother. Joining their palms, they addressed their mother: 'Our father the king has now developed faith and understanding and is capable of aspiring to awaken anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. We have accomplished the Buddha's work on behalf of our father. We pray that our mother will grant us permission to leave home and cultivate the Way in the presence of that Buddha.'"

At that time, the two sons, wishing to restate their meaning, spoke in verse to their mother:

We pray our mother will release us
To leave home and become śramaṇas.
Buddhas are exceedingly difficult to encounter;
We shall follow and learn from the Buddha.

Like the udumbara flower,
To encounter a Buddha is even more difficult than this.
To escape from all difficulties is also difficult;
We pray you will allow us to leave home.

"The mother then told them: 'I permit you to leave home. Why is this so? Because Buddhas are difficult to encounter.' Thereupon, the two sons addressed their father and mother: 'Excellent, father and mother! We pray that you will now go to the place where Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha dwells, to draw near and make offerings. Why is this so? Because Buddhas are difficult to encounter, like the udumbara flower, and also like a one-eyed turtle encountering the hole in a floating log. Through our deep and abundant blessings from former lives, we have been born at a time when the Buddha-Dharma exists. Therefore, father and mother should permit us to leave home. Why is this so? Because Buddhas are difficult to encounter, and the time is also difficult to meet.'"

"At that time, the eighty-four thousand persons in the inner palace of King Wonderful Adornment were all capable of upholding this Lotus Sutra. Pure Eye Bodhisattva had long been thoroughly penetrating the Lotus Samādhi. Pure Repository Bodhisattva had, for immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of kalpas, been thoroughly penetrating the Samādhi of Freeing All from Evil Destinies, because he wished to cause all living beings to be freed from the evil destinies. The king's consort had attained the Samādhi of the Assembly of All Buddhas, and was able to know the secret treasury of all Buddhas. The two sons, through such skillful means and power, skillfully converted their father, causing his mind to develop faith and understanding and to delight in the Buddha-Dharma. Then King Wonderful Adornment, together with his ministers and retinue, Lady Pure Virtue together with the women of the inner palace and her retinue, and the king's two sons together with forty-two thousand persons—all at the same time proceeded together to the Buddha's place. Having arrived, they bowed with their heads at his feet, circumambulated the Buddha three times, and withdrew to stand to one side."

"At that time, that Buddha expounded the Dharma for the king, revealing, instructing, benefiting, and gladdening him. The king greatly rejoiced. Then King Wonderful Adornment and his consort removed the pearl necklaces from their necks, worth hundreds of thousands, and scattered them over the Buddha. In the sky the necklaces transformed into a four-pillared jeweled platform. Within the platform was a great jeweled couch, spread with hundreds of thousands of myriads of heavenly garments, and upon it was a Buddha seated in cross-legged position, emitting great radiance. At that time, King Wonderful Adornment had this thought: 'The Buddha's body is rare, dignified, majestic, and distinctive, perfecting the supremely wondrous form.' Then Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha addressed the fourfold assembly: 'Do you see this King Wonderful Adornment standing with palms joined before me? This king, within my Dharma, shall become a monk and diligently cultivate and practice the dharmas that aid the Buddha Way. He shall become a Buddha named Śāla Tree King. His land will be called Great Light, and the kalpa will be called Great Lofty King. That Śāla Tree King Buddha will have immeasurable multitudes of bodhisattvas and immeasurable multitudes of śrāvakas. His land will be level and upright. Such will be his merits and virtues.' The king immediately ceded his kingdom to his younger brother and, together with his consort, his two sons, and all his retinue, left home within the Buddha-Dharma to cultivate the Way. After the king had left home, for eighty-four thousand years he constantly practiced diligently and cultivated the Wondrous Dharma Lotus Sutra. After this time had passed, he attained the Samādhi of Adornment with All Pure Meritorious Virtues. Immediately he rose into the sky to a height of seven tāla trees and addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, these two sons of mine have accomplished the Buddha's work. Through spiritual powers and transformations, they have turned my mind from wrong views, causing me to abide securely in the Buddha-Dharma and to be able to see the World-Honored One. These two sons are my good spiritual friends. Wishing to awaken the good roots from my past lives and to benefit me, they came to be born in my household.'"

"At that time, Cloud Thunder Sound Constellation King Flower Wisdom Buddha addressed King Wonderful Adornment: 'So it is, so it is, just as you say. If good men and good women plant good roots, life after life they will obtain good spiritual friends. These good spiritual friends are able to accomplish the Buddha's work, revealing, instructing, benefiting, and gladdening them, causing them to enter anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Great King, you should know that good spiritual friends are a great causal connection, bringing about transformation and guidance so that one may see the Buddha and awaken the mind of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Great King, do you see these two sons? These two sons have already made offerings to sixty-five hundred thousand myriads of millions of nayutas of Ganges' sands of Buddhas, drawing near and showing reverence. In the presence of all these Buddhas, they upheld the Lotus Sutra. Out of compassion for living beings of wrong views, they cause them to abide in right views.' King Wonderful Adornment then descended from the sky and addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the Tathāgata is extremely rare. Through the power of his meritorious virtues and wisdom, the fleshy protuberance atop his head radiates brilliant light. His eyes are long and broad, of deep blue color. The tuft of white hair between his eyebrows is white as the moon or snow. His teeth are white, even, and close-set, always emitting radiance. His lips are of excellent reddish color, like the bimba fruit.' At that time, King Wonderful Adornment, having thus praised the Buddha's immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of meritorious virtues, with single-minded palms joined before the Tathāgata, again addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, this is unprecedented! The Tathāgata's Dharma is fully perfected with inconceivable, subtle, and wondrous meritorious virtues. The precepts and instructions that guide conduct bring peace, stability, and excellent goodness. From this day forward, I shall no longer willfully follow my mind's impulses, nor shall I give rise to wrong views or to the evil minds of arrogance, anger, or hatred.' Having spoken these words, he paid reverence to the Buddha and departed."

The Buddha addressed the great assembly: "What do you think? Could King Wonderful Adornment be anyone else? He is now Flower Virtue Bodhisattva. Lady Pure Virtue is now the bodhisattva before the Buddha named Radiance Adorning Characteristics, who, out of compassion for King Wonderful Adornment and his retinue, was born in that place. As for those two sons, they are now Medicine King Bodhisattva and Superior Medicine Bodhisattva. These Medicine King and Superior Medicine Bodhisattvas have accomplished such great meritorious virtues as these. Before immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas they have planted roots of virtue and accomplished inconceivable good meritorious virtues. If there are persons who know the names of these two bodhisattvas, all the gods and humans throughout the world should also pay reverence to them." When the Buddha expounded this Chapter on the Former Lives of King Wonderful Adornment, eighty-four thousand persons cast off the dust and defilement from afar, and with regard to all dharmas attained the pure Dharma eye.
