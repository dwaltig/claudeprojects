# Chapter 25: The Universal Gateway of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara

*觀世音菩薩普門品第二十五*

At that time, the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati immediately rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, joined his palms toward the Buddha, and spoke these words: "World-Honored One, for what cause and condition is the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara called Avalokiteśvara?"

The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati: "Good son, if there are immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of sentient beings who are suffering various afflictions, and they hear of this Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara and single-mindedly call upon his name, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will immediately perceive the sounds of their voices, and they shall all attain deliverance. If there are those who uphold the name of this Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, should they enter into a great fire, the fire will be unable to burn them, by virtue of the majestic spiritual power of this bodhisattva. If they are being swept away by great waters and call upon his name, they will immediately reach the shallows. If there are hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of sentient beings who, seeking for gold, silver, lapis lazuli, giant clam shell, carnelian, coral, amber, pearls, and other treasures, enter upon the great ocean, and even if a black wind should blow their ships and boats, casting them adrift into the lands of the rākṣasa demons—if among them there is even one person who calls upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, all those people shall attain deliverance from the difficulties posed by the rākṣasas. For this cause and condition, he is called Avalokiteśvara."

"If again there are persons who are about to be harmed and they call upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, the swords and staves that their assailants hold will immediately break into pieces, and they shall attain deliverance. If the lands of a great trichiliocosm were filled with yakṣas and rākṣasas who wished to come and torment people, should these people hear them calling upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, these evil demons would not even be able to look upon them with evil eyes, much less cause them harm. If again there are persons, whether guilty or innocent, whose bodies are fettered with stocks, chains, manacles, and bonds, and they call upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, all these restraints shall be severed and broken, and they will immediately attain deliverance. If the lands of a great trichiliocosm were filled with adversaries and bandits, and there was a merchant leader guiding a caravan of merchants, carrying precious treasures and passing through dangerous roads, and if among them one person spoke these words of proclamation: 'Good sons, do not be fearful. You should all single-mindedly call upon the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. This bodhisattva is able to bestow fearlessness upon sentient beings. If you call upon his name, you shall attain deliverance from these adversaries and bandits.' When the merchants heard this, they raised their voices together, saying: 'Homage to the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara!' Because they called upon his name, they immediately attained deliverance."

"Akṣayamati, the majestic spiritual power of the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is sublime and exalted in this manner. If there are sentient beings who are given to excessive sensual desire, and they constantly recollect and venerate the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with reverence, they will attain freedom from desire. If they are given to excessive anger, and they constantly recollect and venerate the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with reverence, they will attain freedom from anger. If they are given to excessive folly, and they constantly recollect and venerate the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with reverence, they will attain freedom from folly. Akṣayamati, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara possesses such great majestic spiritual power and bestows abundant benefit; therefore, sentient beings should constantly bear him in mind. If there is a woman who wishes to seek a male child, and she worships and makes offerings to the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, she will give birth to a son endowed with merit, virtue, and wisdom. If she wishes to seek a female child, she will give birth to a daughter of upright appearance and auspicious features, one who has planted roots of virtue in past lives and is beloved and respected by all people. Akṣayamati, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara possesses such power. If there are sentient beings who venerate and worship the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara with reverence, their merit will not be expended in vain. Therefore, all sentient beings should uphold the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara."

"Akṣayamati, if there is a person who upholds the names of bodhisattvas numbering as many as sixty-two koṭis of Ganges sands, and furthermore exhausts his bodily form in making offerings of food and drink, clothing, bedding, and medicine—what is your opinion? Would the merit and virtue of this good son or good daughter be abundant or not?"

Akṣayamati said: "Extremely abundant, World-Honored One."

The Buddha said: "If again there is a person who upholds the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, and even for but a single moment worships and makes offerings, the merit of these two persons is precisely equal without difference, and cannot be exhausted throughout hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas. Akṣayamati, upholding the name of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara brings the benefits of such immeasurable and boundless merit and virtue."

The Bodhisattva Akṣayamati addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, how does the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara travel throughout this sahā world? How does he expound the Dharma for sentient beings? What is the nature of his skillful means and power?"

The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati: "Good son, if there are sentient beings in any land who should be saved by means of a buddha body, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara immediately manifests a buddha body and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of a pratyekabuddha body, he immediately manifests a pratyekabuddha body and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of a śrāvaka body, he immediately manifests a śrāvaka body and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of Brahmā, the king of gods, he immediately manifests the body of Brahmā and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of Śakra, he immediately manifests the body of Śakra and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of the Īśvara deity, he immediately manifests the body of the Īśvara deity and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of the Maheśvara deity, he immediately manifests the body of the Maheśvara deity and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a great heavenly general, he immediately manifests the body of a great heavenly general and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of Vaiśravaṇa, he immediately manifests the body of Vaiśravaṇa and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a minor king, he immediately manifests the body of a minor king and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of an elder, he immediately manifests the body of an elder and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a householder, he immediately manifests the body of a householder and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a chief minister, he immediately manifests the body of a chief minister and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a brahman, he immediately manifests the body of a brahman and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the bodies of a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman, he immediately manifests the bodies of a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of the wife of an elder, householder, chief minister, or brahman, he immediately manifests a female body and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a boy or girl, he immediately manifests the body of a boy or girl and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the bodies of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and so forth, he immediately manifests all of them and expounds the Dharma for them. For those who should be saved by means of the body of a vajra-bearing spirit, he immediately manifests the body of a vajra-bearing spirit and expounds the Dharma for them."

"Akṣayamati, this Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara has accomplished such meritorious virtues, and with various forms travels throughout the lands of all directions, delivering sentient beings. Therefore, you should all single-mindedly make offerings to the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. This Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is able to bestow fearlessness in the midst of terrifying and urgent difficulties. For this reason, all in this sahā world call him the Bestower of Fearlessness."

The Bodhisattva Akṣayamati addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, I shall now make an offering to the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara." He then removed from his neck a necklace of precious jeweled beads valued at hundreds of thousands of taels of gold, and presented it to him, saying: "Venerable One, receive this gift of Dharma, this precious jeweled necklace." At that time, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara was unwilling to accept it. Akṣayamati again addressed the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, saying: "Venerable One, out of compassion for us, receive this necklace."

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara: "Out of compassion for this Bodhisattva Akṣayamati and the fourfold assembly—the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and so forth—receive this necklace."

Immediately the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, out of compassion for the fourfold assembly and for the devas, nāgas, humans, non-humans, and so forth, received the necklace and divided it into two portions. One portion he offered to Śākyamuni Buddha, and one portion he offered to the stūpa of the Buddha Many Jewels. "Akṣayamati, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara possesses such sovereign spiritual power in traveling throughout the sahā world."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Akṣayamati posed this question in verse:

     World-Honored One, replete with wondrous features,
     I now ask again of him:
     For what cause and condition
     Is the son of the Buddha called Avalokiteśvara?

The Honored One, replete with wondrous features, answered Akṣayamati in verse:

     Hear now of Avalokiteśvara's conduct,
     How skillfully he responds in all quarters.
     His vast vow is deep as the ocean;
     Throughout kalpas inconceivable, he has
     Attended upon many thousands of koṭis of buddhas,
     And has made great pure vows.

     I shall explain to you in brief:
     Hearing his name and seeing his body,
     Bearing him in mind does not pass in vain,
     For he can extinguish the sufferings of all forms of existence.

     Even if someone with harmful intent
     Should push you into a great pit of fire,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     The pit of fire will transform into a pool.

     Or if you are drifting on the vast ocean,
     With dangers from dragons, fish, and demons,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     The waves will be unable to drown you.

     Or if from the peak of Mount Sumeru
     Someone should push you down,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     You will abide in space like the sun.

     Or if you are pursued by evil persons
     And fall from Diamond Mountain,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     Not a single hair will be harmed.

     Or if you encounter hostile bandits surrounding you,
     Each wielding swords to cause harm,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     All will immediately give rise to compassionate minds.

     Or if you suffer the distress of royal punishment,
     Your life about to end at the execution ground,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     The swords will immediately break into pieces.

     Or if you are imprisoned in cangue and chains,
     Your hands and feet bound in fetters,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     You will be freely released and attain deliverance.

     When mantras, curses, and various poisons
     Are intended to harm your body,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     They will return to afflict the original person.

     Or if you encounter evil rākṣasas,
     Poisonous dragons, demons, and the like,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     At that time none will dare to harm you.

     If you are surrounded by fierce beasts
     With sharp fangs and claws, dreadful to behold,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     They will swiftly flee to the boundless distance.

     When venomous serpents and vipers,
     Their poisonous breath blazing like smoke and fire,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     Will turn back at the sound of his name.

     When clouds thunder with rolling drums and flashing lightning,
     Hail falling and great rains pouring down,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     These will instantly be dispersed and dissipated.

     When sentient beings are oppressed by distress,
     Immeasurable sufferings pressing upon their bodies,
     The power of Avalokiteśvara's wondrous wisdom
     Can rescue the suffering of the world.

     Replete with the power of supernatural penetrations,
     Extensively cultivating wisdom and skillful means,
     In the lands of the ten directions,
     There is no realm where he does not manifest his body.

     The various evil destinies—
     The hells, the realms of hungry ghosts and animals,
     The sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death—
     He gradually causes all to be extinguished.

     True perception, pure perception,
     Perception of vast and great wisdom,
     Perception of compassion and perception of kindness—
     May we constantly vow to venerate and behold them.

     Stainless and pure radiance,
     The sun of wisdom that breaks through all darkness,
     Able to subdue the winds and fires of calamity,
     Universally illuminating the world with brightness.

     The precepts embodying compassion shake like thunder;
     The mind of kindness, a wondrous great cloud,
     Raining down the sweet dew of Dharma rain,
     Extinguishing the flames of afflictions.

     In disputes passing through the courts,
     Or in the terror of battle arrays,
     By mindfulness of the power of Avalokiteśvara,
     All enemies will completely withdraw and scatter.

     Wondrous Voice, Avalokiteśvara,
     Voice of Brahmā, Voice of the Ocean Tide,
     Surpassing all worldly voices—
     Therefore one must constantly be mindful of him.

     Moment by moment, give rise to no doubt.
     Avalokiteśvara, pure and sagely,
     In the distress of suffering and the peril of death,
     Is able to serve as a refuge and protection.

     Replete with all meritorious virtues,
     With compassionate eyes beholding sentient beings,
     His accumulation of merit is an immeasurable ocean.
     Therefore, one should bow in reverence to him.

At that time, the Bodhisattva Dharaṇīṃdhara immediately rose from his seat, came forward, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, if there are sentient beings who hear this chapter on the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara—of his sovereign works, his universal gateway manifestations, and his powers of supernatural penetration—it should be known that the merit and virtue of such persons is not small."

When the Buddha expounded this Universal Gateway chapter, eighty-four thousand sentient beings in the assembly all generated the mind set upon anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, the unsurpassed, equal, and perfect enlightenment.
