# Chapter 18: The Merit of Joyful Acceptance

*隨喜功德品第十八*

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, if there are good men and good women who, hearing this Lotus Sutra, joyfully accept it, how much merit shall they obtain?" And he spoke in verse:

"After the World-Honored One's extinction,
Should there be those who hear this sutra—
If they are able to joyfully accept it,
How much merit shall they obtain?"

At that time, the Buddha addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva: "Ajita, after the Tathāgata's extinction, whether bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, or other wise persons, whether senior or junior, having heard this sutra and joyfully accepted it, depart from the Dharma assembly and go to another place—whether in a monastic dwelling, a secluded place, a city, an alley, a village, or a hamlet—and, as they have heard it, expound it to the utmost of their ability for their parents, relatives, good friends, and acquaintances. These persons, having heard, also joyfully accept it and again go forth to teach others. Those others, having heard, also joyfully accept and teach yet others. Thus, transmitting it in succession unto the fiftieth person—Ajita, I shall now explain to you the merit of joyful acceptance of this fiftieth good man or good woman. Listen well."

"Suppose throughout the six destinies and four modes of birth of beings in four hundred myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya worlds—whether egg-born, womb-born, moisture-born, or transformation-born; whether having form or formless; having thought or thoughtless; neither having thought nor thoughtless; without feet, two-footed, four-footed, or many-footed—all such as these who are numbered among beings: suppose there were a person seeking merit who, according to their desires for pleasurable things, gave to them all, granting to each being all of Jambudvīpa's gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, coral, amber, and various wondrous precious things, as well as elephants, horses, carriages, palaces and towers made of the seven precious things. Having practiced such great giving for eighty full years, this great benefactor then thinks: 'I have already given beings pleasurable things according to their desires. However, these beings are all aged and decrepit, over eighty years old, with white hair and wrinkled faces. They shall die before long. I should now guide and instruct them with the Buddha-Dharma.' He immediately gathers these beings, proclaims and expounds the Dharma's transformation, instructing, benefiting, and delighting them. All at once they attain the path of stream-enterer, the path of once-returner, the path of non-returner, and the path of arhatship. They exhaust all outflows and, in profound dhyāna concentrations, all attain self-mastery, perfecting the eight liberations. What is your opinion? Is the merit obtained by this great benefactor abundant or not?"

Maitreya addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, this person's merit is extremely great, immeasurable and boundless. If this benefactor merely gave beings all pleasurable things, their merit would already be immeasurable. How much more so for causing them to attain arhatship!" The Buddha told Maitreya: "I now speak clearly to you: This person, giving all pleasurable things to beings of the six destinies throughout four hundred myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya worlds, and moreover causing them to attain arhatship—the merit they obtain does not equal that of this fiftieth person who hears one verse of the Lotus Sutra and joyfully accepts it. It cannot equal it by a hundredth part, a thousandth part, a hundred-thousandth-myriad-koṭith part, indeed cannot be known even by calculation or parable. Ajita, the merit of joyful acceptance of the Dharma Flower Sutra by this fiftieth person who has heard it transmitted in succession is already immeasurable, boundless, and asaṃkhyeya. How much more so for the first person in the assembly who hears and joyfully accepts it! Their merit is even more superior—immeasurable, boundless, asaṃkhyeya, incomparable."

"Moreover, Ajita, if a person, for the sake of this sutra, goes to a monastic dwelling and, whether sitting or standing, listens and receives it even briefly, through the merit of this cause and condition, when reborn in their next life, they shall receive supremely fine elephants, horses, carriages, precious palanquins, and shall ride in heavenly palaces. If again there is a person who, at a place where the Dharma is being expounded, sits, and another person comes whom they urge to sit and listen, or if they share their seat to allow them to sit—the merit of this person, when reborn in their next life, shall be to obtain the seat of Śakra, or the seat of a Brahmā king, or the seat of a wheel-turning sage-king."

"Ajita, if again there is a person who says to another: 'There is a sutra named the Lotus Flower; let us go together to hear it'—and they receive the teaching and, even for the briefest moment, hear it—the merit of this person, when reborn in their next life, shall be to be born together with dhāraṇī bodhisattvas. They shall possess sharp faculties and wisdom. Throughout hundreds of thousands of myriads of lives they shall never be mute or dumb. Their breath shall not be foul. Their tongue shall always be without illness. Their mouth also shall be without illness. Their teeth shall not be stained or black, not yellow, not sparse, nor missing, crooked, or asymmetrical. Their lips shall not droop down or curl back, nor be coarse or chapped, nor erupted or broken, nor crooked or distorted, neither thick nor large, neither dark black nor with any distasteful features. Their nose shall not be flat or crooked. Their face's color shall not be black, nor shall it be narrow or long, nor sunken or twisted. They shall have no unpleasant features whatsoever. Their lips, tongue, teeth—all shall be excellent and fine. Their nose long and slender, lofty and straight. Their face shall be full and round. Their eyebrows shall be high and long. Their forehead broad, level, and upright. Human marks shall be complete. In life after life wherever they are born, they shall see the Buddha, hear the Dharma, and believe and receive the teachings."

"Ajita, merely observe this: merely urging one person to go and listen to the Dharma produces such merit as this. How much more so for one who single-mindedly listens, expounds, reads, and recites, and in the midst of great assemblies discriminatingly explains it for others and practices according to what is taught?"

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If a person, at a Dharma assembly,
Hears this sutra,
Even a single verse,
And joyfully accepts it and expounds it for others,

"Thus transmitting and teaching
Unto the fiftieth person,
The merit obtained by this last person
I shall now discriminate:

"Suppose there were a great benefactor
Who provided for immeasurable multitudes,
Fully for eighty years,
According to their desires.

"Seeing their aged and decrepit marks,
White hair and wrinkled faces,
Teeth sparse and form withered,
Mindful that their death is not far off,

"'I should now teach them,
Causing them to obtain the fruits of the Way.'
Immediately, through expedient means, I expound
The true Dharma of nirvāṇa:

"'The world is all impermanent,
Like foam, bubbles, and flames.
All of you should
Swiftly generate minds of renunciation.'

"All the people, hearing this Dharma,
Attain arhatship,
Perfecting the six spiritual powers,
The three sciences and eight liberations.

"This fiftieth person
Who hears one verse and joyfully accepts it—
This person's merit exceeds that
And cannot be compared by parable.

"Thus, hearing it transmitted in succession,
Their merit is still immeasurable.
How much more so for one at the Dharma assembly
Who first hears and joyfully accepts!

"If there is one who urges another person,
Leading and guiding them to hear the Lotus Flower,
Saying: 'This sutra is profoundly wondrous,
Difficult to encounter in thousands of myriads of kalpas,'

"And they receive the teaching and go to listen,
Even hearing it for the briefest moment,
The merit and reward of such a person
I shall now discriminatingly explain:

"Life after life without oral afflictions,
Teeth neither sparse, yellow, nor black;
Lips neither thick, curled, nor missing—
Without any distasteful marks.

"Tongue neither dry, black, nor short;
Nose lofty, long and slender, and straight;
Forehead broad, level, and upright;
Face and eyes all upright and dignified—

"Delightful for people to see.
Breath without foul odor—
The fragrance of utpala flowers
Shall issue from their mouth.

"If one purposely goes to a monastic dwelling
Wishing to hear the Lotus Sutra,
Hearing it briefly and rejoicing,
I shall now explain their merit:

"In future lives, born among devas and humans,
They shall obtain wondrous elephants, horses, carriages,
Precious palanquins,
And ride in heavenly palaces.

"If at a place where Dharma is being expounded
One urges others to sit and listen to the sutra,
Through the merit of these causes and conditions they obtain
The seats of Śakra, Brahmā, and wheel-turning kings.

"How much more so for one who single-mindedly listens,
Explains its meaning and purport,
And practices according to what is taught—
Their merit is immeasurable!"
