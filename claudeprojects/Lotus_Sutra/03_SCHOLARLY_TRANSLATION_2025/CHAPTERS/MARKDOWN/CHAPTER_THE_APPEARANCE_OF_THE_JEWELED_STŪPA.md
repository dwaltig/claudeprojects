# Chapter 11: The Appearance of the Jeweled Stūpa

*見寶塔品第十一*

At that time before the Buddha there was a stūpa of the seven jewels, five hundred yojanas in height and two hundred and fifty yojanas in width and depth, which arose from the earth and abided in empty space. It was adorned with various precious things. Five thousand railings, ten million niches and chambers, and innumerable banners and pennants served as magnificent decorations. Hanging jeweled necklaces and myriads of koṭis of precious bells were suspended from it. From its four sides wafted forth the fragrance of tamālapattra and sandalwood, pervading the entire world. Its various banners and canopies were composed of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, true pearls, and rose quartz—the seven jewels combined together—reaching up to the palaces of the Four Heavenly Kings. The thirty-three devas rained down heavenly mandārava flowers as offerings to the jeweled stūpa. The remaining devas, dragons, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and others—thousands of myriads of koṭis of multitudes—made offerings to the jeweled stūpa with all manner of flowers, incense, necklaces, banners, canopies, and music, revering, honoring, and praising it.

At that time from within the jeweled stūpa there issued forth a great sound, proclaiming in praise: "Excellent! Excellent! Śākyamuni, World-Honored One, you are able to teach the Bodhisattvas with the Dharma of great and equal wisdom, the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra treasured by all Buddhas, and to expound it for the great assembly. It is so! It is so! Śākyamuni, World-Honored One—all that you have expounded is entirely true!" At that time the fourfold assembly, seeing the great jeweled stūpa abiding in empty space and also hearing the sound issuing forth from within the stūpa, all attained Dharma-joy and marveled at what they had never before experienced. They arose from their seats, reverently joined their palms, and withdrew to stand to one side.

At that time there was a Bodhisattva-mahāsattva named Mahāpratibhāna who, knowing the doubts in the minds of all in the world—devas, humans, asuras, and others—addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, through what causes and conditions does this jeweled stūpa arise from the earth, and also from within it issue forth this sound?" At that time the Buddha addressed Mahāpratibhāna Bodhisattva: "Within this jeweled stūpa there is the complete body of a Tathāgata. Long ago, in the eastern direction, passing through immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya worlds, there was a land named Ratnaviśuddhā. In it there was a Buddha named Prabhūtaratna. When that Buddha was practicing the Bodhisattva-Way, he made a great vow: 'If, after I accomplish Buddhahood and become extinct, throughout the lands of the ten directions wherever the Dharma Lotus Sutra is expounded, my stūpa-shrine, in order to hear that sutra, shall surge forth and appear before it to bear witness, praising and saying: Excellent!'"

"After that Buddha accomplished the Way, when approaching extinction, in the midst of the great assembly of devas and humans, he addressed the bhikṣus: 'After my extinction, those who wish to make offerings to my complete body should erect a great stūpa.' Through that Buddha's spiritual powers and the power of his vow, throughout the worlds of the ten directions, in every place wherever someone expounds the Dharma Lotus Sutra, that jeweled stūpa surges forth and appears before him, with the complete body present within the stūpa, praising and saying: 'Excellent! Excellent!'"

"Mahāpratibhāna, now the stūpa of Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata, having heard the Dharma Lotus Sutra being expounded, has surged forth from the earth, praising and saying: 'Excellent! Excellent!'"

At that time Mahāpratibhāna Bodhisattva, through the Tathāgata's spiritual power, addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we wish to see the body of this Buddha." The Buddha addressed Mahāpratibhāna Bodhisattva-mahāsattva: "This Prabhūtaratna Buddha has a profound and weighty vow: 'If my jeweled stūpa, in order to hear the Dharma Lotus Sutra, appears before all Buddhas, and if there are those who wish to show my body to the fourfold assembly, then the division-bodies of that Buddha who are throughout the worlds of the ten directions expounding the Dharma must all return and assemble in one place—only then will my body manifest.'"

"Mahāpratibhāna, my division-bodies—those Buddhas who are throughout the worlds of the ten directions expounding the Dharma—should now assemble."

Mahāpratibhāna addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we also wish to see the World-Honored One's division-body Buddhas, to bow in worship and make offerings to them." At that time the Buddha emitted a single ray of light from his white tuft of hair. Immediately there were seen, in the eastern direction, five hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges' sands of lands, all those Buddhas. Those lands were all paved with lapis lazuli, adorned with jeweled trees and jeweled garments, filled throughout with immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of Bodhisattvas. Jeweled canopies were spread everywhere, and jeweled nets covered above. The Buddhas of those lands were expounding the various dharmas with great and wondrous sounds, and immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of Bodhisattvas were seen, pervading all those lands, expounding the Dharma for the multitudes. The southern, western, and northern directions, the four intermediate quarters, and above and below—wherever the light of the white tuft mark shone—all were likewise thus.

At that time all the Buddhas of the ten directions each addressed the multitudes of Bodhisattvas, saying: "Good sons, we should now proceed to the Sahā world, to Śākyamuni Buddha, and also make offerings to the jeweled stūpa of Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata." Thereupon the Sahā world immediately transformed into purity—the ground became lapis lazuli; it was adorned with jeweled trees; golden cords marked the eight paths. There were no villages, towns, cities, oceans, rivers, mountains, streams, or forests. Great jeweled incense was burned; mandārava flowers were strewn everywhere upon the ground. Jeweled nets and canopies covered above; precious bells were suspended. Only the assembly present was retained—the devas and humans were moved and placed in other lands. At that time all the Buddhas each brought one great Bodhisattva to serve as attendant, and arrived in the Sahā world, each proceeding to the base of a jeweled tree. Each jeweled tree was five hundred yojanas in height, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits magnificently adorned in sequence. Beneath all the jeweled trees there were lion-thrones, five yojanas in height, also magnificently decorated with great jewels. At that time all the Buddhas each sat in full lotus posture upon these thrones. Thus extending in succession, they filled the entire trichiliocosm. Yet the division-bodies from even one direction of Śākyamuni Buddha were still not all accommodated.

At that time Śākyamuni Buddha, wishing to accommodate his division-body Buddhas, in each of the eight directions again transformed two hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of lands, causing them all to be pure, without hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras. He also moved the devas and humans and placed them in other lands. The transformed lands were also paved with lapis lazuli and adorned with jeweled trees. The trees were five hundred yojanas in height, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits magnificently decorated in sequence. Beneath the trees there were jeweled lion-thrones, five yojanas in height, magnificently adorned with various jewels. There were also no great oceans, rivers, or Mount Mucilinda, Mahā-Mucilinda, the Iron Ring Mountains, the Great Iron Ring Mountains, Mount Sumeru, and other mountain kings. All were united as one Buddha-land. The jeweled ground was level and even; jeweled terraced canopies covered it throughout; banners and canopies were suspended; great jeweled incense was burned; heavenly jeweled flowers were strewn everywhere upon the ground.

Śākyamuni Buddha, in order that the Buddhas who were to come might have places to sit, again in each of the eight directions transformed two hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of lands, causing them all to be pure, without hells, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras. He also moved the devas and humans and placed them in other lands. The transformed lands were also paved with lapis lazuli and adorned with jeweled trees. The trees were five hundred yojanas in height, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits magnificently adorned in sequence. Beneath the trees there were jeweled lion-thrones, five yojanas in height, also magnificently decorated with great jewels. There were also no great oceans, rivers, or Mount Mucilinda, Mahā-Mucilinda, the Iron Ring Mountains, the Great Iron Ring Mountains, Mount Sumeru, and other mountain kings. All were united as one Buddha-land. The jeweled ground was level and even; jeweled terraced canopies covered it throughout; banners and canopies were suspended; great jeweled incense was burned; heavenly jeweled flowers were strewn everywhere upon the ground.

At that time the division-bodies of Śākyamuni Buddha from the eastern direction—from lands of hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges' sands—all those Buddhas each expounding the Dharma, came and assembled here. In this manner in sequence, all the Buddhas of the ten directions all came and assembled, sitting in the eight directions. At that time in each direction, the Buddhas, Tathāgatas of four hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of lands, pervaded and filled that entire space. At that time all those Buddhas each sat beneath a jeweled tree upon a lion-throne, and all sent attendants to inquire after Śākyamuni Buddha, each bearing handfuls of jeweled flowers and addressing them thus:

"Good son, you should proceed to Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa, to Śākyamuni Buddha, and convey our words thus: 'Are you free from illness and affliction? Are your strength and vitality peaceful and joyful? Are the Bodhisattvas and the śrāvaka multitude all peaceful and secure?' Scatter these jeweled flowers before the Buddha as an offering, and speak these words: 'That certain Buddha wishes to open this jeweled stūpa.'" All the Buddhas' dispatched envoys were likewise thus.

At that time Śākyamuni Buddha, seeing that his division-body Buddhas had all already come and assembled, each sitting upon a lion-throne, and hearing that all the Buddhas expressed the wish jointly to open the jeweled stūpa, immediately arose from his seat and abided in empty space. The entire fourfold assembly arose and stood, joining their palms, single-mindedly gazing at the Buddha. Thereupon Śākyamuni Buddha with his right finger opened the door of the seven-jeweled stūpa, issuing forth a great sound like removing a crossbar and opening the gate of a great city. Immediately the entire assembly all saw Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata within the jeweled stūpa, sitting upon a lion-throne, his complete body undispersed, as if he had entered meditative concentration. They also heard him speak these words: "Excellent! Excellent! Śākyamuni Buddha, you have well expounded this Dharma Lotus Sutra. I have come here in order to hear this sutra." At that time the fourfold assembly and others, seeing the Buddha who had become extinct immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas in the past speaking such words, praised this as unprecedented, and scattered accumulations of heavenly jeweled flowers upon Prabhūtaratna Buddha and Śākyamuni Buddha.

At that time Prabhūtaratna Buddha, within the jeweled stūpa, divided his seat in half and offered it to Śākyamuni Buddha, speaking these words: "Śākyamuni Buddha, take this seat." Immediately Śākyamuni Buddha entered that stūpa, sat upon half the seat, and sat in full lotus posture. At that time the great assembly, seeing the two Tathāgatas upon the lion-throne within the seven-jeweled stūpa sitting in full lotus posture, each had this thought: "The Buddha's seat is lofty and far away. We pray the Tathāgata, through his spiritual powers, may cause all of us to abide together in empty space." Immediately Śākyamuni Buddha, through his spiritual powers, received all the great assembly into empty space. With a great voice he universally addressed the fourfold assembly: "Who is able broadly to expound the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra in this Sahā world? Now is precisely the time. The Tathāgata will soon enter nirvāṇa. The Buddha wishes to entrust this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra to someone."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"The holy lord, the World-Honored One,
Though long extinct,
Within the jeweled stūpa
Still comes for the sake of the Dharma.

"How can people
Not strive diligently for the Dharma?
This Buddha became extinct
Immeasurable countless kalpas ago,

"Yet in place after place he hears the Dharma,
Because it is difficult to encounter.
That Buddha's original vow was:
'After my extinction,

"'Wherever I go,
It shall constantly be to hear the Dharma.'
Moreover my division-bodies—
Immeasurable Buddhas

"Numerous as Ganges' sands—
Come wishing to hear the Dharma,
And to see the extinct
Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata.

"Each abandoning their wondrous lands,
And their multitudes of disciples,
The devas, humans, dragons, spirits,
And all manner of offerings,

"In order to cause the Dharma to abide long,
They have come here.
To provide seats for all the Buddhas,
Through spiritual powers

"They have moved immeasurable multitudes,
Causing the lands to be pure.
Each Buddha, one by one,
Proceeds beneath jeweled trees—

"Like pure ponds
Adorned with lotus flowers.
Beneath those jeweled trees,
Upon all the lion-thrones,

"The Buddhas sit upon them,
Magnificently adorned with radiance—
Like in the darkness of night
Great torches are kindled.

"Their bodies emit wondrous fragrances
Pervading lands in the ten directions.
Living beings, receiving this perfume,
Rejoice beyond self-control—

"Like a great wind
Blowing small tree branches.
Through this skillful means
They cause the Dharma to abide long.

"I address the great assembly:
After my extinction,
Who is able to guard, uphold,
Read, and expound this sutra?

"Now before the Buddha
Let them speak their vow.
Though Prabhūtaratna Buddha
Was long extinct,

"Through his great vow
He roars the lion's roar.
Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata
And also my own body,

"And all the assembled emanation Buddhas—
You should understand this meaning.
All you Buddha-sons:
Who is able to guard the Dharma?

"One should arouse the great vow,
Causing it to abide long.
Those who are able to guard
This sutra Dharma

"Thereby make offerings
To me and to Prabhūtaratna.
This Prabhūtaratna Buddha,
Abiding in the jeweled stūpa,

"Constantly traveling throughout the ten directions
For the sake of this sutra—
One also thereby makes offerings
To all the emanation Buddhas who have come,

"Magnificently adorning with radiance
All these worlds.
If one expounds this sutra,
One thereby sees me,

"Prabhūtaratna Tathāgata,
And all the emanation Buddhas.
All you good sons,
Each reflect carefully:

"This is a difficult matter—
One should arouse the great vow.
The remaining sutras
Numerous as Ganges' sands—

"Though one expounds all these,
It is still not sufficient to be considered difficult.
If one were to grasp Mount Sumeru
And hurl it to another region,

"To immeasurable Buddha-lands,
This also would not be difficult.
If with the toe of one's foot
One were to move the great trichiliocosm,

"Casting it far to another land,
This also would not be difficult.
If one were to stand at the summit of existence
And for the multitude expound

"Immeasurable remaining sutras,
This also would not be difficult.
But if after the Buddha's extinction,
In an evil age,

"One is able to expound this sutra—
This, then, is difficult.
Suppose there were a person
Who grasped empty space in his hand

"And traveled about with it—
This also would not be difficult.
After my extinction,
If one oneself transcribes and upholds it,

"Or causes another to transcribe it—
This, then, is difficult.
If one were to take the great earth
And place it upon a toenail,

"Ascending to the Brahma heaven,
This also would not be difficult.
After the Buddha's extinction,
In an evil age,

"Briefly to read this sutra—
This, then, is difficult.
Suppose when the kalpa burns,
One bears a load of dry grass,

"Enters into it without being burned—
This also would not be difficult.
After my extinction,
If one upholds this sutra

"And expounds it for even one person—
This, then, is difficult.
If one were to uphold the eighty thousand
Four thousand Dharma treasuries,

"The twelve divisions of sutras,
Expounding them for people,
Causing all the listeners
To attain the six spiritual powers—

"Though one could do thus,
It would still not be difficult.
After my extinction,
To listen to and receive this sutra,

"Inquiring into its meaning and purport—
This, then, is difficult.
If a person expounds the Dharma,
Causing thousands of myriads of koṭis,

"Immeasurable, innumerable
Multitudes numerous as Ganges' sands
To attain arhatship,
Complete with the six spiritual powers—

"Though there be such benefit,
This also would not be difficult.
After my extinction,
If one is able reverently to uphold

"Such a sutra as this—
This, then, is difficult.
For the sake of the Buddha-Way,
Throughout immeasurable lands,

"From the beginning until now,
I have broadly expounded various sutras—
Yet among all of them,
This sutra is foremost.

"If one is able to uphold it,
One thereby upholds the Buddha's body.
All you good sons,
After my extinction,

"Who is able to receive, uphold,
And read and recite this sutra?
Now before the Buddha
Let them speak their vow.

"This sutra is difficult to uphold;
If one upholds it even briefly,
I shall then rejoice,
And all Buddhas likewise.

"Such a person as this
Is praised by all Buddhas.
This is valor;
This is vigor.

"This is called upholding the precepts,
Practicing the dhūta austerities.
One thereby swiftly attains
The supreme Buddha-Way.

"One who in a future age
Is able to read and uphold this sutra
Is a true Buddha-son,
Abiding in the ground of pure goodness.

"After the Buddha's extinction,
One able to understand its meaning
Is the eye
Of the devas, humans, and world.

"In a frightening world,
To be able to expound even briefly—
All devas and humans
Should make offerings."
