# Chapter 10: The Dharma Teacher

*法師品第十*

At that time the World-Honored One, through Medicine King Bodhisattva, addressed the eighty thousand great beings: "Medicine King, do you see in this great assembly the immeasurable devas, dragon kings, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans, as well as bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās—those seeking to be śrāvakas, those seeking to be Pratyekabuddhas, and those seeking the Buddha-Way? All such classes as these, in the Buddha's presence, hearing even a single verse or a single phrase of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra, or even having a single thought of rejoicing—to all of them I bestow predictions that they shall attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

The Buddha addressed Medicine King: "Moreover, after the Tathāgata's extinction, if there are persons who hear even a single verse or a single phrase of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra and have a single thought of rejoicing, I also bestow upon them the prediction of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. If furthermore there are persons who accept, uphold, read, recite, explain, or transcribe the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra—even a single verse—and toward this sutra roll regard it with reverence as they would the Buddha, making various offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners, garments, and music, and even joining their palms in reverence—Medicine King, you should know that such persons have already made offerings to hundreds of thousands of koṭis of Buddhas, and in the presence of all Buddhas have perfected great vows. Out of compassion for living beings, they are born in this human realm."

"Medicine King, if someone asks, 'What living beings in a future age shall be able to become Buddhas?'—one should show them that these persons in the future age shall certainly become Buddhas. Why is this? If good sons or good daughters, regarding the Dharma Lotus Sutra—even a single phrase—accept, uphold, read, recite, explain, or transcribe it, and make various offerings to the sutra roll with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners, garments, and music, joining their palms in reverence—such persons are worthy of being gazed upon with reverence by the entire world, and should be made offerings to with Tathāgata offerings. You should know that such persons are great Bodhisattvas who have accomplished anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Out of compassion for living beings, they have vowed to be born here to broadly expound and discriminate the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra. How much more so those who can completely accept, uphold, and make various offerings to it!"

"Medicine King, you should know that such persons have relinquished their pure karmic rewards, and after my extinction, out of compassion for living beings, have been born in this evil world to broadly expound this sutra. If such good sons or good daughters, after my extinction, are able secretly to expound the Dharma Lotus Sutra to even one person—even a single phrase—you should know that such persons are envoys of the Tathāgata, dispatched by the Tathāgata to carry out the Tathāgata's work. How much more so those who in the midst of great assemblies broadly expound it for people!"

"Medicine King, if there are evil persons who, with unwholesome minds, for an entire kalpa manifest themselves before the Buddha constantly reviling the Buddha, their offense would still be light. But if a person uses even a single evil word to slander lay or monastic persons who read and recite the Dharma Lotus Sutra, that offense is extremely grave."

"Medicine King, those who read and recite the Dharma Lotus Sutra—you should know that such persons adorn themselves with the Buddha's adornments, and are borne upon the Tathāgata's shoulders. Wherever they go, one should turn toward them and bow, single-mindedly joining palms in reverence and making offerings, honoring and praising them, with flowers, incense, necklaces, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners, garments, and delicacies, performing various kinds of music—the supreme offerings of the human realm should be offered to them. Heavenly treasures should be scattered upon them; heavenly jeweled accumulations should be presented as offerings. Why is this? Because such persons joyfully expound the Dharma, and if one hears it even briefly, one immediately attains ultimate anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"If one wishes to abide in the Buddha-Way
And accomplish spontaneous wisdom,
One should constantly diligently make offerings
To those who accept and uphold the Dharma Lotus.

"Those who wish swiftly to attain
The wisdom of all modes
Should accept and uphold this sutra,
And also make offerings to those who uphold it.

"If there are those able to accept and uphold
The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra,
Know that they are the Buddha's envoys,
Compassionately mindful of all living beings.

"All those able to accept and uphold
The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra
Have abandoned pure lands—
Out of compassion for beings, they are born here.

"You should know that such persons
Are free in where they vow to be born,
Able in this evil world
To broadly expound the supreme Dharma.

"One should with heavenly flowers and incense,
And heavenly jeweled garments,
Heavenly wondrous jeweled accumulations,
Make offerings to those who expound the Dharma.

"In the evil world after my extinction,
Those able to uphold this sutra—
One should join palms and bow in reverence,
As in making offerings to the World-Honored One.

"Supreme delicacies and sweet offerings,
And various kinds of garments—
Make offerings to this Buddha-son,
Hoping to hear even briefly.

"If in a later age
One is able to accept and uphold this sutra,
I send him among humans
To carry out the Tathāgata's work.

"If throughout an entire kalpa
One constantly harbors an unwholesome mind,
Makes angry faces and reviles the Buddha,
One incurs immeasurable grave offenses.

"But those who read, recite, and uphold
This Dharma Lotus Sutra—
If one briefly speaks an evil word against them,
That offense far exceeds the former.

"If someone seeks the Buddha-Way
And throughout an entire kalpa,
Joins palms before me
And praises me with immeasurable verses,

"Through thus praising the Buddha,
One gains immeasurable merit.
But one who praises those who uphold the sutra—
That merit far exceeds the former.

"Throughout eighty koṭi kalpas,
With the most wondrous forms, sounds,
And also scents, tastes, and tangibles,
One makes offerings to those who uphold the sutra.

"Having made such offerings,
If one is able to hear even briefly,
One should then rejoice in oneself:
'I now have gained great benefit!'

"Medicine King, I now inform you:
Of all the sutras I have expounded,
Among these sutras,
The Dharma Lotus is foremost."

At that time the Buddha again addressed Medicine King Bodhisattva-mahāsattva: "The sutras I have expounded are immeasurable thousands of myriads of koṭis. Those already expounded, now being expounded, and to be expounded in the future—among all of them, this Dharma Lotus Sutra is the most difficult to believe and difficult to understand. Medicine King, this sutra is the secret essential treasury of all Buddhas. It must not be distributed or recklessly transmitted to people. It is guarded and protected by all Buddhas, World-Honored Ones. From ancient times until now, it has never been clearly expounded. Moreover, this sutra, even while the Tathāgata is present, arouses much resentment and jealousy—how much more so after his extinction!"

"Medicine King, you should know that after the Tathāgata's extinction, those able to transcribe, uphold, read, recite, make offerings to, and expound it for others—the Tathāgata shall cover them with his robe, and they shall also be protected and kept in mind by Buddhas of other regions who are presently abiding. Such persons possess great power of faith, power of aspiration, and power of wholesome roots. You should know that such persons dwell together with the Tathāgata, and the Tathāgata places his hand upon their heads."

"Medicine King, in whatever place—whether one expounds, reads, recites, or transcribes it, or wherever the sutra roll abides—one should erect a stūpa of the seven jewels, making it extremely lofty, vast, and magnificently adorned. There is no need to further enshrine relics within it. Why is this? Within it there already exists the Tathāgata's complete body. This stūpa should be made offerings to, revered, honored, and praised with all manner of flowers, incense, necklaces, silk canopies, banners, music, and songs. If people are able to see this stūpa, bow in worship, and make offerings, you should know that all such persons draw near to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

"Medicine King, many persons—whether lay or monastic—practice the Bodhisattva-Way. If they are unable to see, hear, read, recite, transcribe, uphold, or make offerings to this Dharma Lotus Sutra, you should know that such persons have not yet skillfully practiced the Bodhisattva-Way. If there are those who are able to hear this sutra, then they are able skillfully to practice the Bodhisattva-Way. Those living beings who seek the Buddha-Way—if they see or hear this Dharma Lotus Sutra, and having heard it believe, understand, and accept it—you should know that such persons draw near to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

"Medicine King, suppose there were a person thirsty and in need of water who, on a high plateau, dug seeking it. While still seeing dry earth, he would know the water was still far away. But applying effort without cease, progressively seeing moist earth and then gradually reaching mud, his mind would be resolute and certain, knowing water must be near. Bodhisattvas are also thus. If they have not heard, not understood, and are not able to cultivate and practice this Dharma Lotus Sutra, you should know that such persons are still far from anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. If they are able to hear, understand, reflect upon, and cultivate it, you must know they certainly draw near to anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Why is this? All Bodhisattvas' anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi belongs to this sutra. This sutra opens the door of skillful means and reveals the characteristic of true reality. This Dharma Lotus treasury is profound, solid, secluded, and far-reaching—none can reach it. Now the Buddha teaches, transforms, and perfects Bodhisattvas, opening and revealing it for them."

"Medicine King, if there are Bodhisattvas who, upon hearing this Dharma Lotus Sutra, are startled, doubtful, and fearful, you should know they are newly-aspiring Bodhisattvas. If śrāvakas, upon hearing this sutra, are startled, doubtful, and fearful, you should know they are persons of overweening pride. Medicine King, if there are good sons or good daughters who, after the Tathāgata's extinction, wish to expound this Dharma Lotus Sutra for the fourfold assembly, how should they expound it? Such good sons or good daughters should enter the Tathāgata's chamber, wear the Tathāgata's robe, and sit upon the Tathāgata's seat—only then should they broadly expound this sutra for the fourfold assembly. The Tathāgata's chamber is the mind of great compassion among all living beings. The Tathāgata's robe is the mind of gentleness and patient endurance. The Tathāgata's seat is the emptiness of all dharmas. Peacefully abiding in these, and then with a mind free from indolence, one should broadly expound this Dharma Lotus Sutra for Bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly."

"Medicine King, in other lands I send conjured persons to gather audiences to hear the Dharma for them. I also send conjured bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās to listen to the Dharma exposition. These conjured persons, hearing the Dharma, believe, accept, and comply with it without opposition. If the Dharma teacher is in a secluded place, I at that time broadly send devas, dragons, spirits and gods, gandharvas, asuras, and others to listen to the Dharma exposition. Though I may be in another land, I from time to time cause the Dharma teacher to see my body. If regarding this sutra he forgets lines and verses, I then again expound it for him, causing him to be complete."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"One who wishes to cast aside all indolence
Should listen to this sutra—
This sutra is difficult to hear,
And believers and accepters are also rare.

"It is like a person thirsty and needing water,
Who digs seeking it on a high plateau.
While still seeing dry and parched earth,
He knows he is still far from water.

"Progressively seeing moist earth and mud,
He is resolute in knowing water is near.
Medicine King, you should know:
All such persons as these,

"Not hearing the Dharma Lotus Sutra,
Are very far from the Buddha's wisdom.
If they hear this profound sutra—
Which determines and clarifies the śrāvaka Dharma,

"This king of all sutras—
Having heard it, they reflect carefully,
You should know that such persons
Draw near to the Buddha's wisdom.

"If a person expounds this sutra,
He should enter the Tathāgata's chamber,
Wear the Tathāgata's robe,
And sit upon the Tathāgata's seat.

"Fearless when among the multitude,
He broadly discriminates and expounds.
Great compassion is the chamber;
Gentleness and patient endurance, the robe;

"The emptiness of all dharmas, the seat—
Abiding in this, he expounds the Dharma.
If when this sutra is being expounded
Someone speaks evil words or curses,

"Or adds swords, staves, tiles, or stones—
Mindful of the Buddha, one should endure.
Throughout thousands of myriads of koṭis of lands,
I manifest my pure, solid body.

"Throughout immeasurable koṭi kalpas,
I expound the Dharma for living beings.
If after my extinction
One is able to expound this sutra,

"I send conjured fourfold assemblies—
Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs,
And pure laymen and laywomen—
To make offerings to the Dharma teacher.

"Leading and guiding all living beings,
Gathering them to cause them to hear the Dharma.
If persons wish to add harm—
With swords, staves, tiles, and stones—

"I then send conjured persons
To serve as their guards and protectors.
If the Dharma teacher
Is alone in a secluded place,

"In solitude without human voices,
Reading and reciting this sutra,
I at that time manifest for him
A pure, luminous body.

"If he forgets passages or phrases,
I expound them for him, causing him to be proficient.
If a person possesses these virtues,
Whether expounding for the fourfold assembly

"Or in a secluded place reading and reciting the sutra,
All shall be able to see my body.
If a person is in a secluded place,
I send the dragon kings of the heavens,

"Yakṣas, spirits and gods, and others
To form an audience to hear the Dharma.
Such persons delight in expounding the Dharma,
Discriminating without impediment.

"Because all Buddhas protect and keep them in mind,
They are able to cause great assemblies to rejoice.
If one draws near to Dharma teachers,
One swiftly attains the Bodhisattva-Way.

"By following and learning from such teachers,
One shall see Buddhas numerous as Ganges' sands."
