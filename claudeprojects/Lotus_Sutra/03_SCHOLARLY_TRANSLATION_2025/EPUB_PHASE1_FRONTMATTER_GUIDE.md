ABOUT THE CLASSICAL CHINESE TEXT

This translation is based on the Sanskrit-to-Chinese translation of
Kumārajīva (鳩摩羅什), accomplished in 406 CE at Chang'an. Kumārajīva's
version became the most widely-used rendering of the Lotus Sutra in
East Asian Buddhism and remains the standard source text for this
translation.

---

ABOUT DIACRITICAL MARKS

This edition preserves Sanskrit diacritical marks essential to proper
transliteration of Buddhist philosophical and personal names:

ā = macron (long a): Tathāgata, śāriputra
ī = macron (long i): Mañjuśrī
ū = macron (long u): upāya
ṇ = dot below (retroflexed n): Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya
ś = cedilla (palatal s): Śāriputra, Mañjuśrī
ṃ = dot below (nasal m): sambodhi

These marks ensure proper pronunciation and maintain scholarly
accuracy for readers consulting other Buddhist texts.
