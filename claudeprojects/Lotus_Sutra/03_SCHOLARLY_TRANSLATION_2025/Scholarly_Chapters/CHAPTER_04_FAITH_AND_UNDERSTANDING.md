## CHAPTER 4: FAITH AND UNDERSTANDING

### The Four Great Disciples' Joy and Recognition

At that time, the wise Subhūti, Mahākātyāyana, Mahākāśyapa, and Mahāmaudgalyāyana, having heard from the Buddha this unprecedented teaching, with the World-Honored One granting prophecy of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi to Śāriputra, their hearts were moved with wonder and delight. They immediately rose from their seats, straightened their robes, uncovered their right shoulders in respectful posture, knelt upon their right knees, unified their minds by placing their palms together in reverent salutation, bowed deeply in respect, gazed upon the Buddha's countenance with undivided attention, and addressed the Buddha:

"World-Honored One, we are elders among the assembled monks, advanced in age, and we have long believed that we had already attained nirvāṇa and had no further capacity for spiritual attainment. We harbored no aspiration to advance toward anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"World-Honored One, in ages past when you taught the dharma at length, we sat in the assembly, but our bodies were weary and lethargic. We contemplated only emptiness, signlessness, and non-activity. Regarding the Bodhisattva dharma—the display of supernatural powers, the purification of Buddha-lands, and the perfection of sentient beings—our hearts did not delight in these teachings. Why was this?

"The World-Honored One caused us to escape from the three worlds and attain the realization of nirvāṇa. Moreover, at this time we are advanced in age. Toward the Buddha's teaching and transformation of Bodhisattvas aspiring to anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, we have not generated even a single thought of joy.

"Yet now, before the Buddha, we have heard the prophecy that we too shall attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi as Śrāvakas (voice-hearers). Our hearts are extremely joyful—we have experienced what we had never experienced before. We did not anticipate that at this time we would suddenly hear such a rare teaching. We deeply rejoice and feel that we have obtained great benefit, acquiring precious treasures without having sought them."¹

### The Parable of the Prodigal Son: Introduction

"World-Honored One, we now wish to speak in parable to clarify this meaning:

"There was a man who, in his youth, ignorant and without understanding, abandoned his father and fled, dwelling in another land for a long time—ten, twenty, or even fifty years.² In his advancing age, he became impoverished and, wandering in all directions seeking clothing and food, gradually traveled and eventually arrived near his native land.

"His father, having long sought to find his son without success, had settled in a certain city. His household was immensely wealthy, with treasures beyond measure—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, coral, amber, crystal, pearls—all his storehouses completely filled and overflowing. He had numerous servants, officials, retainers, and common people. He possessed countless elephants, horses, chariots, ox-carts, and sheep. His wealth was engaged in business, spreading throughout other lands, and there were many merchants and traders. His father's thoughts constantly turned to his lost son.

"At that time, the impoverished son, seeking employment and wandering through villages and traveling through districts, eventually arrived at the city where his father had settled. His father had long mourned his son, and he and his son had been separated for more than fifty years. Yet the father never spoke of this matter to others. He merely thought within himself, harboring regret in his heart. He contemplated: 'I am old and approaching the end of life. I possess abundant wealth and treasures—gold, silver, precious jewels—my storehouses are completely full. But I have no son to whom I can entrust these riches. One day I shall die, and my wealth shall scatter and be lost with nothing to which it can be consigned. This is why I am constantly concerned and every moment remember my son.'

"Furthermore, he formed this thought: 'If I could only obtain my son and entrust him with my wealth, I would be at ease and happiness, without further worries.'"³

### The Encounter: The Son Becomes Afraid

"World-Honored One, at that time the impoverished son, having hired himself to various employers, eventually arrived at his father's dwelling. He stood beside the gate. From a distance, he saw his father, seated upon a magnificent throne, his feet resting upon a precious footrest. Brahmins, nobles, and merchants all paid him respectful reverence. His body was adorned with pearls and precious ornaments worth thousands of millions of coins. Officials, servants, and retainers held white fly-whisks, standing to his left and right. A jeweled canopy was suspended above him, with precious flower banners hanging down. Fragrant water had been sprinkled on the ground, and precious flowers were scattered about. Precious objects were arrayed in display, brought in and taken out for distribution. Such was the variety of his magnificent adornment, and his authority and dignity were specially exalted.

"The impoverished son, seeing his father possessed of such great power and majesty, immediately became filled with fear and regret for having come to this place. He secretly formed this thought:

"'This man may be a king or the equal of a king. He is certainly not a place where I can earn a livelihood through manual labor. It would be better for me to go to a poor village where I might have a place to exert my strength, where food and clothing can be easily obtained. If I remain here for a long time, I might be constrained and forced to labor.'

"Forming this thought, he hastily fled."⁴

---

### The Father's Recognition and Gentle Retrieval

"At that time the wealthy householder, seated upon his throne, recognized his son immediately and his heart was filled with great joy. He formed this thought:

"'Now I have someone to whom I can entrust my wealth and treasures. I have constantly thought of this son, yet had no means to see him. Unexpectedly, he has come—this accords perfectly with my wish. Although I am advanced in age, my desires remain strong.'

"He immediately sent attendants to pursue and bring back his son. At that moment, the messenger hastily ran after the poor son to capture him. The poor son, startled and alarmed, cried out in protest:

"'I have committed no offense against you—why do you seize me?'

"The messenger held him even more tightly and forcibly dragged him back. At that time, the poor son, thinking that he had committed no transgression yet was being imprisoned and seized, believed his death was certain, and his terror increased. He became unconscious and collapsed to the ground.

"The father, observing this from a distance, instructed the messenger:

"'Release this person! Do not forcibly bring him. Sprinkle cold water on his face to revive him, and do not speak to him further.'

"Why was this? The father understood that his son, possessed of inferior spiritual capacity, was intimidated by the father's power and wealth, which the son found difficult to comprehend. Although the father clearly knew this was indeed his son, he employed skilful means, not telling other people that this was his son.

"The messenger told the son:

"'I now release you. Go wherever you wish.'

"The poor son was delighted to obtain what he had not expected. He rose from the ground and went to a poor village, seeking employment and food."⁵

---

### The Father's Strategy: Gradual Approach

"At that time, the householder, desiring to entice and guide his son through the employment of skilful means, secretly sent two people of humble appearance, without power or prestige:

"'You may go to that place and gradually speak to the poor son, saying: "This place has work available. We shall pay you double wages. If the poor son accepts, bring him here and have him work. If he asks what kind of work it is, tell him: 'We shall hire you to clean excrement. We two shall also work with you.'"'

"The two messengers immediately sought out the poor son, and having found him, explained everything in detail. At that time, the poor son, first receiving payment, immediately began cleaning excrement with them.

"His father, observing his son, felt compassion and was amazed. On another day, peering through a window, the father saw his son—thin and gaunt, his appearance withered and shrunk, his body covered with filth and dust, unclean. Immediately the father removed his ornaments, fine clothing, and adornments, and instead put on coarse, worn, dirty garments, his body covered with dust. Holding a dung-removal implement in his right hand, with an expression showing reverence, he instructed the workers:

"'You all must work diligently without laziness!'

"By employing skilful means in this way, he was able to draw near his son. Later, he spoke to the son:

"'Listen, young man! You should continue this work here. Do not leave to seek other employment. I shall increase your wages. Whatever you need—bowls, rice, noodles, salt, vinegar, and such things—do not hesitate to ask. We have old, worn servants who can provide whatever you need. Make yourself comfortable. I am to you as a father. Do not worry further. Why is this? I am old and advanced in years, while you are young and vigorous. When you work, you show neither deception nor laziness, neither anger nor complaint. I see no such faults in you as I see in other workers. From this time forward, I shall regard you as a son.'

"At that moment, the householder gave him a new name, calling him 'child.' At that time, the poor son, although delighted by this favorable treatment, still regarded himself as a hired servant. Because of this, for twenty years, he continued to clean excrement. After this period had passed, his mind gradually grew familiar and trusting. He came and went without hindrance, yet he still remained in his former dwelling place."⁶

---

### The Father's Deathbed Revelation

"World-Honored One, at that time the householder became ill, and knowing that death was approaching, he spoke to his son:

"'I now possess abundant gold, silver, and precious treasures, and my storehouses are completely filled. I know precisely how much is there and what should be given and taken. You should understand all of this. My heart is thus. You should comprehend this intention. Why? Now I and you are not different—you should apply your heart fully so that nothing is lost.'

"At that time the poor son, having received the instruction, took charge of all the treasures, gold, silver, precious jewels, and storehouses, yet harbored no hope of taking even a single meal's worth. Yet his dwelling place still remained his former location, and he had not yet abandoned his sense of inferiority. After another brief period, the father understood his son's mind was gradually becoming broader and more expansive, and he had achieved a noble aspiration, scorning his former inferior thoughts.

"At the time approaching the father's death, he summoned his son together with his relatives, the king, great ministers, nobles, and wealthy merchants—all having assembled—and he himself made this declaration:

"'All you gentlemen should know: This is my son, whom I fathered. In a certain city, he abandoned me and fled. For more than fifty years, impoverished and suffering hardship, he has been lost. His original name is [such and such], and my name is [such and such]. Long ago in my native city, filled with concern, I sought for him, but suddenly, unexpectedly, I encountered and found him in this place. This is truly my son, and I am truly his father. All my wealth and possessions are now his. All that I previously gave out and took in, he now knows.'

"World-Honored One, at that time the poor son, hearing these words of his father, was suddenly overwhelmed with great joy and experienced what he had never experienced before. He formed this thought:

"'I never harbored any thought of seeking or hoping for anything, yet now this treasury of precious wealth has naturally come to me.'"⁷

---

### The Interpretation: The Buddha's Application

"World-Honored One, the wealthy householder is the Tathāgata. We all, in like manner, are Buddha-children. The Tathāgata constantly speaks of us as his children.

"World-Honored One, we have undergone the three sufferings within birth and death, experiencing various afflictions, confusion, and ignorance, delighting in and clinging to the small dharma. Today the World-Honored One has caused us to contemplate and abandon the excrement of conceptual elaboration regarding all dharmas. We diligently cultivated within this, obtaining the single day's wage of nirvāṇa, and, having obtained this, our hearts were greatly joyful. We believed this was a great attainment and said to ourselves: 'Through diligent cultivation in the Buddha's dharma, what we have obtained is abundant.'

"However, the World-Honored One previously knew that our hearts were attached to inferior desires and delighted in the small dharma. He therefore allowed us to cease, without making distinctions, that you would all share in the treasury of the Tathāgata's wisdom and vision. The World-Honored One, through the power of skilful means, explained the Buddha-wisdom, and we, from the Buddha, obtained the single day's wage of nirvāṇa, regarding it as a great attainment. Toward this great vehicle, we have harbored no aspirational seeking.

"We likewise, because of the Tathāgata's wisdom, have disclosed and explained the Bodhisattva dharma to the various Bodhisattvas, yet we ourselves have harbored no aspiration. Why? Because the Buddha knew that our hearts delight in the small dharma, through the power of skilful means and following our capacities, the Buddha taught us. Yet we did not know that we were truly Buddha-children.

"Now we truly understand that the World-Honored One harbors no stinginess regarding the Buddha-wisdom. Why? We have truly been Buddha-children since ancient times, yet have only delighted in the small dharma. If we had harbored the heart of delight in the great, the Buddha would have taught us the great-vehicle dharma. In this sutra, only the One Vehicle is taught, whereas in the past, before the Bodhisattvas, we disparaged the voice-hearers who delight in the small dharma. Yet the Buddha truly employed the great vehicle to teach and transform us. Therefore, we say: We originally harbored no aspiration to seek anything. Now the precious dharma-king treasure has naturally come to us, and all that Buddha-children should obtain, we have already obtained."⁸

## SCHOLARLY APPARATUS

### Footnote Commentary

1. **"We have long believed that we had already attained nirvāṇa"** (自謂已得涅槃): This opening statement establishes the disciples' fundamental misunderstanding—they believed they had reached the ultimate goal when in fact they had only achieved an intermediate realization. This sets up the parable's theme of false contentment transformed into recognition of higher potential.

2. **"Fifty years"** (五十餘年): The fifty-year separation symbolizes an immense span of time, representing the countless ages through which sentient beings remain separated from Buddha-nature through ignorance. The specific number may also reference the fifty stages of the bodhisattva path.

    *Numerological Significance*: In Buddhist cosmology, significant time periods are often numbered with symbolic meaning. Fifty represents a complete cycle.

3. **"I shall be at ease and happiness"** (坦然快樂): The father's contemplation reveals his deepening awareness that material wealth means nothing without an heir to receive it. This parallels the Buddha's realization that teaching must be transmitted to prepare beings for ultimate realization, not merely enjoyed personally.

4. **"He hastily fled"** (疾走而去): The son's flight despite the father's magnificence illustrates the principle that those bound by limited consciousness cannot immediately comprehend greater realities. Sudden revelation of one's true nature would overwhelm and destroy the unprepared self-concept.

    *Psychological Principle*: This reflects contemporary psychological understanding that radical transformation of self-image requires gradual preparation, not sudden confrontation.

5. **"He became unconscious and collapsed"** (悶絕躄地): The son's psychological collapse when seized reflects the trauma of confronting one's true nature before adequate preparation. The father's compassionate intervention prevents psychological destruction through traumatic awakening.

    *Therapeutic Significance*: This illustrates the Buddhist principle of skillful means as psychological wisdom—truth presented at the wrong pace becomes harmful rather than liberating.

6. **"For twenty years, he continued to clean excrement"** (於二十年中、常令除糞): The twenty-year period of humble work parallels the long cultivation of discipline and ethical training necessary before one can bear the weight of ultimate truth. The "excrement" symbolizes the cleansing of mental defilements.

    *Symbolic Meaning*: In Buddhist psychology, excrement represents mental obscurations—greed, hatred, and delusion—which must be continuously processed and eliminated on the path to enlightenment.

7. **"This treasury of precious wealth has naturally come to me"** (今此寶藏自然而至): The son's realization that he never needed to seek—the wealth was always his birthright—reflects the Lotus Sutra's central teaching that Buddha-nature is intrinsic, not acquired through effort. The treasure comes "naturally" because it was always his inheritance.

    *Metaphysical Principle*: This expresses the non-dualistic teaching that enlightenment is not attainment of something external but revelation of what already exists.

9. **"They immediately rose from their seats"** (即從座起): The formal ritual of rising and respectful bodily posturing demonstrates the Buddhist principle that physical action accompanies and reinforces mental commitment. This parallels contemporary neuroscience research on embodied cognition—that bodily states influence mental states and intention manifestation.

10. **"Uncovered their right shoulders in respectful posture"** (偏袒右肩): This specific gesture (parivrta), found throughout Buddhist texts, symbolizes the disciple's readiness for action and service. The right side represents positive karma and blessing in Buddhist iconography.

11. **"Knelt upon their right knees"** (右膝著地): The asymmetrical kneeling posture suggests readiness for either sitting meditation or immediate action. This reflects the complementary principles of stillness and activity in Buddhist practice.

12. **"Unified their minds by placing their palms together"** (合掌): The hand gesture of pressed palms (añjali mudra) represents bringing together of opposing principles—self and other, individual and universal. This bilateral symmetry may activate whole-brain integration.

13. **"Advanced in age"** (年已老邁): The disciples' advanced age carries significance: they have spent decades cultivating discipline, yet only now recognize the true scope of their capacity. Enlightenment timing is determined by karmic ripeness, not chronological time.

14. **"Bodies were weary and lethargic"** (身體疲勞): Physical weariness parallels psychological exhaustion—the fatigue of limited understanding. The disciples worked within invisible constraints until the Buddha's revelation.

15. **"Emptiness, signlessness, and non-activity"** (空無相無作): These represent the three doors to liberation (śūnyatā-dvāra, ānimitta-dvāra, apraṇihita-dvāra), emphasizing passive cessation rather than active enlightenment. The Lotus Sutra surpasses these as insufficient.

16. **"Supernatural powers"** (神通變化): In Buddhist context, these (abhijñā) represent natural capacities from enlightened mind, not magic. They represent higher possibilities beyond the disciples' previous limited vision.

17. **"Purification of Buddha-lands"** (淨佛國土): This concept (Buddha-kṣetra-viśuddhi) teaches that enlightened activity transforms environmental conditions. This parallels systems theory—how individual consciousness affects systemic reality.

18. **"Perfection of sentient beings"** (成就眾生): Maturation of beings (sattvā-paripācana) represents the bodhisattva's essential function, moving beyond personal enlightenment toward collective liberation.

19. **"The three worlds"** (三界): Buddhist cosmology divides reality into desire-realm (kāma-dhātu), form-realm (rūpa-dhātu), and formless-realm (ārupya-dhātu). Escape from these was the limited goal before this revelation.

20. **"Ignorant and without understanding, abandoned his father"** (幼稚無知): This parallels avidyā—fundamental misunderstanding of reality, not mere intellectual error but perceptual distortion. Similar to Plato's cave allegory.

21. **"Dwelling in another land for a long time"** (住於他國): Variable time periods suggest that separation from truth varies by individual karma. Some beings take longer to return to Buddha-nature based on karmic conditioning.

22. **"Impoverished, seeking clothing and food"** (窮困賣力): Material poverty represents psychological poverty. This reflects the First Noble Truth—that conditioned existence inherently lacks satisfaction.

23. **"Father's thoughts constantly turned to his lost son"** (父母追念): The father's constant awareness parallels the Buddha's perpetual compassionate presence toward all beings, even those unaware of enlightenment.

24. **"Enumeration of treasures"** (金銀琉璃等): The seven precious substances (sapta ratna) represent complete Buddha-wisdom. Each has symbolic meaning in Buddhist aesthetics representing different aspects of enlightenment.

25. **"Skilled means employed throughout"** (方便說法): The entire parable exemplifies upaya—skillful means adapted to each disciple's capacity. This demonstrates that teaching is not static but dynamically responsive to the learner's condition.

8. **"All that Buddha-children should obtain, we have already obtained"** (如佛子所應得者、皆已得之): This concluding statement affirms the complete equality of the disciples with all Buddhist practitioners. The limitation of Arhatship to personal liberation is overcome; they now recognize their capacity for full Buddhahood.

## THEMATIC DEVELOPMENT: THE PRODIGAL SON PARABLE

### Structure and Meaning

The Prodigal Son parable operates on multiple levels:

**Level 1: The Literal Story**
A son abandons his father, becomes impoverished, and eventually discovers his birthright of infinite wealth.

**Level 2: The Psychological Journey**
A being of limited self-concept gradually develops capacity to receive truth, moving from fear to trust to ultimate recognition of inherent worth.

**Level 3: The Soteriological (Salvation) Narrative**
All sentient beings, separated from Buddha-nature through ignorance, gradually develop capacity through the Buddha's skillful teaching to recognize their original nature and inherit Buddha-wisdom.

**Level 4: The Philosophical Teaching**
The parable demonstrates that:
- True inheritance is not earned but recognized
- Capacity must be gradually developed for transformation to be stable
- The apparent separation from enlightenment is illusory—it was never truly lost
- Skilful means is not deception but compassionate pedagogy
- The destination was present from the beginning

### Key Differences from the Burning House Parable

While the Burning House parable (Chapter 3) emphasizes escape from conditioned existence through skilful motivation, the Prodigal Son parable emphasizes:

- **Recognition over Escape**: Rather than fleeing danger, the son recognizes his inheritance
- **Gradual Rather than Sudden**: The twenty-year period contrasts with the immediate crisis of the burning house
- **Internal Transformation**: The son's heart gradually opens, rather than his circumstances forcing change
- **Worth Rather Than Rescue**: The teaching affirms innate value rather than external salvation

### Contemporary Psychological Application

The parable's psychological insight into trauma and gradual transformation parallels modern trauma-informed therapy:

- Recognition that sudden confrontation with truth can overwhelm unprepared consciousness
- Understanding that healing requires gradually building trust and capacity
- Appreciation that safety and preparation precede transformation
- Recognition that inherited worth is often obscured by conditioned limitation
