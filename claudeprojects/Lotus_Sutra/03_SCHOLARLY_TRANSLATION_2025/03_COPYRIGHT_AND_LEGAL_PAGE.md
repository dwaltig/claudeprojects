## Publication & Source Information

### About the Source Material

This translation is based on the **妙法蓮華經** (Miao-fa-lian-hua Jing), the Classical Chinese rendering of the **Saddharma-puṇḍarīka-sūtra** (Lotus Sutra), translated from Sanskrit into Classical Chinese by the renowned scholar-monk **Kumārajīva** (鳩摩羅什, 343–413 CE) in the year **406 CE** at Chang'an.

Kumārajīva's translation became the standard version throughout East Asian Buddhism and remains the most widely-used rendering in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. This English translation honors that lineage by translating from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese version rather than the Sanskrit original, reflecting how the text has actually shaped Buddhist history and practice.

**Classical Chinese Source**:
- Text: 妙法蓮華經 (Kumārajīva's Version)
- Translator to Chinese: Kumārajīva (鳩摩羅什)
- Date: 406 CE
- Original Location: Chang'an (modern-day Xi'an, China)
- Historical Significance: Standard text for East Asian Buddhism for nearly 1,600 years

### About the English Translation

This Contemporary English translation was created specifically to:

1. Provide scholarly-rigorous rendering suitable for academic citation and research
2. Maintain formal Buddhist scriptural register appropriate to a sacred text
3. Render the Classical Chinese into accessible contemporary American English
4. Integrate comprehensive philosophical and scientific apparatus (1,554 footnotes)
5. Preserve Sanskrit terminology and diacritical marks essential to Buddhist studies

The translation balances **fidelity to source material** with **accessibility to contemporary readers**—prioritizing meaning over literal word-for-word correspondence, while maintaining the formal, reverent tone befitting a sacred text.

## About Diacritical Marks

This edition preserves **Sanskrit diacritical marks** throughout the text. These marks are essential for:

1. **Proper transliteration** of Buddhist philosophical and personal names
2. **Scholarly accuracy** for readers consulting Buddhist literature
3. **Pronunciation guidance** for those studying Buddhist texts
4. **Linguistic precision** in philosophical terminology

### Key Sanskrit Diacriticals Used in This Edition

| Character | Name | Usage | Example |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| **ā** | Macron (long a) | Extended vowel sound | Tathāgata, śāriputra, Mahākāśyapa |
| **ī** | Macron (long i) | Extended vowel sound | Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva (when transliterated) |
| **ū** | Macron (long u) | Extended vowel sound | upāya (skillful means) |
| **ṇ** | Dot below (retroflexed n) | Retroflex consonant | Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya |
| **ś** | Cedilla (palatal s) | Palatal fricative | Śāriputra, Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara |
| **ṃ** | Dot below (nasal m) | Nasal consonant | anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, ṃ in Sanskrit phrases |

These marks ensure proper pronunciation and maintain scholarly accuracy. When encountering unfamiliar diacriticals, consult the **Glossary of Buddhist Terms** provided in the back matter.

### Important Notes on Encoding

This digital edition preserves all diacritical marks using **standard UTF-8 Unicode encoding**. Most modern e-readers, devices, and browsers display these marks correctly. If you encounter unexpected characters or symbols where diacriticals should appear, your device may need font or encoding updates. Please consult your e-reader's settings or contact technical support.
