*Imperial Preface by the Yongle Emperor*
*(永樂九年五月初一日 — May 1, 1421)*

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, with a heart of adamantine resolve, responds inexhaustibly to all transformations. Through sovereign spiritual powers, [this Bodhisattva] travels freely throughout the Dharma-realm, entering micro-dust lands to expound the Dharma and bring salvation. Possessed of wondrous marks in full, [this Bodhisattva's] great vow is vast as the ocean. Whoever has the karmic connection and arouses a pure mind—the moment they raise their voice to call upon [this Bodhisattva], [this Bodhisattva] immediately responds to that sound, and all their desires are fulfilled according to their wishes.

The Universal Gate Chapter of the *Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma* is the true teaching for liberating [beings] from suffering and affliction. If one can constantly contemplate this sutra, the moment a single thought arises, one immediately perceives the victorious marks of Great Compassion, able to extinguish all suffering; its merit is inconceivable.

I [the Emperor] reflect that the Way of Heaven brings fortune to the good and calamity to the licentious; therefore, the Buddha revealed karmic retribution to make people do good and not dare to do evil. Heaven and Hell are both made by human actions—they do not depart from within one's own heart. Therefore, those who do good ascend to Heaven; those who do evil fall into Hell.

Loyal ministers, filial children, auspicious people, and steadfast gentlemen—their minds are Buddha. Therefore, divine spirits protect them and their karmic obstructions are entirely eliminated. Thus, in life they do not transgress the laws, and in death they do not fall into uninterrupted [Hell].

As for cruel and obstinate people who are bent on doing evil, who discard the Five Relationships like worn-out brooms and tread upon criminal law as if drinking something sweet, who would rather feed rākṣasas than revere the Buddha's Way—human nature is fundamentally good. Those who do evil are merely distorted by their temperament. If they can transform their minds, change their thoughts, cultivate self-reflection, and approach with caution, then in an instant evil can become good. To do good is to become a good person. The faults accumulated in the past become like a speck of dust in the vast sky, like a flake of snow in a red-hot furnace—cleansed and purified completely. Though karmic retribution exists, where shall it be applied?

I constantly reflect upon this. I only fear that people of the world, having faults, do not know to reform, but willingly abandon themselves. Therefore, I have promulgated this sutra so that virtuous gentlemen may forever strengthen their minds in upholding the precepts and broadly receive immeasurable blessing. The merit of doing good—how can it have any limit!

*The first day of the fifth month of the ninth year of the Yongle reign*
