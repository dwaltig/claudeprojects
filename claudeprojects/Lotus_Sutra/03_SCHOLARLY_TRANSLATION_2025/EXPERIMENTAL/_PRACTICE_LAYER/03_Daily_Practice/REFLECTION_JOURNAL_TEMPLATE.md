# Reflection Journal Template for Lotus Sutra Practice

## How to Use This Template

This journal template supports your engagement with each chapter of the Lotus Sutra. You can:

1. **Print it out** and write by hand (many practitioners find handwriting deepens reflection)
2. **Copy it to a digital document** and keep an ongoing digital journal
3. **Adapt it freely** - modify questions that don't resonate; add your own questions

**Frequency**: Complete one journal entry per chapter you study (or weekly if you're studying 2-3 chapters per week).

**Timing**: Best done in the evening or within 24 hours of studying the chapter, while the material is still fresh.

**Duration**: Each entry takes 20-40 minutes depending on how deeply you engage.

## Additional Journaling Prompts

Use these prompts any time you want to deepen your engagement:

### **Parable Engagement**
When working with the parables in the sutra (burning house, medicinal herbs, stupa, etc.):

- What does each character represent in me?
- What is the burning house I need to escape?
- What medicine does this parable prescribe for my condition?
- How am I like the characters in this story?

### **Verse Deepening**
When working with verse sections:

- What rhythm or rhyme stands out? Why?
- What image or metaphor captures the teaching?
- If I were to paint this verse, what would it look like?
- How does the poetic form add to the meaning compared to the prose?

### **Character Connection**
When learning about bodhisattvas and disciples:

- Which character most resonates with me? Why?
- What is this character teaching me about my own potential?
- If I could ask this character a question, what would it be?
- How am I like this character? How am I different?

### **Obstacle Work**
When you encounter resistance to a teaching:

- What part of me resists? (Fear? Pride? Different values?)
- What am I protecting by resisting?
- What would become possible if I let this resistance soften?
- Can I hold both the resistance AND the teaching simultaneously?

### **Conversation with the Buddha**
Use this when you want to dialogue with the teachings:

- "Buddha, I don't understand why..."
- "I'm struggling with..."
- "Can you help me see...?"

Then write the Buddha's response as you imagine it.

### **Body-Based Reflection**
For embodied understanding:

- Where in my body do I feel this teaching?
- What happens to my breath when I contemplate this teaching?
- What posture arises naturally when I sit with this?
- How does my body want to move or respond to this?

## Tips for Effective Journaling

1. **Write freely**: Don't worry about grammar, coherence, or sounding wise. Genuine reflection is messy.

2. **Write by hand when possible**: The slower pace and physical engagement deepen reflection.

3. **Be specific**: "I felt peace" is less useful than "My shoulders relaxed and my mind became quieter; I felt less anxious about tomorrow's meeting."

4. **Return and read**: Re-read your entries monthly and especially before completing the entire sutra. You'll see patterns and growth invisible in the moment.

5. **Honor what arises**: If grief, anger, or doubt emerges, that's part of the path. Journal about it rather than skipping over it.

6. **Share selectively**: Some entries might be shared in study groups; others are for your private engagement. Honor what wants to be private.

7. **Use the questions as starting points**: If a question doesn't resonate, skip it. If new questions arise, follow them.

8. **Practice before journaling**: Even 10 minutes of meditation or slow reading before journaling deepens the quality of reflection.

## Storing & Protecting Your Journal

Your journal entries are precious—they document your awakening. Consider:

- Keep in a safe place (physical or digital)
- Use a dedicated journal notebook
- Back up digital versions regularly
- Consider sharing your journey with a trusted friend or study group
- Re-read at significant junctures (anniversaries, life transitions, etc.)

Your journal is a mirror of your practice. Over months and years, it becomes a record of transformation.

## A Final Note

This journal is not meant to create another "should" or pressure. It's an offering—a tool to deepen your engagement if you find it useful. Some practitioners will journal extensively; others will write brief notes. Some will use this template exactly as written; others will adapt it completely.

The most important thing is not the journal itself, but your sincere engagement with the teachings. The journal simply gives structure to what's already happening: your gradual awakening to what you already are.

**Your practice is not measured by how much you write, but by how genuinely you open to the teachings.**

---

Use this template in service of your awakening and the awakening of all beings.
