# Yongle Imperial Preface to the Great Vehicle Lotus Sutra
## 御製大乘妙法蓮華經序

*Imperial Preface by the Yongle Emperor (永樂十八年四月十七日 — April 17, 1420)*

In ancient times, the Tathāgata dwelt at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa together with the great Arhats Ājñātakauṇḍinya, Mahākāśyapa, and countless other assembled beings, and there expounded the great vehicle true sutra called the *Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings*. At that time, heavenly jeweled flowers rained down in abundance, the light of wisdom manifested auspicious signs illuminating both the hidden and the manifest, the entire Buddha-world shook in six ways, and all beings human and celestial experienced what they had never before experienced. All rejoiced and praised this teaching, understanding that this sutra is the secret treasury of all the Buddhas and Tathāgatas—spiritually wondrous and beyond measure, vast and ineffable in name.

Therefore it draws forth those sunk in the stagnant depths, rescues those confused and lost in their true nature. Its merit extends far beyond any limit one could mark. Tracing the source, it arose in India and flowed eastward to China. From the Western Jin dynasty, the śramaṇa Dharmarakṣa first translated it under the title *The Lotus of the Correct Dharma*. Then the Kucha Tripiṭaka Master Kumārajīva of the Eastern Jin retranslated it under the title *The Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Dharma*. Coming to the Sui dynasty, the Indian śramaṇa Jñānagupta translated it also as *The Wonderful Dharma*. Although these three translations overlap in text and meaning, each presenting the teaching in its own way, it is the Tripiṭaka Master [Kumārajīva] alone who grasped its true meaning. However, as the ages have passed, errors have inevitably crept in, and without revision and correction, doubts have gradually multiplied. For this reason, I have specially undertaken careful collation and commanded that it be carved in woodblock to spread its transmission widely.

Alas! The Tathāgata, out of compassion for all sentient beings who have various natures, various desires, various actions, and various thoughts and discriminations—entangled through countless eons with no prospect of liberation—appeared in this world for this one great cause. He expounded the wondrous teaching and established supreme skillful means so that all might attain liberation and ascend to correct awakening. This is truly the ferry-bridge across the sea of suffering and the torch of wisdom illuminating the darkness. Virtuous men and women, all sentient beings, who can hold this sutra with utmost sincerity, recite it, wear it reverently, bow to it, and make offerings to it—they shall be freed from all afflictions, all karmic obstructions shall be removed, and all the bonds of birth and death shall be released.

It is as when the hungry receive food, the thirsty receive drink, the cold receive fire, the heated receive coolness, the poor receive treasure, the sick receive a physician, a child receives its mother, a traveler receives a boat. Such comfort and joy cannot be expressed in words.

Ah! The Way cannot be preserved except through scripture; the Dharma cannot be transmitted except through scripture. Through scripture one seeks the Dharma; through the Dharma one awakens to the Way. Only then does one recognize that the meaning of this sutra is pure, subtle, and supremely rare. Those who follow it shall attain bodily health and peace; all roots of virtue shall be perfectly complete, like a lotus rising from the water unstained by mud. Immediately the five aggregates become empty, the six sense-faculties are purified, and it is not difficult to swiftly ascend to the highest good and accomplish correct awakening.

But if one remains sunk in confusion, stubbornly attached, willingly falling and cutting off the roots of virtue, then one's body shall fall into the paths of suffering, cycling through the realm of birth and death—is there limit to such consequences? Nevertheless, the two paths of good and evil depend on what one pursues: doing good brings fortune; doing evil brings misfortune. The karmic retribution in the visible and invisible realms is exact to the smallest measure. Let those who contemplate this sutra take heed! Let them be diligent!

*The seventeenth day of the fourth month of the eighteenth year of the Yongle reign [April 17, 1420]*
