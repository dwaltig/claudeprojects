## Imperial Preface to the Great Vehicle Lotus Sutra
### 御製大乘妙法蓮華經序

*Imperial Preface by the Yongle Emperor*
*(永樂十八年四月十七日 — April 17, 1420)*

---

In ancient times, the Tathāgata dwelt at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa together with the great Arhats Ājñātakauṇḍinya, Mahākāśyapa, and countless other assembled beings, and there expounded the great vehicle true sutra called the *Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings*. At that time, heavenly jeweled flowers rained down in abundance, the light of wisdom manifested auspicious signs illuminating both the hidden and the manifest, the entire Buddha-world shook in six ways, and all beings human and celestial experienced what they had never before experienced. All rejoiced and praised this teaching, understanding that this sutra is the secret treasury of all the Buddhas and Tathāgatas—spiritually wondrous and beyond measure, vast and ineffable in name.

Therefore it draws forth those sunk in the stagnant depths, rescues those confused and lost in their true nature. Its merit extends far beyond any limit one could mark. Tracing the source, it arose in India and flowed eastward to China. From the Western Jin dynasty, the śramaṇa Dharmarakṣa first translated it under the title *The Lotus of the Correct Dharma*. Then the Kucha Tripiṭaka Master Kumārajīva of the Eastern Jin retranslated it under the title *The Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Dharma*. Coming to the Sui dynasty, the Indian śramaṇa Jñānagupta translated it also as *The Wonderful Dharma*. Although these three translations overlap in text and meaning, each presenting the teaching in its own way, it is the Tripiṭaka Master [Kumārajīva] alone who grasped its true meaning. However, as the ages have passed, errors have inevitably crept in, and without revision and correction, doubts have gradually multiplied. For this reason, I have specially undertaken careful collation and commanded that it be carved in woodblock to spread its transmission widely.

Alas! The Tathāgata, out of compassion for all sentient beings who have various natures, various desires, various actions, and various thoughts and discriminations—entangled through countless eons with no prospect of liberation—appeared in this world for this one great cause. He expounded the wondrous teaching and established supreme skillful means so that all might attain liberation and ascend to correct awakening. This is truly the ferry-bridge across the sea of suffering and the torch of wisdom illuminating the darkness. Virtuous men and women, all sentient beings, who can hold this sutra with utmost sincerity, recite it, wear it reverently, bow to it, and make offerings to it—they shall be freed from all afflictions, all karmic obstructions shall be removed, and all the bonds of birth and death shall be released.

It is as when the hungry receive food, the thirsty receive drink, the cold receive fire, the heated receive coolness, the poor receive treasure, the sick receive a physician, a child receives its mother, a traveler receives a boat. Such comfort and joy cannot be expressed in words.

Ah! The Way cannot be preserved except through scripture; the Dharma cannot be transmitted except through scripture. Through scripture one seeks the Dharma; through the Dharma one awakens to the Way. Only then does one recognize that the meaning of this sutra is pure, subtle, and supremely rare. Those who follow it shall attain bodily health and peace; all roots of virtue shall be perfectly complete, like a lotus rising from the water unstained by mud. Immediately the five aggregates become empty, the six sense-faculties are purified, and it is not difficult to swiftly ascend to the highest good and accomplish correct awakening.

But if one remains sunk in confusion, stubbornly attached, willingly falling and cutting off the roots of virtue, then one's body shall fall into the paths of suffering, cycling through the realm of birth and death—is there limit to such consequences? Nevertheless, the two paths of good and evil depend on what one pursues: doing good brings fortune; doing evil brings misfortune. The karmic retribution in the visible and invisible realms is exact to the smallest measure. Let those who contemplate this sutra take heed! Let them be diligent!

*The seventeenth day of the fourth month of the eighteenth year of the Yongle reign*

## Preface to the Transmission of the Lotus Sutra
### 妙法蓮華經弘傳序

*Composed by the Vinaya Master Daoxuan of Zhongnan Mountain during the Tang Dynasty*
*(唐終南山釋道宣述)*

---

The *Sutra of the Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Dharma* represents the fundamental purpose for which all the Buddhas have descended into the world to manifest their spiritual presence. This teaching was preserved in the great kingdoms of the West for over a thousand years before being transmitted eastward to China, where it has flourished for more than three hundred years.

During the Yongkang era (300-301 CE) of Emperor Hui of the Western Jin dynasty, the Bodhisattva Dharmarakṣa of Dunhuang, residing at the Qingmen Gate of Chang'an, first translated this sutra under the title *The Lotus of the Correct Dharma* (正法華).

During the Longan era (397-401 CE) of Emperor An of the Eastern Jin dynasty, and the Hongshi era (399-416 CE) of the Later Qin, the śramaṇa Kumārajīva of Kucha produced the second translation, titled *The Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Dharma* (妙法蓮華).

During the Renshou era (601-604 CE) of the Sui dynasty, at the Da Xingshan Temple, the śramaṇa Jñānagupta of North India produced the third translation, also entitled *The Wonderful Dharma*.

These three translations, though overlapping in content, each present the meaning in their own way. Yet it is the Qin [Kumārajīva] version that has been most honored and widely disseminated through the generations. Beyond these, there exist various individual chapters and separate verses that have circulated as well, as recorded in the historical catalogues, and need not be enumerated here.

Now, the descent of spiritual power from the sacred peaks cannot be accomplished except through the Great Sage. The reach of transformative teaching cannot guide the mind except through karmic connections from past lives. Thus it was that the teaching was first announced at the deer park, where distinctions were made between the capacities of lesser and greater vehicles. At the Golden River, when the Buddha gave his final instructions, distinctions were made between the half and the complete teachings.

Is it not the case that teaching adapts to the times? In evaluating these great assemblies, we cannot merely examine them superficially. Thus we understand: the five thousand who withdrew from their seats had done so to make way for those afflicted by arrogant conceit. The five hundred who received prophecies together honored the traces of the esoteric transformation. Thus the emission of light and the manifestation of auspicious signs opened the teaching-origin that proceeded from inquiry. The Buddha's emergence from meditation and proclamation of virtue expressed the vast significance of Buddha-wisdom.

The decayed mansion elucidated the principles of entering the great vehicle; the phantom city guided those of past karmic connections so they would not fall away. The pearl concealed in the garment made clear the constant presence of the principle of Buddha-nature; the well-digging revealed the many paths to awakening. The language and meaning remain vivid; the similes extend far indeed.

Were it not for the vast compassion of universal salvation, who could pull beings forth from the depths of stagnant drowning? Were it not for the singular unbounded sorrowful heart, who could rescue those lost in confusion from their loss of true nature?

From the Han dynasty to the Tang, throughout six hundred and more years, examining the totality of the texts—over four thousand scrolls—none has been so widely received and maintained as this sutra. Is this not because the teaching struck a resonance with the capacity of beings, following in the traces left by the wisdom of Jixuesheng Buddha? Those who heard it generated profound reverence, following in the remaining merit of King Weiyin.

Therefore, at the very beginning of this sutra, I compose this preface to synthesize its meaning—hoping that we may quickly purify the six sense faculties and ascend to the joyful gathering of the Compassionate Lord; that we may swiftly accomplish the four virtues and proceed toward the profound path of the Pure Land. May praise and dissemination never be exhausted, and may this be bequeathed everlastingly to all future generations.

# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Opening: The Transmission of the Teaching

Thus have I heard.[^1] At one time, the Buddha was dwelling at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa near the city of Rājagṛha,[^2] together with a great assembly of twelve thousand bhikṣus.[^3] All of these practitioners had attained the state of Arhat—having exhausted all outflows of mental affliction, having eliminated all defilements, having realized their own ultimate benefit, having severed all bonds of conditioned existence, and having attained complete mastery and freedom of mind.[^4]

Their names are recorded as follows: Ājñātakauṇḍinya, Mahākāśyapa, Uruvilvākāśyapa, Gayākāśyapa[^fn_gaya], Nadīkāśyapa, Śāriputra, Mahāmaudgalyāyana[^fn_maud], Mahākātyāyana, Aniruddha[^fn_aniruddha], Kapphiṇa, Gavāṃpati, Revata, Pilindavatsa, Bakkula, Mahākauṣṭhila, Nanda, Sundarananda, Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra, Subhūti, Ānanda, and Rāhula—great Arhats of this caliber, well known throughout all communities of practitioners.[^5]

[^fn_gaya]: **Gayākāśyapa**: The text distinguishes this Kāśyapa brother using the phonetic 伽 (*qié*) for "Gayā," whereas the other two brothers (Uruvilvā and Nadī) use the standard 迦 (*jiā*). While the base Taishō text prints 迦 here as well, the critical apparatus emends this to 伽 to preserve the distinction found in the Sanskrit.

[^fn_maud]: **Mahāmaudgalyāyana**: The Taishō text utilizes the character 揵 (*qián*), written with the hand radical (手), as opposed to the character 犍 (*jiān*), written with the cow radical (牛), which appears in the Song, Yuan, and Ming editions. The reading Mahāmaudgalyāyana remains standard.

[^fn_aniruddha]: **Aniruddha**: The Taishō text uses the rare variant character 㝹 (*nóu*), as confirmed by critical notes, rather than the more common transliterations 那 (*nà*) or 耨 (*nòu*). This indicates a specific phonetic reconstruction intended by the translator distinct from other versions of the sutra.

## The Assembly: All Beings Present

Furthermore, there were also two thousand persons[^6] among both those still in training and those who had completed their training. The bhikṣuṇī Mahāprajāpatī was present together with her retinue of six thousand bhikṣuṇīs.[^7] Yaśodharā, the mother of Rāhula, was also present with her retinue.[^8]

Additionally, there were eighty thousand Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas,[^9] all of whom had become irreversible in their aspiration toward the attainment of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi (supreme perfect enlightenment).[^10] All had attained the dharaṇī[^11]—the power to retain and preserve teaching—and possessed eloquence in joyful exposition. They had already turned the irreversible Dharma wheel,[^12] spreading teachings that cannot be reversed or overturned.

These Bodhisattvas had made offerings to innumerable hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, and in the presence of all these Buddhas they had planted deep roots of virtue. They were constantly praised by all Buddhas on account of their devotion and accomplishment. They cultivated themselves through the mind of compassion (maitrī and karuṇā), skillfully entered into Buddha-wisdom,[^13] thoroughly penetrated the great wisdom of ultimate reality,[^14] and thereby reached the farther shore—transcending the realm of conditioned existence.[^15]

Their fame was universally heard throughout immeasurable worlds, and they possessed the power to liberate innumerable hundreds of thousands of living beings. Their names are recorded as: the Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī (He of Transcendent Wisdom),[^16] the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara (the One Who Observes the Sounds of the World),[^17] the Bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta, the Bodhisattva Nityodyukta (Ever-Exerting), the Bodhisattva Aniksiptadhura, the Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi (He with the Jeweled Hand), the Bodhisattva Medicine King, the Bodhisattva Pradānaśūra (Courageous in Giving), the Bodhisattva Ratnacandra (Jeweled Moon), the Bodhisattva Candraprabha (Moonlight), the Bodhisattva Pūrṇacandra (Full Moon), the Bodhisattva Mahāvikramin (Great Strider), the Bodhisattva Anantavikramin (Boundless Strider), the Bodhisattva Trailokyavikrama (Strider Through the Three Realms), the Bodhisattva Bhadrapāla (Excellent Guardian), the Bodhisattva Maitreya (He of Loving-Kindness), the Bodhisattva Ratnākara (Ocean of Jewels), and the Guide Bodhisattva (導師菩薩)—eighty thousand Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas of this caliber were all present in the assembly.[^18]

---

## The Celestial and Divine Attendants

Moreover, Śakra Devānām Indra (the Lord of the Thirty-Three Heavens) was present with his retinue of twenty thousand celestial sons.[^19] The celestial sons Candravimala (Moonlight), Manojñasvara, Ratnacchattra, and the Four Great Heavenly Kings were also present, together with their retinue of ten thousand celestial sons.[^20]

The celestial sovereigns Īśvara and Maheśvara were present with their retinue of thirty thousand celestial sons. The Brahmā Heavenly King—the lord of the Sahā world (our cosmic realm)—together with Śikhin Mahābrahman, Jyotiṣprabha Mahābrahman, and others, were present with their retinue of twelve thousand celestial sons.[^21]

There were eight Dragon Kings: the Dragon King Nanda, the Dragon King Upananda, the Dragon King Sāgara, the Dragon King Vāsukin, the Dragon King Takṣaka, the Dragon King Anavatapta, the Dragon King Manasvin, and the Dragon King Utpalaka—each accompanied by several hundreds of thousands of retinue members.[^22]

There were four Kiṃnara Kings: the Kiṃnara King Dharma, the Kiṃnara King Sudharma, the Kiṃnara King Mahādharma, and the Kiṃnara King Dharmadhara—each with several hundreds of thousands of attendants.

There were four Gandharva Kings: the Gandharva King Manojña, the Gandharva King Manojñasvara, the Gandharva King Madhura, and the Gandharva King Madhurasvara—each with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members.

There were four Asura Kings: the Asura King Balin, the Asura King Kharaskandha, the Asura King Vemacitra, and the Asura King Rāhu—each with several hundreds of thousands of attendants.

There were four Garuḍa Kings: the Garuḍa King Mahātejas (Great Radiance), the Garuḍa King Mahākāya (Great Form), the Garuḍa King Mahāpūrṇa (Great Fullness), and the Garuḍa King Manojña (Pleasing to Mind)—each with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members.

King Ajātaśatru, son of Vaidehī, was present with several hundreds of thousands of retinue members.[^23] All in the assembly bowed respectfully at the Buddha's feet and withdrew to sit respectfully to one side.[^24]

---

## The Buddha's Teaching and Cosmic Manifestation

At that time, the World-Honored One, surrounded by the fourfold assembly[^25] and having been honored with reverent offerings, praise, and adoration, expounded for the assembled Bodhisattvas a Mahāyāna sutra entitled the *Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings*—a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured and protected by the Buddhas.[^26]

Having concluded his exposition of this sutra, the Buddha sat in full lotus posture (padmāsana)[^27] and entered into the samādhi of the abode of immeasurable meanings[^28]—a meditative absorption in which his body and mind remained utterly still and unmoved, entering a state of unified, non-dualistic awareness.[^29]

Thereupon heavenly mandārava flowers, great mandārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, and great mañjūṣaka flowers rained down abundantly from the heavens, scattering upon the Buddha and upon the great assembly.[^30] The entire Buddha-world quaked and trembled in six ways—a cosmic manifestation signifying the profound nature of the teaching being conveyed.[^31]

---

## The Universal Response

At that time, all the beings present in the assembly—bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas (male lay practitioners), upāsikās (female lay practitioners), devas (celestial beings), nāgas (serpent-beings), yakṣas (nature spirits), gandharvas (celestial musicians), asuras (anti-gods), garuḍas (divine eagles), kiṃnaras (celestial musicians), mahoragas (great serpents), humans, and non-human beings, together with the lesser kings and wheel-turning sage kings[^32]—the entire great assembly experienced phenomena they had never before experienced.

Filled with joy, they placed their palms together in salutation and gazed upon the Buddha with unified attention, their minds focused single-pointedly.[^33]

---

## The Buddha's Light and the Revelation of Other Worlds

At that time, the Buddha emitted a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows (the ūrṇā-keśa, an auspicious mark of Buddhahood).[^34] This light illuminated eighteen thousand worlds to the east, omitting none, extending downward to the Avīci hell[^35] and upward to the Akaniṣṭha Heaven (the highest heaven of the form realm).[^36]

Within this illumination, from the perspective of our world, the beings of the six paths of rebirth[^37] in all those lands were completely visible. The six destinies of sentient existence—beings born in hell, as hungry ghosts, as animals, as asuras, as humans, and as celestial beings—each in their respective realms, appeared as if in direct vision.

Moreover, the Buddhas presently dwelling in those eighteen thousand worlds to the east were seen, and the sutras and Dharma teachings that those Buddhas were expounding were heard as if directly transmitted. Also visible were the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who had cultivated the path through meditation and ethical practice and had thereby attained the Way.[^38]

Furthermore, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas were seen practicing the Bodhisattva path through various causes and conditions, through various frames of understanding and belief, and through various appearances and manifestations adapted to their respective capacities.[^39]

Also seen were Buddhas entering parinirvāṇa (final transcendence)—a sight indicating the impermanent and conditional nature of even the Buddha's manifest form in the world.[^40] Also seen, after those Buddhas' parinirvāṇa, were stūpas of the seven precious materials being erected and dedicated to preserve their sacred relics (śarīra).[^41]

---

## Maitreya's Inquiry

At that time, the Bodhisattva Maitreya[^42] had this thought: "Now the World-Honored One has manifested this extraordinary spiritual transformation and display of supernatural power. For what cause and condition has this auspicious sign appeared? The Buddha, the World-Honored One, has now entered into samādhi—this inconceivable manifestation of rare phenomena heretofore unprecedented. To whom should I pose my question? Who possesses the capacity to answer such a profound matter?"[^43]

Then he harbored this further thought: "This Mañjuśrī, the prince of the Dharma King, has previously drawn near and made offerings to immeasurable Buddhas of the past through countless eons. Surely he must have witnessed these rare signs before. I shall now inquire of him."[^44]

---

## The Assembly's Collective Doubt

At that time, the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, and all the devas, nāgas, and other spirits all harbored this thought: "This extraordinary Buddha-light and display of spiritual power—of whom should we now inquire? To whom shall we address our questions?"[^45]

---

## Maitreya Addresses Mañjuśrī

At that time, the Bodhisattva Maitreya, wishing to resolve his own doubt and observing the minds of the fourfold assembly—the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, and all the devas, nāgas, and spirits of the assembly—addressed Mañjuśrī directly, saying:

"For what cause and condition has this auspicious spiritual sign appeared? For what reason does the Buddha emit this great light, illuminating the eighteen thousand lands to the east, whereby all the magnificent adornments of those Buddha-lands are completely visible to us?"

---

## Maitreya's Verse Inquiry

Thereupon, the Bodhisattva Maitreya, wishing to restate this meaning in verse form, spoke the following inquiry:

*O Mañjuśrī!*  
*Why does the Guide,*  
*From the white hair between his brows,*  
*Universally illuminate with great light?*  

*Raining mandārava flowers,*  
*And mañjūṣaka flowers,*  
*While sandalwood-scented breezes*  
*Delight the hearts of all—*  

*By this cause and condition,*  
*The earth is perfectly adorned,*  
*And this world itself*  
*Quakes in six ways.*  

*At this time, the fourfold assembly*  
*All rejoice in unison,*  
*Their bodies and minds delighted,*  
*Experiencing what they have never experienced before.*  

*The light between the brows*  
*Illuminates the east—*  
*Eighteen thousand lands*  
*All become golden in hue.*  

*From Avīci hell*  
*Up to the Summit of Existence,*  
*In all those worlds,*  
*The beings of the six paths—*  

*Where birth and death lead,*  
*The karmic connections of good and evil,*  
*The beautiful and ugly results they receive—*  
*All these are seen here.*  

*Also visible are the Buddhas,*  
*Those sage lords and spiritual lions,*  
*Expounding sutras and teachings,*  
*Most subtle and supremely profound.*  

*Their voices pure and undefiled,*  
*Emitting gentle, compassionate tones,*  
*Teaching Bodhisattvas*  
*Numbering countless myriads—*  

*Brahman voices profound and wondrous,*  
*Causing people to delight in hearing.*  
*In each world,*  
*They expound the correct Dharma—*  

*Through various causes and conditions,*  
*With immeasurable parables and illustrations,*  
*Illuminating the Buddha-Dharma,*  
*Awakening living beings.*  

*If people encounter suffering,*  
*Weary of old age, sickness, and death,*  
*For them they expound nirvāṇa,*  
*The ending of all suffering's limits.*  

*If people possess merit,*  
*Having made offerings to Buddhas,*  
*And aspire to the supreme Dharma,*  
*For them they expound pratyekabuddhahood.*  

*If there are sons of Buddha*  
*Cultivating various practices*  
*And seeking supreme wisdom,*  
*For them they expound the pure bodhisattva path.*  

*O Mañjuśrī!*  
*Dwelling here,*  
*I see and hear such things,*  
*And thousands of billions more—*  

*So numerous that words cannot measure them,*  
*I shall now briefly speak.*  
*I see in those lands*  
*Bodhisattvas numerous as the sands of the Ganges,*  

---

## Mañjuśrī's Response: The Teaching of Skillful Means

Then the Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī addressed Maitreya and all the great Bodhisattvas and virtuous men assembled: "Based on what I understand and contemplate, the World-Honored One is about to expound the great Dharma. He will rain down the great Dharma rain, sound the great Dharma trumpet, and beat the great Dharma drum, in order to expound the great significance of the Dharma."[^46]

"O virtuous men, in ages past, spanning countless immeasurable eons prior to the present, there existed a Buddha named the Sun Moon Lamp Bright Tathāgata (Candrasūryapradīpa), one worthy of offerings, possessing perfect knowledge, perfect conduct, well-gone, knower of the world, supreme guide, trainer of men, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.[^47] He expounded the correct Dharma—a teaching that was good at the beginning, good in the middle, and good at the end, whose meaning was profound and far-reaching, whose language was skillfully composed, pure and simple without admixture, adorned with complete and perfect conduct befitting a Brahmin sage.[^48]

"To those seeking the status of Śrāvaka (disciple), he taught the Four Noble Truths,[^49] enabling them to transcend birth, old age, sickness, and death, and ultimately attaining the perfect peace of nirvāṇa.[^50] To those seeking the status of Pratyekabuddha (solitary awakener), he taught the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination.[^51] To the Bodhisattvas, he taught the Six Perfections (pāramitās),[^52] enabling them to attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi and perfect enlightenment, becoming endowed with all-knowing wisdom."[^53]

"Now, in succession to this Buddha, there appeared another Buddha, also named the Sun Moon Lamp Bright Tathāgata. In fact, in this manner, there appeared a succession of twenty thousand Buddhas, all bearing the same name and title, all belonging to the same lineage. O Maitreya, you should know that the first Buddha and the last Buddha were all of the same name and title, called the Sun Moon Lamp Bright Tathāgata, and all possessed the ten epithets.[^54] The teachings they expounded were good at the beginning, good in the middle, and good at the end."[^55]

"The last of these Sun Moon Lamp Bright Buddhas, before he had renounced the household life and attained Buddhahood, had eight sons as a prince. Their names were: the Prince with Intention, the Prince of Good Intention, the Prince of Boundless Intention, the Prince of Jeweled Intention, the Prince of Increasing Intention, the Prince of Intention without Doubt, the Prince of Intention Directed Forward, and the Prince of Dharma Intention.[^56]

"These eight princes possessed great supernatural power and authority, each ruling over the Four Continents of the world. When these sons heard that their father had renounced the household life and attained anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, they all immediately abandoned their royal positions and also followed him in renouncing the world. They developed the great bodhisattva intention and continuously cultivated the Brahmin conduct of ethical purity, becoming Dharma teachers. All of them had already planted roots of virtue in the presence of thousands of millions of Buddhas."[^57]

---

## The Parable of Sun Moon Lamp Bright and the Prophecy

"At that time, the Sun Moon Lamp Bright Tathāgata expounded the Mahāyāna sutra called the *Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings*, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured and protected by the Buddhas. After completing the exposition of this sutra, he sat in full lotus posture in the assembly and entered into the samādhi called the abode of immeasurable meanings, with his body and mind completely unmoving.

"Thereupon, heavenly mandārava flowers, great mandārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, and great mañjūṣaka flowers rained down, falling upon the Buddha and the great assembly. The entire Buddha-world quaked and trembled in six ways. At that time, the assembly of bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans, as well as lesser kings and wheel-turning sage kings—all in the great assembly experienced what they had never experienced before. They rejoiced, placed their palms together in salutation, and gazed at the Buddha with unified, single-pointed attention.[^58]

"At that time, the Sun Moon Lamp Bright Tathāgata emitted a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows, illuminating eighteen thousand Buddha-worlds to the east, with nothing omitted, the light extending downward to the Avīci hell and upward to the Akaniṣṭha Heaven. Like you, the assembled Bodhisattvas in that time saw these very things being revealed.

"O Maitreya, you should know that in that assembly, there were two billion Bodhisattvas, all eager to hear the Dharma. These Bodhisattvas, having seen the light illuminating all the Buddha-lands, were astonished and wanted to know the cause and condition for this light.

"At that time, there was a Bodhisattva named Wonderful Light (Myoho) who had eight hundred disciples. The Sun Moon Lamp Bright Tathāgata, having risen from the samādhi, thereupon, because of the Bodhisattva Wonderful Light, expounded the Mahāyāna sutra called the *Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower*, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured and protected by the Buddhas. He taught this sutra for sixty small eons without rising from his seat.[^59]

"And the assembly listening to the Dharma also sat continuously in one place for sixty small eons without any movement of body or mind, listening to the Buddha's teaching. Yet to those who listened, it seemed only like a brief meal duration.[^60] In the assembly, there was not a single person whose body or mind gave rise to fatigue or weariness."[^61]

---

## The Prophecy and the Continuity of Teaching

"After the Sun Moon Lamp Bright Tathāgata had expounded this sutra for sixty small eons, he then announced to the assembly of Brahmā kings, Māra, śramaṇas, Brahmins, gods, humans, asuras, and all other beings: 'In this very night, the Tathāgata shall enter into parinirvāṇa (final transcendence).'

"At that time, there was a Bodhisattva named Treasure Store (Kosha), and the Sun Moon Lamp Bright Tathāgata immediately bestowed upon him a prophecy. He announced to all the bhikṣus: 'This Bodhisattva Treasure Store shall become a Buddha next, and his name shall be Pure Body Buddha (Vimalakaya Tathāgata), who shall be an Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One, possessing perfect knowledge, perfect conduct, well-gone, knower of the world, supreme guide, trainer of men, teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.'[^62]

"The Buddha then, that very night, entered into nirvāṇa. After the Buddha's passing, the Bodhisattva Wonderful Light held and preserved the *Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower*, teaching it extensively for eighty small eons. The eight sons of that Sun Moon Lamp Bright Buddha all became the disciples of the Bodhisattva Wonderful Light. She taught them, causing them to become firmly established in anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"These eight princes, after having made offerings to innumerable billions of Buddhas, all attained Buddhahood. The last of them to become a Buddha was named the Buddha of Burning Lamps (Dipamkara).[^63]

"Among the eight hundred disciples of Bodhisattva Wonderful Light, there was one disciple whose name was Seeker of Fame (Yasha-kami). This disciple was always lazy and loved profit and gain. Although he read and recited many sutras, he did not understand their meaning, and forgot much of what he had learned. Therefore he was called Seeker of Fame.

"This person also, because of having planted many roots of virtue, was able to encounter innumerable billions of Buddhas, made offerings to them, showed them respect, and praised them with reverence.[^64]

"O Maitreya, know that the Bodhisattva Wonderful Light at that time was none other than myself. And the Bodhisattva Seeker of Fame was you. Now that you have witnessed this very same auspicious sign, it is just like before. Therefore I have contemplated that the World-Honored One is about to expound the Mahāyāna sutra called the *Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower*, the teaching for Bodhisattvas, treasured and protected by the Buddhas."[^65]

## Mañjuśrī's Verse Recapitulation

Thereupon, the Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, wishing to restate this meaning in verse, spoke:

*I recall in ages past,*  
*Through countless immeasurable eons,*  
*There was a Buddha of supreme honor among men,*  
*Named the Sun Moon Lamp Bright Tathāgata.*  

*The World-Honored One expounded the Dharma,*  
*Liberating countless billions of beings,*  
*Numberless billions of Bodhisattvas,*  
*Leading them into the wisdom of Buddha.*  

*Before that Buddha had renounced worldly life,*  
*Were born eight sons as princes,*  
*Seeing the great sage renounce the world,*  
*They too cultivated the conduct of pure Brahmin ascetics.*  

*The Buddha at that time expounded the great vehicle—*  
*A sutra named the Teaching of Immeasurable Meanings—*  
*He explained it extensively to the great assembly,*  
*Breaking it down with manifold distinctions.*  

*After the Buddha had finished explaining,*  
*He sat upon the seat of truth,*  
*Entering into the samādhi,*  
*Called the abode of immeasurable meanings.*  

*Heavenly mandārava flowers rained down,*  
*The heavenly drums sounded naturally and spontaneously,*  
*The devas and dragons, ghosts and spirits,*  
*All made offerings to the supreme person.*  

*All the Buddha-lands trembled and quaked.*  
*The Buddha emitted light between his brows,*  
*Revealing all rare and wondrous phenomena,*  
*This light illuminated to the east—*  

*Eighteen thousand Buddha-lands,*  
*All became brilliant gold in color,*  
*Revealing to all sentient beings,*  
*The places where birth and death occur.*  

*Some saw Buddha-lands adorned,*  
*With all kinds of precious treasures,*  
*Crystal, beryl in radiant color,*  
*Made brilliant by the Buddha's light.*  

*And the divine beings, humans,*  
*Dragons, spirits, night-wanderers,*  
*Gandharvas and celestial musicians,*  
*Each making offerings to their own Buddha.*  

*Again, the great Tathāgatas*  
*Naturally become enlightened upon the path,*  
*Their bodies like golden mountains,*  
*Incomparably dignified and wondrous,*  

*Like pure crystal within,*  
*With a true golden image manifested within.*  
*The World-Honored One among the great assembly,*  
*Expounds the profound dharma significance.*  

*In each Buddha-land,*  
*Innumerable hosts of voice-hearers gather,*  
*Because of the Buddha's light illumination,*  
*All these great assemblies are visible.*  

*Some see Bodhisattvas,*  
*In the mountains and forests,*  
*Diligently maintaining pure precepts,*  
*Protecting them like precious pearls.*  

*Others see Bodhisattvas,*  
*Cultivating giving, patience, and other virtues,*  
*Numbering like Ganges' sands,*  
*All revealed by the Buddha's light.*  

*Others see Bodhisattvas,*  
*Deeply absorbed in meditative states,*  
*Bodies and minds at rest and unmoving,*  
*Seeking the supreme path.*  

*Others see Bodhisattvas,*  
*Who understand the characteristics of phenomena,*  
*As having no duality,*  
*Like empty space.*  

*Within the four groups of disciples,*  
*Seeing the Sun Moon Lamp Bright Buddha,*  
*Displaying great supernatural powers,*  
*All hearts were filled with joy—*  

*Each asking another,*  
*What is the cause and reason for this?*  
*The being honored by heaven and earth,*  
*Has just risen from meditation,*  

*And praised the Bodhisattva Wonderful Light:*  
*"You are the eye of the world,*  
*In all things the object of refuge,*  
*Able to preserve the treasury of the Dharma,"*  

*As I expound the teachings,*  
*Only you can fully understand them.*  
*The World-Honored One having praised you,*  
*Made the Bodhisattva Wonderful Light rejoice.*  

*He then expounded the Lotus Sutra,*  
*Throughout sixty small eons without rising.*  
*All who heard the teachings,*  
*Were able to receive and maintain them.*  

*The Buddha spoke this Dharma,*  
*Bringing joy to the assembly,*  
*Then announced to all beings:*  
*"The true nature of phenomena,*  

*I have now expounded to you;*  
*I shall now enter parinirvāṇa in this night.*  
*You should exert yourselves diligently,*  
*Never indulging in negligence—*  

*For Buddhas are most difficult to encounter,*  
*Meeting one only through countless billions of eons."*  
*The Buddha's sons,*  
*Hearing of the Buddha's entry into parinirvāṇa,*  

*Each felt deep sorrow and distress—*  
*How quickly the sage will depart!*  
*The supreme dharma king,*  
*Comforted the vast assembly,*  

*Saying: "When I pass away,*  
*You should not despair or fear,*  
*This Bodhisattva Treasure Store*  
*Has realized the nature of emptiness—*  

*His mind has already penetrated it,*  
*Next he shall become a Buddha,*  
*Known as Pure Body Buddha,*  
*Who shall liberate countless beings."*  

*That Buddha passed away that night,*  
*Like fire extinguished when fuel is exhausted,*  
*His relics were distributed widely,*  
*And countless stūpas were erected.*  

*Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs,*  
*Numbering like Ganges' sands,*  
*All redoubled their diligent practice,*  
*Seeking the supreme path.*  

*This Bodhisattva Wonderful Light,*  
*Preserved the treasury of the Buddha's Dharma,*  
*For eighty small eons,*  
*Widely expounding the Lotus Sutra.*  

*The eight royal sons,*  
*Guided and taught by Wonderful Light,*  
*Became firmly established in the path,*  
*Encountering countless Buddhas,*  

*Having made offerings to the Buddhas,*  
*And following the great path,*  
*They succeeded each other in becoming Buddhas,*  
*Each receiving prophecy in turn.*  

*The last supreme being among beings,*  
*Was named the Buddha of Burning Lamps,*  
*The guide and teacher of sages,*  
*Who liberated countless beings.*  

*That Bodhisattva Wonderful Light,*  
*Once had a disciple,*  
*Whose mind was constantly lazy,*  
*Attached to profit and fame,*  

*Seeking fame and profit without end,*  
*Often visiting noble families,*  
*Abandoning the study and recitation,*  
*Forgetting and failing to understand.*  

*For this reason he was called Seeker of Fame,*  
*Yet he cultivated many virtuous deeds,*  
*Encountered countless Buddhas,*  
*Making offerings with reverence and praise.*  

*In the future he shall become a Buddha,*  
*Named Maitreya Buddha,*  
*Liberating countless living beings,*  
*Without limit or measure.*  

*After that Buddha's parinirvāṇa,*  
*You who are lazy are that one—*  
*The Bodhisattva Wonderful Light of that age,*  
*Is now my own body.*  

*I saw the Burning Lamps Buddha,*  
*And how his original auspicious sign appeared—*  
*Because of this, I know today's Buddha,*  
*Desires to expound the Lotus Sutra.*  

*Now the signs are like before,*  
*These are the skillful means of all Buddhas—*  
*Now the Buddha emits light,*  
*To reveal the meaning of the ultimate nature of reality.*  

*All you people, know this:*  
*Place your palms together in reverence and wait,*  
*The Buddha shall rain down the dharma rain,*  
*Satisfying all who seek the path.*  

*All those who seek the three vehicles,*  
*If they harbor any doubt or hesitation,*  
*The Buddha shall dispel it completely,*  
*Leaving nothing remaining.*

# Chapter 2: Skillful Means

## The Buddha's Opening Teaching on Buddha-Wisdom

At that time, the World-Honored One, having emerged from meditation with composed serenity, addressed Śāriputra:[^1]

"The wisdom of the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, is infinitely profound and immeasurable. The gateway to this wisdom is difficult to comprehend and difficult to enter—beyond the capacity of all Śrāvakas (disciples) and Pratyekabuddhas (solitary awakeners) to understand. Why is this?

"The Buddhas have approached and made offerings to hundreds of thousands of billions of Tathāgatas beyond number. They have completely practiced the infinite dharmic pathways of all the Buddhas. With courageous diligence, their renown has spread universally. They have accomplished teachings utterly unprecedented and extraordinary.[^2]

"Their teachings, adapted to circumstances and conditions, are of meaning (arthas) most difficult to comprehend. Śāriputra, since my own attainment of Buddhahood, I have employed innumerable causes and conditions, boundless parables and illustrations, and infinite skillful means (upayā) to guide and transform all beings, enabling them to transcend all forms of attachment and clinging.[^3] Why is this?

"The Tathāgata has completely perfected the transcendent wisdom and vision of skillful means (upaya-jñāna-darsana). Śāriputra, the Tathāgata's wisdom and vision is boundless and vast, profound and far-reaching, infinite and unobstructed. His supernatural powers, fearlessness, meditative concentrations, liberations, and samadhis extend into the infinite and reach to the limit. The Tathāgata has accomplished teachings utterly unprecedented.

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is able to make distinctions among the various dharmas and to discourse skillfully upon them, employing words gentle and soft that bring joy to the hearts of all beings.[^4] Śāriputra, in essential summary, the Tathāgata has accomplished infinite, boundless, unprecedented teachings."[^5]

---

## The Buddha's Cessation: The Limits of Teaching

Then the Buddha said: "Cease, Śāriputra. There is no need to speak further. Why? The supremely rare and extraordinary teaching that the Buddha has accomplished—the dharma most difficult to understand—can only be fully penetrated and exhausted by the Buddha together with other Buddhas. I refer to the realm of reality in which:[^6]

"The various dharmas possess such-like characteristics, such-like natures, such-like bodies, such-like powers, such-like activities, such-like causes, such-like conditions, such-like effects, such-like retributions, and such-like their beginning and end, their ultimate equivalence."[^fn_ten_suchnesses]

[^fn_ten_suchnesses]: **The Ten Suchnesses (十如是):** This famous list of ten factors (*characteristics, nature, substance, power, activity, cause, condition, effect, retribution, and ultimate equality*) is unique to Kumārajīva's Chinese translation (*shí rúshì*) and does not appear in this form in the Sanskrit *Saddharmapuṇḍarīka* or other Chinese versions. It became the foundational scriptural basis for the Tiantai school's doctrine of "Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life" (*yinian sanqian*). Kumārajīva likely expanded the pithy Sanskrit "ye dharma hetu prabhava..." concept into this systematic list to clarify the mechanism of reality for Chinese readers.

## Verse Statement of Buddha-Wisdom's Transcendence

The World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, then spoke in verse:

*The Lord of Sages cannot be measured—*  
*By all the devas and all people,*  
*All classes of sentient beings,*  
*None have the capacity to know the Buddha.*  

*The Buddha's power is without limitation,*  
*His fearlessness, his liberations, his concentrations,*  
*And all other Buddha-dharmas are,*  
*Beyond any capacity to measure.*  

*From countless numberless Buddhas,*  
*He has completely practiced all the paths,*  
*The profoundly subtle dharmas,*  
*Difficult to see and difficult to comprehend.*  

*Through immeasurable billions of eons,*  
*Having practiced all these pathways,*  
*Upon the seat of enlightenment,*  
*I have fully realized and perceived all this.*  

*Such great fruitions,*  
*With their diverse characteristics and meanings,*  
*Only I and the ten-direction Buddhas,*  
*Are able to know these things.*  

*This dharma cannot be demonstrated,*  
*Language and verbal expression exhaust themselves;*  
*All other classes of sentient beings,*  
*Have no capacity to comprehend it,*  

*Except for the Bodhisattva assembly,*  
*Whose faith-power is firmly established.*  
*The Buddha's disciples assembled here,*  
*Having made offerings to all the Buddhas,*  

*Who have exhausted all outflows,*  
*And dwell in this their final body,*  
*Such persons as these,*  
*Lack the capacity for this.*  

*Even if the entire world were filled,*  
*All like Śāriputra in wisdom,*  
*Collectively thinking and measuring,*  
*They could not fathom Buddha-wisdom.*  

*And should the entire ten directions,*  
*All be filled with Śāriputra-like beings,*  
*And all other disciples,*  
*Completely filling all the Buddha-lands,*  

*All collectively thinking and measuring,*  
*Still they could not know it.*  
*Pratyekabuddhas of keen intelligence,*  
*With the unconditioned final body,*  

*Completely filling all ten-direction worlds,*  
*Numbering like bamboo forests,*  
*All of these, in unified mind,*  
*Throughout billions of immeasurable eons,*  

*Desiring to contemplate Buddha-wisdom,*  
*Could not know even a fraction of it.*  
*Newly-aspiring Bodhisattvas,*  
*Having made offerings to countless Buddhas,*  

*Understanding various meanings,*  
*And able to discourse skillfully upon the dharma,*  
*As numerous as rice grains, hemp seeds, bamboo stalks, and reeds,*  
*Filling all the ten-direction Buddha-lands,*  

*All with transcendent wisdom,*  
*Throughout the Ganges' sand-number of eons,*  
*All together contemplating,*  
*Could not know Buddha-wisdom.*  

*The non-retrogressive Bodhisattvas,*  
*Numbering like Ganges' sands,*  
*All of one mind seeking to comprehend,*  
*Still could not know it.*  

*Again, I tell you, Śāriputra:*  
*The unconditioned, unthinkable,*  
*Profoundly subtle dharmas,*  
*I have now completely obtained.*  

*Only I am able to know their characteristics,*  
*And so too are the Buddhas of the ten directions.*  
*Śāriputra, you should know:*  
*The language of all Buddhas is without contradiction,*  

*Regarding the dharma spoken by the Buddha,*  
*You should generate great faith-power.*  
*The World-Honored One's dharma, after a long time,*  
*Will certainly speak the truth.*  

*Announcing to the assembly of Śrāvakas,*  
*And to those seeking the pratyekabuddha vehicle,*  
*I have enabled them to escape suffering's bonds,*  
*And to attain nirvāṇa.*  

*By the Buddha's skillful means-power,*  
*I have shown the three-vehicle teaching,*  
*And because sentient beings cling everywhere,*  
*I guide them to liberation.*  

---

## The Assembly's Confusion

At that time, there were in the great assembly twelve hundred Śrāvakas who had exhausted all outflows and were Arhats, including Ājñātakauṇḍinya and others, as well as those among the bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs, male and female lay disciples who had generated the aspiration toward Śrāvaka and Pratyekabuddha vehicles. All of them harbored this thought:

"Why does the World-Honored One so earnestly praise skillful means (upaya) and speak in this manner? He says that the dharma obtained by the Buddha is profoundly difficult to comprehend, that what he speaks is of meaning difficult to discern, that it exceeds the capacity of all Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas to attain.

"The Buddha has spoken of one meaning of liberation,[^8] which we too have obtained, enabling us to reach nirvāṇa. Yet now we do not understand toward what end this teaching aims."[^9]

---

## Śāriputra's Inquiry

At that time, Śāriputra, recognizing the perplexity in the hearts of the fourfold assembly and being himself uncertain, addressed the Buddha:

"World-Honored One, for what cause and condition do you so earnestly praise the supreme skillful means of all the Buddhas—that dharma most profoundly subtle and difficult to comprehend? Since ancient times, I have never heard from the Buddha such teaching as this. Now the fourfold assembly harbors doubt about this matter. I beseech you, World-Honored One, to elucidate this matter! Why do you so earnestly praise the dharma so profoundly subtle and difficult to comprehend?"[^10]

---

## Śāriputra's Verse of Inquiry

Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

*O Wisdom-Sun, Great Sage of Honor,*  
*Long have you refrained from speaking this dharma,*  
*You yourself have spoken of possessing such power, fearlessness, and concentrations,*  
*Meditations, liberations, and other inconceivable dharmas.*  

*The dharma obtained upon the seat of enlightenment,*  
*—no one has capacity to question about it.*  
*Your intention is difficult to measure,*  
*And there is none who can question you.*  

*Without being asked, you spontaneously speak,*  
*Praising the path you have traversed,*  
*Your wisdom is supremely subtle,*  
*The attainment of all the Buddhas.*  

*The unconditioned Arhats,*  
*And those seeking nirvāṇa,*  
*Now find themselves caught in a net of doubt—*  
*Why do you speak in this manner?*  

*Those seeking the pratyekabuddha vehicle,*  
*The bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs,*  
*All the devas, dragons, ghosts, and spirits,*  
*And the gandharvas and others,*  

*Gaze at each other with doubt in their hearts,*  
*Reverently looking to the Two-Footed Honored One,*  
*Asking: What is the meaning of this?*  
*I beseech the Buddha to explain.*  

*Regarding all the Śrāvaka assembly,*  
*The Buddha has said I am foremost.*  
*But I myself harbor doubt regarding wisdom—*  
*Is this the ultimate dharma, or is it the practiced path?*  

*Sons of the Buddha, joined hands reverently,*  
*Await in anticipation,*  
*Wishing to hear your subtle voice,*  
*At this time explaining what is truly so.*  

*The devas, dragons, and spiritual beings,*  
*Number like Ganges' sands,*  
*The Bodhisattvas seeking the Buddha,*  
*Are eighty thousand in great number.*  

*Moreover, all the billions of worlds,*  
*Including wheel-turning sage kings,*  
*With palms joined in reverent respect,*  
*Desire to hear the complete path.*  

---

## The Buddha's Hesitation and Reassurance

Then the Buddha said to Śāriputra: "Cease, cease! There is no need to speak further. If I were to explain this matter, the entire world of devas and humans would be astonished and filled with perplexity."[^11]

Śāriputra again respectfully addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I beseech you to speak! I beseech you to speak! Why is this? This assembly includes immeasurable, hundreds of thousands of billions of asankhya sentient beings who have witnessed countless Buddhas before. Their faculties are keen and sharp, their wisdom is clear and lucid. These beings, having heard the dharma the Buddha speaks, will be able to generate respectful faith."[^12]

---

## Verse on the Assembly's Readiness

Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

*O Dharma King without superior,*  
*I beseech you to speak without hesitation—*  
*This assembly contains immeasurable multitudes,*  
*Who are capable of generating respectful faith.*  

---

## The Buddha's Continued Reluctance

The Buddha again restrained Śāriputra, saying: "If I were to explain this matter, all the devas, humans, and asuras would be astonished. Moreover, monks seized by arrogant conceit will fall into a great abyss."[^13]

---

## The Buddha's Verse on the Difficulty of Teaching

Then the World-Honored One spoke in verse:

*Cease, cease—there is no need to speak.*  
*My dharma is wonderfully difficult to conceive,*  
*Those seized by arrogant conceit,*  
*Hearing it, will generate no respectful faith.*  

---

## Śāriputra's Final Entreaty

Then Śāriputra again respectfully addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I beseech you to speak! I beseech you to speak! In this assembly, there are ones comparable to myself, numbering in the hundreds of thousands and billions across countless ages. Having long been transformed by the Buddha, such persons will certainly generate respectful faith and enjoy long safety and repose, receiving immeasurable benefit."[^14]

---

## Verse of Śāriputra's Final Request

Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

*O Unsurpassed Two-Footed Honored One,*  
*I beseech you to teach the supreme dharma—*  
*I am the Buddha's eldest son,*  
*I alone receive your distinctions of teaching.*  

*This assembly contains immeasurable multitudes,*  
*Capable of generating faith in this dharma.*  
*The Buddha has, through countless ages,*  
*Taught and transformed beings such as these.*  

*All with unified, joined hands,*  
*Desire to hear the Buddha's words.*  
*We twelve hundred,*  
*Together with all who seek Buddhahood,*  

*On behalf of this assembly,*  
*I beseech you to make distinctions clear.*  
*These beings, hearing this dharma,*  
*Will generate great joy.*  

---

## The Buddha's Consent and the Departure of Doubters

Then the World-Honored One said to Śāriputra: "You have made your earnest request three times. How could I not speak? Now listen attentively and think carefully upon what I say. I shall make clear distinctions for you."[^15]

At the moment the Buddha spoke these words, there arose from their seats among the assembly five thousand bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, male and female lay disciples, and they bowed to the Buddha and withdrew.[^16] Why was this?

"This group harbored deep karmic roots of transgression and, moreover, arrogant conceit. They presumed attainment without having truly attained, and presumed realization without having truly realized. Possessed of such failings, they did not remain. The World-Honored One, observing this, made no attempt to prevent them from departing."[^17]

---

## The Buddha's Affirmation of the Remaining Assembly

Then the Buddha said to Śāriputra: "Now my assembly here is entirely purified, without superfluous branches—consisting only of authentic fruit. Śāriputra, such proud and conceited persons departing is a good thing. Now listen well. I shall explain this to you. Śāriputra replied: 'Excellent, World-Honored One. I earnestly desire to hear.'"[^18]

---

## THE HEART OF THE TEACHING: THE ONE GREAT CAUSE

## The Rarity and Incomparability of the Buddha's Teaching

The Buddha then addressed Śāriputra:

"This Wonderful Dharma is something that all the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, only rarely teach. It is comparable to the udumbara flower, which blooms but once in a very long age. Śāriputra, you and others should believe in the words of the Buddha, for the Buddha's speech is not false and cannot deceive.[^19]

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas teach the dharma adaptively (upaya) according to circumstances and conditions, and their meaning is difficult to comprehend. Why is this?

"I employ innumerable skillful means, various causes and conditions, parables and verbal expressions to expound upon the various dharmas. This dharma cannot be comprehended through thinking and discrimination—only the Buddhas are capable of knowing it.

"Why is this? All the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world for one great cause alone. Śāriputra, what is meant by 'the Buddhas appear in the world for one great cause'?

"The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world in order to open for sentient beings the perception of Buddha-wisdom (buddha-jñāna). They appear in order to show sentient beings the Buddha-perception. They appear in order to cause sentient beings to awaken to Buddha-perception. They appear in order to guide sentient beings into the path of Buddha-perception.[^20]

"Śāriputra, this is the one great cause for which the Buddhas appear in the world."[^21]

---

## The One Buddha Vehicle

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas teach and transform only Bodhisattvas. Whatever the Buddhas undertake to do is always for one purpose alone: to show sentient beings the Buddha-perception, to cause them to awaken to it.

"Śāriputra, because of the One Buddha Vehicle, the Tathāgata teaches the dharma to all sentient beings. There are no other vehicles—neither two nor three.[^22] Śāriputra, all the Buddhas of the ten directions teach the dharma in this very manner."[^23]

---

## Universal Attainment Through One Vehicle

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the past employed innumerable skillful means, various causes and conditions, parables and verbal expressions to expound upon the various dharmas. All these dharmas were for the One Buddha Vehicle alone. The sentient beings who heard the dharma from these Buddhas ultimately obtained the wisdom-knowing-all-aspects (sarvākārajñatā).[^24]

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the future shall appear in the world, and they too shall employ innumerable skillful means, various causes and conditions, parables and verbal expressions to expound upon the various dharmas. All these dharmas will be for the One Buddha Vehicle alone. The sentient beings who hear the dharma from these Buddhas shall ultimately obtain the wisdom-knowing-all-aspects.

"Śāriputra, in the present age, in the boundless, countless, billion-fold Buddha-lands of the ten directions, the World-Honored Ones who dwell there bring immeasurable benefit and peace to sentient beings. These Buddhas too employ innumerable skillful means, various causes and conditions, parables and verbal expressions to expound upon the various dharmas. All these dharmas are for the One Buddha Vehicle alone. The sentient beings who hear the dharma from these Buddhas shall ultimately obtain the wisdom-knowing-all-aspects.

"Śāriputra, these Buddhas teach and transform only Bodhisattvas, desiring to show sentient beings the Buddha-perception, desiring to cause sentient beings to awaken to the Buddha-perception, desiring to guide sentient beings into the path of Buddha-perception.

"Śāriputra, I too am now in precisely this manner. Knowing that sentient beings possess various desires, deeply attached according to their fundamental natures, I employ various causes and conditions, parables and verbal expressions, skillful means, to expound the dharma for them. Śāriputra, in all these ways, my purpose is to realize the One Buddha Vehicle and the wisdom-knowing-all-aspects."[^25]

---

## The Denial of the Three Vehicles in Absolute Reality

"Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions, there do not even exist two vehicles, much less three. Śāriputra, the Buddhas appear in the world amid the five corruptions and turbidities[^26]—namely, the corruption of the age, the corruption of afflictions, the corruption of sentient beings, the corruption of views, and the corruption of lifespan.

"Thus, Śāriputra, when the age is corrupted and turbid, sentient beings are weighted with defilements, stingy and jealous, and have accumulated roots of unwholesomeness. Therefore, the Buddhas, by means of skillful means-power, within the One Buddha Vehicle, make distinctions and teach the three vehicles.[^27]

"Śāriputra, if my disciples, claiming to be Arhats or Pratyekabuddhas, do not hear about this matter—that the Tathāgata teaches and transforms only Bodhisattvas—then they are not disciples of the Buddha, not Arhats, and not Pratyekabuddhas."[^28]

---

## The False Claim of Arhatship

"Moreover, Śāriputra, those bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs who claim they have already attained the state of Arhat, that this is their final body, and that they have ultimately realized nirvāṇa, and therefore no longer aspire to realize anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi—you should understand that such persons are seized by arrogant conceit.

"Why is this? If a bhikṣu truly attains Arhatship, if he does not believe in this dharma, such a situation is impossible.[^29] [Exception exists only] when the Buddha has entered parinirvāṇa and no Buddha is present in the world.

"Why is this? After the Buddha enters parinirvāṇa, if there are persons who receive, read, recite, and understand the meaning of sutras such as this, these persons are rare indeed. When they encounter another Buddha, regarding this dharma they will attain decisive understanding.

"Śāriputra, you and all others should generate one-pointed faith and understanding, and receive and uphold the Buddha's words. The Tathāgata and all other Buddhas do not speak falsity. There are no other vehicles—the Buddha Vehicle alone exists."[^30]

---

## Verse Recapitulation of the One Vehicle Teaching

Then the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

*Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs,*  
*Those harboring arrogant conceit,*  
*Male lay practitioners of pride,*  
*Female lay practitioners of faithlessness,*  

*Such among these four groups,*  
*Numbering five thousand in total,*  
*Who do not perceive their own shortcomings,*  
*With respect to the precepts possessing flaws,*  

*Who protect and hide their defects—*  
*The small-minded have now departed,*  
*The chaff among the assembly,*  
*Gone due to the Buddha's majesty.*  

*Now this assembly contains no branches,*  
*Consisting entirely of authentic fruit.*  
*Śāriputra, listen carefully!*  
*The dharma the Buddhas obtain,*  

*Is through immeasurable skillful means-power,*  
*That they teach the various dharmas to sentient beings.*  
*The beings' hearts' intentions,*  
*The various paths they pursue,*  

*The differing desires and natures,*  
*And the wholesome and unwholesome deeds from the past—*  
*The Buddha, having completely understood all this,*  
*By means of causes, conditions, parables, and verbal expressions,*  

*And skillful means-power,*  
*Teaches all beings to their joy.*  
*Teaching sutras and poetic gathas,*  
*Stories and previous lives,*  

*And also on causes and conditions,*  
*Parables, verses, and analytic discourse—*  
*Those of dull faculties who delight in small dharmas,*  
*Clinging to birth and death,*  

*Among the countless Buddhas,*  
*Not practicing the profound subtle path,*  
*Troubled by all sufferings,*  
*For such beings I teach nirvāṇa.*  

*I create this skillful means,*  
*To enable them to enter Buddha-wisdom,*  
*Never before have I taught that you,*  
*Should attain the Buddha path.*  

*Why have I not taught this before?*  
*Because the time for speaking had not yet come.*  
*Now at last the time has arrived—*  
*I shall now decisively teach the great vehicle.*  

*These nine categories of teaching,*  
*I teach in accordance with sentient beings,*  
*Taking the great vehicle as the foundation,*  
*Therefore I teach this sutra.*  

*There are Buddha-children,*  
*Pure of heart and of pliable faculties,*  
*Who have before countless Buddhas,*  
*Practiced the profound subtle path.*  

*For all such Buddha-children,*  
*I teach this great-vehicle sutra.*  
*I prophesy to such beings,*  
*That in the future they shall become Buddhas,*  

*Because of deep mindfulness toward the Buddha,*  
*And constant cultivation of pure precepts.*  
*Upon hearing the Buddha's dharma,*  
*Great joy fills their entire bodies.*  

*The Buddha knows their minds and deeds,*  
*And therefore teaches them the great vehicle.*  
*Whether Śrāvakas or Bodhisattvas,*  
*Who hear the dharma I teach,*  

*Even to the extent of a single verse,*  
*All shall without doubt become Buddhas.*  
*In the Buddha-lands of the ten directions,*  
*There exists only the One Vehicle dharma—*  

*Neither two nor three.*  
*Except for the Buddhas' skillful means-teaching,*  
*Which merely uses provisional names,*  
*To guide sentient beings,*  

*Speaking of Buddha-wisdom.*  
*All the Buddhas who appear in the world,*  
*Accomplish this single real principle,*  
*While the other two are not true.*  

*They shall never employ the small vehicle,*  
*To liberate any sentient being at all.*  
*The Buddha dwells in the great vehicle,*  
*In accordance with the dharma obtained,*  

*Adorned with concentrated power and wisdom,*  
*With this they liberate sentient beings.*  
*Having themselves realized the supreme path,*  
*The impartial dharma of the great vehicle,*  

*If one were to use the small vehicle,*  
*Even to transform a single person,*  
*I would fall into stinginess and attachment—*  
*This is an impossible matter.*  

*If a person takes refuge in the Buddha,*  
*The Tathāgata does not deceive or betray,*  
*Nor harbors any stingy or jealous intent,*  
*But severs all evil dharmas.*  

*Therefore the Buddha, in the ten directions,*  
*Stands alone without fear.*  
*I adorn my body with the sublime marks,*  
*And my light illuminates the world.*  

*Honored by countless multitudes,*  
*To proclaim the seal of the real nature of reality.[^31]*  
*Śāriputra, you should know,*  
*I have established the original vow,*  

*Desiring that all beings,*  
*Would be equal with me.*  
*As I vowed in the past,*  
*Now this is fully accomplished—*  

*I teach all sentient beings,*  
*Causing them to enter the Buddha path.*  
*If I encounter any sentient being,*  
*I teach them all the Buddha path—*  

*Those without wisdom become confused,*  
*Bewildered and unable to receive the teaching.*  
*I know such sentient beings,*  
*Have never cultivated wholesome roots,*  

*Firmly attached to the five desires,*  
*Caused suffering by delusion and craving.*  
*Because of various desire-conditions,*  
*They fall and descend into the three evil paths,*  

*Circling through the six destinies,*  
*Completely experiencing all suffering and pain,*  
*Receiving tiny embryonic forms,*  
*Continually increasing through world after world.*  

*Those of slight virtue and meager good fortune,*  
*Pressed upon by all sufferings,*  
*Enter into forests of perverted views—*  
*Viewing existence and non-existence equally.*  

*Relying on such perverted views,*  
*Possessed of sixty-two such views,*  
*Deeply attached to false dharmas,*  
*Firmly grasping them as inseparable,*  

*With self-pride and exalted conceit,*  
*Scheming hearts and untruthful intentions,*  
*For billions of eons,*  
*They hear not the Buddha's name,*  

*Nor hear the correct dharma—*  
*Such beings are difficult to liberate.*  
*Therefore, Śāriputra,*  
*I create skillful means,*  

*Teaching all dharmas that exhaust suffering,*  
*Showing them nirvāṇa.*  
*Although I teach nirvāṇa,*  
*This is also not true extinction.*  

*For all dharmas have,*  
*From the beginning, the characteristic of quiescence.*  
*Buddha-children practicing the path,*  
*In the future will become Buddhas.*  

*I possess skillful means-power,*  
*Opening and revealing the three-vehicle dharmas.*  
*All the World-Honored Ones,*  
*All speak the one-vehicle path—*  

*In this assembly,*  
*All should cast off their doubts.*  
*The language of the Buddhas is without variance—*  
*Only One Vehicle without a second.*  

*In past countless eons,*  
*Countless, immeasurable Buddhas have passed away,*  
*A hundred thousand billion types,*  
*Beyond measure in number.*  

*All such World-Honored Ones,*  
*Through various causes, conditions, and parables,*  
*Immeasurable skillful means-power,*  
*Expounded the characteristics of various dharmas.*  

*All these World-Honored Ones,*  
*All taught the one-vehicle dharma,*  
*Transforming countless sentient beings,*  
*Causing them to enter the Buddha path.*  

*Again, all the great sage-rulers,*  
*Knowing all the world—*  
*Devas, humans, and all other living kinds,*  
*The deep desires of their hearts—*  

*By means of alternative skillful means,*  
*They further reveal the supreme reality.[^32]*  
*If there are sentient beings,*  
*Who encounter the Buddhas of the past,*  

*Or hearing the dharma of giving,*  
*Or maintaining precepts, practicing patience,*  
*Exerting effort, meditation, and wisdom—*  
*Cultivating all manner of virtue and good fortune—*  

*All such persons,*  
*Have already become Buddhas.*  
*After the Buddhas have passed away,*  
*If beings possess gentle, soft hearts,*  

*All such sentient beings,*  
*Have already become Buddhas.*  
*After the Buddhas have passed away,*  
*Those who make offerings to the relics,*  

*Erecting billions of kinds of stūpas,*  
*Of gold, silver, and crystal,*  
*Beryl and agate,*  
*Pearls and jewels—*  

*Brightly adorned with purity,*  
*Decorated and ornate with many stūpas,*  
*Or building stone temples,*  
*Sandalwood and aloe-wood,*  

*Timber and other materials,*  
*Brick, tile, clay and earth—*  
*Or in wastelands,*  
*Accumulating earth into Buddha shrines,*  

*Even children at play,*  
*Piling sand to make Buddha stūpas—*  
*All such persons as these,*  
*Have already become Buddhas.*  

*If a person, for the Buddha's sake,*  
*Establishes all manner of Buddha images,*  
*Carving and sculpting all kinds of forms—*  
*All have already become Buddhas.*  

*Made from the seven precious substances,*  
*Copper, stone, red and white bronze,*  
*White lead and tin,*  
*Wood and clay, etc.—*  

*Or with glue, lacquer, and cloth,*  
*All adorned as Buddha images—*  
*All such persons as these,*  
*Have already become Buddhas.*  

*Painted and rendered as Buddha images,*  
*Adorned with the hundred-fold blessings—*  
*Whether one creates or directs others to create—*  
*All have already become Buddhas.*  

*Even to the extent that children in play,*  
*With grass, wood, or a brush,*  
*Or with their fingernails or teeth,*  
*Paint Buddha images—*  

*All such persons as these,*  
*Gradually accumulate blessed merit,*  
*Complete the heart of great compassion,*  
*And have already become Buddhas.*  

*Transforming only Bodhisattvas,*  
*Liberating countless sentient beings.*  
*If a person, in stūpas or temples,*  
*With precious images and painted ones,*  

*Makes offerings with flowers, incense, banners, and canopies,*  
*With a heart of reverent respect.*  
*Or causes music to be made,*  
*Striking drums and blowing horns and conches,*  

*Flutes, lyres, and harps,*  
*Lutes and cymbals, and brass bells—*  
*All such marvelous sounds,*  
*Are employed in making offerings.*  

*Or with a joyful heart,*  
*One sings hymns praising the Buddha's virtue—*  
*To the extent of even one small utterance,*  
*All have already become Buddhas.*  

*If a person with distracted mind,*  
*Even offers a single flower,*  
*To a painted Buddha image,*  
*They shall gradually see countless Buddhas.*  

*Or if someone bows,*  
*Or merely joins their palms,*  
*Lifts a single hand,*  
*Or even slightly bows the head,*  

*In making offerings to an image—*  
*They shall gradually perceive countless Buddhas.*  
*And will themselves attain the supreme path,*  
*Widely liberating countless sentient beings,*  

*Entering the unconditioned parinirvāṇa,*  
*Like fire extinguished when fuel is exhausted.*  
*If a person with scattered mind,*  
*Enters into a stūpa or temple,*  

*And utters a single "Homage to the Buddha,"*  
*All have already become Buddhas.*  
*Regarding past Buddhas,*  
*Both in their living presence and after their passing,*  

*If any being hears this dharma,*  
*All have already become Buddhas.*  
*The future World-Honored Ones,*  
*Shall be boundless in number,*  

*All such Tathāgatas,*  
*Shall also teach the dharma through skillful means.*  
*All the Tathāgatas,*  
*Through immeasurable skillful means-power,*  

*Liberate all sentient beings,*  
*Causing them to enter the Buddha's unconditioned wisdom.*  
*If there is one who hears the dharma,*  
*There is none who shall not become a Buddha.*  

*All the Buddhas' original vows,*  
*Are that the path I have practiced,*  
*I universally desire all sentient beings,*  
*To attain this path equally.*  

*The future World-Honored Ones,*  
*Though teaching hundreds of billions,*  
*Of countless dharma-teachings,*  
*In reality constitute but one vehicle.*  

*All the Buddhas, the two-footed honored ones,*  
*Know that dharma is ever without nature,*  
*Buddha-seed arises from conditions—*  
*Therefore they teach the one vehicle.*[^33]

## Conclusion: The Truth of the Teaching

"This dharma dwells in the dharmic position; the characteristics of the world ever remain constant. Upon the seat of enlightenment, having understood this, the guide teaches it through skillful means.[^34]

"The beings honored by heaven and people, the present Buddhas in the ten directions, numbering like Ganges' sands, appearing in the world in order to bring peace to sentient beings, all teach this same dharma.

"Understanding supreme quiescence through skillful means-power, although they show various paths, in reality this is the Buddha Vehicle. Understanding sentient beings' practices, the deep desires of their hearts, their past habits and karmic deeds, the desires and exertions of their faculties, dull and keen—through various causes, conditions, parables, and verbal expressions, they teach adaptively according to circumstances.

"I too am now in this manner, bringing peace to sentient beings through infinite dharma-teachings, revealing the Buddha path.

"I employ the power of wisdom to know sentient beings' natures and desires, teaching the dharmas through skillful means such that all attain joy.

"Śāriputra, with the Buddha-eye I observe the six-path sentient beings—poor, without virtue and good fortune, entering the dangerous path of birth and death, their suffering continuously unceasing, deeply attached to the five desires, like oxen attached to their own tails, blinded by greed and affection, unseeing.

"They do not seek the power of the great Mahāsattva Buddha, nor seek the dharma that cuts suffering; they deeply enter perverted views, and with suffering seek to transcend suffering.

"For the sake of such sentient beings, I generate the mind of great compassion.

"When I initially sat upon the seat of enlightenment, observing the trees and practicing circumambulation, within twenty-one days, I contemplated this matter: The wisdom I have obtained is subtle and supreme; sentient beings are dull-witted, bound by blindness and suffering—how can they be liberated?

"At that time, all the Brahmā kings, the devas of India, the Four Heavenly Kings, and the great Maheśvara devas, together with all celestial retinues numbering in the hundreds of thousands and millions, showed respect through palms joined in salutation, requesting me to turn the Dharma wheel.

"I then reflected within myself: If I merely praise the Buddha Vehicle, sentient beings submerged in suffering will be unable to generate faith in this dharma. If they reject the dharma due to faithlessness, they will fall into the three evil paths. It would be better for me not to teach the dharma and to quickly enter parinirvāṇa.[^35]

"Then I recalled the skillful means-power of the Buddhas of the past. Now, the path I have obtained should also employ teaching of the three vehicles.

"While contemplating this matter, all the Buddhas of the ten directions appeared to me and spoke with voices of Brahmā, comforting me: 'Well done, Śākyamuni, supreme guide! We have also obtained this dharma. In accordance with the conduct of all the Buddhas, we employ skillful means-power.

"'We too have all attained the supreme, most wonderful dharma. In order to teach all sentient beings, we make distinctions among the three vehicles. Although we teach the three vehicles, it is only to guide Bodhisattvas.

"'Those of limited wisdom delight in small dharmas and do not generate faith that they shall become Buddhas. This is why we employ skillful means, distinguishing the results.

"'Although we teach the three vehicles, in reality we guide all toward the Bodhisattva path.'

"Śāriputra, upon hearing the words of these Buddha-sages, and recalling their words, I rejoiced and called out, 'Homage to the Buddhas!' and contemplated this matter further.[^36]

"I realized that the appearance of Buddhas in the world is to teach Buddha-wisdom. And now is precisely the time to teach this dharma.[^37]

"Śāriputra, you should know: Those of dull faculties, those of limited wisdom, those seized by attachment and arrogant conceit, are unable to generate faith in this dharma.

"Now I am glad and without fear regarding all Bodhisattvas. I shall forthwith abandon skillful means and teach only the supreme path.

"The Bodhisattvas, having heard this dharma, will have their nets of doubt completely severed. The twelve hundred Arhats shall all become Buddhas.[^38]

"Just as all the Buddhas of the three times teach the dharma through such methods, I now likewise teach the undifferentiated dharma.

"The appearance of Buddhas in the world is extraordinarily rare, and the chance to encounter them is difficult; even if one encounters them, to hear this dharma is rare; and the capacity to listen to this dharma is rare indeed.

"It is comparable to the udumbara flower, which all love and esteem, which devas and humans regard as rare, appearing only at certain times.

"One who hears this dharma with joyful praise, even to the extent of uttering a single word, has already made offerings to all the Buddhas of the three times. Such a person is extremely rare, surpassing even the udumbara flower.

"You should harbor no doubt! I am the Dharma King of all dharmas,[^39] and I hereby universally announce to the great assembly: It is through the One Buddha Vehicle alone that I teach the Bodhisattvas. There are no voice-hearer disciples.

"You, Śāriputra, together with all voice-hearers and Bodhisattvas, should understand that this wonderful dharma is the secret treasury of all the Buddhas.[^40]

"Because the five corruptions exist in this evil world, sentient beings delight in and cling to various desires. Such beings will never seek the Buddha path. When those evil-natured humans of the future age hear the Buddha teaching the One Vehicle, confused and faithless, they will reject the dharma and fall into the evil paths.[^41]

"But for those possessing shame and purity, seeking the Buddha path, I shall extensively praise the One Vehicle path.

"Śāriputra, you should know: The dharma of all Buddhas is thus—through immeasurable skillful means, teaching dharmas according to circumstances. Those who have not studied and learned cannot fully comprehend this.[^42]

"Now that you have already understood the Buddhas' nature and the matter of teaching through skillful means, without any further doubts, your hearts generate great joy, and you shall surely become Buddhas."

*[End of Fascicle 1 (卷一)]*

# Chapter 3: Parables

## Śāriputra's Joy and Understanding

At that time, Śāriputra, overflowing with joy and delight, immediately rose from his seat, pressed his palms together in salutation, gazed upon the Buddha's face with reverent attention, and addressed the Buddha:

"Now, having heard this dharma-sound from the World-Honored One, my heart overflows with joy and I have experienced what has never been experienced before. Why is this?

"In ancient times, when I heard from the Buddha such a teaching as this, I saw that the various Bodhisattvas received prophecies of Buddhahood, yet I and my companions were not included in these events. I deeply sorrowed within myself, feeling that I had lost the infinite wisdom of the Tathāgata.[^1]

"World-Honored One, I have often dwelt alone in mountain forests and beneath trees, whether sitting or walking, constantly entertaining this thought: 'We have all entered into the dharma-nature equally—why then does the Tathāgata appear to guide us through the small vehicle?' This fault lies with us, not with the World-Honored One. Why is this?

"Had we expected the teaching of that which would enable us to achieve anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, we would surely have been liberated through the great vehicle. However, we did not understand the skillful means of adaptive teaching according to circumstances. Upon first hearing the Buddha's teaching, we encountered it and immediately generated faith, contemplated it, and claimed realization.

"World-Honored One, since ancient times I have continuously and throughout day and night reproached myself. Yet now, having heard from the Buddha teachings never before heard, unprecedented dharmas, I have severed all doubt and regret. My body and mind are at peace, my heart is utterly tranquil. Today I truly understand that I am a Buddha-child, born from the Buddha's mouth, born from the dharma, and possessed of the Buddha-dharma inheritance."[^2]

---

## Śāriputra's Verse of Joy

Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

*Having heard this dharma-sound,*  
*I have obtained what was never before experienced,*  
*My heart overflows with great joy,*  
*And all my nets of doubt have been severed.*  

*In the past, receiving the Buddha's teaching,*  
*I did not lose the great vehicle,*  
*The Buddha's sound is supremely rare,*  
*Able to remove all sentient beings' afflictions.*  

*I have already exhausted all outflows,*  
*And this hearing has removed my distress.*  
*I dwelt in valleys*  
*Or beneath forest trees,*  

*Whether sitting or walking in meditation,*  
*I constantly contemplated this matter,*  
*Grieving deeply and reproaching myself:*  
*How could I deceive myself?*  

*We too are Buddha-children,*  
*Having entered into the unconditioned dharma together,*  
*Yet I have been unable in the future,*  
*To expound the supreme path.*  

*The thirty-two marks of gold,*  
*The ten powers and all liberations,*  
*Shared within one dharma,*  
*Yet I did not obtain this.*  

*The eighty wonderful characteristics,*  
*The eighteen dharmas unique to Buddhas,*  
*And such meritorious qualities as these,*  
*I have altogether lost.*  

*During my solitary practice, walking,*  
*I saw the Buddha in the great assembly,*  
*His renown filling the ten directions,*  
*Bringing immeasurable benefit to all beings.*  

*I contemplated how I had lost this benefit,*  
*And knew that I had deceived myself.*  
*Constantly throughout day and night,*  
*I contemplated this matter,*  

*Wishing to question the World-Honored One,*  
*Whether I had lost or not lost this,*  
*I constantly saw the World-Honored One,*  
*Praising the various Bodhisattvas.*  

*Because of this, throughout day and night,*  
*I deliberated upon this matter.*  
*Now, hearing the Buddha's voice,*  
*Teaching the dharma according to circumstances,*  

*The unconditioned, inconceivable dharma,*  
*That brings all beings to enlightenment.*  
*I was originally attached to perverted views,*  
*A teacher to all the Brahmin ascetics.*  

*The World-Honored One knew my mind,*  
*And uprooted my perverted views by teaching nirvāṇa.*  
*I have completely eliminated perverted views,*  
*And realized the dharma of emptiness.*  

*At that time, my mind believed,*  
*That I had attained extinction.*  
*Yet now I have suddenly awakened,*  
*That this is not true extinction.*  

*When I obtain Buddhahood,*  
*Possessing the thirty-two marks,*  
*The devas, humans, yakshas,*  
*And dragon-beings showing reverence,*  

*Only then can it be truly said,*  
*That extinction has been completed without remainder.*  
*The Buddha, in the great assembly,*  
*Has taught that I shall become a Buddha.*  

*Having heard such dharma-sound,*  
*All my doubt and regret have been severed.*  
*When I first heard what the Buddha taught,*  
*My heart harbored great astonishment and doubt,*  

*"Could this be the work of Māra,*  
*Creating a false Buddha, disturbing my mind?"*  
*The Buddha, through various causes and conditions,*  
*Parables and skillfully chosen words, spoke,*  

*And my heart became calm as the ocean,*  
*My nets of doubt were severed upon hearing.*  
*The Buddha spoke of past world-ages,*  
*Countless Buddhas who had passed away,*  

*Who dwell within skillful means,*  
*And all taught this very dharma.*  
*The Buddhas of the present and future,*  
*Are boundless in number,*  

*And also through skillful means,*  
*Expound this dharma likewise.*  
*Just as the World-Honored One of today,*  
*From birth and renunciation of family life,*  

*Attained the path and turned the dharma-wheel,*  
*Also teaching through skillful means.*  
*The World-Honored One speaks the true path—*  
*Māra has no such accomplishment.*  

*Therefore, I know with certainty,*  
*That this is not the work of Māra.*  
*I had fallen into nets of doubt,*  
*Thinking it was Māra's doing.*  

*Upon hearing the Buddha's gentle and soft voice,*  
*Profoundly mysterious and supremely subtle,*  
*Expounding the pure dharma,*  
*My heart was filled with great joy.*  

*Doubt and regret have forever been severed,*  
*And I dwell firmly in true wisdom.*  
*I shall certainly become a Buddha,*  
*Honored by devas and humans,*  

*Turn the supreme dharma-wheel,*  
*And teach the various Bodhisattvas.*

## The Buddha's Prophecy for Śāriputra

Then the Buddha addressed Śāriputra: "Now I speak before the assembly of devas, humans, monks, and Brahmins: I previously, for immeasurable billions of eons, in the presence of twenty billion Buddhas, for the sake of achieving the supreme path, continually taught and transformed you. You also, for countless nights, followed me and received my teaching.

"Because I guided you through skillful means, you were born within my teaching. Śāriputra, in the past I taught you to aspire to the Buddha path. You have now forgotten this, and thus you presume you have already attained extinction. Now I wish to cause you to recollect your original vow and the path you cultivated. For this reason, for all the Śrāvakas I teach this great-vehicle sutra, called the *Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower*, the teaching for Bodhisattvas, protected and remembered by all the Buddhas."[^3]

---

## Śāriputra's Future Buddhahood

"Śāriputra, in the future world, after passing through immeasurable, boundless, inconceivable eons, having made offerings to countless billions of Buddhas, upheld the correct dharma, perfected the bodhisattva path, you shall become a Buddha with the title Tathāgata of Radiant Flower, Worthy of Offerings, Possessor of Perfect Knowledge, Possessor of Perfect Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed Guide, Trainer of Beings, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.

"The land will be named Pure Radiance, its earth level and even, supremely pure and beautifully adorned, secure and prosperous, with abundance of devas and humans. Its ground shall be made of lapis lazuli, with eight crossways adorned with golden boundaries. Throughout the realm shall grow seven-jeweled trees, eternally bearing flowers and fruit. The Tathāgata of Radiant Flower shall also teach the three vehicles to sentient beings."[^4]

---

## The Golden Age of Radiant Flower Buddha

"Śāriputra, at the time of this Buddha's emergence, although it will not be an evil age, because of his original vow, he will teach the three-vehicle dharma. The eon shall be named 'Great Jeweled Adornment.' Why is it called 'Great Jeweled Adornment'? Because the beings considered the great jewels of that realm are the Bodhisattvas themselves.[^5]

"Those Bodhisattvas shall be boundless, immeasurable, and inconceivable—beyond the capacity of calculation, parable, or comparison. Only the Buddha's wisdom has the capacity to know them. When they desire to go about, precious flowers manifest beneath their feet.

"These Bodhisattvas are not newly-aspiring ones but have long planted roots of virtue and cultivated the Brahmin conduct purely in the presence of countless billions of Buddhas. They are continuously praised by all Buddhas, constantly cultivate Buddha-wisdom, possess great supernatural powers, skillfully understand the gateways to all dharmas, are direct and without deception, and have fixed, unwavering intentions. Such Bodhisattvas fill that Buddha-realm entirely."[^6]

---

## THE PARABLE OF THE BURNING HOUSE

## The Setting and the Fire

"Śāriputra, if in a country, city, or village there is a great householder—elderly, with wealth without measure, possessing much land, houses, servants, and retainers. His house is vast with only a single gate. Many people—one hundred, two hundred, up to five hundred—dwell within it. The buildings are decayed and deteriorated, the walls cracked and crumbling, the pillars at their foundations rotting and corrupting, the roof beams tilting dangerously. All around simultaneously, fire suddenly erupts, burning the entire dwelling.[^7]

"The householder's children—ten, twenty, or as many as thirty—are within this house. The householder sees the great fire rising from all four sides, is immediately seized with tremendous alarm, and thinks within himself:

"'Although I am able to escape safely from this burning gate, my children, being within the burning house, are absorbed in play and amusement, unaware and unknowing, neither startled nor fearful. The fire approaches their bodies, the pain is acute, yet their minds harbor no loathing, nor do they harbor any thought of escaping.'"[^8]

---

## The Father's Dilemma and First Attempt

"Śāriputra, the householder then thinks: 'My body possesses strength and skill. I should use my garments or a cloth to pull the children out of the house.' Then again he thinks: 'This house has only one gate, and it is narrow and small. The children are very young, without understanding or awareness, clinging to their playing places. When they come out, they might fall down or be burned by the fire. I must describe to them the frightening nature of this situation—this house is already burning, and it is fitting that you quickly exit, so that the fire does not burn and harm you.'

"Having this thought, he carefully tells all his children: 'You must quickly exit!' Though the father is compassionate and entices them with gentle words, the children, absorbed in play, do not believe him, are neither startled nor afraid, and have no intention of exiting. They do not know what fire is, what the house is, what being lost means, but only run about in play to the east and west, glancing at their father."[^9]

---

## The Father's Skilful Means

"At that time the householder immediately thinks: 'This house is greatly burning in flames. If I and my children do not exit in time, we shall all be burned. Now I must establish skillful means to enable my children to escape this danger.'

"The father knows that each of his children previously harbored various preferences for rare and wonderful playthings and objects, which their feelings naturally delighted in. He tells them:

"'The playthings and precious objects that delight you are rare and difficult to obtain. If you do not take them, you will surely regret it later. There are here various kinds of sheep-carts, deer-carts, and ox-carts, now outside the gate, which you can use for play. Come quickly out of this burning house, and according to your wishes, I shall give you each one of these carts.'

"At that moment, the children, hearing their father speak of these rare playthings suited to their desires, each became eager and sharp in mind, competing with one another and pushing forward in rivalry, hastening to run out of the burning house.[^10]

"At this time the householder, seeing his children safely escape, all seated in the open space at the four crossroads, unobstructed and secure, his heart at peace and overflowing with joy, thinks to himself:

"Then his children each address their father: 'Father, the playthings and precious objects you previously promised us—the sheep-carts, deer-carts, and ox-carts—we wish you to give them to us now.'"[^11]

---

## The Gift of the Great Carriage

"Śāriputra, at that time the householder bestows upon each child one great carriage. That carriage is tall and spacious, adorned and decorated with multitudinous precious materials, surrounded by railings, with bells suspended from all four sides. From its top hangs a jeweled canopy, also decorated and adorned with rare and various treasures. Jeweled ropes interweave, and precious flower-garlands hang down. Soft fabrics are thickly spread within, and cushioned with crimson pillows are arranged for reclining.

"It is drawn by white oxen, with lustrous and pure skin, beautiful in form, possessing great strength and power, steady and even in gait, swift as wind. Many servants accompany and protect it. Why is this?[^fn_white_ox_cart]

[^fn_white_ox_cart]: **The Great White Ox Cart (大白牛車):** A critical distinction must be made between the "Ox Cart" (*niu che*) promised earlier (symbolizing the Bodhisattva vehicle among the Three Vehicles) and this "Great White Ox Cart" (*da bai niu che*) actually given. The "Great White Ox Cart" represents the *Ekayāna* (One Buddha Vehicle) which transcends and encompasses all three provisional vehicles. Kumārajīva's translation explicitly adds "Great White" to distinguish the ultimate reality from the provisional promise.

"This great householder possesses wealth without limit, and all his various treasuries are completely full and overflowing. Yet he thinks:

"'My wealth is without end—it is not fitting that I give my children inferior small carts. All these youths are my sons, and I love them without partiality. I possess such seven-jeweled great carts without measure, and it is fitting that I give them with equal mind to each, without favoritism. Why is this? Even if I were to distribute these possessions throughout an entire realm, there would still be no exhaustion—how much more so for my sons?'

"At this time each of the children, riding the great carriage, experienced what they had never before experienced, and what they had not originally expected."[^13]

---

## The Buddha's Application

"Śāriputra, what do you think of this matter? Is the householder's giving of these precious great carts to the children deceptive in any way?"[^14]

Śāriputra replied: "No, World-Honored One. The householder merely caused his children to escape the fire-danger and preserve their lives—this is not deceptive. Why? Because preserving their bodies and lives, they have already obtained the playthings they desired, much more so through skillful means to rescue them from the burning house. World-Honored One, even if the householder had not given them even the smallest single cart, it would still not be deceptive. Why? Because the householder previously formed this intention: 'I shall employ skillful means to enable my children to escape.' By this cause and condition, there is no deception. How much more so when the householder, knowing his wealth is immeasurable, wishes to benefit his children and gives them equally great carts."[^15]

---

## The Central Teaching: The Burning House and the Three Worlds

Then the Buddha said to Śāriputra: "Excellent! Excellent! As you have spoken. Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is likewise the father of all the world.[^16]

"The Tathāgata has completely exhausted all fears, afflictions, distress, sorrow, and ignorance and darkness—having realized infinite wisdom and knowledge, fearlessness, great supernatural power, and wisdom-power. The Tathāgata has perfected the perfection of skillful means and wisdom, great compassion and great loving-kindness, never ceasing in endeavor, constantly seeking to benefit all beings.[^17]

"The Tathāgata, being born within the three-world decaying house, in order to liberate sentient beings from birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, affliction, pain, ignorance, and darkness—from the fire of the three poisons (greed, hatred, delusion)—teaches the dharma, enabling them to attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.[^18]

"The Tathāgata sees sentient beings burned by birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, affliction, and pain. Because of the five desires and material wealth, they undergo various sufferings. Because of their greedy attachment and pursuit, they experience present suffering, and in the future will experience the suffering of hell-beings, animals, and hungry ghosts. If born among devas and humans, they experience poverty, suffering, separation from loved ones, meeting with those they hate—all manner of such various sufferings.

"Sentient beings are submerged within these sufferings, yet take joy in their entertainments and games, unaware and unknowing, neither startled nor afraid, generating no loathing and seeking no liberation. In this three-world burning house, they run about to east and west. Though they encounter great suffering, they do not regard it as a calamity.

"Śāriputra, the Buddha, having seen this, forms this thought: 'I am the father of sentient beings—I should free them from their suffering and hardship, and grant them the joy of infinite, boundless Buddha-wisdom, enabling them to engage in play.'[^19]"

---

## The Buddha's Internal Deliberation

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata again forms this thought: 'If I merely employ supernatural power and wisdom-power, abandoning skillful means, and for sentient beings praise the Tathāgata's wisdom, fearlessness, and powers, sentient beings would not thereby be liberated. Why? These sentient beings have not yet escaped birth, old age, sickness, death, and sorrow—they are burned by the three-world burning house. How could they comprehend Buddha-wisdom?'[^20]"

---

## The Buddha's Skilful Teaching of the Three Vehicles

"Śāriputra, as the householder, though possessed of physical strength and skill, did not employ it, but only through persistent skillful means labored to rescue his children from the burning house, and afterward gave them precious great carts—the Tathāgata is likewise:

"Although possessing power and fearlessness, the Tathāgata does not employ it. Rather, through wisdom and skillful means, within the three-world burning house, the Tathāgata liberates sentient beings, teaching the three vehicles—the Śrāvaka Vehicle, the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle, and the Buddha Vehicle—and speaks as follows:[^21]

"'You must not take pleasure in dwelling within the three-world burning house. Do not covet the coarse and inferior—forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations. If you grasp at them with craving and attachment, you will be burned. You must quickly emerge from the three worlds and attain the three vehicles—the Śrāvaka Vehicle, the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle, and the Buddha Vehicle. I give you my assurance of this matter; it shall never be false. You need only diligently cultivate mindfulness.'

"The Tathāgata, through these skillful means, encourages sentient beings forward, and again speaks: 'You should know that these three-vehicle dharmas are all praised by the sages, are free and unbound, with nothing to depend upon or seek. By means of these three vehicles, employing the unconditioned roots, powers, awakening-factors, path-factors, meditation, liberation, samadhi, and such, you shall entertain yourselves and obtain countless security, ease, and happiness.'"[^22]

---

## The Three Vehicles Explained

"Śāriputra, if there are sentient beings who possess inner wisdom-nature, who hear the dharma from the Buddha, the World-Honored One, generate faith and receive it, diligently cultivate, and speedily wish to escape the three worlds, seeking nirvāṇa for themselves—this is called the Śrāvaka Vehicle, like those children who sought the sheep-carts and exited the burning house.[^23]

"If there are sentient beings who hear the dharma from the Buddha, the World-Honored One, generate faith and receive it, diligently cultivate, seek the wisdom arising of itself, delight in solitary peace, and deeply understand the causes and conditions of all dharmas—this is called the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle, like those children who sought the deer-carts and exited the burning house.[^24]

"If there are sentient beings who hear the dharma from the Buddha, the World-Honored One, generate faith and receive it, diligently cultivate, seek the wisdom-knowing-all-aspects, Buddha-wisdom, wisdom-arising-of-itself, wisdom-without-teacher, the Tathāgata's wisdom and vision, the Buddha's power and fearlessness, who have compassion for and give ease to countless sentient beings, who benefit devas and humans, and liberate all beings—this is called the Great Vehicle. Bodhisattvas seek this vehicle, and therefore are called Mahāsattvas (Great Beings), like those children who sought the ox-carts and exited the burning house."[^25]

---

## The Ultimate Gift: The One Vehicle

"Śāriputra, as the householder, having seen his children safely escape from the burning house and arrive at the fearless place, knowing his wealth is without measure, grants to each child these great vehicles as equal gifts—the Tathāgata is likewise:

"Being the father of all sentient beings, when the Tathāgata sees countless billions of sentient beings, having escaped the suffering and fear of the three-world dangerous path through the Buddha-teaching gate, having attained the joy of nirvāṇa, the Tathāgata at that time forms this thought:

"'I possess infinite, boundless wisdom, fearlessness, and all the Buddha-dharma treasuries. All these sentient beings are my children. I shall equally grant them the great vehicle, and not allow any being to attain liberation alone.'

"All sentient beings are liberated by means of the Tathāgata's nirvāṇa. All these sentient beings who have escaped the three worlds are provided with the treasuries for entertainment of all the Buddhas—meditative absorptions, liberations, and such—all of which are of one characteristic, one type, praised by the sages, and capable of producing the purest, most supreme joy."[^26]

---

## The Resolution: No Deception in Skilful Means

"Śāriputra, as the householder initially employed three carts to entice his children, and subsequently gave them only the great carriage, with precious treasures and adornment, the most secure and supreme—yet that householder harbored no deception.

"The Tathāgata is likewise—there is no deception. The Tathāgata initially teaches the three vehicles to guide and transform sentient beings, and subsequently liberates all through the great vehicle alone. Why is this? Because the Tathāgata possesses infinite wisdom, fearlessness, and all dharma-treasuries, and is able to grant the great-vehicle dharma to all sentient beings—only they do not all have the capacity to receive it.[^27]

"Śāriputra, by means of this cause and condition, you should understand: The Buddhas, through the power of skillful means, within the One Buddha Vehicle, make distinctions and teach the three vehicles."[^28]

---

## The Complete Vision of the Buddha's Teaching

Then the Buddha, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse elaborating the entire parable with vivid detail and concluding:

*The World-Honored One is like this—*  
*Honored among all sages,*  
*Father of all sentient beings.*  
*All are my children,*  

*Deeply clinging to worldly pleasures,*  
*Lacking wisdom.*  
*The three worlds are without peace,*  
*Like a burning house,*  

*Full of all manner of suffering,*  
*Extremely fearful.*  
*Eternally possessing birth, old age, sickness, death, and sorrow—*  
*Such fires continuously blaze.*  

*The Tathāgata has already escaped the three-world burning house,*  
*Dwelling in tranquility, in peaceful solitude.*  
*Now this three worlds is wholly mine,*  
*And all its sentient beings are my children.*  

*Yet this realm contains many sufferings,*  
*Only I alone am able to rescue and protect them.*  
*Though I teach continually, they do not believe and accept.*  
*Regarding worldly desires and attachments, they cling deeply.*  

*By means of these skillful means,*  
*I teach the three vehicles,*  
*Enabling sentient beings to understand the three-world suffering,*  
*Opening and revealing the path of transcendence.*  

*If these children's minds become determined,*  
*Perfecting the three clear-knowings and six supernatural powers,*  
*Some obtain the pratyekabuddha realization or become non-retrogressive Bodhisattvas.*  
*You, Śāriputra, I teach to sentient beings,*  

*Through this parable,*  
*The One Buddha Vehicle—*  
*If all of you can generate faith in this teaching,*  
*Then all shall certainly attain the Buddha path.*  

*This vehicle is subtle and wonderful,*  
*Pure and supreme,*  
*In all the worlds it has no superior—*  
*Praised and honored by all Buddhas and sentient beings,*  

*Worthy of reverence and worship.*  
*Possessing countless billions of supernatural powers, liberations,*  
*Concentrations, wisdom, and other Buddha-dharmas,*  
*This vehicle grants to all children,*  

*Day and night, throughout eons,*  
*Constant play and entertainment,*  
*Together with all Bodhisattvas and śrāvaka assemblies,*  
*Riding this precious vehicle,*  

*Directly reaching enlightenment.*  
*By this cause and condition,*  
*Seeking throughout the ten directions,*  
*No other vehicle exists,*  

*Except the Buddha's skillful means.*  
*Tell Śāriputra:*  
*You and all others are my children—*  
*I am your father.*  

*Throughout countless eons,*  
*You have all been burned by manifold sufferings.*  
*I have completely rescued and liberated you,*  
*Enabling you to escape the three worlds.*  

*Though I previously taught*  
*That you have attained extinction—*  
*Merely exhausting birth and death—*  
*In truth, you have not been extinguished.*  

*What now remains to be accomplished*  
*Is only Buddha-wisdom.*  
*If any Bodhisattva in this assembly,*  
*Can listen wholeheartedly to the true dharma of all Buddhas,*  

*All Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones,*  
*Though employing skillful means,*  
*Transform all sentient beings into Bodhisattvas.*  
*If there are those of limited wisdom,*  

*Deeply attached to love and desire,*  
*For such beings I teach the suffering-truth.*  
*Sentient beings' hearts delight,*  
*Obtaining what has never been obtained,*  

*The Buddha's teaching of the suffering-truth—*  
*Truly without deception.*  
*If there are sentient beings*  
*Who do not know suffering's origin,*  

*Deeply attached to suffering's cause,*  
*Unable to abandon it for even a moment—*  
*For such beings, I skillfully teach the path.*  
*The cause of all suffering is greed and desire;*  

*If greed and desire are eliminated,*  
*There is nowhere for them to depend—*  
*Destroying all suffering completely,*  
*This is named the third truth.*  

*In order to extinguish the truth of cessation,*  
*One practices the path,*  
*Severing all suffering's bonds—*  
*This is called obtaining liberation.*

## WARNINGS REGARDING THE LOTUS SUTRA'S TRANSMISSION

"Śāriputra, you should not proclaim this dharma-seal of mine carelessly in places you travel. If there is one who hears, generates joy, and accepts it respectfully, understand that such a person shall attain non-retrogression. If any being generates faith and accepts this sutra-dharma, understand that such a person has already seen the Buddhas of the past, shown them respect and reverence, and also heard this dharma.

"Whoever can generate faith in what you teach shall see me, shall see you, and shall see the bhikṣu assembly and all the Bodhisattvas. This Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma is for those of profound wisdom. The shallow-minded, upon hearing it, become confused and do not understand. All the Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas are unable to comprehend this sutra.

"Śāriputra, you too only enter this sutra through faith—how much more so for other Śrāvakas? Moreover, Śāriputra, you should not teach this sutra to the arrogant, the lazy, those with the view of self, nor to those common folk of shallow understanding who are deeply attached to the five desires. For those who do not believe and slander this sutra shall reap grave karmic consequences."

# Chapter 4: Faith And Understanding

## The Four Great Disciples' Joy and Recognition

At that time, the wise Subhūti, Mahākātyāyana, Mahākāśyapa, and Mahāmaudgalyāyana, having heard from the Buddha this unprecedented teaching, with the World-Honored One granting prophecy of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi to Śāriputra, their hearts were moved with wonder and delight. They immediately rose from their seats, straightened their robes, uncovered their right shoulders in respectful posture, knelt upon their right knees, unified their minds by placing their palms together in reverent salutation, bowed deeply in respect, gazed upon the Buddha's countenance with undivided attention, and addressed the Buddha:

"World-Honored One, we are elders among the assembled monks, advanced in age, and we have long believed that we had already attained nirvāṇa and had no further capacity for spiritual attainment. We harbored no aspiration to advance toward anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"World-Honored One, in ages past when you taught the dharma at length, we sat in the assembly, but our bodies were weary and lethargic. We contemplated only emptiness, signlessness, and non-activity. Regarding the Bodhisattva dharma—the display of supernatural powers, the purification of Buddha-lands, and the perfection of sentient beings—our hearts did not delight in these teachings. Why was this?

"The World-Honored One caused us to escape from the three worlds and attain the realization of nirvāṇa. Moreover, at this time we are advanced in age. Toward the Buddha's teaching and transformation of Bodhisattvas aspiring to anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, we have not generated even a single thought of joy.

"Yet now, before the Buddha, we have heard the prophecy that we too shall attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi as Śrāvakas (voice-hearers). Our hearts are extremely joyful—we have experienced what we had never experienced before. We did not anticipate that at this time we would suddenly hear such a rare teaching. We deeply rejoice and feel that we have obtained great benefit, acquiring precious treasures without having sought them."[^1]

---

## The Parable of the Prodigal Son: Introduction

"World-Honored One, we now wish to speak in parable to clarify this meaning:

"There was a man who, in his youth, ignorant and without understanding, abandoned his father and fled, dwelling in another land for a long time—ten, twenty, or even fifty years.[^2] In his advancing age, he became impoverished and, wandering in all directions seeking clothing and food, gradually traveled and eventually arrived near his native land.

"His father, having long sought to find his son without success, had settled in a certain city. His household was immensely wealthy, with treasures beyond measure—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, coral, amber, crystal, pearls—all his storehouses completely filled and overflowing. He had numerous servants, officials, retainers, and common people. He possessed countless elephants, horses, chariots, ox-carts, and sheep. His wealth was engaged in business, spreading throughout other lands, and there were many merchants and traders. His father's thoughts constantly turned to his lost son.

"At that time, the impoverished son, seeking employment and wandering through villages and traveling through districts, eventually arrived at the city where his father had settled. His father had long mourned his son, and he and his son had been separated for more than fifty years. Yet the father never spoke of this matter to others. He merely thought within himself, harboring regret in his heart. He contemplated: 'I am old and approaching the end of life. I possess abundant wealth and treasures—gold, silver, precious jewels—my storehouses are completely full. But I have no son to whom I can entrust these riches. One day I shall die, and my wealth shall scatter and be lost with nothing to which it can be consigned. This is why I am constantly concerned and every moment remember my son.'

"Furthermore, he formed this thought: 'If I could only obtain my son and entrust him with my wealth, I would be at ease and happiness, without further worries.'"[^3]

---

## The Encounter: The Son Becomes Afraid

"World-Honored One, at that time the impoverished son, having hired himself to various employers, eventually arrived at his father's dwelling. He stood beside the gate. From a distance, he saw his father, seated upon a magnificent throne, his feet resting upon a precious footrest. Brahmins, nobles, and merchants all paid him respectful reverence. His body was adorned with pearls and precious ornaments worth thousands of millions of coins. Officials, servants, and retainers held white fly-whisks, standing to his left and right. A jeweled canopy was suspended above him, with precious flower banners hanging down. Fragrant water had been sprinkled on the ground, and precious flowers were scattered about. Precious objects were arrayed in display, brought in and taken out for distribution. Such was the variety of his magnificent adornment, and his authority and dignity were specially exalted.

"The impoverished son, seeing his father possessed of such great power and majesty, immediately became filled with fear and regret for having come to this place. He secretly formed this thought:

"'This man may be a king or the equal of a king. He is certainly not a place where I can earn a livelihood through manual labor. It would be better for me to go to a poor village where I might have a place to exert my strength, where food and clothing can be easily obtained. If I remain here for a long time, I might be constrained and forced to labor.'

"Forming this thought, he hastily fled."[^4]

---

## The Father's Recognition and Gentle Retrieval

"At that time the wealthy householder, seated upon his throne, recognized his son immediately and his heart was filled with great joy. He formed this thought:

"'Now I have someone to whom I can entrust my wealth and treasures. I have constantly thought of this son, yet had no means to see him. Unexpectedly, he has come—this accords perfectly with my wish. Although I am advanced in age, my desires remain strong.'

"He immediately sent attendants to pursue and bring back his son. At that moment, the messenger hastily ran after the poor son to capture him. The poor son, startled and alarmed, cried out in protest:

"'I have committed no offense against you—why do you seize me?'

"The messenger held him even more tightly and forcibly dragged him back. At that time, the poor son, thinking that he had committed no transgression yet was being imprisoned and seized, believed his death was certain, and his terror increased. He became unconscious and collapsed to the ground.

"The father, observing this from a distance, instructed the messenger:

"'Release this person! Do not forcibly bring him. Sprinkle cold water on his face to revive him, and do not speak to him further.'

"Why was this? The father understood that his son, possessed of inferior spiritual capacity, was intimidated by the father's power and wealth, which the son found difficult to comprehend. Although the father clearly knew this was indeed his son, he employed skilful means, not telling other people that this was his son.

"The messenger told the son:

"'I now release you. Go wherever you wish.'

"The poor son was delighted to obtain what he had not expected. He rose from the ground and went to a poor village, seeking employment and food."[^5]

---

## The Father's Strategy: Gradual Approach

"At that time, the householder, desiring to entice and guide his son through the employment of skilful means, secretly sent two people of humble appearance, without power or prestige:

"'You may go to that place and gradually speak to the poor son, saying: "This place has work available. We shall pay you double wages. If the poor son accepts, bring him here and have him work. If he asks what kind of work it is, tell him: 'We shall hire you to clean excrement. We two shall also work with you.'"'

"The two messengers immediately sought out the poor son, and having found him, explained everything in detail. At that time, the poor son, first receiving payment, immediately began cleaning excrement with them.

"His father, observing his son, felt compassion and was amazed. On another day, peering through a window, the father saw his son—thin and gaunt, his appearance withered and shrunk, his body covered with filth and dust, unclean. Immediately the father removed his ornaments, fine clothing, and adornments, and instead put on coarse, worn, dirty garments, his body covered with dust. Holding a dung-removal implement in his right hand, with an expression showing reverence, he instructed the workers:

"'You all must work diligently without laziness!'

"By employing skilful means in this way, he was able to draw near his son. Later, he spoke to the son:

"'Listen, young man! You should continue this work here. Do not leave to seek other employment. I shall increase your wages. Whatever you need—bowls, rice, noodles, salt, vinegar, and such things—do not hesitate to ask. We have old, worn servants who can provide whatever you need. Make yourself comfortable. I am to you as a father. Do not worry further. Why is this? I am old and advanced in years, while you are young and vigorous. When you work, you show neither deception nor laziness, neither anger nor complaint. I see no such faults in you as I see in other workers. From this time forward, I shall regard you as a son.'

"At that moment, the householder gave him a new name, calling him 'child.' At that time, the poor son, although delighted by this favorable treatment, still regarded himself as a hired servant. Because of this, for twenty years, he continued to clean excrement. After this period had passed, his mind gradually grew familiar and trusting. He came and went without hindrance, yet he still remained in his former dwelling place."[^6]

---

## The Father's Deathbed Revelation

"World-Honored One, at that time the householder became ill, and knowing that death was approaching, he spoke to his son:

"'I now possess abundant gold, silver, and precious treasures, and my storehouses are completely filled. I know precisely how much is there and what should be given and taken. You should understand all of this. My heart is thus. You should comprehend this intention. Why? Now I and you are not different—you should apply your heart fully so that nothing is lost.'

"At that time the poor son, having received the instruction, took charge of all the treasures, gold, silver, precious jewels, and storehouses, yet harbored no hope of taking even a single meal's worth. Yet his dwelling place still remained his former location, and he had not yet abandoned his sense of inferiority. After another brief period, the father understood his son's mind was gradually becoming broader and more expansive, and he had achieved a noble aspiration, scorning his former inferior thoughts.

"At the time approaching the father's death, he summoned his son together with his relatives, the king, great ministers, nobles, and wealthy merchants—all having assembled—and he himself made this declaration:

"'All you gentlemen should know: This is my son, whom I fathered. In a certain city, he abandoned me and fled. For more than fifty years, impoverished and suffering hardship, he has been lost. His original name is [such and such], and my name is [such and such]. Long ago in my native city, filled with concern, I sought for him, but suddenly, unexpectedly, I encountered and found him in this place. This is truly my son, and I am truly his father. All my wealth and possessions are now his. All that I previously gave out and took in, he now knows.'

"World-Honored One, at that time the poor son, hearing these words of his father, was suddenly overwhelmed with great joy and experienced what he had never experienced before. He formed this thought:

"'I never harbored any thought of seeking or hoping for anything, yet now this treasury of precious wealth has naturally come to me.'"[^7]

---

## The Interpretation: The Buddha's Application

"World-Honored One, the wealthy householder is the Tathāgata. We all, in like manner, are Buddha-children. The Tathāgata constantly speaks of us as his children.

"World-Honored One, we have undergone the three sufferings within birth and death, experiencing various afflictions, confusion, and ignorance, delighting in and clinging to the small dharma. Today the World-Honored One has caused us to contemplate and abandon the excrement of conceptual elaboration regarding all dharmas. We diligently cultivated within this, obtaining the single day's wage of nirvāṇa, and, having obtained this, our hearts were greatly joyful. We believed this was a great attainment and said to ourselves: 'Through diligent cultivation in the Buddha's dharma, what we have obtained is abundant.'

"However, the World-Honored One previously knew that our hearts were attached to inferior desires and delighted in the small dharma. He therefore allowed us to cease, without making distinctions, that you would all share in the treasury of the Tathāgata's wisdom and vision. The World-Honored One, through the power of skilful means, explained the Buddha-wisdom, and we, from the Buddha, obtained the single day's wage of nirvāṇa, regarding it as a great attainment. Toward this great vehicle, we have harbored no aspirational seeking.

"We likewise, because of the Tathāgata's wisdom, have disclosed and explained the Bodhisattva dharma to the various Bodhisattvas, yet we ourselves have harbored no aspiration. Why? Because the Buddha knew that our hearts delight in the small dharma, through the power of skilful means and following our capacities, the Buddha taught us. Yet we did not know that we were truly Buddha-children.

"Now we truly understand that the World-Honored One harbors no stinginess regarding the Buddha-wisdom. Why? We have truly been Buddha-children since ancient times, yet have only delighted in the small dharma. If we had harbored the heart of delight in the great, the Buddha would have taught us the great-vehicle dharma. In this sutra, only the One Vehicle is taught, whereas in the past, before the Bodhisattvas, we disparaged the voice-hearers who delight in the small dharma. Yet the Buddha truly employed the great vehicle to teach and transform us. Therefore, we say: We originally harbored no aspiration to seek anything. Now the precious dharma-king treasure has naturally come to us, and all that Buddha-children should obtain, we have already obtained."[^8]

## The Disciples' Verse of Understanding

Then Mahākāśyapa, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse. The extended verse parallels and reinforces the parable in poetic form, concluding with key affirmations:

*And immediately ordered his servants to pursue and bring him back.*  

*The poor son cried out in alarm,*  
*Confused and dizzy, collapsed on the ground.*  
*The man seizes me—I shall surely be killed!*  
*What use have I for food and clothing,*  
*That he brings me to this place?'*  
*The householder understood his son was foolish and narrow-minded,*  
*Unbelieving of his words,*  
*Unable to believe he was the father.*  

*Then employing skilful means,*  
*He sent another person,*  
*One-eyed, short and ugly, without prestige or power,*  
*To say to the poor son:*  
*'We shall hire you,*  
*And double your wages to remove the filth.*  
*The poor son heard this and joyfully followed,*  
*Working to remove filth,*  
*Cleaning the rooms.*  

*The householder looked through the window,*  
*Constantly seeing his son,*  
*Thinking his son was foolish and base,*  
*And enjoyed degrading work.*  
*So the householder,*  
*Wore worn and dirty clothes,*  
*And carried the excrement-removal tool,*  
*Going to his son's place,*  
*Employing skilful means to draw near,*  
*And speaking to him, urging him to work diligently.*  

*'I shall increase your wages,*  
*Provide oil for your feet,*  
*Supply abundant food,*  
*Offer warm bedding.*  
*I speak harshly to you:*  
*Work diligently!*  
*But I also speak gently to you:*  
*Be as my son!'*  

*The householder, being wise,*  
*Gradually caused his son to come and go,*  
*For twenty years executing household tasks,*  
*Showing him his gold, silver, pearls, and glass,*  
*All the treasures going in and out—*  
*He made him know them all.*  

*Yet still dwelling outside the gate,*  
*Living in a grass hut,*  
*Thinking of his poverty,*  
*Believing himself to lack these things.*  
*The father understood his son's mind*  
*Had gradually grown broader,*  
*Wishing to give him the wealth.*  
*He gathered his relatives, the king, great ministers, and nobles.*  

*In this great assembly,*  
*He declared:*  
*'This is my son,*  
*Who abandoned me and fled.*  
*For fifty years he has been lost.*  
*I myself came upon him and recognized him*  
*Twenty years ago.*  
*Lost in a certain city,*  
*Seeking for him, I came here.*  
*All I possess—my house and people,*  
*All is entrusted to him.*  
*He may use it as he wishes.'*  

*His son, recalling his former poverty,*  
*With his inferior aspiration,*  
*Now at his father's place*  
*Obtains precious treasures—*  
*Both the house and all the wealth,*  
*And he is extremely joyful,*  
*Having obtained what he never expected.*  

*The Buddha is likewise!*  
*Knowing we delight in the small,*  
*Never saying: 'You shall become Buddhas,'*  
*But saying we have obtained*  
*The unconditioned and perfected the small vehicle,*  
*The voice-hearer disciples.*  

*The Buddha commanded us to teach*  
*The supreme path,*  
*And those cultivating this*  
*Shall become Buddhas.*  
*We, accepting the Buddha's teaching,*  
*Taught all the Bodhisattvas*  
*Through various causes and conditions,*  
*Many parables and different expressions,*  
*The supreme path.*  

*The Buddha-children,*  
*Hearing the dharma from us,*  
*Day and night contemplating and diligently cultivating,*  
*At that time all the Buddhas*  
*Granted them prophecy:*  
*'In the future you shall become Buddhas.'*  

*All the secret dharmas of all Buddhas,*  
*We proclaimed for the Bodhisattvas alone,*  
*Their true reality.*  
*Yet not for us*  
*Did they reveal this supreme truth.*  

*Like that poor son*  
*Drawing near his father,*  
*Though knowing all the objects,*  
*His heart harbored no hope of obtaining them—*  
*We likewise, speaking of*  
*The Buddha's dharma treasures,*  
*Ourselves lacked aspiring hearts.*  

*We internally realized extinction,*  
*Believing ourselves satisfied,*  
*Understanding only this,*  
*With nothing beyond.*  
*When we heard of*  
*Pure Buddha-lands,*  
*Teaching and perfecting beings,*  
*We felt no joy whatsoever.*  

*Why? All dharmas,*  
*Are entirely empty and quiescent,*  
*Without arising or ceasing,*  
*Without great or small,*  
*Without outflows or conditioning—*  
*Contemplating thus,*  
*We generated no joy.*  

*For a long time our hearts,*  
*Had no greed or attachment,*  
*Regarding Buddha-wisdom,*  
*We had lost all aspiration.*  
*We regarded the dharma we cultivated,*  
*As ultimate.*  
*For countless nights,*  
*We cultivated the dharma of emptiness,*  
*Escaping from the three-world suffering,*  
*Dwelling in the final body,*  
*And obtaining residual nirvāṇa.*  

*The Buddha's teaching was not in vain,*  
*And we obtained the path—*  
*This is already repaying,*  
*The Buddha's kindness.*  
*Though we taught*  
*All the Buddha-children,*  
*The Bodhisattva dharma,*  
*Seeking the Buddha path,*  
*Regarding this dharma,*  
*We lacked heartfelt aspiration.*  

*The Compassionate Guide,*  
*Observing our hearts,*  
*Did not initially encourage us,*  
*Speaking of actual benefit.*  
*Like the wealthy householder,*  
*Knowing his son's inferior capacity,*  
*Through the power of skilful means,*  
*Gently subdued his heart,*  
*And then entrusted him*  
*With all the wealth.*  

*The Buddha likewise,*  
*Manifesting rare phenomena,*  
*Knowing those who delight in the small,*  
*Through the power of skilful means,*  
*Trained and subdued our hearts,*  
*And then taught the great wisdom.*  
*We now have obtained what never was,*  
*Beyond what we originally sought—*  
*Like the poor son,*  
*Obtaining measureless wealth.*  

*World-Honored One,*  
*We have obtained the path and the fruit,*  
*Regarding the unconditioned dharma,*  
*We have attained the pure eye.*  
*Through countless nights,*  
*We have upheld the Buddha's pure precepts,*  
*And only now*  
*Obtain their fruition.*  

*In the Dharma-King's domain,*  
*Long cultivating the Brahmin conduct,*  
*We now attain the unconditioned,*  
*The supreme, great fruit.*  
*We are now truly voice-hearers,*  
*Proclaiming the Buddha-path voice*  
*To all the world.*  

*We are truly Arhats now,*  
*In all the worlds—*  
*Among devas, humans, Māra, and Brahmā,*  
*Everywhere worthy of worship.*  
*The World-Honored One's tremendous kindness,*  
*With rare compassion, teaching and transforming us,*  
*Benefiting us—*  
*Who could repay such kindness?*  

*Not even by offering,*  
*Through countless eons,*  
*Could we repay,*  
*The Buddha's grace.*

# Chapter 5: The Medicinal Herbs Parable

---

## The Buddha's Address to Mahākāśyapa

> "Excellent! Excellent, Mahākāśyapa. You have spoken well of the Tathāgata's true virtues. Indeed, the Tathāgata possesses measureless, inconceivable merits that could not be exhausted even if explained throughout countless kalpas. Mahākāśyapa, understand this: the Tathāgata is the sovereign of all dharmas. Whatever the Tathāgata proclaims is never false. Through wisdom and skillful means, the Tathāgata expounds all dharmas, and every dharma taught reaches the domain of all-knowing wisdom."[^1]

---

## The Medicinal Herbs Parable: The Central Metaphor

> "Mahākāśyapa, consider this: In the entire threefold thousand-fold great thousand-world system, with all its mountains, valleys, and streams, there grow medicinal herbs, forests, and shrubs of countless kinds—each with its own form, name, and character. Then a great cloud arises, dense and voluminous, spreading and enveloping the entire threefold thousand-fold great thousand-world system. At a single moment, rain pours down equally, and its waters saturate everywhere."[^4]

> "Now, in that region grow medicinal herbs—small roots, small stems, small branches, small leaves; medium roots, medium stems, medium branches, medium leaves; large roots, large stems, large branches, large leaves. Trees of various sizes stand similarly ranked by upper, middle, and lower grades. Each receives precisely according to its species-nature. Although all are nourished by a single rain, each grass and tree develops distinctly according to its own kind."[^4]

---

## Application: The Buddha as the Great Cloud

> "Mahākāśyapa, the Tathāgata appears in the world precisely as this great cloud appears. Like that great cloud spreading over the threefold thousand-fold great thousand-world system, the Tathāgata speaks with a great voice, proclaiming to all gods, humans, and asuras:

> 'I am the Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Enlightened One, the One Possessed of Luminous Conduct, the Well-Gone One, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed One, the Tamer of Beings, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. Those not yet liberated I liberate. Those not yet awakened I awaken. Those not yet at peace I establish in peace. Those not yet entered into nirvana I guide to nirvana. I know both the present and the future as they truly are. I am the All-Knower, the All-Seer, the Knower of the Path, the Revealer of the Path, the Proclaimer of the Path. Come, all gods, humans, and asuras! Listen to the dharma.'"[^1]

---

## The Reception According to Capacity

> "At that time, countless millions of billions of beings come to the Buddha to hear the dharma. The Tathāgata observes these beings' faculties—whether sharp or dull, diligent or lazy—and teaches accordingly, in countless different ways, bringing all to joy and securing benefits for them.[^4]

> "These beings, hearing the dharma, find peace and happiness in the present life and are born in favorable realms in future lives. Through the path, they gain joy and continued opportunity to hear the dharma. Having heard it, they abandon obstacles and, to the extent of their ability, gradually enter the path. Thus, like that great cloud raining upon all forests and herbs and medicinal plants, with each receiving moisture according to its nature and becoming fully nourished and growing—so the Tathāgata's dharma rain causes all beings to grow."[^5]

---

## The One-Taste Teaching and Differential Realization

> "The Tathāgata's teaching has a single taste and aspect—namely, the taste of liberation, non-duality, and cessation, culminating in all-knowing wisdom. It ultimately reaches the realm of emptiness. Among beings who hear the Tathāgata's teaching, whether they uphold and recite it, read it, or practice it as taught, the merit they obtain is beyond their own awareness.[^7]

> "Why is this? Because only the Tathāgata knows the specific nature of each being—what it thinks upon, what it deliberates, in what manner it practices, through which dharma it thinks, deliberates, and practices, and through which dharma it attains which dharma. Beings dwell in countless different stations, and only the Tathāgata, seeing them as they truly are, perceives this without obstruction.[^8]

> "Just as medicinal herbs and trees do not themselves know whether their nature is superior, inferior, or middling, even so, the Tathāgata knows the single-taste dharma—the taste of liberation, non-duality, cessation, nirvana, the peace of final quiescence, ultimately reaching emptiness. Knowing this, the Tathāgata observes beings' desires and needs and protects them accordingly. Therefore, the Tathāgata does not immediately teach all-knowing wisdom to all beings."[^15]

---

## The Assembly's Recognition

> "Mahākāśyapa, you are rare and precious! You comprehend how the Tathāgata adapts teaching to circumstance. You are able to believe and accept it. Why? Because it is exceedingly difficult to understand and know the adaptive teachings of the Buddhas of the world."[^7]

## Extensive Elaboration

"The Dharma King who breaks all fixed views  
Appears within the world,  
And in accord with beings' nature  
Speaks the dharma in countless ways.  

The Honored Tathāgata,  
With wisdom deep and far-reaching,  
Long contemplates this essential truth,  
Yet has no haste to speak.  

Should one of wisdom hear it,  
One can believe and comprehend,  
But one without wisdom wavers in doubt  
And loses it forever.  

Thus, Mahākāśyapa, I teach according to capacity,  
Using countless causes and conditions  
To guide all beings to correct vision.  

Mahākāśyapa, understand this:  
It is like a great cloud  
Arising in the world,  
Enveloping all things.  

The cloud of wisdom rains moisture,  
With lightning flashing and illuminating,  
Thunder sounding far and wide,  
Delighting all beings.  

The sun is concealed and hidden,  
The earth grows cool,  
Dark clouds descend and spread  
As if they might be grasped.  

The rain pours equally in all directions,  
Flowing down on all four sides,  
With currents of water without limit,  
Saturating the entire land.  

Mountain peaks and steep valleys,  
Dark and hidden places where plants grow—  
All grasses, medicinal herbs,  
And trees both small and great,  

Grains and seedlings,  
Sugar cane and grape vines,  
All watered by the rain,  
None lacking abundance.  

The parched earth becomes saturated,  
And medicinal herbs flourish together.  
The water that comes from the clouds is of one taste,  
Yet grasses and forests receive nourishment according to their share.  

All trees, whether great or small,  
Whether upper, middle, or lower—  
Receive exactly in accordance with their size,  
Each achieving growth.  

Roots, stems, branches, and leaves,  
Flowers, fruits, and brilliant colors,  
All reached by the single rain,  
All becoming fresh and lustered.  

According to their form and nature,  
And their capacity,  
Though the moisture is one,  
Each flourishes according to its kind.

## The Buddha as the Great Cloud: Continued Application

"Thus the Buddha appears in the world,  
Like a great cloud,  
Universally covering all things.  

Having appeared in the world,  
The Buddha distinguishes and proclaims  
The reality of all dharmas.  

The Great Sage and World-Honored One  
Pronounces to all gods and humans:  
'I am the Tathāgata,  
The Two-Footed One, Most Worthy,  

Appearing in the world  
Like a great cloud,  
Saturating all beings,  
The withered and parched multitudes,  

All are caused to leave suffering  
And gain peace and happiness—  
The world's happiness and also  
The happiness of nirvana.'  

All gods and human multitudes,  
Listen with one-pointed minds!  
All should come here  
To pay homage to the Unsurpassed Sage!  

I am the World-Honored One,  
Without peer or equal.  
I establish all beings in peace,  
Therefore I appear in the world.  

To the great assembly I proclaim  
The ambrosial dharma, purified.  
This dharma is of one taste:  
Liberation and nirvana!  

With one wondrous voice  
I expound this meaning,  
Always serving as a cause  
For the Great Vehicle.  

"I regard all things as equal,  
Without differences or preferences,  
Without attachment or limitation,  
Ever teaching equally to all,  

As if there were but one person,  
So too the many—thus I teach.  
Ever proclaiming the dharma,  
Never weary or abandoned,  

Standing, sitting, or moving,  
Never becoming tired,  
Fulfilling the world,  
Like rain saturating universally.  

Noble and base, superior and inferior,  
Those observing precepts and those transgressing,  
Those with perfect conduct and those without,  
Those of right view and wrong view,  

Sharp-faculty and dull-faculty beings—  
The dharma-rain falls on all equally,  
Without weariness or laziness.  

All beings who hear my dharma  
Receive according to their power,  
And dwell in various stations."  

---

## The Differentiation of Recipients: The Taxonomy of Beings

"Some dwell in human realms and celestial realms,  
Become monarchs of the turning wheel,  
Or kings among gods and Brahmā—  
These are small medicinal herbs.  

Those who know the dharma of no outflows,  
Able to attain nirvana,  
Who manifest the six supernatural powers  
And gain the three knowledges,  

Living alone in mountain forests,  
Ever practicing meditation,  
Attaining the realization of pratyekabuddhas—  
These are middle-sized medicinal herbs.  

Those seeking the World-Honored One's station,  
'I shall become a Buddha,'  
Practicing diligent meditation—  
These are the superior medicinal herbs.  

"Moreover, all Buddha-children,  
Single-heartedly devoted to the Buddha-path,  
Ever practicing compassion and loving-kindness,  
Know surely that they will become Buddhas,  

Abiding in supernatural powers,  
With unretrogressing wheels,  
Liberating countless billions  
Of hundreds of thousands of beings—  
Such Bodhisattvas are called great trees.  

"Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas,  
Dwelling in mountain forests,  
In their final body,  
Hearing the dharma attain the fruit—  
These are named medicinal herbs,  
Each attaining increase.  

Should there be Bodhisattvas  
Whose wisdom is firmly established,  
Who understand all three realms,  
Seeking the highest vehicle—  
These are named small trees,  
Achieving increase.  

Moreover, those dwelling in meditation,  
Who attain supernatural powers,  
Hearing that all dharmas are empty,  
Whose minds greatly rejoice,  
Who emit light without measure,  
Liberating multitudes of beings—  
These are named great trees,  
Achieving increase.  

Thus, Mahākāśyapa,  
The dharma the Buddha proclaims  
Is like a great cloud,  
With a single-taste rain  
Moistening beings' flowers,  
Causing each to be fully realized."

### Appendix: The Sanskrit Parables (Missing from Kumārajīva's Chinese)

*Note: The following section appears in the Sanskrit 'Saddharmapuṇḍarīka' (GRETIL 5.45–5.83) and other Chinese translations but is absent from Kumārajīva's Version (Taishō 262). It contains the Parable of the Blind Man and the Parable of the Potter, further illustrating the single flavor of the Dharma.*

**The Parable of the Blind Man**

"It is like a man born blind who says: 'There are no shapes, no colors, no sun, no moon, no stars. There is no one who sees them.' A physician, seeing this, gathers medicinal herbs from the snowy mountains—herbs of all four flavors. He chews them and applies them to the blind man's eyes. Suddenly, the man sees forms, colors, the sun, and the moon. He is amazed and says: 'I was foolish! I claimed these things did not exist, but now I see them all!'

"Yet, seeing the physical world, he becomes arrogant, thinking he knows everything. Then, wise seers (Rishis) with divine vision tell him: 'You have only regained physical sight. You do not yet see through walls, nor do you see the thoughts of others, nor the karma of past lives. How can you be proud?'

"Ashamed, the man seeks the path of the seers, cultivates meditation, and eventually attains true spiritual vision. The Buddha says: 'I am like that physician. The herbs are the teachings of Emptiness and Nirvana. You, the Śrāvakas, are like the blind man cured of blindness—you have cut off the afflictions of samsara, and you think this is the end. But I tell you: this is only the first stage. You have not yet attained the true Buddha-eye of omniscience. Do not be satisfied! Seek the supreme wisdom of the Tathāgata!'"

**The Parable of the Potter**

"Or consider a potter who takes the same clay and fashions different vessels—some for sugar, some for ghee, some for milk, and some for filth. The clay is one, but the vessels are defined by what they hold. Even so, the Dharma is one taste—the taste of liberation—but beings are different vessels. Some hold the vehicle of the Disciples, some the vehicle of the Pratyekabuddhas, and some the Great Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas. But ultimately, there is only the One Buddha Vehicle, designed to lead all to the state of Omniscience."

---

- Teaching reaches celestial beings and hell-dwellers, masters and servants, scholars and fools
- The appearance of difference is not contradiction of equality but expression of principle meeting conditions
- The Tathāgata never abandons any being; the dharma is accessible to all
- All beings possess Buddha-nature; ultimate enlightenment is inevitable for all

**Footnotes with Extended Analysis:**

21.**Metaphysical Implication [Eternal Recurrence]**: This connects to the eternal Buddha-principle presented in Chapter 16 (Eternally Dwelling Buddha). The ultimate point is not that beings keep reincarnating until they become Bodhisattvas, but that the Buddha's enlightenment is eternal and omnipresent, continuously teaching all beings—and all beings are continuously becoming enlightened within this eternal moment.

# Chapter 6: Prophecies

## The Buddha's Prophecy to Mahākāśyapa: First Among the Great Disciples

> "When I have spoken this verse, I address all the assembly and proclaim as follows: 'My disciple Mahākāśyapa, in the future world, shall gain the opportunity to pay reverence to three hundred million billion Buddhas of the World-Honored kind, making offerings to them, honoring them, respecting them, and praising them. He shall extensively proclaim the immeasurable great dharma of the Buddhas. In his final existence, he shall become a Buddha, named Radiant Light Tathāgata, Worthy One, Perfectly Enlightened One, Possessor of Luminous Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.'[^2]

> 'His land shall be called Radiant Virtue. His kalpa shall be named Great Adornment. The Buddha shall dwell for twelve small kalpas. The Proper Dharma shall dwell in the world for twenty small kalpas. The Dharma-Semblance shall also dwell for twenty small kalpas. His Buddha-realm shall be pure and adorned, without all filth, rubble, thorns, or excrement. The land shall be level, without any hills or depressions. Lapis lazuli shall be its soil. Precious trees shall stand in rows along the paths, marked by golden cords. Precious flowers shall be scattered everywhere, and the entire realm shall be perfectly pure.'[^3]

> 'In that Buddha-land, there shall be immeasurable thousands of billions of Bodhisattvas, and the assembly of śrāvakas shall likewise be numberless. There shall be no demonic interference. Though demons and demonic beings exist, they all protect the Buddha-dharma.'"[^4]

*"The Buddha's lifespan shall be twelve small kalpas.*
*The Proper Dharma shall dwell in the world twenty small kalpas.*
*The Dharma-Semblance shall likewise dwell twenty small kalpas.*
*The World-Honored One Radiant Light shall be thus."*

> "At that moment, the Great Maudgalyāyana, Subodhi, and Mahākātyāyana were all stirred with emotion. They trembled, clasped their hands in unison, gazed upon the World-Honored One's face without turning away their eyes, and together spoke in verse:"[^11]

## The Disciples' Supplication: Verse of Yearning

*"Great, Mighty World-Honored One,*  
*Dharma-King of all the Shakya clan,*  
*For our sake, you have bestowed Buddha's voice.*  
*If you know our deepest hearts*  
*And see fit to grant us prophecy,*  

*It would be as if pouring cooling nectar*  
*Upon beings burning with great heat.*  
*We are like one who comes from a land of famine*  
*And suddenly encounters the great king's meal.*  
*Though the heart still harbors fear and doubt,*  
*Not yet daring to take the food immediately.*  

*But if the king gives instruction,*  
*Then one may eat without hesitation.*  
*So we too, though hearing Buddha's word*  
*That we shall become Buddhas,*  
*Still harbor anxiety and fear,*  
*Like one not yet daring to eat.*  

*But if you grant us prophecy,*  
*Then all will be comfort and joy.*  
*Great, Mighty World-Honored One,*  
*Forever wishing to establish peace in the world,*  
*We beseech you: grant us the prophecy*  
*As the famished require your instruction!"*[^13]  

---

## The Buddha's Recognition of Subodhi: "Wisdom" Becomes Buddha

> "At that time, the World-Honored One, knowing the minds of the great disciples, told the assembly of monks: 'This Subodbi, in the future world, shall pay reverence to three hundred million billion nayutas of Buddhas, making offerings and honoring them with reverence and respect. After the final nirvana of each of these Buddhas, in each case he shall erect stupas, great stupas, each a thousand yojanas high, stretching and extending one hundred yojanas in each direction. Each shall be composed of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, crystal, pearl, carnelian, and the seven precious substances. Above them shall be hung jeweled garlands, countless flowers, incense, powdered incense, burning incense, silk canopies, and banners, all for making offerings to the stupas.'[^16]

> 'Beyond this, he shall pay reverence to twenty billion billion Buddhas, in the same manner. Having completed his offerings to all these Buddhas, he shall perfect the Bodhisattva path and become a Buddha, called "Renowned by Name" Tathāgata, Worthy One, Perfectly Enlightened One, Possessor of Luminous Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.'[^17]

> 'In his Buddha-realm, the land shall be perfectly pure, composed of lapis lazuli, with precious trees adorning it, marked by golden cords along the paths. The ground shall be level, without any hills or depressions. The Bodhisattvas shall be countless, all possessing sharp faculties, their wheels never retreating. His Buddha-land shall be adorned with Bodhisattvas. The assembly of śrāvakas shall be immeasurable, all possessing the three knowledges and the six supernatural powers, dwelling in the eight liberations, possessing great majesty.'[^18]

> 'The Buddha's proclamation of dharma shall manifest in countless supernatural transformations beyond all conception. Gods and humans, numberless as the sand of the Ganges, shall all join palms in unison, listening to the Buddha's words. The Buddha shall dwell for twelve small kalpas. The Proper Dharma shall dwell in the world for twenty small kalpas, and the Dharma-Semblance shall likewise dwell for twenty small kalpas.'"[^19]

*Attend with one heart to what I proclaim.*  
*My great disciple Subodhi*  
*Shall certainly become a Buddha,*  
*Named 'Renowned by Name.'*  

*He shall encounter numberless Buddha-billions,*  
*Following the path each Buddha walks,*

*He shall attain the thirty-two marks,*  
*Splendid and beautiful,*  
*Like a jeweled mountain.*

Listen attentively."[^32]

## Significance: The Five Chapters' Teaching Made Personal and Particular

Chapter 6 represents the culmination and personalization of the Five Chapters' teaching arc (Chapters 1-5). What Chapters 1-5 established theoretically—that all beings possess Buddha-nature and all will eventually become Buddhas—Chapter 6 now proclaims directly to particular disciples.

The mechanism is crucial: the Buddha doesn't argue for universal Buddhahood through logical proof. Rather, he proclaims prophecies to particular disciples, each receiving a prophecy that reflects their individual nature and practice (Māhakāśyapa's asceticism becomes radiance, Subodbi's emptiness-understanding becomes famous teaching, etc.). Through the accumulation of particular prophecies, the universal principle becomes evident: if each distinct disciple becomes a Buddha, then all can become Buddhas.

Chapters 7 and onward will further elaborate this pattern while introducing new teachings (bodhisattva practice, women's Buddha-potential, the eternal Buddha, etc.).

---

## Conclusion: Prophecy as Recognition

The prophecy-giving in Chapter 6 accomplishes something more subtle than mere fortune-telling. A prophecy, in the Buddhist context, is not predestination imposed from outside but recognition of what is already true. The Buddha sees the Buddha-nature already present in Māhakāśyapa, Subodbi, Kātyāyana, and Maudgalyāyana, and proclaims what he sees.

In Chapter 6, the teaching moves from the cosmic (Chapter 1), to the theoretical (Chapters 2-5), to the particular and personal. Each disciple receives their own prophecy; each prophecy reflects their individual nature; yet all point to the same truth: enlightenment is the inevitable destiny of all beings who encounter the dharma.

---

## Apparatus Summary
## Major Themes:
- Prophecy as recognition of Buddha-nature rather than arbitrary prediction
- Individual variation (different Buddha-names, realms, timescales) within universal truth
- Psychological transformation through recognition by an enlightened guide
- Extension from great disciples to five hundred, prefiguring universal extension
- Spiritual psychology: emotional response (trembling, yearning) as gateway to transformation
- The role of faith in accepting what seems impossible

# Chapter 7: The Phantom City Parable

---

> "The Buddha told the monks: 'Incalculably long ago, beyond a boundless and inconceivable number of immeasurable aeons, there was a Buddha named Great Penetrating Wisdom Victory Tathāgata, Worthy One, Perfectly Enlightened One, Possessor of Luminous Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. His Buddha-land was called "Realm of Good Form." The kalpa was named "Great Imagery."

> 'Monks, from the time of that Buddha's final nirvana until now, a very long time has passed. To illustrate: Suppose someone took all the earth of the threefold thousand-fold great thousand-world system and ground it into ink. Then, passing through the east for a thousand Buddha-lands, he would place a single dot of ink-dust. He would continue in this way throughout all the earth-ink, placing dots. Tell me: What do you think? Can a calculator or a calculator's apprentice possibly determine the extent of these Buddha-lands, either those marked with ink or those left unmarked?'

> The monks replied: 'No, World-Honored One.'[^2]

> The Buddha said: 'All those Buddha-lands, whether marked or unmarked, if ground into dust—one dust-particle equals one kalpa—the Buddha Great Penetrating Wisdom Victory, from his final nirvana until now, has surpassed even this number by immeasurable, boundless, hundreds of thousands of millions of aeons. Yet through the power of the Tathāgata's knowledge and vision, I observe that ancient time as though it were the present day.'"[^3]

> 'All wished to draw near to Great Penetrating Wisdom Victory Tathāgata, to make offerings and show reverence, honor, and praise. Upon arriving, they prostrated their heads to his feet, circumambulated him, then standing with palms joined gazed upon the World-Honored One and praised him in verse:

*"Great Mighty World-Honored One,*  
*For the sake of liberating all beings,*  
*Through immeasurable billions of aeons,*  
*You have at last attained Buddhahood.*  

*Your vows all fulfilled, supremely auspicious and fortunate,*  
*The World-Honored One is most rare and precious!*  
*In a single sitting for ten small kalpas,*  
*Your body, hands, and feet remained still and unmoved.*  

*Your mind was ever peaceful and equanimous,*  
*Never scattered or distracted,*  
*Ultimately dwelling in ultimate peace,*  
*Abiding in the dharma without outflows.*  

*Now seeing the World-Honored One,*  
*Safely established in enlightenment,*  
*We have gained great benefit,*  
*And we celebrate with immense joy!"*[^12]  

The sixteen sons are crucial figures. They represent a generation that follows the Buddha's enlightenment, yet they also represent the disciples of the future (as will be revealed). Their abandonment of precious possessions parallels the disciples' renunciation in Chapter 4's Prodigal Son parable.

---

## The Request to Teach: The Dharma-Wheel Turns

The narrative continues:

> "At that time, the sixteen prince-sons, having praised the Buddha in verse, urged the World-Honored One to turn the dharma-wheel, saying: 'The World-Honored One's teaching brings much peace, compassion, benefit, and advantage to all gods and humans.' Again, they spoke in verse:

*"O Mighty World-Honored One,*  
*Incomparable and unequaled,*  
*Adorned with a hundred auspices,*  
*Possessor of supreme wisdom!*  

*We beseech you to teach the world,*  
*Liberating us and all beings,*  
*Revealing and displaying this wisdom,*  
*So that all may attain it.*  

*If we and all beings attain Buddhahood,*  
*The World-Honored One, knowing the depths of beings' minds,*  
*Understanding their paths and their wisdom,*  
*Their desires and their merit, their karmic deeds—*  

*World-Honored One, knowing all these,*  
*Turn the wheel of unsurpassed dharma!'"[^13]  

The princes' request is for the Buddha to teach the dharma more broadly—to "turn the dharma-wheel". This is the traditional Buddhist term for the Buddha's proclamation of the dharma.

What's significant here is that the sons explicitly request that "we and all beings attain Buddhahood"—they are not asking for personal advancement but for universal enlightenment. This anticipates the ultimate teaching of the Lotus Sutra: all beings are destined for Buddhahood.

The Buddha accepts their request silently, indicating readiness without elaborate ceremony. His silence conveys assent and appropriate restraint.

---

## The Buddha's Teaching: Cosmic Illumination

The narrative describes the cosmic impact of the Buddha's enlightenment and teaching:

> "When the Buddha Great Penetrating Wisdom Victory attained supreme enlightenment, the worlds in all ten directions—each with five hundred million billion Buddha-lands—underwent sixfold trembling. In the dark and shadowy places of these Buddha-lands, places that the light of the sun and moon could not reach, there was suddenly great luminosity. The beings dwelling there could each see one another and said: 'How is it that beings suddenly appeared here?' And in that Buddha-realm, the celestial palaces, even up to the Brahma-palaces, all underwent sixfold trembling, and great light pervaded all worlds, surpassing the light of the celestial beings."[^14]

---

## The Brahmas' Discovery and Praise

The Buddha continues describing how celestial beings from all ten directions recognize the light and come to investigate:

> "At that time, from the eastern direction, from five hundred million billion Buddha-lands, in the Brahma-palaces of those celestial realms, the light from their dwellings shone brightly and brilliantly, more radiant than usual. The Brahma-kings, each pondering: 'For what reason does this unprecedented brightness illuminate our palaces?' immediately departed and met together to discuss this matter.[^16]

> "Among them was a great Brahma-king named 'Savior of All,' who spoke to the gathered Brahmas: 'Our heavenly palaces, which never before possessed such light, have now illuminated unexpectedly. This cannot be without cause. Let us together investigate the cause. Is it a great and virtuous being born? Is a Buddha appearing in the world? This great light pervades all directions.'[^17]

> "Then five hundred million billion Brahma-kings, together with their palaces, each took celestial flowers in their robes and jointly traveled westward, seeking the source of this light. They saw Great Penetrating Wisdom Victory Tathāgata, dwelling at the place of enlightenment, beneath the Bodhisattva-tree, seated on a lion-throne, with gods, dragon-kings, gandharvas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans, all reverently surrounding him. They also saw the sixteen prince-sons requesting the Buddha to turn the dharma-wheel."[^18]

The Brahma-kings recognize that the light indicates something extraordinary and seek its source. This models how enlightenment radiates outward, attracting beings of all kinds. The description of the Brahmas presenting their heavenly palaces as offerings suggests their complete surrender and devotion.

---

## The Dharma-Teaching: Dependent Origination

> "At that time, the Buddha Great Penetrating Wisdom Victory, receiving the requests of the Brahma-kings and the sixteen prince-sons, immediately turned the dharma-wheel three times with twelve aspects, that which no śramaṇa, brahmin, god, māra, or brahma in the world could turn, namely:[^19]

> 'This is suffering, this is its arising, this is its cessation, this is the path leading to its cessation.'

> "And he extensively explained the dharma of the twelve-fold dependent origination:[^20]

> 'Ignorance conditions formation;
> Formation conditions consciousness;
> Consciousness conditions name-and-form;
> Name-and-form conditions the six sense-bases;
> The six sense-bases condition contact;
> Contact conditions feeling;
> Feeling conditions craving;
> Craving conditions grasping;
> Grasping conditions existence;
> Existence conditions birth;
> Birth conditions old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, grief, and despair.

> "And: Ignorance ceasing, formation ceases; formation ceasing, consciousness ceases; consciousness ceasing, name-and-form ceases; name-and-form ceasing, the six sense-bases cease; the six sense-bases ceasing, contact ceases; contact ceasing, feeling ceases; feeling ceasing, craving ceases; craving ceasing, grasping ceases; grasping ceasing, existence ceases; existence ceasing, birth ceases; birth ceasing, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, grief, and despair cease."[^21]

The teaching describes how suffering arises through interdependent conditions and how suffering ceases when those conditions are dissolved. This is the fundamental insight of Buddhism: that suffering is not intrinsic but conditional, and therefore can be ended through understanding and transforming conditions.[^23]

The "three times with twelve aspects" refers to teaching the four truths (suffering, its origin, its cessation, the path) three times over, with each teaching having twelve aspects (the four truths taught forward, backward, and showing causality both ways).

---

## The Assembly's Realization: From Many to All

> "When the Buddha taught this dharma in the assembly of gods and humans, six hundred million billion nayutas of beings, through not-grasping of all dharmas, attained liberation from all outflows, achieved deep, subtle meditative absorption, the three knowledges, and the six supernatural powers, and perfected the eight liberations.[^24]

> "In the second and third turnings of the dharma-wheel, thousands of millions of Gangetic-sand-numerous nayutas of beings, likewise through not-grasping of all dharmas, attained liberation from all outflows.[^25]

> "From then onward, the assembly of śrāvakas became immeasurable and boundless, beyond counting."[^26]

The teaching produces immediate and massive results. Beings attain liberation through the teaching of dependent origination. Notice the phrase "through not-grasping of all dharmas"—liberation comes not through acquiring something but through releasing all fixed views and attachments.

The progression is significant: first teaching produces six hundred million billion Nayuta beings liberated; second teaching produces thousands of millions of times more; "from then onward" the numbers become incalculable. This suggests that enlightenment radiates outward—each being who awakens becomes a teaching for others, creating exponential growth.

---

## The Sixteen Sons Request the Great Vehicle Teaching

The narrative then takes a crucial turn:

> "At that time, the sixteen prince-sons, having become the Buddha's disciples through their own choice, all became monks with keen faculties, bright wisdom, and having previously made offerings to hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas, now practicing pure conduct, seeking supreme enlightenment. The sixteen sons together said to the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the immeasurable thousands of millions of billions of great virtue and accomplished śrāvakas have now all been fulfilled. World-Honored One, you should also teach us the dharma of supreme enlightenment. We desire to study it after hearing it. World-Honored One, we and our retinues all wish to attain Buddhahood just as you have, possessing the pure wisdom-eye like the World-Honored One.'

> "The Buddha, knowing the sixteen youths' hearts, the conduct of their past lives, understanding their deep wishes—what they contemplated, what they meditated upon, for what purposes they meditated—spoke to them using limitless causes and conditions, countless parables, and the six perfections and supernatural powers, distinguishing the true dharma, the Bodhisattva-path, teaching the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, in verses as numerous as the sands of the Ganges."[^27]

This is a turning point. After establishing the foundation (the four truths and dependent origination), the Buddha now teaches the Great Vehicle dharma to those ready for it. The sixteen sons request the teaching explicitly, expressing their intention to attain Buddhahood, not just nirvana.

The Buddha's response "knowing the sixteen youths' hearts, the conduct of their past lives" echoes the Medicinal Herbs teaching: the Buddha's pedagogy is responsive to beings' actual conditions. He teaches them "using limitless causes and conditions, countless parables"—the very methods employed in the Lotus Sutra itself.[^28]

---

## The Buddha's Deepening Practice: Extended Meditation

A crucial transition now occurs:

> "After the Buddha had taught this dharma, he entered a quiet chamber, abode in meditative absorption, sitting in a single place for eighty-four thousand kalpas.[^29]

> "At that time, the sixteen Bodhisattva-monks, knowing that the Buddha had entered his chamber and was sitting in profound meditation, each ascended a dharma-seat and also taught the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, speaking the unsurpassed wisdom to immeasurable billions of multitudes, for eighty-four thousand kalpas, each liberating six hundred million billion Gangetic-sand-numerous nayutas of beings, causing them to generate the aspiration for supreme enlightenment.[^30]

> "Upon the Buddha's emergence from meditation after eighty-four thousand kalpas, he went to the dharma-seat, sat serenely, and spoke to the great assembly: 'These sixteen Bodhisattva-monks are most rare and precious. Their faculties are keen and their wisdom bright. They have previously made offerings to immeasurable thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas. At the Buddha-lands of the Buddhas, they constantly practiced pure conduct, bearing the Buddha-wisdom, and opening up and displaying dharma to all beings, causing them to enter therein.'"[^31]

The significance is profound:**the Buddha does not monopolize teaching but empowers others to teach in his absence.** The sixteen Bodhisattvas, each teaching for eighty-four thousand kalpas, each liberating incalculable multitudes, represent enlightenment spreading through a network of awakened beings rather than depending on a single teacher.[^32]

---

## The Revelation: The Sixteen Are Buddhas

Now comes an extraordinary revelation:

> "The Buddha told the monks: 'These sixteen Bodhisattva-monks have long loved to teach the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma. Each, in turn, has liberated six hundred million billion Gangetic-sand-numerous beings through this dharma, world after world, in successive rebirths, all being born together with the Bodhisattva and always hearing the dharma from him. By this cause and condition, these beings have encountered four hundred million billion Buddhas and yet do not exhaust the [Bodhisattva's] life-force, until the present day.'

> "'Monks, I declare to you: these sixteen Bodhisattvas have now all attained supreme enlightenment and are at present teaching the dharma in all ten directions of the Buddha-lands, with immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Bodhisattvas and śrāvakas as their retinue.'"[^33]

This is the revelation. The sixteen young monks are not merely disciples—they are Buddhas themselves, currently teaching in all directions. The Buddha explicitly identifies himself among them:

> "'Two Bodhisattvas are stationed in the eastern direction, teaching in Buddha-lands. Their names are Ākāśagarbha and Meru-Peak. In the southeastern direction, two are named Simha-Sound and Simha-Appearance. In the southern direction, two are named Sky-Dweller and Constant-Cessation. In the southwestern direction, two are named Imperial-Mark and Brahma-Mark. In the western direction, two are named Amitāyus and Relieving-All-Worlds'-Suffering. In the northwestern direction, two are named Tamalapatri-Sandalwood-Fragrance-Supernatural-Powers and Meru-Appearance. In the northern direction, two are named Cloud-Mastery and Cloud-Mastery-King. In the northeastern direction, one is named Destroying-All-Worlds'-Fear. The sixteenth is myself, Śākyamuni Buddha, in this Sahā-world, having attained Buddhahood.'"[^34]

The sixteen Bodhisattvas are now identified as Buddhas themselves—the same ones who will receive prophecies in the earlier chapters! This creates a stunning retro-active interpretation: what we read as chronologically earlier (Chapter 6's prophecies) is actually eternally true. The Buddha was always teaching the dharma; the prophecies are recognitions of what eternally is.[^35]

---

## The Sixteen Disciples' Relation to Past Kalpas

> "'Monks, I tell you: these sixteen Bodhisattvas, when they were young monks, taught the Lotus Sutra, and all beings who heard the dharma from them—you assembled monks today, and my future śrāvaka disciples after my extinction—are these very beings.

> "'My disciples dwelling in the śrāvaka-path, to whom I teach supreme enlightenment—for these beings who are now in the position of being taught the Buddha-path, I am ever teaching them supreme enlightenment. Among those who do not hear this dharma, not comprehending the Bodhisattva-path, and who generate the notion of extinction regarding the nirvana they have attained, I shall cause them to enter nirvana. But in other Buddha-lands, seeking Buddha-wisdom, they shall hear this dharma, and only through the Buddha-vehicle shall they attain extinction—there is no other vehicle save the skillful means of the Tathāgata.'"[^36]

This passage contains the deepest revelation of the Phantom City parable's meaning. The Buddha explains:

This reveals that the Buddha's teaching is not sequential but cyclical and eternal—the same dharma continuously offered in different forms until beings are ready to understand its true nature.[^37]

---

## THE PHANTOM CITY PARABLE: The Central Teaching

> "'Monks, understand this through parable. There is a long and treacherous path five hundred yojanas in extent, full of dangers and fears, with few people, many wild beasts, and no water or herbs—a place that terrifies all beings. Suppose there are innumerable thousands of multitudes of people who wish to traverse this difficult path to reach a place of treasures.

> 'There is a wise and capable guide, skilled in the many paths, knowing well which ways are passable and which are blocked, who leads this multitude of people to traverse this difficult path. At the three-hundred-yojana mark, the people become exhausted and fearful, saying to the guide: "We are all weary and terrified. We are unable to go further. The path ahead is still distant. We wish to turn back."

> 'The guide, knowing these people can be saved and observing their fatigue and fear, thinks to himself with compassion: "These people are pitiable. How can they abandon the great treasure and wish to return?"

> 'The guide then employs skillful means, using his supernatural powers, creating an illusory city in the middle of this dangerous path. He tells the people: "Do not be afraid. Do not wish to return. Here is a great city where you may rest, having whatever you desire. If you are able to advance further to the treasure place, you may also go there."

> 'The exhausted people, hearing of this city, are greatly delighted and filled with joy, thinking to themselves: "We have been freed from this dangerous path and have gained peace and rest!"

> 'They enter this illusory city, thinking themselves to have reached their destination, resting securely within it. Then, knowing that these people have rested and are no longer weary, the guide causes the illusory city to vanish. He tells the people: "Come! The treasure place is near. This great city that I created was merely for your rest. I created it to allow you to cease your fatigue."'"[^38]

Now the parable's application:

> "'Monks, the Tathāgata is like this guide. The Tathāgata is the great guide of all living beings. Knowing that all beings are attracted to and dwelling in the realms of birth and death, with suffering, anxiety, and fear on the difficult path of existence, the Buddha thinks: "If these beings merely hear the dharma of the One Buddha-Vehicle, they will not believe, accept, receive, or practice it, saying: 'The Buddha-path is long and distant, difficult to achieve.' Thus the Tathāgata employs skillful means, speaking of two kinds of nirvana.

> 'If living beings dwell in the two-vehicle path, thinking themselves to have attained extinction, to have reached the station of nirvana, the Tathāgata declares to them: 'What you have attained is not true extinction. Know that what you have attained is not the dharma-seat of enlightenment. In the One Buddha-Vehicle, I separate and distinguish the three vehicles. But all are just the Buddha's skillful means. Among these three vehicles, there is no actual existence of vehicles other than in appearance alone. Through these means, I am leading you to the Buddha-path.

> 'It is like the guide who created the city: having observed your fatigue and desires to rest, I taught you the dharma of the two vehicles as a provisional arrangement. Now understand: the treasure place is near. What I have taught is not the final teaching. Rather, through numberless skillful means, I am leading you toward the supreme vehicle, toward Buddha-wisdom, toward Buddha-knowledge, toward Buddha-insight.'"[^39]

This is the climax of the Lotus Sutra's theological revolution. The parable reveals:

## The Verse Elaboration: Cosmic Echoes

*"The Great Penetrating Wisdom Victory Buddha*  
*Sat ten kalpas at the enlightenment seat,*  
*Yet the dharmas of Buddhahood did not appear.*  
*Unable to attain supreme enlightenment,*  

*Celestial beings and dragon-kings,*  
*Asuras and other devas,*  
*Rained celestial flowers as offerings,*  
*Striking the celestial drums for ten kalpas,*  
*Offering flowers to this Buddha,*  
*Without pause until his extinction,*  
*Celestial drums beat constantly,*  
*And heavenly orchestras played without ceasing.*  

*After ten kalpas passed,*  
*The dharmas then appeared,*  
*And enlightenment was attained.*  

The verse emphasizes the cosmic scale and the ten-kalpa delay. It then describes the assembly:

*"The sixteen sons of the Buddha,*  
*Each with retinues of thousands of millions,*  
*All came to the Buddha with palms joined,*  
*And requested the dharma-wheel's turning.*  

*'Great Sage of incomparable worth!*  
*May you transform all beings,*  
*Shake and awaken all the world,*  
*For all recognize the assembly's calling.*  

*The celestial devas' palaces*  
*Shone with previously unseen light,*  
*And the Brahmā-kings came to the Buddha*  
*Bearing flowers in offering.*  

*"The Buddha, knowing that the time had not yet come,*  
*Accepted their request and sat silently,*  
*And the ten directions' Brahmā-kings,*  
*All scattered flowers and made offerings,*  
*Requesting that the dharma-wheel be turned.*  

*'The Tathāgata is difficult to encounter,*  
*May you with great compassion*  
*Open wide the gate of immortal nectar,*  
*And turn the unsurpassed dharma-wheel!'*  

*"In the first teaching of the dharma,*  
*Six hundred million billion multitudes*  
*Exhausted the limits of suffering,*  
*All becoming arhats.*  

*In the second and third teachings,*  
*Thousand-million Gangetic-sands of multitudes,*  
*For all dharmas ungrasped,*  
*Attained arhatship likewise.*  

*From that point onward, those liberated*  
*Were countless and incalculable,*  
*Beyond all numbers in billions of kalpas."*  

*"The sixteen young princes,*  
*Became monks as novices,*  
*All together requesting the Buddha,*  
*To proclaim the Great Vehicle teaching.*  

*'The Buddha knows our deepest hearts,*  
*The deeds of our past lives,*  
*With countless causes and conditions,*  
*And varied parables and explanations,*  
*Teach us the dharma of the six perfections*  
*And the wonders of supernatural powers.*  

*'Distinguish and proclaim the true dharma,*  
*The Bodhisattva-path truly practiced,*  
*Speak the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma*  
*In verses numberless as Gangetic sands.'*  

*"Then the Buddha spoke the dharma,*  
*And entered a quiet chamber,*  
*Dwelling alone in meditative absorption,*  
*Sitting eight ten-thousand and four thousand kalpas.*  

*The sixteen Bodhisattva-novices,*  
*Knowing the Buddha had entered meditation,*  
*Each ascended the dharma-seat,*  
*And proclaimed the supreme Buddha-wisdom*  

*To immeasurable billions of multitudes,*  
*For eight ten-thousand and four thousand kalpas.*  
*Each guided six hundred million billion*  
*Gangetic-sands-numbered multitudes,*  
*And caused them to generate*  
*The aspiration for supreme enlightenment.*  

*'Those beings heard the dharma then,*  
*Through countless births ever following their teacher,*  
*Receiving from him the dharma's teaching,*  
*All had perfect understanding.*  

*'These sixteen Bodhisattvas,*  
*Now have all perfectly completed*  
*The Buddha-path and the Buddha-way,*  
*Now in ten directions*  

*'Each present in their Buddha-lands,*  
*Each guides measureless billions*  
*Of Bodhisattvas and śrāvakas.*  
*That Buddha has now become known*  
*As Amitāyus of the western land.'*  

The verse identifies Amitāyus (Amitābha) as one of the sixteen—a Buddha known across East Asia for his Pure Land teaching. The text thereby incorporates other Buddhist traditions into its vision.

*"As an example of skillful means,*  
*There is a perilous and evil path,*  
*Stretching and extending quite distant,*  
*Beset with many poisonous creatures,*  
*And devoid of water and plants—*  
*A place all beings fear.*  

*"Countless millions of multitudes,*  
*Wish to pass through this treacherous path,*  
*Their route extends five hundred yojanas,*  
*And at this time there is a guide,*  
*Wise and knowing, with excellent wisdom,*  
*Known to navigate the dangers and to guide through."*  

*"The multitudes became weary,*  
*And spoke to the guide saying:*  
*'We are now utterly exhausted,*  
*And desire to return from this way.'*  

*"The guide conceived skillful means,*  
*And thought to employ supernatural powers,*  
*Creating a great city,*  
*With buildings adorned and fine,*  
*With gardens and lotus ponds,*  
*And parks filled with living things.*  

*"With gates and high towers,*  
*And male and female inhabitants.*  

*"The guide then spoke to the multitudes:*  
*'Do not fear or turn back,*  
*This great city you may enter,*  
*And do as you please.'*  

*"The exhausted multitudes,*  
*Hearing of the city,*  
*Became greatly delighted,*  
*And all felt at peace,*  
*Thinking they had been freed*  
*From the treacherous path,*  
*And had gained safe rest.'*  

*"The guide then knew the people*  
*Had rested and were no longer weary,*  
*And assembled the multitudes to say:*  
*'Go forward, travelers!*  
*The treasure is nearby.*  
*This city I created*  
*As a resting place,*  
*Recognizing your fatigue,*  
*I used skillful powers—*  
*The city you saw is not real,*  
*But created by me.*  

*'Now press forward together,*  
*To the treasure place.'*  

*"I too am like this guide,*  
*The guide for all beings.*  
*Seeing that they seek the dharma,*  
*Walking the middle path through dangerous realms,*  
*Unable to endure the suffering of birth and death,*  
*And these afflicted and fearful realms.*  

*"I employed skillful means,*  
*Teaching cessation as nirvana,*  
*Proclaiming: 'Your suffering is extinct,*  
*Your work is now complete.'*  
*Once you knew you had reached nirvana,*  
*All becoming arhats,*  
*I then gathered the great multitude*  
*And taught them the true dharma.*  

*'The Buddhas' skillful means,*  
*Distinguishing the three vehicles—*  
*There is truly only one Buddha-vehicle,*  
*Teaching the two vehicles as a resting place.*  

*'Now for your sake I teach the real:*  
*What you have achieved is not extinction.*"  

---

## Summary: The Phantom City's Ultimate Meaning

**Chapter 7 completes the doctrinal revolution begun in Chapter 2. ** If Chapter 2 established that skillful means exist, Chapter 7 now reveals their purpose and justification. The three vehicles are not different paths to different destinations but stages on a single path, with the phantom city representing the provisional achievement of nirvana.

This revelation requires complete reinterpretation of everything preceding it:

This emotional-narrative pedagogy itself exemplifies skillful means: the Buddha uses the form that reaches hearts, not merely minds.

# Chapter 8: Prophecies for Five Hundred Disciples

---

---

## Furūṇa's Buddha-Land: Pure Teaching Environment

> "'His land shall be pure and adorned. Using the threefold thousand-fold great thousand-world system as a single Buddha-land, its soil shall be of the seven precious substances, perfectly level, without mountains, valleys, streams, or ravines. Seven-jeweled pavilions shall fill it completely. The celestial palaces shall be near in the sky, with gods and humans in contact, able to see each other mutually. There shall be no evil realms. There shall be no women. All beings shall be born through transformation, without sexual desire. They shall possess great supernatural powers, their bodies emitting light, flying freely, their aspirations firm, their efforts intense, their wisdom luminous—all of golden hue, adorned with the thirty-two marks.

> 'The beings in that land shall sustain themselves with two kinds of food: first, dharma-joy food, and second, meditative-bliss food. There shall be immeasurable aeons of thousands of myriads of billions of Bodhisattvas, possessing great supernatural powers and the four unobstructed knowledges, skillfully able to teach and transform all kinds of beings. The assembly of śrāvakas shall be incalculable, all possessing the six supernatural powers, the three knowledges, and the eight liberations. That Buddha-land possesses such immeasurable merits and adorning accomplishments.[^7]

> 'The kalpa shall be named "Treasure Illumination," the land shall be named "Pure Excellence." That Buddha's lifespan shall be immeasurable aeons.'"[^8]

Furūṇa's Buddha-realm is described with extraordinary detail:

- **No women**: A feature of "pure" Buddha-lands in classical Buddhist cosmology, reflecting attitudes about sexual desire as a primary obstacle to enlightenment, though the Lotus Sutra itself will later affirm women's Buddha-nature (Chapter 12)[^9]
- **Transformation-birth**: No sexual reproduction, eliminating the primary cause of attachment
- **Golden bodies and thirty-two marks**: All beings naturally embody the Buddha's physical characteristics, suggesting universal perfection
- **Two foods**: Dharma-joy and meditative-bliss replace material food, suggesting beings sustained by spiritual nourishment alone
- **No evil realms**: Complete absence of suffering-realms, reflecting the Buddha's perfected teaching

---

## The Five Hundred Arhats' Request

The narrative then describes a crucial moment:

> "At that time, the twelve hundred arhats whose minds possessed independent mastery contemplated: 'We are delighted to have obtained what was never obtained before. If the World-Honored One were to grant each of us prophecy, just as he granted to the other great disciples, would this not be excellent?' The Buddha, knowing the thoughts of these beings, told Mahākāśyapa: 'These twelve hundred arhats—I shall now grant them, in sequential order in my presence, prophecies of supreme enlightenment.

> 'Among this assembly, my great disciple the monk Ājñātakauṇḍinya shall make offerings to sixty-two billion Buddhas, and then become a Buddha, bearing the name Universal-Illumination Tathāgata, Worthy One, Perfectly Enlightened One, Possessor of Luminous Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.[^10]

> 'The five hundred arhats—Uruvelā-Kāśyapa, Gaya-Kāśyapa, Nādi-Kāśyapa, Kalodāyin, Udāyin, Aniruddha, Revata, Kapiṇa, Bakula, Cunda, Svāgata, and the others—shall all attain supreme enlightenment, bearing the same Buddha-name: Universal-Illumination.'"[^11]

This is a stunning egalitarian moment. Rather than singling out individual disciples with unique prophecies, the Buddha grants all five hundred the same Buddha-name and essentially the same fate. This affirms the universal applicability of the prophecy to all beings who have received the dharma.

The Buddha-name "Universal-Illumination" is the same given to Subodbi earlier (Chapter 6), suggesting that across different individuals and different teachers, the ultimate achievement is fundamentally identical—different paths, same destination.

---

## The Verse Elaboration: Collective Prophecy in Verse

*"The monk Ājñātakauṇḍinya*  
*Shall encounter immeasurable Buddhas,*  
*After immeasurable aeons,*  
*Attain perfect enlightenment.*  

*Ever emitting great light,*  
*Possessing all supernatural powers,*  
*Fame spreading throughout the ten directions,*  
*Respected by all beings—*  

*Ever proclaiming the unsurpassed way,*  
*Therefore named Universal-Illumination.*  
*His Buddha-land shall be pure,*  
*With Bodhisattvas all valiant,*  

*All ascending marvelous towers,*  
*Traversing the ten directions,*  
*Making unsurpassed offerings*  
*To the Buddhas with fine requisites.*  

*Having made such offerings,*  
*Their hearts filled with great joy,*  
*Swiftly returning to their native land—*  
*Such is their supernatural power.*  

*The Buddha's lifespan: sixty thousand kalpas;*  
*The Proper Dharma dwells twice that lifespan;*  
*The Dharma-Semblance dwells twice again—*  
*At dharma's extinction, gods and humans grieve.*  

*The five hundred monks*  
*Shall successively become Buddhas,*  
*All bearing the same name: Universal-Illumination,*  
*Receiving prophecies in sequence.*  

*After my extinction,*  
*The designated one shall become Buddha,*  
*Their transformed world,*  
*Just as mine is today:*  

*Pure Buddha-lands and supernatural powers,*  
*Bodhisattva and śrāvaka assemblies,*  
*Proper dharma and dharma-semblance duration,*  
*The Buddha's lifespan—all as described above.*  

*Mahākāśyapa, you already know:*  
*The five hundred autonomous ones,*  
*And the remaining śrāvaka assemblies*  
*Shall all receive prophecies like these.*  

*Those not present at this assembly*  
*You should proclaim to them.*'"[^12]  

---

## The Five Hundred Arhats' Rejoicing: The Pearl in the Garment Parable

Now comes one of the Lotus Sutra's most profound and moving parables. The five hundred arhats, having heard their prophecies, express their joy and revelation:

> "At that time, the five hundred arhats, having received their prophecies in the Buddha's presence, were greatly delighted and joyful. They immediately rose from their seats, approached the Buddha, prostrated their heads to his feet, repented, and said: 'World-Honored One, we constantly held the following thought: we assumed we had attained ultimate extinction. Now we know that, being ignorant, we were deluded. Why is this? We should have attained the Tathāgata's wisdom, yet we were satisfied with a lesser wisdom.'[^13]

> 'World-Honored One, consider this analogy: Suppose a man goes to the house of a close friend, becomes intoxicated, and falls asleep. At that time, his friend had some urgent business and departed, intending to give the man a precious pearl of immeasurable value. He sewed it secretly into the man's inner garment and left.

> 'The man, in his drunken sleep, knew nothing of this. After waking, he traveled to another country. Seeking livelihood out of need, he exerted himself with great difficulty. Whatever small amount he obtained, he considered sufficient. He did not know that inside his garment was a precious pearl of immeasurable value.[^14]

> 'Later, his friend encountered him and said: "You, fellow! Why do you sustain yourself with such difficulty through gathering food and clothing? Long ago, when I wanted you to gain contentment and enjoy the five desires without restriction, on such-and-such a date, I sewed a precious pearl of immeasurable value into your inner garment. That pearl is still there now! Yet you did not know, and have thus tormented yourself with worry in seeking your livelihood—how foolish you are! Now you can use this pearl to exchange for whatever you need, and you shall always have plenty, never lacking anything.'"[^15]

This parable contains the Lotus Sutra's most poignant teaching about human self-ignorance. Several elements are crucial:

---

## Application to Buddhist Teaching

The arhats continue their understanding of the parable's application:

> "'The Buddha is the same. When he was a Bodhisattva, he taught us, causing us to generate the mind of supreme enlightenment. We subsequently forgot, not knowing, not understanding. Having attained the arhat path, we assumed we had attained ultimate extinction and great peace. We sustained ourselves with difficulty, considering our small attainments sufficient. Our aspiration for supreme enlightenment remained, undiminished.

> 'Now the World-Honored One awakens us, saying: "Monks, what you have attained is not ultimate extinction. I have long caused you all to plant the roots of merit for Buddhism. Through skillful means, I showed you the appearance of nirvana, and you took it as actual extinction. But this was not the case."[^16]

> 'World-Honored One, now we know truly that we are Bodhisattvas, having received prophecies of supreme enlightenment. For this reason, we are exceedingly joyful and delighted, having obtained what was never obtained before.'"[^17]

This application extends the parable's significance: the Buddha (like the friend) has been continuously teaching beings toward enlightenment, but out of ignorance, beings mistake provisional accomplishments for final goals. The "pearl" is Buddha-nature—always present, always available, yet requiring the Buddha's revelation for recognition.

---

## Verse of the Five Hundred Arhats' Rejoicing

The arhats elaborate their realization in verse:

*"We have heard the unsurpassed*  
*Sound of receiving prophecy,*  
*Our hearts filled with rejoicing,*  
*As if with immortal nectar.*  

*In the Buddha's presence today,*  
*We repent of our transgressions,*  
*As those possessing slight nirvana-attainment,*  
*Like the ignorant, thoughtless person*  

*Who went to his friend's house,*  
*And whose friend was very wealthy,*  
*Placed in his inner garment*  
*A precious pearl of immeasurable value.*  

*Left it there unknowingly,*  
*The man slept in intoxication.*  
*Then rising, traveled to another land,*  
*Seeking livelihood and sustenance—*  

*The task proved most difficult,*  
*Obtaining only small amounts,*  
*Not knowing that within his robe*  
*There was a precious pearl of immeasurable worth.*  

*The friend who had given the pearl,*  
*Later meeting this poor man,*  
*Scolded him severely, saying:*  
*'For what reason have you remained impoverished?*  

*I gave you a precious pearl,*  
*Sewn into the lining of your robe,*  
*The pearl remains to this very day.*  
*The poor man saw the pearl,*  

*His heart filled with great joy,*  
*Becoming wealthy with many possessions,*  
*Able to indulge the five desires.*  
*We too are like this:*  

*The World-Honored One has, throughout the night,*  
*Constantly pitied and taught us,*  
*Causing us to plant the supreme aspiration.*  
*We, lacking wisdom,*  

*Did not know or perceive this,*  
*Having attained the small nirvana,*  
*We were satisfied, not seeking more.*  
*Now the Buddha awakens us,*  

*Saying: "This is not actual extinction,*  
*To attain the supreme Buddha-wisdom—*  
*This alone is true extinction."*  
*We now hear the Buddha grant us prophecy,*  

*And our body and mind are filled with joy.'"*[^18]  

The verse recapitulation emphasizes the pathos of the situation: beings who possess immeasurable treasure yet remain in poverty, needing their ignorance revealed before they can access what was always theirs.

## The Significance of the Pearl in the Garment

This parable constitutes one of the Lotus Sutra's most enduring teachings about the nature of Buddhist awakening:

## The Five Hundred Arhats' Names and Individual Recognition

The text then enumerates the five hundred arhats receiving prophecy by name:

> "The monks mentioned by name are Uruvelā-Kāśyapa, Gaya-Kāśyapa, Nādi-Kāśyapa, Kalodāyin, Udāyin, Aniruddha, Revata, Kapiṇa, Bakula, Cunda, Svāgata, and five hundred others. All of them received prophecies of Buddhahood, all bearing the same Buddha-name: Universal-Illumination."

The naming of individual disciples alongside the collective prophecy serves multiple functions:

## Philosophical Implications

---

## Cosmic Significance: The Doctrine Expands

The chapter's conclusion extends the prophecies to include future disciples:

> "After all five hundred had received their prophecies, the Buddha told Mahākāśyapa: 'Mahākāśyapa, you have already learned that five hundred autonomous ones and the remaining śrāvaka assemblies shall also receive prophecies. Those not present at this assembly—you should proclaim this dharma to them.'[^19]

This extension of the prophecies beyond the present assembly to all future disciples is theologically momentous. It suggests that:

## Ānanda's Prophecy: The Dharma-Keeper's Future Buddha-hood

The Buddha immediately addresses Ānanda:

> "The Buddha told Ānanda: 'In the future world, you shall become a Buddha, bearing the name Mountain-Sea-Wisdom Self-Mastery-King Tathāgata, Worthy One, Perfectly Enlightened One, Possessor of Luminous Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.[^7]

> You shall make offerings to sixty-two billion Buddhas, protecting the dharma-treasury, and then attain supreme enlightenment. You shall teach and transform twenty thousand billion billions of Gangetic-sand-numerous Bodhisattvas, causing them to attain supreme enlightenment.[^8]

> Your Buddha-land shall be named "Always Standing Victory Banner." Its soil shall be pure, composed of lapis lazuli. The kalpa shall be named "Wonderful Sound Pervading."[^9] Your Buddha's lifespan shall be immeasurable thousands of billions of aeons. If someone were to calculate and compute within thousands of billions of immeasurable aeons, they would be unable to determine the measure. The Proper Dharma shall dwell for a time equal to the Buddha's lifespan, and the Dharma-Semblance shall dwell for twice the Proper Dharma.[^10]

> Ānanda, the Buddha Mountain-Sea-Wisdom Self-Mastery-King shall be praised by immeasurable thousands of billions of Gangetic-sand-numerous Tathāgatas throughout the ten directions, who shall celebrate his virtues.'"[^11]

Ānanda's Buddha-name is extraordinarily expressive:**"Mountain-Sea-Wisdom Self-Mastery-King"**. Let us examine its components:

- **Mountain-Sea**: Evokes vastness and immensity, suggesting the comprehensiveness of his wisdom
- **Wisdom**: Direct knowing, often emphasizing experiential understanding
- **Self-Mastery**: Freedom from constraint, unrestricted movement
- **King**: Sovereignty, supreme authority

Together, the name suggests a Buddha whose wisdom is as vast as mountains and seas, who moves freely in all directions, and who reigns supreme—yet attains this status precisely *through* service and dharma-keeping.[^12]

The prophecy emphasizes several remarkable elements:

---

## Ānanda's Emotional Response: Memory and Recognition

The text then describes Ānanda's immediate response:

> "Ānanda, standing directly before the Buddha, upon hearing his prophecy and the description of his Buddha-land's adornments, having had all his wishes fulfilled, was filled with immense joy and had obtained what was never before obtained. At that moment, he recalled without limit the dharma-treasuries of immeasurable millions of billions of Buddhas from the past, understanding them without obstruction. Just as he hears them now, he also recognizes his original aspiration.[^14]

> At that time, Ānanda spoke in verse:

*'The World-Honored One is supremely rare and extraordinary,*  
*Causing me to recall the past*—  
*Immeasurable dharma-treasuries of Buddhas*  
*Just as I hear them today.*  

*I am now without doubt,*  
*Established in the Buddha-path,*  
*As skillful means, serving as attendant,*  
*I protect the dharma of all Buddhas.'"*[^15]  

This response is extraordinary. Upon hearing his prophecy, Ānanda instantaneously:

This suggests that prophecy functions not merely as future prediction but as *present recognition and awakening*. The prophecy triggers Ānanda's full realization of his eternal aspiration.[^16]

- **Recognition of serving as skillful means**: Ānanda understands that his attendant role is not limitation but method
- **Dharma-protection as eternal function**: He will continue protecting the dharma even in future Buddha-realms

This reinterprets his entire past and future: what seemed like being always behind-the-scenes is revealed as the most essential work—being present to receive, preserve, and transmit the teaching.

---

## Rāhula's Prophecy: The Eternal Son

> "The Buddha told Rāhula: 'In the future world, you shall become a Buddha, bearing the name Treading-Jeweled-Flowers Tathāgata, Worthy One, Perfectly Enlightened One, Possessor of Luminous Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.[^17]

> You shall make offerings to Buddha-Tathāgatas equal in number to the dust-particles of ten worlds. You shall always be the eldest son of all Buddhas, just as you are now. This Buddha Treading-Jeweled-Flowers' Buddha-land's adornments, lifespan, number of disciples, Proper Dharma, and Dharma-Semblance shall be identical to those of the Buddha Mountain-Sea-Wisdom Self-Mastery-King, with no difference whatsoever. You shall always be that Buddha's eldest son, and after this, you shall attain supreme enlightenment.'"[^18]

Rāhula's prophecy is distinctive in emphasizing his eternal role as**"eldest son"** of all Buddhas. This is significant because:

---

## Verse on Rāhula's Prophecy

The Buddha elaborates in verse:

*"When I was a prince,*  
*Rāhula was my eldest son,*  
*Now that I have attained the Buddha-path,*  
*He receives the dharma as the dharma-heir.*  

*In future worlds,*  
*He shall encounter immeasurable billions of Buddhas,*  
*Always serving as their eldest son,*  
*Single-heartedly seeking the Buddha-path.*  

*Rāhula's secret practice[^20]*  
*Only I can know,*  
*Now serving as my eldest son,*  
*To demonstrate this to all beings.*  

*Immeasurable millions of billions of virtues*  
*Beyond all counting,*  
*Established in the Buddha-dharma,*  
*Seeking the unsurpassed path.'"[^21]*  

The verse emphasizes the continuity between present and future: Rāhula was the eldest son when the Buddha was a prince; he is now the dharma-heir when the Buddha is enlightened; he will be the eldest son across all future Buddha-realms. His identity is stable even as circumstances transform.[^22]

---

## The Two Thousand Learning and Unlearning Disciples: Collective Prophecy

The narrative then addresses the large group:

> "At that time, the World-Honored One, seeing the two thousand learning and unlearning disciples, their minds gentle and soft, serene and pure, with unified attention focused on the Buddha, told Ānanda: 'Do you see these two thousand learning and unlearning disciples?'

> Ānanda replied: 'Yes, indeed, I have seen them.'

> The Buddha said: 'Ānanda, these people shall each make offerings to Buddha-Tathāgatas equal to the dust-particles of fifty worlds, respectfully honoring them, protecting the dharma-treasure. Finally, at the same time, in the ten directions of all lands, they shall each attain Buddhahood, bearing the same Buddha-name: Jeweled Appearance Tathāgata, Worthy One, Perfectly Enlightened One, Possessor of Luminous Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. Their Buddha-lands' adornments, their disciples, the Proper Dharma, and the Dharma-Semblance shall all be equal and identical, with no differences whatsoever.'"[^23]

---

## Verse Recapitulation: The Two Thousand Collectively Rejoice

The verse section recapitulates:

*"These two thousand śrāvakas,*  
*Now standing before me,*  
*Receive prophecies completely*  
*And shall become Buddhas in the future.*  

*The number of Buddhas they shall encounter,*  
*Equal to the dust-particles as described above,*  
*They shall protect their dharma-treasuries,*  
*And later attain perfect enlightenment.*  

*Each in the ten directions of all lands,*  
*All bearing the same Buddha-name,*  
*Simultaneously sitting at the enlightenment seat,*  
*Verifying supreme wisdom.*  

*All named Jeweled Appearance,*  
*Their Buddha-lands and disciples,*  
*Proper Dharma and Dharma-Semblance,*  
*All equal without any difference.*  

*All using supernatural powers,*  
*To transform beings in the ten directions,*  
*Their fame and renown pervading universally,*  
*Gradually entering nirvana.'"[^27]*  

The verse emphasizes the perfect parallelism of their futures. The repetition of "all equal," "no differences," and "simultaneously" drives home the radical assertion: these two thousand disciples—who appear in the present moment as a diverse group at different stages of practice—are destined for utterly identical Buddhahood.[^28]

The two thousand disciples then respond:

*"World-Honored One, O wisdom-lamp bright,*  
*We hear the sound of receiving prophecy,*  
*Our hearts filled with rejoicing,*  
*As if anointed with immortal nectar.'"[^29]*  

The simplicity of their response contrasts with the elaborate verse sections. Their joy is expressed without elaboration—just the image of their hearts filled with the joy of hearing prophecy, like nectar's transformative power.

---

## Bodhisattvas' Question: Why Such Prophecies to Śrāvakas?

A new complication now arises. The text notes:

> "At that time, eight thousand newly-determined Bodhisattvas in the assembly thought: 'We have not yet heard that the great Bodhisattvas received such prophecies. Why do the śrāvakas now receive such prophecies?'"[^30]

This is a crucial question, and one that naturally arises: If Bodhisattvas are those dedicated to enlightenment for the sake of all beings, why do śrāvakas (disciples of the limited path) receive such exalted prophecies?

The question reveals a hierarchy assumption: that Bodhisattvas are superior to śrāvakas, and therefore should receive more exalted prophecies. Yet the text is asserting something more radical—that all paths ultimately lead to the same destination.

---

## The Buddha's Answer: Original Vows Determine Destiny

The Buddha immediately addresses the Bodhisattvas' unspoken concern:

> "The World-Honored One, knowing what the Bodhisattvas contemplated in their hearts, told them: 'Good children, I and Ānanda, along with others, at the Buddha Empty-King's place simultaneously generated the aspiration for supreme enlightenment. Ānanda constantly delighted in hearing the dharma and taking in the teachings, while I constantly applied myself with diligent effort. Therefore, I have already attained supreme enlightenment, while Ānanda protects my dharma and also protects and preserves the dharma-treasuries of the Buddhas yet to come.[^31]

> This is Ānanda's original intention, and therefore he received this prophecy.'"[^32]

This answer is profoundly important. It establishes that:

This answer revolutionizes how we understand spiritual status. What appears as limitation (being an attendant rather than the teacher) reflects a higher, earlier choice (the vow to preserve dharma for all Buddhas). The answer honors all roles as expressions of deeper aspirations.[^35]

---

## The Principle Underlying Chapter 9

This connects backward to Chapter 7's Phantom City parable: the Buddha's use of skillful means is not deception but response to beings' conditions. The prophecies in these chapters are recognitions of what beings eternally are, not arbitrary grants.[^36]

---

## Significance: Chapter 9's Contribution to the Prophecy Arc

**Chapters 6-9 systematically expand prophecies:**

- **Chapter 6**: Great disciples individually recognized
- **Chapter 7**: Justification of skillful means (Phantom City)
- **Chapter 8**: Five hundred disciples collectively prophesied; revelation of Buddha-nature (Pearl in the Garment)
- **Chapter 9**: Key disciples (Ānanda, Rāhula) and two thousand disciples; revelation of original vows

**Each chapter adds a new dimension:**

- Ch. 6: Individuality matters; each person is unique
- Ch. 7: Skillful means are justified; stages are necessary
- Ch. 8: All possess Buddha-nature; equality underlies multiplicity
- Ch. 9: Original vows determine destiny; present roles express eternal aspirations

By Chapter 9, the prophecy pattern is clearly established:

**All will become Buddhas because all made the original vow. The Buddha's role is to recognize and affirm these eternal intentions.**

---

# Chapter 10: The Dharma-Teacher

---

## The Universal Prophecy: All Beings Who Hear

The chapter opens with the Buddha addressing the Bodhisattva Medicine King:

> "At that time, the World-Honored One, through the Bodhisattva Medicine King, addressed eighty thousand great Bodhisattvas: 'Medicine King, do you see in this great assembly the immeasurable celestial beings, dragon-kings, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans, and monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, those seeking śrāvaka-enlightenment, those seeking pratyekabuddha-enlightenment, those seeking Buddha-enlightenment? All such beings as these, who have heard the Lotus Sutra even one verse or sentence, or experienced even a single moment of rejoicing in their hearts before the Buddha, I grant them all the prophecy: they shall attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi (supreme enlightenment).'"[^2]

> "Furthermore, Medicine King, after the Tathāgata's extinction, if there are people who hear the Lotus Sutra—even one verse or sentence—and experience a single moment of rejoicing, I also grant them the prophecy of supreme enlightenment.[^4]

> "If there are people who receive, uphold, read, recite, explain, and write out the Lotus Sutra—even one verse—and treat this scripture with respect, as if it were the Buddha himself, making various offerings of flowers, incense, garlands, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners, clothing, and music—indeed, even joined hands in reverence—Medicine King, know that these people have already made offerings to one hundred million billion Buddhas, fulfilled great vows at the Buddhas' places, and have been born in this human realm out of compassion for beings.'"[^5]

This extended prophecy introduces the concept of**dharma-keeping work** (、、、):

Each of these forms of engagement with the text is affirmed as sufficient for Buddhahood. Importantly, all such practitioners are revealed as bodhisattvas in disguise—beings who have already served hundreds of millions of Buddhas and chosen to be born now in service to the dharma.[^6]

## The Dharma-Teacher's Status: Worthy of the Highest Reverence

> "'Medicine King, if someone asks: "What beings shall become Buddhas in the future world?" you should show them these beings, for in the future world they shall certainly become Buddhas.[^7]

> "Why? Because if good men and good women receive, uphold, read, recite, explain, write, or make various offerings to the Lotus Sutra—even one verse—treating the scripture with respect, making offerings of flowers, incense, garlands, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners, clothing, and music, joined hands in reverence—these people are ones whom all the world should venerate. They should be honored with offerings as befits the Tathāgata.[^8]

> Know that such people are great Bodhisattvas, having accomplished supreme enlightenment, compassionate toward beings, and wishing to be born in this world to widely proclaim and distinguish the Lotus Sutra. How much more so those who are entirely capable of upholding and making various offerings!'"[^9]

This has profound implications for anyone engaged in Buddhist practice:

- The practitioner is not a seeker becoming something other than they are, but a Bodhisattva recognizing their true nature
- Teaching or practicing the sutra is not lesser work but the highest work, equivalent to the Buddha's own activity
- Community members encountering a dharma-teacher should recognize that they are in the presence of a Bodhisattva

## The Dharma-Teacher as Buddha's Messenger

> "'Medicine King, know that this person has abandoned the pure rewards of karmic action. Out of compassion for beings, this person takes birth in this degenerate world after my extinction, and proclaims this sutra widely. If a good man or good woman, after my extinction, is able—even secretly—to teach the Lotus Sutra to even one person, even one verse, know that this person is the Tathāgata's messenger, sent by the Tathāgata to carry out the Tathāgata's work.[^11]

> How much more so for one who proclaims it widely to the great assembly!'"[^12]

The term "" (Tathāgata's messenger) is profound. It suggests:

Even teaching "secretly to one person" activates this status. The dharma-teacher becomes, in essence, the Buddha's embodiment in the world, continuing the teaching activity that the historical Buddha performed.[^13]

---

## The Terrible Cost of Slandering the Dharma-Teacher

The text now provides a sharp warning about the consequences of disrespecting practitioners:

> "'Medicine King, if there is an evil person who, with an unwholesome heart, slanders the Buddha for one entire kalpa, appearing before the Buddha and constantly reviling and abusing the Buddha, their sin would still be light. But if even one person speaks even one evil word slandering those, whether in households or monastic orders, who read, recite, and uphold the Lotus Sutra, their sin is very grave.'"[^14]

This ranking is extraordinary:**slandering a dharma-teacher is worse than slandering the Buddha directly.**

Why? Because:

The implication is clear:**protecting and respecting dharma-teachers is more important than even direct reverence for the Buddha.**[^15]

---

## The Dharma-Teacher as Embodiment of the Buddha

> "'Medicine King, those who read and recite the Lotus Sutra should know that they adorn themselves with the Buddha's adornments and are borne upon the shoulder of the Tathāgata.[^16] Wherever they go, they should be honored with prostration, joined hands in reverence, respect, and praise. Flowers, incense, garlands, powdered incense, paste incense, burning incense, silk canopies, banners, clothing, delicacies, musical instruments, and supreme offerings among humans should be made to them. Heavenly treasures should be scattered upon them; heavenly jewel-heaps should be offered to them.[^17]

> Why? Because this person, delighting in expounding the dharma, will, upon hearing it for but a moment, immediately attain the ultimate supreme enlightenment.'"[^18]

Several extraordinary assertions appear here:

This suggests a profound metaphysical claim:

**The dharma-teacher is the Buddha's body in the world.** To encounter the teacher is to encounter the Buddha.

## The Three Robes of the Dharma-Teacher: Conditions for Teaching

The text now provides crucial guidance for anyone intending to teach the sutra:

> "'Medicine King, if there are good men and good women who, after my extinction, wish to teach the Lotus Sutra to the four assemblies—how should they teach?

> These good men and good women should enter the Tathāgata's room, wear the Tathāgata's robes, and sit on the Tathāgata's seat. Only then should they broadly teach this sutra to the four assemblies.[^20]

> What is the Tathāgata's room? It is the great compassionate heart among all beings.[^21]

> What is the Tathāgata's robe? It is the gentle and patient heart.[^22]

> What is the Tathāgata's seat? It is the emptiness of all dharmas.[^23]

> Established in these, then with an unrelenting heart, one should broadly teach the Lotus Sutra to the Bodhisattvas and the four assemblies.'"[^24]

This passage provides perhaps the most important instruction for dharma-teachers in the entire Lotus Sutra. The "three robes" are not literal garments but inner conditions:

Together, the three robes describe an inner state of perfect balance:**passionate compassion, protective gentleness, and ultimate wisdom-emptiness, expressed through unwavering commitment.**

This portrait of the ideal dharma-teacher represents the integration of all Buddhist virtues.[^25]

---

## The Buddha's Support for Dharma-Teachers: Supernatural Protection

> "'Medicine King, I, in other countries, send transformed beings to gather assemblies for listening to the dharma. I also send transformed monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen to listen to their teaching. These transformed beings, upon hearing the dharma, believe and accept it, following and not opposing.

> If the dharma-teacher dwells in a solitary place, at that time I extensively send celestial beings, dragons, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, and the like to listen to their teaching.[^26]

> Even though I am in another country, from time to time I cause the dharma-teacher to see my body. If they forget passages or sentences of this sutra, I will teach it to them, causing them to become complete.'"[^27]

These promises describe extraordinary support:

These promises function to:

## The Supreme Difficulty and Importance of Dharma-Teaching
The Buddha now elaborates the prophecy and protection in extensive verse, emphasizing the supreme difficulty and supreme importance of dharma-teaching:

*"Whoever wishes to dwell in the Buddha-path*  
*And accomplish naturally perfect wisdom,*  
*Should constantly diligently make offerings*  
*To those who uphold the Lotus Sutra.*  

*Whoever wishes to swiftly obtain*  
*All-encompassing wisdom,*  
*Should uphold this sutra*  
*And make offerings to its keepers.*  

*Those able to uphold the Lotus Sutra,*  
*Know that they are the Buddha's messengers,*  
*Compassionate toward all beings.*  

*Those able to uphold the Lotus Sutra,*  
*Abandon the pure realms,*  
*Out of compassion for beings, taking birth here.*  

*Know that such persons*  
*Are free to be reborn as they wish,*  
*Able to proclaim the unsurpassed dharma*  
*In this degenerate world.*  

*With celestial flowers and fragrances*  
*And celestial jeweled clothes,*  
*And celestial precious treasure-heaps,*  
*Make offerings to the dharma-teachers.*"  

*"If during one entire kalpa,*  
*One harbored unwholesome heart,*  
*Made angry expression and reviled the Buddha,*  
*One would obtain immeasurable grave sin.*  

*But if one spoke even one evil word*  
*To revile those who read, recite, and uphold*  
*The Lotus Sutra,*  
*One's sin would exceed that even more.*  

*If there were one who sought the Buddha-path*  
*And during one entire kalpa*  
*Joined palms before me*  
*With numberless verses of praise,*  

*And because of this praise of the Buddha,*  
*Obtained immeasurable merit—*  
*Yet praising the keeper of the sutra*  
*Would have even greater merit than that.*  

*If during eighty billion kalpas*  
*One made the most excellent offerings*  
*Of form, sound, scent, taste, and touch*  
*To those who keep the sutra,*  

*And having made such offerings,*  
*Should hear even for a moment,*  
*One should rejoice, thinking:*  
*'I have now obtained great benefit.*'"  

*"Medicine King, I declare to you:*  
*Of all the sutras I have taught,*  
*Among these,*  
*The Lotus Sutra is first.* (line 2583)  

This section's repeated comparative structure (praising Buddha is good, but praising the dharma-teacher is better; one kalpa of offering is good, but eighty billion kalpas of offering is still less than momentary hearing of the dharma-teacher) establishes a hierarchy of merit that culminates in the recognition that:

**Dharma-teaching and dharma-keeping are the highest activities in the universe.**

This radical revaluation places those engaged in teaching and preserving the dharma at the absolute apex of spiritual significance.[^29]

---

## Connection to Later Chapters

The text now shifts to new material (the emergence of Prabhūtaratna Buddha and subsequent chapters), but Chapter 10's teaching stands complete. Let me note that in the Classical Chinese, the manuscript continues with:

- **Chapter 11**: The emergence of Prabhūtaratna Buddha's stupa and the meeting of past and present Buddhas
- **Chapter 12**: The revelation that even Devadatta (the Buddha's nemesis) will become a Buddha, and the story of the eight-year-old Nāga princess attaining Buddhahood
- **Chapter 13**: The assembly's vows to uphold and propagate the sutra

But I'll focus on completing Chapter 10 here, as it's a complete teaching unit.

## The Revolutionary Implications of Chapter 10

## Metaphysics: The Buddha's Continued Presence

Chapter 10 makes a profound metaphysical claim:

**The Buddha does not truly enter extinction.** Instead, the Buddha's presence is:

This suggests that nirvana (the Buddha's extinction) is not cessation but**transformation into omnipresent dharma-presence**.

## Ethics: The Revaluation of Work

Chapter 10 completely revalues what counts as important work:

- **Previous view**: Monastic practice, meditation, personal enlightenment are the highest activities
- **Lotus Sutra view**: Teaching the dharma and preserving texts are the highest activities—more important than even direct practice

This shift from contemplative monasticism to dharma-transmission establishes that**engaged activity in service to beings' enlightenment is superior to withdrawn practice.**[^30]

## Sociology: Community Transformation

Chapter 10 establishes a new form of Buddhist community:

- **Not hierarchical**: The teacher is a "messenger," not a superior being; the student who hears one verse is already a future Buddha
- **Not dependent on the Buddha's physical presence**: The dharma-text and teachers continue the Buddha's function indefinitely
- **Cosmic in scope**: Beings throughout the universe support and recognize dharma-transmission
- **Democratized**: Any being engaging with the sutra—hearing, reciting, teaching, writing—participates in the Buddha's eternal work

## Linguistics and Semiotics: The Power of Language

Chapter 10 asserts extraordinary power for language:

- **One verse is sufficient**: The smallest unit of language carries infinite truth
- **Text becomes sacred**: The written characters themselves become the Buddha's body
- **Transmission preserves power**: Each recitation, reading, and teaching carries the Buddha's actual transformative presence

This suggests that dharma-language is not merely *about* enlightenment but is itself**enlightenment made manifest in linguistic form.**

## Temporality: The Eternal Present

Chapter 10 abolishes the temporal separation between past and future:

- **The Buddha's teaching is eternally present**: Though the historical Buddha entered extinction, the dharma continues the teaching eternally
- **Future hearing is present encounter**: Those who hear the sutra centuries in the future encounter the Buddha as directly as those present
- **The text transcends time**: The Lotus Sutra sutures all times together, making all moments of hearing simultaneous

This suggests that**time is not the primary dimension of reality; dharma is.**[^31]

---

## The Dharma-Text as Embodiment: A Metaphysical Innovation

Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of Chapter 10 is the assertion that**the Lotus Sutra text itself is the Buddha's body.**

Supporting evidence from the chapter:

This creates a radical identification:

**Lotus Sutra Text = Buddha's Body = Dharma Itself.**

This has profound implications:

- **Literacy becomes spiritual practice**: Reading and writing the sutra is meditation
- **The text is sacred object**: The book/scroll itself is worthy of the highest reverence
- **Language is enlightenment**: The dharma is not beyond language; it is language made manifest
- **Preservation of text is salvation**: Copying and protecting the sutra saves all beings

This doctrine would influence East Asian Buddhism profoundly, leading to:
- Elaborate ritual treatment of Buddhist texts
- Copying as spiritual practice (often done as merit-making)
- Printing and distribution of sacred texts as religious duty
- The understanding that encountering the text is encountering the Buddha

---

## Conclusion: The Transformation of Buddhism

**Chapter 10 represents perhaps the most significant transformation in Buddhist understanding across the entire Lotus Sutra.** Where earlier chapters established the doctrine of universal Buddha-nature, Chapter 10 transforms this from a metaphysical principle into a**present, practical reality accessible through hearing the dharma.**

The central assertion—that hearing one verse is sufficient for guaranteed Buddhahood—makes enlightenment:

By identifying dharma-teachers as Bodhisattva-incarnates and the dharma-text as the Buddha's eternal body, Chapter 10 establishes that**the Buddha's teaching function continues eternally through the agency of texts and teachers.**

This means that Buddhism does not depend on the historical Buddha for its authenticity. The dharma itself—present in sutra-texts and manifested through teachers—is eternally alive, eternally teaching, eternally liberating all beings who hear.

This is perhaps why the Lotus Sutra is called the "King of Sutras" in East Asian Buddhism: it not only teaches the doctrine of universal enlightenment but establishes the mechanism—text, teachers, transmission—by which that enlightenment becomes accessible to all beings across all time.

In Chapter 10, the Lotus Sutra's vision moves from theological possibility to practical, present reality.

# Chapter 11: The Emergence of Prabhūtaratna Buddha's Stupa

## THE COSMIC MANIFESTATION OF WITNESS
At that moment, before the Buddha, there suddenly appeared a seven-jeweled stupa, five hundred *yojanas* in height and two hundred fifty *yojanas* in length and breadth. This magnificent structure surged up from the earth itself, suspended in space, adorned with countless precious objects beyond enumeration. Five thousand railings surrounded it, with ten thousand million chambers carved into its brilliance. Infinite banners and pennants, woven from the finest silks and golden threads, adorned its surfaces in all directions. Precious bells, numbering in the billions, hung suspended from above, each one resonating with the faintest breath. From all four cardinal directions emanated the most precious fragrances—aromatic sandalwood that filled the entire cosmic universe with its presence.[^1]

The banners themselves were composed of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, crystal, jade, pearls, and rose-quartz—all seven precious materials unified in a single manifestation. The stupa rose until its apex touched the four divine regions themselves, reaching the palaces of those who govern the sensory worlds. From the thirty-three heavens above, celestial beings rained down the sweet mandāra flowers, scattering them as offerings to this extraordinary stupa.[^2] The numberless classes of celestial beings, dragons, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans—countless millions upon millions—offered to this stupa every precious gift: flowers, fragrances, garlands, banners, canopies, and musical performances. With profound reverence and exultation, they honored and praised this stupa that had emerged from the depths of the earth.

Then from the stupa itself there issued a great voice that proclaimed: "Excellent! Excellent, Śākyamuni Buddha! You have taught the Dharma of the Bodhisattvas with profound wisdom and equanimity. Your teaching is upheld by all Buddhas. This supreme Lotus Sutra—this wondrous teaching—you present to this great gathering. Yes, yes, Śākyamuni Buddha, all that you have taught is absolutely true!"[^3]

The entire assembly of four kinds of beings[^4]—witnessing this magnificent stupa hovering in the empty sky and hearing this remarkable voice emerging from within it—felt a great joy arise in their hearts. They perceived something they had never witnessed before. All rose from their seats and bowed with joined palms, standing to the side in reverence.

Then the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva named Mahāraranavihāra, knowing the doubts that arose in the hearts of all the heavenly beings, humans, and asuras in this great assembly, addressed the Buddha with this question:

"World Honored One, what is the cause and condition that brings forth this precious stupa from the earth itself? And from where comes this voice that resonates with such extraordinary power?"[^5]

The Buddha responded to this question:

"Mahāraranavihāra, inside this precious stupa there resides the**entire body**—the *śarīra*—of a Buddha. Long ago, in the incomprehensibly distant past, east of here, beyond countless worlds numbering more than the grains of sand in the Ganges River, there existed a world-system called Precious Purity. In that realm dwelt a Buddha known as Prabhūtaratna—the Buddha of Abundant Treasures.[^6]

"When this Buddha was still a Bodhisattva practicing to attain Buddhahood, he made a great vow, speaking these words: 'When I eventually achieve Buddhahood and, after my final extinction, my life comes to an end, I shall not truly pass away. Rather, my stupa—my crystallized form—will appear wherever throughout the ten directions the Lotus Sutra is being taught. My stupa shall emerge to provide testimony and confirmation. I will speak from within that stupa, declaring: "Excellent! Excellent!"'[^7]

"This Bodhisattva eventually attained full Buddhahood. At the moment of his final extinction, when he was about to enter *parinirvāṇa*, he addressed all the monks, nuns, laypeople, and celestial beings assembled before him:

'After my extinction, whosoever wishes to make offerings to my complete body should construct a great stupa for me.'[^8]

"Through the supernatural powers developed during his practice and through the force of his original vow, this Buddha ensured that his stupa would manifest throughout all the worlds in all ten directions. Whenever the Lotus Sutra is taught in any location, his stupa emerges from the earth. His entire, uncorrupted body remains within it, and from that stupa his voice declares: 'Excellent, excellent!'

"At this very moment, Mahāraranavihāra, the stupa of Prabhūtaratna Buddha has emerged because it hears the teaching of the Lotus Sutra. His stupa declares: 'Excellent, excellent!'"[^9]

The Bodhisattva Mahāraranavihāra, empowered by the Buddha's supernatural presence, then spoke again:

"World Honored One, we and all the beings in this assembly wish to perceive the body of this ancient Buddha with our own eyes."[^10]

The Buddha made this reply:

"Mahāraranavihāra, Prabhūtaratna Buddha, while his stupa is emerging to bear witness to this Lotus Sutra teaching in any of the ten directions, has made this additional vow: Whenever anyone wishes to gaze upon my ancient body and witness my presence in this form, my transformed emanations—my division-bodies, the Buddhas I have manifested in countless worlds—must first all gather together in this one location. Only when all my division-bodies have assembled will my ancient form appear before you.

"Now, Mahāraranavihāra, I shall gather all of my division-bodies from the ten directions to this place."[^11]

And at that very instant, the Buddha released a beam of pure white light from the curl of hair between his eyebrows. Through this extraordinary radiance, all the assembly could perceive vast reaches to the east—five hundred million times a billion *yojanas* of distance—revealing themselves as a cosmic vision. In that direction, worlds without limit opened to view, each one serving as a foundation of luminous crystal. These worlds were adorned with precious trees, jeweled clothing, and countless treasures. Innumerable Bodhisattvas filled these realms entirely. Precious nets woven from the finest materials hung above all places. Beneath these celestial canopies, the Buddhas of those lands taught the Dharma with profound, wondrous voices.[^12]

In all directions—south, west, north, the four intermediate directions, above and below—in every region touched by the radiance of this white-light beam from the Buddha's brow curl, the same cosmic vision appeared: infinite worlds, each containing innumerable Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, all teaching the Dharma together in perfect synchronization.[^13]

Then all the Buddhas in these ten directions, observing what had occurred, spoke to their assembled Bodhisattvas:

"Good children, we must now journey to the Śākyamuni Buddha's realm, the Sahā world, to do honor to both Śākyamuni Buddha and the stupa of Prabhūtaratna Buddha."[^14]

In that instant, the Sahā world transformed completely. It became luminous and pure, with crystal serving as its earth. Precious trees adorned its landscape. Golden ropes marked out the eight cardinal paths. All villages, towns, cities, settlements, oceans, rivers, and mountain ranges simply vanished from sight, made invisible. The entire realm was perfumed with precious incense, and mandāra flowers covered the ground completely. Precious nets wove themselves above the entire landscape. Precious bells hung suspended in the air. Only the assembly of those present at this teaching remained visible in this realm; all other celestial beings and humans were transferred to other worlds to make room for what was about to occur.[^15]

Then each Buddha from the ten directions, bringing with them a single great Bodhisattva as an attendant, journeyed toward the Sahā world. Each arrived at the foot of a precious tree. Each precious tree stood five hundred *yojanas* in height, with branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits arranged in perfect harmony. Beneath every precious tree was set a lion-throne, five *yojanas* in height, adorned with the finest precious substances.[^16] Upon these thrones, all the Buddhas arranged themselves in the meditation posture, legs crossed.

Continuing in this manner, the Buddhas spread throughout the entire three-thousand-fold thousand-fold world-system. Yet even as the Buddha-assembly covered this entire cosmic expanse, the division-bodies of Śākyamuni Buddha—those manifestations sent to one direction alone—had still not all arrived.[^17]

To provide space for all the remaining Buddhas to gather, Śākyamuni Buddha transformed eight additional cosmic regions beyond the eight primary directions. In each region, he created two hundred million times a billion *yojanas* of additional worlds, all made pure and radiant. He removed all hells, hungry ghosts, animals, and asuras from these worlds, and transferred the celestial beings and humans dwelling there to other realms to make space. These transformed worlds too had crystal as their foundation, precious trees for adornment, trees five hundred *yojanas* in height with perfectly arranged branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Beneath each tree stood a lion-throne five *yojanas* high, adorned with precious substances. These worlds had no oceans, rivers, or great mountains—the entire region became a single unified Buddha-realm of perfect clarity. The earth itself became pure and gleaming, with precious curtains draped above it. Precious bells hung suspended everywhere. Great precious incense filled the air, and celestial flowers covered the ground.[^18]

The Buddha prepared yet another eight regions beyond these for the remaining division-bodies to sit within. In each region, he transformed two hundred million times a billion *yojanas* of additional worlds, purifying them completely. He removed all suffering realms from them and transferred other beings to different worlds. All these worlds too became bases of crystal, adorned with precious trees, with perfect arrangements of branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Lion-thrones of five *yojanas* stood beneath each tree. No oceans, rivers, or mountains existed here. Each realm became a single, unified Buddha-realm. The earth was pure and gleaming, precious curtains hung everywhere, precious bells were suspended, great precious incense filled the space, and the flowers of the celestial realms covered the ground entirely.[^19]

Now in sequence, all the Buddha-bodies that Śākyamuni had manifested in the eastern direction—those dwelling in lands numbering beyond the mathematical limits of description—all came together to this gathering. In this manner, all the Buddhas from the ten directions progressively assembled. In each of the eight outer directions, four hundred million times a billion *yojanas* of Buddha-lands were completely filled with seated Buddhas. Each Buddha sat beneath a precious tree upon a lion-throne, and each sent an attendant to offer respects to Śākyamuni Buddha. These attendants carried precious flowers in both hands as they approached, speaking these words:

"Good child, go to Vulture Peak where Śākyamuni Buddha dwells. Convey greetings from our Buddha, saying: 'May the Buddha be well and free from afflictions. May all Bodhisattvas and disciples be at ease and at peace. Our Buddha sends you these flowers as an offering and expresses our wish to open the precious stupa together.'"[^20]

All the Buddhas in the ten directions sent their messengers in this manner.

When Śākyamuni Buddha beheld all his division-bodies assembled and at rest upon their lion-thrones, when he heard from all the Buddhas their agreement to open the precious stupa together, he rose from his seat and stood suspended in empty space. All the assembly of four kinds of beings rose up and joined their palms together, focusing their complete attention upon the Buddha.[^21]

At that moment, Śākyamuni Buddha extended his right hand and opened the seven-jeweled stupa. As the doors opened, a great sound echoed forth—like the turning of keys in locks, like the opening of great city gates. In that instant, the entire assembly could perceive Prabhūtaratna Buddha sitting in meditation posture upon a lion-throne inside the stupa. His body appeared completely whole and incorrupt, as if he were still in the depths of profound *samādhi*.[^22]

From within the stupa, Prabhūtaratna Buddha spoke these words: "Excellent, excellent, Śākyamuni Buddha! You have eloquently taught the Lotus Sutra. It was precisely to hear this Dharma that I made my original vow and came to this place."[^23]

When all the four kinds of beings witnessed this ancient Buddha—one who had passed into extinction countless eons ago—yet heard him speak in this very moment, they were filled with wonder beyond measure. Using precious celestial flowers gathered in heaps, they scattered countless offerings over both Prabhūtaratna Buddha and Śākyamuni Buddha.[^24]

Then Prabhūtaratna Buddha, still seated within the stupa, created space upon his own lion-throne and spoke to Śākyamuni: "Śākyamuni Buddha, please sit upon this seat beside me."[^25]

In that moment, Śākyamuni Buddha entered the stupa and sat upon the half-seat offered to him, placing himself in the meditation posture beside the ancient Buddha. Now the great assembly perceived that both Buddhas sat together in the seven-jeweled stupa upon the lion-throne, their bodies in perfect meditation.

Beholding this vision, each being in the assembly generated this thought: "The Buddha's seat is very high and far away. We wish that the World Honored One would use his supernatural power to allow us all to dwell together in empty space."[^26]

Immediately, through his supernatural powers, Śākyamuni Buddha lifted the entire great assembly upward, placing them all in the empty sky. Then, with a voice that resonated throughout all directions, the Buddha proclaimed to the four kinds of beings:

"Who will be able to extensively teach the supreme Lotus Sutra in this Sahā world?**Now is the time.** The Tathāgata will soon enter final *parinirvāṇa*. The Buddha wishes to entrust this supreme Lotus Sutra to someone for transmission. I seek those who will accept this sacred responsibility."[^27]

---
## At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to express this teaching again, spoke in verse:
The mighty saint, the World Honored One,
Though long ago he passed away—
His sacred form still dwells,
Within the tower, for Dharma's sake.

What living being would not strive,
To undertake the sacred work?
This Buddha's extinction occurred,
In eons countless as the sands.

Yet still he journeys everywhere,
To hear the teaching that is rare.[^28]
For such was his original vow:
When I have passed beyond this life,
Wherever the true Dharma lives,
I shall appear to hear it taught.

My transformation-bodies too,
Innumerable as sand-grains vast—
They come now seeking to hear the truth,
And to behold the Buddha gone.

Each one abandons precious lands,
Leaves disciples, heavenly hosts,
All who make offerings sacred—
To keep the Dharma ever true,
These Buddhas journey here to dwell.

That all these Buddhas find their seats,
Through supernatural power's grace,
Innumerable beings move,
So all worlds become supremely pure.

Each Buddha sits beneath a tree,
At the foundations luminous—
Like unto lotus flowers white,
Adorning a most perfect pond.

Beneath these trees of precious hue,
The lion-thrones of Buddhas wait—
The Buddhas sit in glory there,
Their forms adorned with radiant light.

As darkness flees before great fire,
So shines their presence through all worlds.
Their sacred fragrance fills the space,
All beings sense and know great joy,

Just as the wind that bends the branch
Of trees so tender, small, and weak.[^29]

By such compassionate device,
The Dharma will endure through time.
The Buddha tells the gathered throng:
When I have entered into rest,
Who shall protect, who shall proclaim,
Who will maintain this Dharma true?

Let all declare before me now,
Your sacred vow to uphold this law.[^30]

That ancient Buddha, Prabhūtaratna,
Though eons past his leaving went,
Still roars like lion for the Dharma—
Such is the power of the vow!

Both Prabhūtaratna and myself,
Along with all the Buddhas here—
Understand that what we seek,
Is who will uphold this sacred way.

All Bodhisattva children true,
Who shall protect this Dharma-realm?
Now make your vows, profound and great,
That this true teaching may endure.

All those who guard this sacred Dharma,
Make offerings to me and him,
For Prabhūtaratna's stupa dwells,
Forever journeying through ten worlds—

For this Dharma's sake, it travels,
To make vast offerings as well,
To all the Buddhas manifested,
Who adorn and glorify the worlds.

When this Dharma is proclaimed and taught,
You are perceiving both myself,
And Prabhūtaratna Buddha,
With all the manifested Buddhas.

All children virtuous and true,
Observe this carefully and well:
What we proclaim to you this day,
This is indeed the deepest truth.

What other teachers, other ways,
Are numberless as grains of sand—
Yet even were they taught to all,
This would not yet be reckoned hard.

If one could take Mount Sumeru,
The cosmic mountain at world's core,
And fling it far across the void,
To other Buddha-lands afar—
Even this would not be hard.

If one could use a single finger,
To move the mighty thousand-fold worlds,[^31]
To hurl them far to other regions,
Even this would not be hard.

If one could stand at the world's apex,
Where the highest gods reside,
And teach innumerable sutras,
Other teachings without bound—
Even this would not be hard.[^32]

But if, when I have passed away,
A being could proclaim this Dharma,
When hatred, hatred fills this age,**This indeed would be most hard.**[^33]

If one could grasp the empty air itself,
And walk upon it as a path,
Even this would not be hard.
But if, after my extinction comes,
A being writes this scripture down,
Or has another write for them—**This indeed would be most hard.**

If one could place the vast earth,
Upon the tip of one small nail,
Then carry it to the Brahma heavens,
Even this would not be hard.

But if, when I have passed from life,
A being reads this scripture,
For just a brief and fleeting moment,**This indeed would be most hard.**[^34]

If ages burned in cosmic fire,
And one could carry grass so dry,
And enter that great conflagration,
Carrying it all through without burning—
Even this would not be hard.

But if, when I have entered rest,
A being teaches this scripture,
For even one single person,**This indeed would be most hard.**

If one could teach and comprehend,
Eighty thousand dharma-treasures,
The twelve-fold divisions of all teachings,
Leading countless sentient beings,
Billions, trillions, sand-grain multitudes,
All to attain the state of *arhat*,
Granting each supernatural powers—
Even this would not be hard.

But if, when I have passed beyond,
A being holds this scripture fast,
Receives it and maintains its truth,**This indeed would be most hard.**[^35]

I have proclaimed the Dharma widely,
Throughout a thousand billion lands,
Since time without beginning,
I have taught the sacred Dharma,
Yet among all these teachings,
This scripture stands preeminent.

All those who have the power to hold it,
Hold the Buddha's very body.

Now all my virtuous children,
After my extinction has occurred,
Who shall receive this scripture,
Read and recite its sacred words?
Come now, speak your vows before me,
Your solemn promise in this place.

This Dharma is most hard to hold—
Should anyone keep it briefly,
This Buddha will rejoice,
All Buddhas will rejoice likewise.

Such is the being whom the Buddhas,
Will proclaim with heartfelt praise:
This is the courageous one,
This is the diligent practitioner,
This one keeps the precepts pure,
This one practices *dhūta* austerity—[^36]
Such a being shall swiftly gain,
The most supreme and highest way.

Those who can read and hold,
This scripture in time to come,
Are truly the children of Buddha,
Dwelling in the place of goodness.

When Buddhas pass away,
Those who understand their meaning,
These shall be the eyes,
Of all the heavenly and human worlds.

In this age of fear and darkness,
Those who teach this scripture,
For even a fleeting moment,
All the heavens and humans,
Should come and make offerings,
To such a rare and precious being.

# Chapter 12: Devadatta and the Nāga Princess

## THE REDEMPTION OF THE ANTAGONIST; THE INSTANTANEOUS ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE EXCLUDED
At that moment, the Buddha addressed all the Bodhisattvas and the four kinds of celestial and human beings:

"Throughout the incomprehensibly distant past—through countless eons—I have sought this Lotus Sutra without ever becoming weary. During many aeons, I lived as a universal monarch, who made a great vow to seek the supreme enlightenment without ever wavering in resolve. Desiring to completely fulfill the six transcendent perfections, I practiced generosity with the most open heart, never hoarding or grasping.[^1]

"I gave without measure: elephants and horses, the seven precious treasures, my kingdoms and cities, wives and sons, servants and attendants. I even offered my head, eyes, bone-marrow, brain, and flesh—my entire body was offered as the cost of obtaining this teaching. During those ages, human life-spans were immeasurable. For the sake of this Dharma, I abandoned my throne and transferred the kingdom to my son. I caused great drums to be struck and proclaimed throughout all directions: 'Who is there who can teach me the Great Vehicle? Whoever explains the supreme teaching to me, I shall serve as their slave and attendant throughout my entire life.'

"At that time, a sage-hermit came before me and said: 'I possess a Great Vehicle called the supreme Lotus Sutra. If you do not rebel against me, I shall unfold its teaching for you.'

"Hearing these words, my heart overflowed with delight and my whole being trembled with joy. I immediately followed that hermit-sage, providing for all his needs. I gathered fruits and drew water. I collected firewood and prepared food. Even more than this—I used my own body as a seat upon which he might rest. With neither weariness in body nor fatigue in mind, I served him continuously for one thousand years, attending diligently to his every need so that nothing was lacking.[^2]

"The monks and disciples must now hear what I will tell you: that hermit-sage of that ancient time—that one is now Devadatta.[^3]

"It is through Devadatta as a good friend that I have been able to perfect the six transcendent perfections, the four measureless states of mind, the thirty-two marks of a Buddha, and the eighty beautiful characteristics. It is through Devadatta that I have developed the ten powers, the four kinds of fearlessness, the four methods of gathering others to myself, the eighteen unique Buddha-qualities, and all supernatural powers and capacities. It is through Devadatta that I have achieved supreme, perfect enlightenment and am now able to teach sentient beings extensively. All of this—my complete enlightenment and universal teaching—arises from Devadatta serving as a good friend."[^4]

The Buddha then addressed the assembled four kinds of beings:

"**Devadatta, in the distant future after countless eons have passed, shall himself attain complete Buddhahood. He shall be called the Heaven-King Thus-Come-One, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened One, possessed of wisdom and conduct, the Well-Gone One, the Understander of the World, the Unsurpassed One, the Controller of Beings, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.**

"His world-realm shall be called the Heavenly Way. At that time, the Heaven-King Buddha shall dwell in the world for twenty intermediate aeons. He shall teach the supreme Dharma extensively to all sentient beings. Through his teaching, countless beings equal to the sands of the Ganges shall attain the state of arhat, the highest fruit of the listener's path. Immeasurable beings shall awaken to the understanding of solitary enlightenment. And countless beings—equal in number to the sands of the Ganges—shall develop the aspiration for supreme enlightenment, shall attain the non-regressing patience, and shall become irreversibly established on the path to Buddhahood.[^5]

"**After the Heaven-King Buddha's final extinction, the true teaching shall endure in the world for twenty intermediate aeons. His entire body, in the form of relics, shall be enshrined in a great seven-jeweled stupa measuring sixty *yojanas* in height and forty *yojanas* in length and breadth.**

"All the celestial and human beings of that world shall pay reverence to this stupa with every kind of offering: flowers both fresh and fragrant, powdered incenses, aromatic oils, clothing, precious ornaments, banners, parasols, musical performances, and songs of praise. Through their worship and offerings to this seven-jeweled stupa, countless beings shall attain the state of arhat. Immeasurable beings shall realize the understanding of solitary enlightenment. And beyond measure, beings shall develop the aspiration for supreme enlightenment, attaining the non-regressing patience and becoming irreversibly established."[^6]

"In worlds yet to come, should any virtuous men or women hear this Devadatta chapter of the supreme Lotus Sutra, developing completely pure faith and reverence without doubt or suspicion, such beings shall not fall into the hells, shall not be reborn as hungry ghosts, shall not be born as animals. Rather, they shall be reborn in the presence of all the Buddhas in the ten directions. Wherever they are reborn, they shall constantly hear this supreme Dharma. If they are born among humans or celestial beings, they shall experience the most sublime and exquisite joys. If they are reborn in a Buddha's presence, they shall spontaneously manifest within a lotus flower, already in bloom.[^7]

---
## THE EMERGENCE OF MAÑJUŚRĪ: GATEWAY TO THE NĀGA PRINCESS
At that moment, from the lower realms below the assembly, the Buddha called Prabhūtaratna—who had been dwelling in the lower reaches of this world-system—sent forth one of his Bodhisattva attendants, named Wisdom-Accumulation, bearing a message. This Bodhisattva approached Prabhūtaratna and spoke:

"We should return to our original home realm."[^8]

But Śākyamuni Buddha addressed Wisdom-Accumulation, saying:

"Good child, wait a moment. There is here a Bodhisattva named Mañjuśrī, the Dharma-Prince. You should meet with him and engage in dialogue about the supreme Dharma. After this discussion, you may return to your home."[^9]

At that very moment, Mañjuśrī, the Bodhisattva of supreme wisdom, appeared, seated upon a thousand-petaled lotus flower as large as a great cart-wheel. Accompanying him were other Bodhisattvas, likewise seated upon precious lotus-thrones. From the depths of the vast ocean—from the palace of Sāgara, the Dragon-King—they spontaneously surged upward, remaining suspended in the empty air. They ascended toward Vulture Peak, where they descended from their lotus-thrones. Upon arriving at the Buddha's presence, all bowed with their heads to the ground, paying homage to the feet of both World-Honored Ones. Their acts of respect completed, they approached Wisdom-Accumulation and engaged in friendly discourse, then seated themselves to the side.

Wisdom-Accumulation then questioned Mañjuśrī:

"When you went to the Dragon-King's palace, how many living beings did you cause to awaken to enlightenment? Tell me the number."[^10]

Mañjuśrī replied:

"The number is immeasurable and incalculable. It exceeds what words can express and surpasses what the mind can comprehend. Wait but a moment, and you shall witness this directly yourself."[^11]

Before Mañjuśrī had even finished speaking, an immeasurable multitude of Bodhisattvas, seated upon precious lotus-thrones, surged forth from the ocean, ascending to Vulture Peak where they remained suspended in the empty sky. All of these Bodhisattvas were beings whom Mañjuśrī had caused to transform and awaken. They possessed the complete range of Bodhisattva practices. They all engaged together in discourse concerning the six transcendent perfections.[^12]

Among them were beings who had previously been listeners to the teaching—who had practiced as *śrāvakas* (those who hear the Buddha's voice). In the empty sky, they demonstrated the path of the listener. Yet now all of them are practicing the Great Vehicle understanding of emptiness. Mañjuśrī turned to Wisdom-Accumulation and proclaimed:

"This is how the awakening occurs within the ocean's depths. The work of transformation and liberation unfolds in this manner."[^13]

Wisdom-Accumulation, witnessing this extraordinary scene, expressed his admiration in verse, singing the praises of Mañjuśrī's accomplishments:

"O Mañjuśrī, possessing great wisdom, virtue, and courage!
You have awakened to enlightenment immeasurable multitudes.
We see here all these great assemblies,
And I myself have witnessed this transformation.

You illuminate the meaning of how things truly are,
You reveal and proclaim the One Buddha Vehicle,
You guide all sentient beings widely,
Leading them speedily toward supreme enlightenment."[^14]

Mañjuśrī then addressed Wisdom-Accumulation:

"In the ocean's depths, I have been continuously proclaiming this supreme Lotus Sutra. That is all I have done."[^15]

Wisdom-Accumulation then posed another question to Mañjuśrī:

"This teaching is profoundly subtle and wondrous—it is the treasure among all the sutras, a rarity in all the worlds. Tell me: are there any sentient beings who, through diligent practice and cultivation of this supreme Dharma, might swiftly attain Buddhahood?"[^16]

Mañjuśrī replied:

"There is indeed. There is the daughter of the Dragon-King Sāgara. She is only eight years old. Her wisdom is keen and her capacity to understand profound. She possesses complete knowledge of the past actions and present conditions of all sentient beings. She has attained the *dhāraṇī*—the capacity to hold all the profound secret teachings that all Buddhas have explained. She is able to retain all these teachings completely. She has entered deeply into *samādhi*—the meditative absorption of perfect clarity. She has penetrated understanding of all dharmas. In a single moment—in less time than it takes a thought to arise—she developed the aspiration for supreme enlightenment. She has attained the non-regressing patience, is irreversibly established, and possesses eloquence without obstruction. She contemplates all living beings with compassion, as a mother regards her beloved child. Her virtues are complete and perfect.[^17]

"When she speaks, her words manifest as both subtle and profound, both spacious and great. She overflows with compassion and forbearance, with gentleness and grace. She is capable of attaining enlightenment."[^18]

---
## THE CHALLENGE: ŚĀRIPUTRA'S DOUBT
Wisdom-Accumulation then expressed his hesitation:

"I have observed Śākyamuni Buddha—how for immeasurable eons he has engaged in difficult and painful practice, accumulating merit and virtue without interruption, seeking the path to enlightenment without ever ceasing. I have witnessed how, throughout the three-thousand-fold thousand-fold world-system, there is not a single place, not even the size of a mustard seed, where this Bodhisattva has not sacrificed body and life for the sake of sentient beings.**Only after such inconceivable accumulation of virtue over countless ages did he finally attain supreme, perfect enlightenment.**

"I find it difficult to believe that this young girl, within a brief moment, could suddenly achieve Buddhahood."[^19]

At that moment, before Wisdom-Accumulation had even finished speaking, the Dragon-King's daughter suddenly appeared before the assembly. She bowed with her head touching the feet of the Buddhas, then stood to the side. With great joy in her heart, she proclaimed her understanding in verse:

"I have deeply penetrated the nature of all offenses and all virtue.
I have illuminated with my light all ten directions.
My dharma-body is subtle and perfectly pure.
I possess the thirty-two marks of beauty,
Adorned with the eighty excellent characteristics.
All celestial and human beings bow before me.
All dragons and protective deities show me respect.
All classes of sentient beings venerate and honor me.
I have heard that Buddhahood is attained
Only through the Buddha's own realization.**I shall unfold the Great Vehicle teaching,
And liberate all suffering sentient beings.**"[^20]

At that very moment, the great elder Śāriputra—one of the Buddha's principal disciples—challenged the young princess:

"You say that you will swiftly attain the state of unsurpassed enlightenment, but this is difficult to believe. Why is this so? The female form is defiled and impure. It is not a proper vessel for dharma. How could you possibly attain supreme enlightenment?

"The Buddha's path is distant and difficult, requiring passage through immeasurable ages of arduous practice and virtue-accumulation before perfecting all transcendent perfections. Only then does one achieve Buddhahood.[^21]

"Moreover, the female body is subject to five great obstacles. First, a woman cannot become the ruler of Brahmā heaven. Second, she cannot become Śakra, king of the gods. Third, she cannot become a Māra-king. Fourth, she cannot become a wheel-turning monarch. And fifth, she cannot become a Buddha.[^22]

"**How could a female body swiftly achieve Buddhahood?**"[^23]

---
## THE INSTANTANEOUS DEMONSTRATION: ENLIGHTENMENT WITHOUT DELAY
The Dragon-King's daughter then possessed herself of a single precious jewel. This jewel had a value equal to the entire three-thousand-fold thousand-fold world-system.[^24] She presented this jewel as an offering to the Buddha. The Buddha immediately accepted it.[^25]

The Dragon-King's daughter then turned to Wisdom-Accumulation and Śāriputra and spoke these words:

"I have made an offering of this precious jewel to the World-Honored One, and the Buddha has accepted it. Tell me: did this occur quickly?"

"Yes," they answered, "it was accomplished with extraordinary speed."

The princess replied:

"By means of your supernatural vision, observe my attainment of Buddhahood. I shall accomplish it with even greater speed than this!"[^26]

In that very moment, before the entire assembly gathered there, the Dragon-King's daughter suddenly transformed. Her female form changed into the form of a male, possessing the complete practice of a Bodhisattva. In that instant, she journeyed toward the southern direction, toward the realm called Spotless Purity. There she seated herself upon a precious lotus-throne and achieved the state of supreme, perfect enlightenment—*anuttara-samyak-sambodhi*.[^27]

She then manifested the thirty-two marks of a Buddha and the eighty beautiful characteristics. She revealed her transformed dharma-body to all sentient beings in the ten directions, teaching the supreme Dharma universally to all beings in her assembly.[^28]

At that very moment, in the Sahā world, all the Bodhisattvas, listeners to the Buddha's voice, the eight classes of protective beings, humans, and non-humans—all perceived from a distance how the Dragon-King's daughter had attained Buddhahood and how she was teaching the Dharma universally for the benefit of all beings in her assembly. Their hearts filled with great joy, all turned their attention toward her and bowed in reverence from a great distance.[^29]

Immeasurable numbers of sentient beings heard the teaching and achieved perfect understanding. They attained the non-regressing patience, irreversibly established on the path to Buddhahood. Countless beings received a prophecy that they would attain supreme enlightenment. In the Spotless Pure realm, the earth itself shook and trembled six times with tremendous force.[^30]

In the Sahā world, three thousand living beings were established in the non-regressing stage. Three thousand sentient beings awakened the aspiration for supreme enlightenment and received the prophecy of future Buddhahood.[^31]

Wisdom-Accumulation the Bodhisattva, Śāriputra, and all the assembled multitude—all remained silent, completely accepting this demonstration.[^32]

---

**At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to express this meaning again, spoke in verse:

**DEVADATTA AND THE PATH OF ANTAGONISM****

I recall an ancient age,
A time before time began,
When seeking the Dharma true and great,
I made a solemn vow.

I was a monarch of the world,
Yet held no love for pleasures five.
I caused drums to sound forth,
Proclaiming to all directions:

"What king among the sages
Possesses the supreme Great Vehicle?
If one would teach to me
This most profound teaching,

Forever shall I bow to him,
Serving as his humble slave."
And there appeared a hermit-sage,
A mystic of great power.

"I possess," he spoke, "a Dharma
Called the Lotus Sutra wondrous-supreme.
Should you not rebel against my word,
I shall its teachings unfold."

The king, on hearing thus,
Felt overflowing joy arise.
At once he followed that hermit-sage,
Attending all his needs.

He gathered fruits and drew the water,
Collected firewood, prepared the meals.
He rendered his own body
To serve the sage as seat and rest.

Neither his body grew weary,
Nor weariness touched his mind.
For one thousand years thus serving,
He tended the sage with constant care,

All that he offered was lack—
Each need was fully met.
This he did for all beings,
Seeking the supreme and highest Dharma.

Not for his own body's sake,
Nor for the pleasures of the world,
Did this great king thus labor—
But to attain the Dharma supreme.

Through such seeking, he attained,
And in the end, the Buddha became.**Today, for your sake, I speak these teachings.**[^33]

The Buddha declared to the monks:

"The king in that age of old,
That was none other than myself.
The hermit-sage who taught him,
Is Devadatta in your time.

Because Devadatta served
As a good friend and guide to me,
I perfected the transcendent perfections six,
And every quality of Buddha-nature.

The four immeasurable states of mind,
The thirty-two marks so beautiful,
The eighty excellent characteristics,
All marks of Buddha-excellence.

The ten great powers I attained,
The four kinds of fearlessness supreme,
All methods by which I gather beings,
The eighteen qualities unique to Buddha.

All supernatural powers came to be,
And all the Buddha's transformative capacities—
All these I gained through serving
Devadatta as my teacher true.

Because this one served as guide,
I reached enlightenment complete.
The teaching spreads, all beings are uplifted,
Through Devadatta's role as good friend."[^34]**DEVADATTA'S PROPHECY**

In countless eons yet to come,
When ages unnumbered shall have passed,
Devadatta too shall attain
To perfect Buddhahood supreme.

The Buddha-name he shall receive,
Called Heaven-King Thus-Come-One,
Worthy of all offerings pure,
Perfectly awakened, complete in truth.

Possessed of wisdom, conduct perfect,
Well-gone and understander of all worlds,
Unsurpassed, the charioteer of beings,
Teacher of gods and human kinds.

In that Buddha's world-realm,
Named the Heavenly Way it shall be,
Devadatta the Buddha shall dwell,
For twenty intermediate ages.

He shall teach the Dharma supreme,
In breadth and depth complete,
And countless beings equal
To the sands of Ganges' river,

Shall attain the highest fruit,
The stage where no more learning waits.
Immeasurable beings shall awaken,
To the solitary, silent enlightenment.

And beings countless as sand-grains,
The Ganges' waters cannot number,
Shall develop the aspiration
For the supreme and highest way.

They shall attain the patience
That never turns away, never retreats.**For Devadatta, wrongdoer transformed,
Shall become a Buddha in his turn.**[^35]**THE NĀGA PRINCESS: IMPOSSIBLE ENLIGHTENMENT ACHIEVED**

There is, within the ocean's realm,
A dragon-king of mighty power.
His daughter, only eight years old,
Possesses wisdom keen and deep.

She understands the inclinations,
The past deeds of all beings living.
She has attained the *dhāraṇī*,
That comprehends what Buddhas teach.

She entered *samādhi* profound,
And penetrated all dharmas true.
In just the moment of a thought,
She raised the aspiration for enlightenment.

She never turns away from truth,
She possesses eloquence complete.
Her compassion flows for all beings,
Like a mother for her child.

The virtues of this dragon-girl,
Are perfected utterly complete.**Yet is she but eight years old,
And yet she shall become a Buddha.**[^36]**THE CHALLENGE AND THE PROOF**

The great one, Śāriputra wise,
Posed forth this challenge then:
"The Buddha, through countless eons,
Engaged in painful discipline.

He practiced what is truly hard,
Accumulated merit without end.
In all the great world-system vast,
Upon each smallest point of space,

He offered up his form and life,
For all the sentient beings' sake.
Through such incomparable effort,
Only then attained he Buddhahood.

How can this young girl, in a moment,
Achieve enlightenment supreme?
This is most difficult to believe,
Too sudden to accept as true."[^37]

But then the dragon-princess spoke,
And offered up a precious jewel.
The Buddha took it from her hands—
This treasure worth entire worlds.

"When I presented this gem,
How swift was its acceptance here?"
The elders answered: "Swift indeed,
Most swift and instantaneous."

The princess then replied to them:
"Watch now with supernatural sight,
And see me reach enlightenment,
With speed exceeding even this!

See me abandon female form,
See male Bodhisattva arise,
Watch as I travel to the south,
To realms of utmost purity.

There shall I sit on lotus throne,
And attain enlightenment complete,
With Buddha-marks and excellences,
Teaching all the Dharma pure."[^38]

All the assembly gathered there,
Perceived this demonstration strange and wondrous:
The princess became a Bodhisattva,
In that very moment transformed.

She journeyed to the southern lands,
To the realm of Spotless Pure,
And there before all beings living,
In all the ten directions wide,

She sat upon the lotus throne,
And achieved the Buddhahood supreme.
The thirty-two marks displayed,
The eighty excellent characteristics.

All beings in ten directions,
Perceived her Buddhahood manifest.
They heard her teaching spread,
The Dharma flowing without limit.

Each being felt great joy arise,
And bowed to her from distant lands.
Countless beings heard the truth,
And understanding came to be.

Many reached the non-regressing state,
The point where turning back is not.
Many received the prophecy,
Of Buddha-attainment yet to come.

The realm where she had taken seat,
The earth itself shook six times through.
And in the Sahā world of ours,
Three thousand sentient beings here,

Attained the non-regressing stage,
No longer subject unto turning-back.
And three thousand beings more,
Awakened the enlightenment-aspiration,

And all received the prophecy,
Of Buddhahood in times to come.**Thus does the Lotus Sutra prove,
That any being—none excepted—

Can reach the Buddha's state supreme,
Through the teaching of this way.**[^39]

# Chapter 13: Exhortation to Uphold

## THE BODHISATTVAS' VOWS: ACCEPTING THE TRANSMISSION
At that moment, the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva named Medicinal-King—a Great Being of extraordinary compassion—and the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva named Great-Joy-in-Speaking—possessing the voice of great proclamation—together with twenty thousand Bodhisattvas and their retinues, all stood before the Buddha and spoke this pledge:

"World Honored One, we implore you: do not concern yourself with anxiety or doubt. After your extinction, when you have entered into final *parinirvāṇa*, we shall uphold, read, recite, and explain this supreme Dharma-teaching. We shall preserve it, we shall practice it, we shall make offerings to it.

"In the future ages, in the times that are to come, sentient beings in the worlds that follow your passing will have become fewer in wholesome roots and deeper in unwholesome tendencies. Pride and conceit will multiply. They will cling to profit and honor, hungry for recognition and worship. They will increase in destructive, unhealthy dispositions, and they will drift far from liberation and awakening.

"**Though these beings are difficult to teach and transform, we shall arise with great patient endurance. We shall read this Dharma, we shall recite it, we shall explain it and teach it. We shall write it down and preserve it in written form. We shall make every kind of offering to it. We shall not spare our bodies and lives in this sacred work.**"[^1]

At that very moment, five hundred arhats who had received the prophecy of future Buddhahood stood before the Buddha and proclaimed:

"World Honored One, after your extinction, we also vow freely and openly that we shall travel to different lands and teach this supreme Dharma extensively throughout many realms."[^2]

Then eight thousand men and women practitioners—both monks and lay followers who had received the prophecy of Buddhahood—rose from their seats, bowed with hands joined in reverence before the Buddha, and made this vow:

"World Honored One, we too vow freely to teach this supreme Dharma in lands different from our own, spreading it extensively through many realms. Why do we make this pledge? It is because in this Sahā world-realm, the beings are of base character, prone to corruption and destructive conduct. They are filled with prideful arrogance and conceit. Their wholesome roots are shallow and sparse. They are filled with anger, hatred, and filthy, twisted thoughts. Their minds are not straightforward and authentic in seeking the truth.[^3]

"For this reason, we shall undertake the burden of spreading this teaching throughout the worlds to come."[^4]

---
## THE BUDDHA'S AUNT AND THE WOMEN DISCIPLES
At that time, the Buddha's aunt, the Bhikṣuṇī Mahāprajāpatī—the great grandmother-mother of all Buddhist nuns—along with six thousand nuns, both learners and established adepts, rose from their seats. In perfect unison, they joined their hands in deep reverence, their eyes fixed constantly upon the Buddha's face without ever turning away. At that moment, the World Honored One turned his attention to the nun Gautamī and spoke:

"Why do you gaze upon me with such an expression of concern? Is your heart troubled, wondering perhaps whether I have not proclaimed your name among those receiving the prophecy of Buddhahood?"[^5]

The Buddha then addressed the assembled nuns:

"Gautamī, I have already proclaimed universally that all sentient beings endowed with Buddha-nature shall receive the prophecy of Buddhahood. When you now seek to know what future awaits you, you shall learn this: In the worlds yet to come, in ages beyond counting,**you shall become a Great Teacher of the Dharma before six hundred and eighty billion Buddhas.** Along with your six thousand nun-disciples, all of you together shall serve as Great Teachers of the Dharma.

"By gradually accumulating the Bodhisattva path in this manner, you shall perfect all qualities and become yourself a Buddha. Your Buddha-name shall be**'She Who Brings Joy to All Living Beings Thus-Come-One'**—the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened One, possessed of wisdom and conduct, the Well-Gone One, the Understander of the World, the Unsurpassed One, the Controller of Beings, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.

"Gautamī, these six thousand nuns together with you shall all progressively receive the prophecy of Buddhahood, achieving supreme enlightenment."[^6]

At that moment, the Bhikṣuṇī Rāhula's mother, the woman named Yaśodharā, had a troubling thought. She reflected: "Among all these prophecies and declarations of future Buddhahood, how is it that the World Honored One has not proclaimed my name?"[^7]

The Buddha then addressed Yaśodharā directly:

"In the worlds yet to come, in ages beyond all count, you shall cultivate the Bodhisattva path before countless Buddhas—before hundreds, thousands, millions, and billions of them. You shall become a Great Teacher of the Dharma, gradually perfecting the complete Bodhisattva way. In a good and wholesome world-realm, you shall attain Buddhahood yourself. Your Buddha-name shall be**'Possessing a Hundred Thousand Ten-Million Radiant Marks Thus-Come-One'**—the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened One, possessed of wisdom and conduct, the Well-Gone One, the Understander of the World, the Unsurpassed One, the Controller of Beings, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. The lifespan of that Buddha shall extend through numberless immeasurable eons."[^8]

At that time, both Bhikṣuṇī Mahāprajāpatī and the woman Yaśodharā—together with all their disciples—experienced great joy. They had encountered what they had never encountered before. Immediately, they expressed their happiness in verse, proclaiming before the Buddha:

"World Honored One, our Guide and Teacher,
You who bring peace and security to gods and humans,
We have heard the declaration of our future Buddhahood,
And our hearts are now complete and fully satisfied.

The names we shall bear in ages yet to come—
We shall become Buddhas, and at that time,
All the highest heavens and the human realms shall hear our teaching.
We shall protect and nurture all who come to us with trust."[^9]

After the nuns spoke these verses, they addressed the Buddha:

"World Honored One, we too are able to teach and proclaim this supreme Dharma extensively in other lands and in worlds yet to come."[^10]

---
## THE BODHISATTVAS' GREAT VOWS
At that moment, the World Honored One gazed out at eighty million billions of countless Bodhisattva Mahāsattvas. These Bodhisattvas were all of them Avaivartikas—those who have attained the irreversible stage, those who turn the wheel of irreversible dharma, those who have obtained all the *dhāraṇī*s, the capacities to remember and manifest all teachings without obstruction.[^11]

These Bodhisattvas rose from their seats and approached the Buddha. With a single unified intention, they joined their palms together in reverence. In their minds, they generated this thought:**"If the World Honored One commands us to uphold and teach this supreme Dharma, we shall follow the Buddha's instruction, spreading this teaching far and wide throughout all the realms."**

Yet another thought arose within them:**"But the Buddha now stands in silence, offering no explicit command. What then is his intention? How shall we respond?"**[^12]

At that moment, these Bodhisattvas, respecting the Buddha's will and wishing to fulfill their own original vows, stood before the Buddha and roared forth their lion-vow. With a great roar of determination, they proclaimed their pledge:

"World Honored One, we do not require your command. After your extinction, we shall journey throughout the ten directions, moving back and forth in all worlds. We shall enable sentient beings to write down this supreme Dharma, to receive it, to read it, to recite it, to understand its meanings, and to practice it according to the teachings. They shall abide in right understanding and mindfulness—and all of this shall be accomplished through the power and grace of the Buddha.

"We humbly beseech the World Honored One: watch over us from other worlds, protecting us from afar through your supernatural vision and wisdom-power."[^13]

At that very moment, all the Bodhisattvas together proclaimed their determination in verse:

"Do not harbor concern or anxiety,
After the Buddha's passage into *parinirvāṇa*,
In this dark and dangerous age to come,
We shall teach this Dharma widely.

There will be those of no wisdom,
Who hurl angry words of curse and blame,
And those who come with violent weapons,
Against whom we shall exercise patience.

In the evil times ahead, there will be monks,
Possessed of twisted, perverted minds,
Who say they have attained what they have not,
Whose hearts are swollen with arrogant pride.

Or some who retreat into hermitages,
Wearing patched and ragged robes,
Who claim to practice the true path,
Looking down upon those dwelling in the world.

Driven by love of profit and gain,
They teach the Dharma to those of worldly power,
And are revered by the world like *arhats* of six powers,
Yet they harbor evil intentions.

They constantly contemplate worldly affairs,
These so-called forest dwellers of hollow name,
And they take delight in revealing our faults,
Speaking thus of us before the multitudes:

'These monks practice for profit and gain!
Their teachings are not from the Buddha,
They have invented this Sutra themselves,
To mislead and deceive the world!

They seek fame and reputation thereby,
These monks of twisted intentions.'
Making such accusations against us,
They separate themselves from the assembly.

In this evil age ahead, such are the accusations.
Yet we shall endure all such hostility,
For we deeply respect the Buddha's will,
And shall withstand whatever hardships come.

We shall wear the armor of patient endurance,
And bear witness to this Dharma,
Through all the suffering and danger,
Across this difficult and defiled age.

We do not love our bodies or our lives,
But treasure infinitely the supreme path.
In the ages yet to come, we shall
Guard what the Buddha has entrusted to us.

We are the messengers of the World Honored One,
Working in the midst of multitudes without fear.
We shall teach the Dharma with skillful means,
And pray that the Buddha find peace and rest.

Before the World Honored One,
Before all Buddhas coming from ten directions,
We make this solemn vow here,
For the Buddha's own understanding alone.

All the Bodhisattvas throughout the cosmos,
Know the sincerity of our hearts today.
We shall protect what the Buddha has entrusted—
The Buddha himself already understands our minds."[^14]

# Chapter 14: The Bodhisattva's Peaceful Ways of Practice

## THE FOUR CONDITIONS FOR SAFE DHARMA-TEACHING
At that time, Mañjuśrī, the Bodhisattva of supreme wisdom and the Dharma-Prince, addressed the Buddha:

"World Honored One, these Bodhisattvas are indeed most extraordinary, rarely encountered. They possess great respect for the Buddha and profound commitment. They generate great vows for the future. In those evil ages to come, they wish to teach and proclaim this supreme Lotus Sutra.

"World Honored One, how shall these Bodhisattva Mahāsattvas, in those evil ages yet to come, be enabled to teach this supreme Sutra? How shall they do so with confidence and without timidity?"[^1]

The Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī:

"If any Bodhisattva Mahāsattva desires to teach this supreme Lotus Sutra in the evil ages yet to come, they must dwell firmly established in four essential practices. What are these four?**First: Establishing oneself in the Bodhisattva's dwelling-place and associations.**

Mañjuśrī, if a Bodhisattva Mahāsattva wishes to teach this supreme Sutra in the evil ages, they must establish themselves upon the ground of patience, becoming gentle, yielding, and harmonious. Their heart shall not be suddenly startled or disturbed by difficulties. Moreover, regarding all teachings, they shall not practice attachment or discrimination. Rather, they shall perceive all dharmas as they truly are—not inverted, not unstable, not regressing, not transforming—remaining like empty space, possessing nothing whatsoever.[^2]

"Mañjuśrī, what is meant by 'the Bodhisattva's association' or proper companions? It means the Bodhisattva shall not associate closely with kings, princes, ministers, or officials. They shall not keep company with those who practice false teachings, heretics, or various ascetics. They shall not spend time with those who create worldly compositions glorifying other texts. They shall not befriend those who practice destructive amusements or wrestling matches and various entertainments.[^3]

"Furthermore, they shall not associate with those of base caste—hunters, butchers, those engaged in harmful livelihoods—nor shall they maintain close relationships with such people. If any such people come to them, they shall teach the Dharma without expectation of gain.

"They shall not associate with monks or nuns who seek the listener's path, nor with lay practitioners. They shall not dwell together in the same place, nor speak together often. If any such people come to them, they shall teach the Dharma as circumstances require, without seeking anything in return.[^4]

"Mañjuśrī, regarding women: the Bodhisattva shall not look upon women's bodies as objects of desire when teaching them the Dharma. They shall not delight in viewing women's forms. When entering a household, the Bodhisattva shall not speak with young girls, unmarried women, or widows. They shall not become intimate with the five kinds of gender-ambiguous persons. They shall not enter another's household alone. If there is some pressing reason to enter a house alone, the Bodhisattva shall focus the mind entirely upon the Buddha.[^5]

"When teaching the Dharma to women, the Bodhisattva shall not display their teeth in smiling, shall not expose their chest or inner garments. Even for the sake of the Dharma, they shall not become intimate with women—how much less so for other matters. The Bodhisattva shall not delight in keeping young disciples, novice monks, or children as attendants, nor shall they wish to study together with fellow disciples under the same master.

"The Bodhisattva shall constantly delight in sitting in meditation, remaining in quiet, secluded places, gathering and controlling their mind. Mañjuśrī, these practices constitute what is called the Bodhisattva's associations.[^6]**Second: The Bodhisattva's intellectual and spiritual cultivation.**

"Moreover, Mañjuśrī, the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva should observe all dharmas as empty. They should perceive their true nature—not inverted, not moving, not regressing, not transforming—as entirely resembling empty space, possessing no nature whatsoever.

"All verbal and conceptual elaborations shall cease. They shall not be born, shall not emerge, shall not arise. They shall possess no name, no characteristic. In truth, they possess nothing whatsoever. They are immeasurable, boundless, without obstacle or impediment. They exist only through causes and conditions; they arise from inverted thinking; therefore, they are taught.[^7]

"The Bodhisattva shall always delight in observing dharmas in this manner—this is called the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva's second form of dwelling, the second place of proper association.**Third: The peaceful way of proclaiming the Dharma.**

"Mañjuśrī, after my extinction, in the final age of the Dharma, those who wish to teach this supreme Sutra must practice the peaceful way of expression. When speaking or reading the Sutra, they shall not delight in discussing others' faults or the Sutra's faults. They shall not look down upon other dharma-teachers with contempt. They shall not speak of others' strengths and weaknesses, their merits and defects.[^8]

"Regarding listeners of the Buddha's voice: they shall not speak their names when discussing their faults. They shall not speak their names when praising their virtues. Neither shall they harbor resentment or hostility toward any being. Because they have cultivated this peaceful mind, all those who listen to them shall not oppose their intention.[^9]

"When some listener poses a difficult question, the Bodhisattva shall not answer with the listener's limited understanding. Rather, they shall answer only through the perspective of the Great Vehicle, enabling all listeners to awaken the aspiration for supreme enlightenment and eventually attain all-knowing wisdom.[^10]

"The Bodhisattva shall not be lazy or slack. They shall not harbor worries or disturbances. They shall teach the Dharma with a compassionate heart. Day and night, they shall constantly proclaim the supreme teaching of the Buddha. Through various causes and conditions, through numberless parables and illustrations, they shall illuminate the teachings so that all sentient beings rejoice.[^11]

"The Bodhisattva's garments, bedding, food, and medicines—regarding all these material supports, they shall harbor no hope of gain. They shall focus only upon the intention to teach the Dharma. They shall desire to attain the Buddha-way and to enable all sentient beings to accomplish the same. This is called the supreme and peaceful offering.[^12]

"In the Buddha's final age, when any monk or nun is able to proclaim this supreme Lotus Sutra—if their heart is free from jealousy, hatred, resentment, and all mental obstacles, free from worry and sorrow, free from being cursed or condemned, and free from the threat of violence or weapons—such a person shall dwell in the peaceful way as I have described.[^13]

"By cultivating such peaceful practice, the teacher shall encounter no one who creates disturbances. They shall find good fellow-practitioners with whom to study this Sutra together. They shall obtain a great assembly who come to listen. Those who listen shall be able to retain the teaching, able to recite it, able to explain it, able to proclaim it, able to write it down. If they cause others to write it, they shall respect and honor the written text, shall praise and glorify it.**Fourth: The cultivation of compassion and proper regard.**

"Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva in the Buddha's final age, when the Dharma is about to perish, whoever preserves this Lotus Sutra shall generate great compassion toward all sentient beings, whether lay or ordained. They shall generate great compassion toward those who are not Bodhisattvas. They should reflect thus: 'This is what such beings lack. The Tathāgata has taught the teachings through skillful methods adapted to conditions, yet these beings do not hear, do not understand, do not awaken, and do not seek to understand this Sutra. Their loss is great.[^14]

"'Although these beings have not questioned the teachings, have not sought faith, have not sought understanding, when I attain supreme enlightenment, I shall, through supernatural power and wisdom-power, draw all such beings and enable them to dwell in this Dharma.'

"Mañjuśrī, the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva should generate this kind of compassionate reflection toward all sentient beings. The Bodhisattva should regard all Buddhas with the attitude of a most devoted child toward a father. The Bodhisattva should regard all Bodhisattvas with the attitude of a most devoted student toward a great teacher. The Bodhisattva should regard all sentient beings with universal equanimous compassion.[^15]

"When maintaining and reading this Sutra, they shall practice the way of peaceful, pleasurable proclamation. What does this mean? It means: cultivating a quality of gentleness in one's manner. Preparing a pure place for teaching. Providing a cushioned seat. Bathing the body and dressing in clean clothes. When any listener comes—whether monks, nuns, male lay practitioners, female lay practitioners, kings, princes, citizens, or brahmins—the Bodhisattva shall teach with subtle profundity and a gentle expression.[^16]

"If a listener poses a difficult question, the Bodhisattva shall respond according to the meaning, employing causes and conditions, parables and illustrations, in detailed explanation, enabling all who listen to awaken the aspiration for enlightenment and gradually enter the Buddha-way. This person's virtue and merit, across countless eons, cannot be fully calculated or described.[^17]

"In the Buddha's final age, if a monk or nun is capable of proclaiming this supreme Lotus Sutra—if their mind is free of jealousy, hatred, and all obstacles, if they are without worry or sorrow, if they endure mockery and rejection, maintaining patience—such a person has already established themselves in the peaceful way as I have described. Such a being's merit and virtue, throughout countless and immeasurable eons, cannot be exhausted through enumeration or comparison.[^18]

"It is as when a king of great power, desiring to subdue all other kingdoms, gathers all his generals and troops, and when he perceives among the warriors some of great courage and strength who have achieved significant victories, he becomes filled with great delight. To these victorious ones, he grants whatever they desire: lands, cities, villages, or precious garments, jewels, gold, silver, coral, pearls, precious stones, and all kinds of treasures. Yet there is one thing: the luminous pearl worn in the crown upon the king's head—this single pearl he has never given to anyone.[^19]

"Why is this? Because the king alone possesses this one pearl. There is no second pearl like it. If he were to give it to his soldiers and attendants, all his queens and concubines would be astonished and disturbed.

"The Tathāgata is exactly like this. The Tathāgata, through meditation-power and wisdom-power, has obtained the dharma-realm and rules over the three worlds, conquering all māras and demons. The Tathāgata's worthy disciples and noble saints have battled against the five-aggregates-demon, the defilements-demon, and the death-demon, achieving great victories and destroying the three poisons, escaping the three worlds, breaking the nets of māra.[^20]

"The Tathāgata, seeing such victorious warriors, becomes greatly delighted. The Tathāgata, among the multitude of listeners, teaches various dharmas, grants them meditation-attainment, liberation, and the supernatural powers of the undefiled path. The Tathāgata grants them the meditation-palaces and the cities of *parinirvāṇa*, speaking to them of the attainment of extinction, causing all to rejoice.

"Yet the Tathāgata does not teach this Lotus Sutra. Why not?**This Lotus Sutra is the highest among all teachings that the Tathāgata has proclaimed throughout the three times—past, present, and future.**[^21]

"The Sutra possesses the capacity to bring all sentient beings to the state of all-knowing wisdom. The realm where the Sutra is taught is one of many enemies and difficulty—a world where beings harbor great suspicion and distrust. Yet now, the Tathāgata, beholding the great deeds of these Bodhisattva-warriors who have vowed to uphold and teach this Sutra in such hostile times, becomes greatly delighted.

"This supreme Lotus Sutra—which can enable sentient beings to attain all-knowing wisdom, which all the Buddhas throughout the three times have proclaimed—is now given to these Bodhisattvas. It is like the king who finally grants the crown jewel to those who have achieved supreme victory.[^22]

"Therefore, Mañjuśrī, those Bodhisattvas who uphold this Sutra are the Tathāgata's most precious treasure. Know them to be the Buddha's children. Know them to be the most honored among all beings.

"How much more so: those Bodhisattvas who can read, recite, remember, understand, teach, and proclaim this Sutra—such beings, enduring abuse and rejection, maintaining patient forbearance—such beings are establishing themselves in the peaceful way of practice as I have described."[^23]

---

**At that time, the World Honored One, wishing to elaborate further upon this teaching, spoke in verse:

**THE FOUR PEACEFUL PRACTICES****

If one desires to teach this supreme Dharma,
In the evil age yet to come,
One must dwell with no fearful heart,
And wish to proclaim this teaching.

To enter the Bodhisattva's dwelling place
And proper associations pure,
One must always remain in patience,
Gentle, harmonious, without sudden disturbance.

# Chapter 15: The Emergence of Bodhisattvas from the Earth

## THE COSMIC DISCLOSURE: INFINITE DISCIPLES APPEAR
At that moment, the Bodhisattva Mahāsattvas from countless worlds beyond—more numerous than the sands of eight Ganges Rivers—rose from their seats. With joined palms in reverence, they addressed the Buddha:

"World Honored One, if you would grant us permission, after your extinction we shall remain in this Sahā world-realm. We shall diligently apply ourselves with great care and effort. We shall uphold, read, recite, write, and make offerings to this supreme Sutra. We shall proclaim it extensively throughout this realm."[^1]

At that moment, the World Honored One addressed all the assembled Bodhisattva Mahāsattvas:

"Stop, good children. There is no need for you to protect and preserve this teaching. Why is this so?**In my Sahā world-realm, there are already six hundred thousand Ganges' worth of Bodhisattva Mahāsattvas.** Each of these Bodhisattvas possesses six hundred thousand Ganges' worth of attendants and retinues.[^2]

"All of these beings shall be able, after my extinction, to protect, read, recite, and extensively teach this supreme Sutra."[^3]

---
## THE EARTH RESPONDS: THE COSMIC ASSEMBLY EMERGES
At the moment the Buddha spoke these words,**the entire three-thousand-fold thousand-fold world-system trembled and split open.** From within the fissures, there emerged without number countless millions upon millions of Bodhisattva Mahāsattvas—**an utterly immeasurable multitude, all rising forth simultaneously from beneath this very Sahā world-realm.**

All of these Bodhisattvas manifested bodies of golden radiance. Each possessed the thirty-two marks of a Buddha. Each was surrounded by measureless light. They had been dwelling in the empty space beneath this Sahā world-realm, and from their dwelling-places they rose upward.[^4]

These Bodhisattvas, hearing the voice of Śākyamuni Buddha speaking from above, emerged from below. Each of these Bodhisattvas served as a leader and guide directing multitudes. Each brought with them six hundred thousand Ganges' worth of attendants. And yet even those bringing "only" five hundred thousand Ganges of retinues, or four hundred thousand, three hundred thousand, two hundred thousand, or one hundred thousand Ganges' worth—those bringing fifty thousand, ten thousand, one thousand, one hundred, fifty, thirty, twenty, ten, five, four, three, two, or even just a single disciple—and those coming entirely alone, who delighted in solitary practice—**all such beings without number, beyond the power of calculation to encompass, came forth.[^5]

These Bodhisattvas, having emerged from the earth, proceeded to the empty space where the seven-jeweled stupa containing Prabhūtaratna Buddha and Śākyamuni Buddha sat suspended. Upon arriving, they bowed with their heads to the ground before both World-Honored Ones. They also made reverent obeisance to all the Buddhas seated beneath the precious trees upon their lion-thrones in all eight directions. Three times they circumambulated these Buddhas, with joined palms in reverent respect.

They praised the Buddhas using all manner of Bodhisattva-glorification, expressing their profound reverence. Then they stood to one side, their hearts delighting in gazing upon the two World-Honored Ones.**These Bodhisattvas Mahāsattvas, from the moment they emerged, praised the Buddha using all manner of Bodhisattva-glorification. This continued for fifty minor eons. During this entire time, Śākyamuni Buddha sat in silence, and all the assembled four kinds of beings also remained in silence for fifty minor eons.** Yet through the Buddha's supernatural power, all the great assembly perceived the passage of time as only half a day. The four kinds of beings, through the Buddha's supernatural power, perceived these Bodhisattvas filling without limit hundreds of thousands of millions of worlds throughout the three-thousand-fold thousand-fold world-system, suspended in the empty space.[^6]

---
## THE FOUR LEADER BODHISATTVAS: INQUIRY AND RECOGNITION
Among this Bodhisattva multitude, there were four foremost guide-leaders:

**Anantaviśiṣṭa** (Boundless Superior Conduct / *Wubian xing* )

**Sthiraviśiṣṭa** (Stable Conduct / *Anliixing* )[^8]

These four Bodhisattvas were the most foremost leaders and guides within the assembled multitude. Standing before the great assembly, they joined their palms together and gazed upon Śākyamuni Buddha, respectfully inquiring:

"World Honored One, are you in health and ease? Do you experience few ailments and minor troubles? Are the sentient beings whom you have undertaken to teach receptive to instruction? Do our efforts to teach bring you no weariness or fatigue?"[^9]

At that moment, the four great Bodhisattvas expressed their inquiry in verse:

"The World Honored One abides in peace and ease,
Experiencing few ailments and minor troubles.
The sentient beings whom you teach find transformation easy,
And your sacred effort brings no weariness or exhaustion to you."[^10]

---
## THE BUDDHA'S REVELATION: THE ANCIENT DISCIPLES
At that moment, Śākyamuni Buddha addressed the assembled Bodhisattva multitude:

"**Yes, precisely so. Yes, precisely so, good children. The Tathāgata is at ease, with few ailments and minor troubles. All sentient beings are easy to transform and teach, and there is no weariness in my work.**

"Why is this so?**It is because all these sentient beings, throughout innumerable eons, have constantly received my teaching.** They have also shown respect and reverence to the Buddhas of past ages, and they have planted countless good roots. These sentient beings, upon seeing my form and hearing the teachings I proclaim, immediately receive them with faith and enter into the wisdom of the Tathāgata.[^11]

"Except for those who previously studied and practiced the limited teachings of the small vehicle—**even these beings I now enable to hear this supreme Sutra and to enter into the Buddha-wisdom.**"[^12]

At that moment, all the great Bodhisattvas expressed their gratitude in verse:

"Excellent, excellent, great mighty World Honored One!
The sentient beings are easy to transform and teach.
They can question the Buddha regarding the deepest wisdom,
And having heard, they trust and practice accordingly.
We rejoice in all of this."[^13]

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha praised the foremost Bodhisattvas:

"Excellent, excellent, good children. You are all capable of generating hearts of rejoicing regarding the Tathāgata's teaching."[^14]

---
## THE ASSEMBLY'S PERPLEXITY: WHERE DID THESE COME FROM?
At that moment, the Bodhisattva Maitreya and eight thousand Ganges' worth of Bodhisattva-multitudes all generated the same profound thought in their minds:

"We have never seen, never heard, during all the time we have traveled throughout worlds and realms, of such a vast assembly of great Bodhisattva Mahāsattvas emerging from the earth, standing before the World Honored One with joined palms, making offerings and respectful inquiry."[^15]

At that time, the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Maitreya, understanding the thoughts that all eight thousand Ganges' worth of Bodhisattvas were contemplating, and wishing to resolve his own doubt, joined his palms together before the Buddha. Using verse, he questioned:

"Innumerable hundreds of thousands of millions,
Vast assembly of these great Bodhisattvas—
Beings we have never seen before in any age,
We pray, O One with Two Feet Most Honored, that you explain:

From where have these beings come?
Through what causes and conditions did they gather?
Their bodies possess immense majesty,
Their supernatural powers are inconceivable,
Their aspirations are firmly established,
Possessed of great patience and forbearance,
Pleasing to perceive by all sentient beings—
Tell us from where they originally came.

Each of these Bodhisattvas
Brings countless retinue-companions,
Numbers immeasurable as the Ganges' sands,
Some bringing six hundred thousand Ganges-multitudes.

Some great Bodhisattvas bring five hundred thousand,
Four hundred thousand, three hundred thousand, two hundred thousand,
One hundred thousand, ten thousand, one thousand,
One hundred, fifty, ten—

Even down to those bringing a single disciple,
And those who come alone, delighting in solitude—
Such numbers if one were to attempt to count,
Using even the measure of a Ganges-measuring rod,
Through immeasurable eons of counting,
Could never be exhausted or determined.

These Bodhisattvas of great spiritual power,
With intense vigor and concentrated aspiration—
Whose teaching have they received?
Who has educated and established them?
Whose Dharma have they accepted?
Whose Buddhist path do they cultivate?

These great Bodhisattvas,
With supernatural powers and wisdom inconceivable—
The four directions of the earth have opened,
And all have emerged forth from within.

World Honored One, in all the time I have journeyed,
I have never witnessed such an occurrence.
We pray that you reveal their origin,
And tell us the names of the lands they come from.

I have always traveled through many realms,
Yet I have never encountered this assembly.
Among all these Bodhisattvas here present,
There is not a single one I recognize.

They emerge suddenly from the earth—
We pray that you explain the cause and reason.
This great assembly gathered here
Is immeasurable, numbering hundreds and thousands of millions.

All these Bodhisattva-beings wish to know
The beginning and end of their story, their causes and conditions.
O World Honored One of immeasurable virtue,
We pray that you resolve this doubt for us all."[^16]

---
## THE BUDDHA'S IMPLICIT ANSWER: "These are my disciples whom I have taught"
At that moment, all the division-bodies of Śākyamuni Buddha—all those who sat beneath the precious trees on lion-thrones in the eight cardinal directions throughout countless Buddha-lands—heard the Buddha's voice declaring how this vast multitude had emerged.[^17]

The attendants of each of these Buddhas perceived this immense assembly of Bodhisattvas filling the three-thousand-fold thousand-fold world-system, emerging from the earth and suspending themselves in the empty space. The attendants of each Buddha asked their respective Buddha-lord:

"World Honored One, from where have come all these immeasurable, incalculable multitudes of great Bodhisattvas?"[^18]

At that moment, each Buddha instructed their attendants:

"Good children, wait but a moment. There is a great Bodhisattva Mahāsattva named Maitreya, who has received a prophecy from Śākyamuni Buddha that he shall become a Buddha in the next age. He has already posed this very question to the Buddha. The Buddha shall now answer it, and you shall hear the response through his words."[^19]

---
## THE BUDDHA ADDRESSES MAITREYA: REVEALING THE DISCIPLES
At that moment, Śākyamuni Buddha addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva, saying:

"Excellent, excellent, Ajita (O Maitreya)! You have posed to the Buddha a matter of great significance. All of you gathered here should now unite in a single-pointed mind. Put on the armor of diligent effort. Establish a firm and unshakable resolve.[^20]

"**The Tathāgata now wishes to reveal and proclaim the wisdom of all Buddhas, the absolute freedom and supernatural powers of all Buddhas, the lion's roar-power of all Buddhas, and the fierce and mighty dignity of all Buddhas.**"[^21]

At that moment, the World Honored One, wishing to elaborate further upon this teaching, spoke in verse:

"Gather all your strength and concentrate your minds,
I wish to tell you something of ultimate significance.
Do not allow any doubt or regret to arise—
The Buddha's wisdom is beyond all conceptualization.

You should manifest the power of faith,
Dwell in patience and the wholesome state.
What you have never heard before,
You shall now hear completely.

I now reassure and encourage you:
Do not harbor doubt or fear.
The Buddha speaks only what is true,
And Buddha-wisdom is immeasurable.

The supreme Dharma that was attained
Is most subtle and beyond discrimination.
This is what I shall now teach—
Listen together with undivided attention."[^22]

At the moment the Buddha completed this verse, he addressed Maitreya Bodhisattva, saying:

"I now proclaim to all of you here, O Ajita (Maitreya).**These great Bodhisattva Mahāsattvas—immeasurable, incalculable, inconceivable multitudes whom you have never previously seen—these are all Bodhisattvas whom I have educated and transformed, to whom I have taught the Dharma after I attained supreme, perfect enlightenment in this Sahā world-realm.**

"I have guided and trained their minds, causing them to generate the determination to pursue the path to enlightenment.**All these Bodhisattvas dwell beneath the surface of this Sahā world-realm, in the empty space within the earth itself.** They thoroughly master the meaning of all sutras, they contemplate and discriminate the teachings, and they maintain correct mindfulness.[^23]

"O Ajita, these good children do not delight in dwelling in crowds, they do not enjoy engaging in excessive speaking. They constantly delight in quiet, solitary places, they apply themselves with vigorous diligence, and they never pause in their endeavor. They do not rely upon or dwell attached to heavenly beings or humans. They constantly delight in profound wisdom, which encounters no obstacles. They also constantly delight in the teachings of all Buddhas, they apply themselves with undivided focus, and they seek the supreme, unsurpassed wisdom."[^24]

At that moment, Śākyamuni Buddha, wishing to express this teaching in verse form, spoke:

"O Ajita, understand this clearly:
These are the great Bodhisattvas
Who have cultivated Buddha-wisdom
Throughout innumerable eons.

All of them are those whom I have transformed,
To whom I have taught the aspiration for supreme enlightenment.
These are my children,
Dwelling and relying upon this world.

They constantly engage in ascetic practice,
Delighting in quiet, solitary places,
Abandoning the tumultuous crowds,
Not desiring to speak excessively.

Like students of my Dharma-teaching,
These children practice and study my path,
Day and night maintaining vigorous effort,
Seeking the path to supreme enlightenment.

In the empty space beneath the Sahā world,
They dwell and remain established,
Their resolve firm and their determination unshakable,
Ever diligently seeking wisdom.

Teaching the Dharma with infinite subtlety,
Their hearts harboring no fear.

At Gayā's holy site,
Beneath the Bodhi tree,
I attained the most perfect enlightenment,
And turned the wheel of supreme Dharma.

It was then that I taught them,
Inspiring them to generate the determination for enlightenment.
Now all of them dwell in the stage of non-regression,
And they shall all attain Buddhahood.

I now speak what is true:
You should all have faith and believe.
I have cultivated and taught these beings
For very long ages indeed."[^25]

---

# Chapter 16: The Tathāgata's Eternal Lifespan

## THE TRIPLE REQUEST: PREPARING FOR REVELATION
At that moment, the Buddha addressed all the Bodhisattvas and the entire great assembly:

"Good children, you must now have complete faith in the Tathāgata's truthful words."

A second time, he addressed the great assembly:

"Good children, you must now have complete faith in the Tathāgata's truthful words."

A third time, he addressed the great assembly:

"Good children, you must now have complete faith in the Tathāgata's truthful words."[^1]

At that moment, the assembled Bodhisattva multitudes, with Maitreya at the fore, joined their palms before the Buddha and spoke:

"World Honored One, we only pray that you will teach us. We shall place complete faith in the Buddha's words."

They made this request once. Again they spoke:

"World Honored One, we only pray that you will teach us. We shall place complete faith in the Buddha's words."[^2]

---
## THE REVELATION: THE BUDDHA'S INCONCEIVABLE LIFESPAN
At that moment, the World Honored One, knowing that the Bodhisattvas had made three requests without ceasing, addressed them, saying:

"Listen carefully to what I shall now reveal to you:**the Tathāgata's secret and supernatural power.** All the beings in the worlds—celestial and human, as well as asuras—believe and imagine that the present Śākyamuni Buddha left the Śākya palace, departed from the Śākya clan, traveled not far from the city of Gayā, sat upon the enlightenment seat, and there attained supreme, perfect enlightenment.[^3]

"**But hear this truth, good children: I have in reality been a Buddha for an immeasurable, incalculable number of eons—far beyond what could be expressed as hundred, thousand, ten-thousand, million, billion *asamkhyeya* eons of time.**[^4]

---
## THE MATHEMATICAL PARABLE: WORLDS AS DUST PARTICLES
"Let me give you an illustration, good children. Suppose there existed five hundred thousand million billion *asamkhyeya* three-thousand-fold thousand-fold world-systems. Further suppose someone were to grind all these worlds into fine dust-particles. And suppose this person were to journey eastward, dropping one particle of dust as they passed through five hundred thousand million billion *asamkhyeya* worlds, continuing eastward until they had exhausted all the dust.

"What do you think, good children? Would it be possible to calculate, to measure, to determine the number of all these worlds?"[^5]

Maitreya Bodhisattva and all the assembled Bodhisattvas spoke to the Buddha in unison:

"World Honored One, these worlds are immeasurable, incalculable, limitless. They exceed what can be computed through numbers, exceed what the mind can grasp. Even the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, employing undefiled wisdom, cannot fathom the boundaries of these worlds. We Bodhisattvas, dwelling in the stage of non-regression, are likewise unable to comprehend the limit of such worlds. O World Honored One, all these worlds are innumerable and boundless."[^6]

At that moment, the Buddha told the assembled Bodhisattvas:

"Good children, now I shall make clear to you:

**Among all those worlds—whether those where dust has settled and those where it has not—if all these were converted into dust-particles, and one particle represented one eon, then the number of eons since I attained Buddhahood would exceed this calculation by hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of *asamkhyeya* eons.** [^7]

"**From that time until now, I have always remained in this Sahā world, teaching and transforming sentient beings. Furthermore, I have also in other places—in hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of *asamkhyeya* worlds—guided and benefited living beings.**[^8]

---
## THE REVELATION OF SKILLFUL MEANS: APPARENT EXTINCTION
"Good children, during this immeasurable span,**I have spoken of other Buddhas—such as the Buddha Dipamkara and others—proclaiming that they had entered into *parinirvāṇa*. Yet all of this was skillful teaching, skillful explanation. In truth, these were all adaptations to beings' capacities.**[^9]

"When sentient beings come to me,**I observe with my Buddha-eye their faith, their spiritual faculties, their dullness or sharpness of perception, their individual inclinations and habits. According to what they require, I manifest different names, different ages. Sometimes I proclaim my own extinction, sometimes that of others. Employing various causes and conditions, parables, and subtle teachings, I cause all sentient beings to develop joy and gladness in their hearts.**

"Good children, when the Tathāgata observes sentient beings who delight in limited teachings, who are defiled in merit and heavy with karmic obstruction, he teaches them:**'In my past life, I practiced austere discipline. Only recently have I attained supreme, perfect enlightenment.'**

"**Yet in truth, I have been a Buddha for incalculable eons. I speak in this manner only to teach sentient beings, to lead them into the Buddha-way and cause them to awaken to enlightenment.**[^10]

---
## THE PRINCIPLE: ALL TEACHING IS TRUE, NONE IS DECEPTIVE
"Good children, whatever teachings the Tathāgata reveals,**whether concerning my own body, the bodies of others, my own affairs, or the affairs of others—whether showing my own form or the forms of others—all such teachings are absolutely true and not deceptive.** Why is this?

"The Tathāgata directly perceives and knows the characteristics of the three worlds with perfect clarity:**"There is no arising, no passing away, no abiding in the world, and no extinction.**[^11]**"There is no actual and no illusory, no such-ness and no differ-ness. It is not as the limited perception within the three worlds perceives the three worlds. The Tathāgata sees these matters with perfect clarity and without error.** [^12]

"**Because all sentient beings possess different natures, different desires, different practices, different habitual tendencies, different ways of imagining and discriminating, in order to cause all to generate wholesome roots and advance toward enlightenment, through countless causes and conditions, through innumerable parables and illustrations, through various forms of teaching, the Tathāgata performs the work of teaching without ever interrupting or ceasing.**[^13]

"Thus, since I attained Buddhahood,**an immeasurably vast span of time has passed. My lifespan is measureless asankhya kalpas, constantly abiding without extinction. I have not yet entered parinirvāṇa, and my life is not yet exhausted.**[^14]

---
## THE REASON: COMPASSION THROUGH SEEMING ABSENCE
"Good children, during my previous practice of the Bodhisattva path, I perfected a lifespan through cultivation.**Even now, that lifespan has not been exhausted—in fact, it remains doubled beyond what it was.**[^15]

"**However, I do not truly disappear. Yet I announce my extinction. Why?** Because the Tathāgata perceives that**when beings of weak merit lack sufficient wholesome roots, are defiled by heavy karmic obstacles, are driven by greed toward the five desires, dwelling in delusion—if they see the Tathāgata constantly present and never departing, such beings would become arrogant and careless. They would not generate the thought: 'This opportunity to encounter the Buddha is rare and precious.' They would not develop reverence, respect, and longing toward the Buddha. They would not create wholesome roots.**[^16]

"**For this reason, the Tathāgata teaches them, saying: 'Monks and nuns, Buddhas appearing in the world are difficult and rare to encounter.'** [^17]

Why?**Because when the weaker beings, after passing through hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of *asamkhyeya* eons, can at last perceive a Buddha, or perhaps never perceive one at all—**for this reason, I teach:**'The Tathāgata is difficult to perceive and encounter.'**[^18]

"Through hearing such words, these sentient beings will certainly develop the thought:**'The meeting with a Buddha is rare and difficult. I must seize this precious opportunity.' In this way, they generate reverence and respect, cultivate longing and yearning for the Buddha, and thereby plant wholesome roots. Thus the Tathāgata, though not actually entering extinction, proclaims that he shall enter extinction.**[^19]

---
## THE PARABLE OF THE GOOD PHYSICIAN
"Furthermore, good children, this is the method of all Buddhas. It is like the case of a skillful, wise physician, intelligent and experienced, knowledgeable of medicinal treatments, capable of healing all illnesses.[^20]

"This physician has many sons—perhaps ten, perhaps twenty, perhaps a hundred in number. Due to some circumstance, he must journey to a distant country. While he is absent, all his sons drink poison by mistake. The poison has taken effect in their bodies, causing them to writhe upon the ground in agony.

"At that moment, their father returns home. Seeing his sons suffering in this way, he is moved with compassion.**The father consults many medical texts, seeking excellent herbs—herbs that are fine and beautiful in color, aroma, and taste—possessing all wholesome qualities. He gathers these herbs, grinds and mixes them, and gives them to his sons, speaking thus:****'This is truly a supremely good medicine. Its color, aroma, and taste are all complete and excellent. Consume this now, and your suffering will swiftly be relieved. You shall no longer have any disease or affliction.'**[^21]

"Among the sons, those whose minds have not been too damaged by poison, seeing this excellent medicine with its fine color and aroma, immediately accept it and consume it completely. Their illnesses are entirely cured.[^22]

"However, among the other sons, whose minds have been severely damaged by the poison and clouded in delusion—though they also see their father's arrival and joyfully greet him, begging for treatment—**when given the excellent medicine, they refuse to drink it. Why? Because the poison has deeply entered their systems, causing their minds to become confused and deluded. They regard the excellent medicine with its fine color and aroma as ugly and unpalatable.**[^23]

"The father thinks to himself:**'These sons are most pitiable. The poison has so clouded their understanding that even when offered excellent medicine, they will not accept it. I must devise a skillful method to make them take this medicine.'**

"Accordingly, he tells them:**'You must understand—I have grown old. My death is near. This excellent medicine I now leave with you. You may take it without anxiety.'** [^24]

"Having given these instructions, the father departs to a distant country, sending messengers back with word:**'Your father has died.'**[^25]

"Upon hearing that their father is deceased, the sons experience great sorrow and grief. They reflect:**'If our father were here, he would have compassion upon us and could rescue us. Now he has abandoned us, departing to a distant country and dying there.'**

"Recognizing their own abandonment and loneliness, the sons eventually awaken to wisdom. They finally examine the excellent medicine that their father left behind, finding it to be of excellent color and delightful aroma. They take it and consume it completely, and all their poisons are entirely cured.

"The father, learning that all his sons have recovered, returns immediately and meets with them, revealing himself."[^26]

---
## THE APPLICATION: THE BUDDHA AS SKILLED PHYSICIAN
"Good children, what is your opinion? Could anyone rightly accuse this excellent physician of falsehood or deception?"[^27]

The assembly responded: "No, World Honored One."

The Buddha declared: "I am exactly like this physician.**I have been a Buddha for immeasurable, incalculable hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of *asamkhyeya* eons. For the sake of sentient beings, through skillful means, I proclaim my extinction. Yet there is no one who can justly accuse the Tathāgata of falsehood or deception.** "[^28]

---
## THE ETERNAL BUDDHA
At that moment, the World Honored One, wishing to elaborate further upon this teaching, spoke in verse:

"Since I attained Buddhahood,
The eons that have passed
Are numberless and incalculable—
Hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of *asamkhyeya* eons.

Constantly I have taught and transformed
Hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of beings,
Leading them to enter the Buddha-way.
Throughout all these eons,

To liberate sentient beings,
I have employed skillful means to manifest extinction.
Yet in truth I do not disappear—
I remain constantly, teaching in this place.[^29]

I remain always in this world,
Through all supernatural powers,
Making those with inverted views—
Though dwelling near—unable to perceive me.

The multitudes perceive my extinction,
And make extensive offerings to my relics,
All harboring yearning and longing,
Generating hearts of devoted aspiration.

When sentient beings develop faith and trust,
When their minds become sincere and gentle,
With minds devoted to seeing the Buddha,
Regardless of sacrifice of body or life—

At that time, I and the assembly
Appear together at Vulture Peak,
And I address all sentient beings, saying:
'I remain constantly here, never departing—

Through skillful means I manifest
Both extinction and non-extinction.
Other lands contain sentient beings
Who are respectful and reverent believers.

For them I teach the supreme Dharma.
You do not hear this teaching,
For you believe that I have entered extinction.

I perceive all sentient beings
Sinking in the ocean of suffering.
Therefore, I do not manifest my body—
I cause them to develop longing and yearning.

Sinking in the depths of their desire,
They then awaken to seek the Buddha.
My supernatural powers are such as this—
Throughout immeasurable eons,

I remain constantly at Vulture Peak,
As well as at all other dwelling-places.
When the multitude perceives the eon-fire
Burning and destroying all worlds,

My Buddha-land remains eternally peaceful,
Filled continuously with gods and humans.
The gardens and palaces,
Various precious adornments—

Precious trees bear flowers and fruit,
And all beings dwell in joy and pleasure.
The gods strike their celestial drums,
Always performing various musical performances,

Raining down the mandāra flowers,
Scattering them upon the Buddha and the great assembly.
My pure Buddha-land is not destroyed,
Yet the multitude perceives it burned entirely.[^30]

Anxiety and terror,
And all kinds of suffering fill them.
These sinful beings,
Because of their evil karma,

Throughout immeasurable eons
Cannot even hear the name of the Three Jewels.
But those who have cultivated merit,
Who are gentle and sincere of heart,

All perceive my body present here
Teaching the Dharma.
Sometimes to this assembly I proclaim
That the Buddha's lifespan is immeasurable,

Sometimes I teach that the Buddha is rarely encountered,
Depending upon what causes beings to awaken.
My wisdom-power is like this—
The light of wisdom illuminates immeasurably.

The lifespan is incalculable eons,
Accomplished through long cultivation.
All wise ones—do not generate doubt about this,
Put an end to your doubts forever.

The Buddha's words are true and real, not false.
Just as the excellent physician,
Employing skillful means to heal his deluded sons,
Though truly present, proclaims his death—

There is no one who can call the physician false.
I am also the father of the world,
Rescuing all beings from suffering.
For those subject to delusion,

I am truly present, yet proclaim my extinction.
Though deluded beings fail to perceive,
The Buddha constantly dwells here.
With all supernatural power,

I am conscious of all sentient beings—
Who practices the path and who does not.
I adapt all teachings accordingly,
In order that all may enter supreme wisdom and

Swiftly accomplish the Buddha-body."[^31]

# Chapter 17: The Discrimination of Merits

## The Universal Merit of Single-Verse Rejoicing
At that time, the great assembly gathered around the Buddha heard his revelation of the Tathāgata's eternal lifespan—that immeasurable, incalculable eons have passed since he first attained enlightenment. Countless bodhisattvas, beginning with Maitreya, experienced tremendous benefit from this teaching. Incalculable aeons of beings obtained the spiritual threshold of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi; thousands of times that number of great bodhisattvas gained the dharma-gate of dhāraṇī-hearing; entire assemblies whose numbers equal the dust-particles of a world-realm achieved unrestricted eloquence in explaining dharma; other assemblies numbering like the dust-grains of three thousand great thousand-worlds obtained hundreds of millions upon millions of wheel-turning mantric formulas; three thousand world-realms' worth of great bodhisattvas turned the irreversible dharma-wheel; twice that number developed the dharma-wheel of purity; the bodhisattva-assembly of a thousand worlds would attain supreme enlightenment in eight succeeding lifetimes; four-world-realm assemblies in four lifetimes; three-world-realm assemblies in three; two-world-realm assemblies in two; one-world-realm assemblies in one remaining lifetime; eight complete world-realms' worth of beings awakened the incomparable resolve for supreme enlightenment[^1].

The Buddha declared to Maitreya: "When I spoke this teaching concerning the Tathāgata's eternal lifespan, the merit obtained by beings who developed even a single moment of authentic understanding would be immeasurable and infinite. If a virtuous man or woman devoted himself or herself to practicing the five perfections[^2]—generosity, moral discipline, patience, energetic effort, and meditation—through eighty million billion nayuta eons in order to attain incomparable supreme enlightenment, the merit obtained from such practice across all these eons would not equal one-hundredth, one-thousandth, one-hundred-thousandth, one-billion-fold of the merit gained by a single instant of authentic understanding regarding the Tathāgata's eternal lifespan. The disparity is such that even enumeration and analogy fail to capture it[^3].

"Listen further, Maitreya. When one hears of the Tathāgata's eternal lifespan and genuinely comprehends its meaning, the merit obtained is boundless, awakening the Tathāgata's incomparable wisdom. How much greater then when one extensively learns this sutra, teaches it to others, maintains it personally, or writes it out with one's own hand, embellishing it with flowers, fragrant oils, garlands, silk banners, jeweled canopies, and precious incense-vessels burning incense of immeasurable value? Such a person obtains merit of infinite and boundless measure, capable of generating the wisdom of all phenomena[^4].

"When virtuous men and women hear my proclamation of the Tathāgata's eternal lifespan and develop profound, heartfelt understanding, they directly perceive the Buddha dwelling eternally on Vulture Peak Mountain, surrounded by great bodhisattvas and assemblies of śrāvakas, explaining the dharma. Furthermore, they behold this Sahā world-realm: its ground composed of lapis lazuli, level and smooth; eight roads marked with grades of gold; rows of precious trees; towers, pavilions, and observation halls all manifested in the seven jewels; bodhisattva assemblies inhabiting these places. Whoever is able to perceive in this manner possesses marks of profound authentic understanding[^5].

"Furthermore, after the Tathāgata's passing, should one hear this sutra and neither reject nor disparage it, instead generating a mind of sincere rejoicing, understand that such a being has already established marks of profound understanding. What need be said of those who actually read it aloud, maintain it, or practice accordingly? These people carry the Tathāgata atop their heads. I declare, Maitreya, that such virtuous men and women need not establish stupas or construct monastic dwellings for the support of the sangha. Why is this? Those virtuous men and women who receive and maintain, read and recite this sutra have already established stupas, constructed monastic dwellings, and provided support to the sangha. They have, in effect, raised seven-jeweled stupas honoring the Tathāgata's relics, reaching toward the Brahma realms, hung with jeweled banners and numberless precious bells, decorated with flowers, fragrant oils, garlands, and powdered incenses. Through immeasurable thousands of millions of eons, they have continuously offered such worship[^6].

"I declare, Maitreya: after my passing, should one hear this sutra and be able to maintain it—whether by writing it themselves or arranging for it to be written—they thereby construct a monastic dwelling, a great temple of sandalwood wood with thirty-two halls, eight palm-trees high, ornate and sublime. Thousands of millions of monastics dwell therein, supplied with all necessities: gardens, bathing pools, pathways for circumambulation, meditation caves, robes, food, beds, medicinal preparations, and all requisite pleasures. Such monastic dwellings in their diversity number countless thousands of millions[^7].

"The presence of these temples constitutes worship of me and the assembly of monks. Therefore I proclaim: after my passage, should one receive and maintain, read and recite, explain and write this sutra, one has no need to establish stupas or construct monastic dwellings. Moreover, should such a person also practice charity along with discipline, patience, energetic effort, singular concentration, and transcendent wisdom—these virtues are supreme and boundless, like the infinite space extending east, west, north, south, upward, and downward—the spiritual merit becomes equally immeasurable and infinite, swiftly approaching all-knowing wisdom[^8].

"When one reads, maintains, and explains this sutra for others, or writes it, coupled with the capacity to establish stupas and construct monastic dwellings, to honor and praise assemblies of śrāvakas with myriads of praises, and to praise bodhisattva-merits with myriad commendations; when one explains this Lotus Sutra with various reasons and skilled language suited to its meaning; when one maintains pure moral discipline, dwells in harmony with gentle companions, practices patience without anger, steadies one's mind with firm intention, treasures sitting in meditation and attains deep absorptions, pursues energetic effort with heroic courage, embraces all wholesome dharmas, and possesses keen wisdom with clever answers to inquiries—if one practices in this manner, one's merit becomes incomparable. Whoever perceives such a dharma-teacher, having perfected such virtues, should scatter heavenly flowers upon that person, drape them with heavenly garments, bow with their head to the person's feet, and generate the thought-pattern of seeing a Buddha in them.

"Moreover, cultivate this thought: 'This person shall not long remain before reaching the bodhi-path, attaining the unsurpassable, non-action wisdom, and bringing benefit to countless beings of human and heavenly realms.' Wherever such a person dwells, whether standing, sitting, or walking, they are present in a place where a stupa should be erected, adorned with elaborate reverence and manifold offerings. The Buddha-child dwelling in that space represents the Buddha's own enjoyment, constantly dwelling therein in walking and sitting meditation[^9]."

## The Celebration of Merit-Discrimination

*At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

When one hears this dharma in a great assembly,
And rejoices, even hearing but a single verse,
Conveying that teaching to others who then rejoice,
This happiness extending through fifty sequential recipients—
The merit of the fiftieth person who heard
A single verse with joyful heart
Shall now be differentiated and fully explained.

Consider a great benefactor who possesses
Supplies of entertainment for countless beings,
Sustaining their delight through eighty full years,
Providing whatever each creature desires,
Yet seeing their weakness in advanced age—
Hair white, faces wrinkled,
Teeth sparse, forms withered—
Recognizing that death approaches,
This benefactor thinks, "Now I must guide them
Toward the dharma and the fruit of enlightenment,"
And speaks to them the profound truth:
"All existence is impermanent as mist and foam and flame—
Each of you must develop the mind of renunciation."

All who heard this dharma teaching
Directly attained arhatship,
Possessing the six divine penetrations,
Three insights, and eight deliverances.
Yet consider: the fiftieth person
Who but heard one verse with joy—
That person's merit surpasses this great patron
Beyond the reach of any comparison.

Such retransmitted rejoicing holds merit infinite,
Immeasurable in extent—
What need be said of those who first heard and rejoiced
In the great assembly gathering?

Should someone say to another:
"A most profound sutra exists, called the Lotus—
Let us together attend its teaching!"
And that person, receiving this invitation,
Listens to the dharma, even for the briefest moment—
The fruition of such virtue shall now be explained:

In each succeeding lifetime,
The person's mouth shall bear no ailments:
Teeth neither sparse nor yellow nor black,
Lips neither thick, sunken, nor rough,
The tongue never parched, dark, nor shortened,
The nose straight, refined, and perfect,
The forehead broad, level, and well-proportioned,
The facial features harmonious and complete—
All marks of human perfection intact—
The breath never fouled by unpleasant odor,
But instead fragrant with lotus-blossom scent
Emanating from the mouth itself[^10].

When one deliberately journeys to the monastery
Wishing to hear this sutra's profound dharma,
Delighting even for a moment in such hearing—
The karmic fruition shall manifest thus:
In successive rebirths among gods and humans,
The person obtains excellent elephants, horses, conveyances,
Precious palanquins and jeweled transport,
And the celestial mansions of heavenly realms.

Should one counsel another to sit and listen
To this dharma in the place of teaching,
Sharing one's seat to allow their attendance—
Such merit produces the seat of Śakra,
The seat of Brahma the Lord,
Or the throne of the Chakravartin King.

How much greater is the merit of those
Who single-mindedly listen with one heart,
Penetrating and explaining the meaning,
Practicing exactly as the dharma instructs—
Such merit proves immeasurable[^11].

## Philosophical Implications

Chapter 17 represents a turning point in the Lotus Sutra's teaching: the transition from metaphysical revelation (the Buddha's eternal presence) to ethical consequence (the actual benefits of maintaining the dharma). The chapter operates on a principle of recursive amplification—each act of dharma transmission multiplies the merit of the previous transmission, until the fiftieth person's mere rejoicing surpasses eighty million billion eons of concentrated practice by another being.

This asymmetry reveals a profound Buddhist principle: the merit of recognizing the dharma vastly exceeds the merit of conventional practice. The virtuous man who gives sustenance for eighty years, then teaches the dharma to attain arhats, obtains immense merit. Yet a being who merely hears one verse and rejoices transcends that entire achievement. Why?

Because dharma-recognition operates on a different ontological level. Conventional merit (dana, sila, concentration) addresses suffering within cyclic existence. But recognizing the dharma addresses the structure itself. When one responds to the Lotus Sutra's teaching regarding the Buddha's eternal lifespan, one perceives the reality that cyclical existence has been transcended (from the Buddha's perspective) eons ago. This recognition is itself partial enlightenment.

The chapter also articulates a crucial Buddhist principle regarding merit transference and sequential communication. The teaching passes from Buddha to first hearer to second hearer through fiftieth hearer, with each stage potentially reducing the "original" authority. Yet the Buddha's point is exactly opposite: the fiftieth person's rejoicing contains merit equal to or exceeding earlier participants. This suggests that dharma's efficacy does not depend on proximity to source but on the authenticity of recognition. The five-hundredth hearer in a transmission chain receives dharmic truth equally vivid.

The physical benefits described (dental perfection, vocal sweetness, refined facial features) might appear mundane. But they possess profound symbolic significance in Buddhist cosmology. Such marks indicate beings capable of effective dharma-teaching. Perfect speech, attractive presence, and freedom from physical disabilities enable the dharma-teacher to function optimally. The "perfect person" described in this chapter is not beautified for vanity but equipped for efficacy.

The mantra-like repetition—"may my mouth emit lotus fragrance rather than foul odor"—reflects Buddhist understanding that consciousness and body interpenetrate. What emerges from one's mouth (speech) follows from what dwells in one's consciousness. Speech should "naturally" emanate sweetness because the mind dwells in dharma. This is not magical transformation but the natural result of consciousness-reorientation.

The chapter also pioneers a distinctive Buddhist argument: the value of "merely" hearing and rejoicing. In many traditions, spiritual practice requires extensive effort, discipline, and technique. The Lotus Sutra suggests that authentic participation in dharma-recognition requires nothing but openness. To hear the sutra and rejoice—to recognize its truth without rejection—is itself sufficient. This opens the dharma-path to beings excluded by conventional criteria (the lazy, the inept, those of limited capacity). The sutra's revolutionary inclusivity appears here not as arbitrary generosity but as theological necessity: dharma-recognition itself is universal, not restricted to yogic adepts or scholarly virtuosos.

The architectural imagery—stupas, monasteries, eight-hall temples—operates both literally and symbolically. The sutra-maintainer does not merely benefit from maintaining a text; the maintenance of the sutra itself becomes a form of worship equivalent to constructing elaborate monuments. This reflects a sophisticated Buddhist understanding that dharma and its material manifestations are not separate. The written text, carefully preserved and transmitted, is not merely a conveyance of concepts but a sacred presence itself.

# Chapter 18: The Merit of Rejoicing

## The Recursive Multiplication of Rejoicing
At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva approached the Buddha with reverent demeanor and inquired: "World-Honored One, when beings hear this Lotus Sutra and develop a mind of sincere rejoicing, what measure of merit do they acquire?"

The Buddha replied to Maitreya: "After the Tathāgata's passing, should a bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī, upāsaka, or upāsikā—indeed, any wise being whether elder or youth—hear this sutra and sincerely rejoice, understanding its meaning, they should proceed from that assembly to other locations: monastic dwellings, open spaces, towns, villages, highways, or fields. There they shall explain this dharma to father, mother, relatives, or knowledgeable companions, conveying what they have heard according to their understanding. These listeners, upon hearing, shall themselves generate rejoicing and communicate this joy to still others. In this manner, from person to person, the transmission continues until the fiftieth recipient is reached[^1].

"Maitreya, observe the merit of this fiftieth virtuous man or woman who has received the joy of the sutra through sequential transmission. I shall now elucidate it for you.

"Consider four hundred million billion nayuta world-realms populated with six-path beings of all types—those born from eggs, wombs, moisture, and transformation; those with form and formless; those with consciousness and unconscious; those neither conscious nor unconscious; those with no feet, two feet, four feet, or multiple feet—in essence, all categories of sentient life. Suppose a great benefactor, wishing to acquire merit, provides to each of these innumerable beings whatever objects delight them, whatever brings joy and satisfaction. To each being, he distributes treasures filling the entire continent of Jambudvīpa: gold, silver, lapis lazuli, crystal, agate, coral, amber, and all precious jewels. Moreover, he provides elephants, horses, carriages, and palaces constructed of seven jewels—towered mansions and pavilions. This great benefactor practices such charity for eighty years, until observing the aged condition of these beings—their white hair, wrinkled faces, sparse teeth, withered forms—he recognizes that death approaches. At that moment he thinks: 'These beings have aged considerably. I must now offer them the dharma and guide them toward enlightenment.'

"Gathering these beings, he proclaims to them the dharma of nirvāṇa, the essential truth. He teaches that all realms are impermanent, equal to foam and bubbles and burning flames, and that all should swiftly develop the determination to transcend cyclic existence. Upon hearing this dharma, all these beings directly attain arhatship, possessing the six divine penetrations, the three knowledges, and the eight deliverances, becoming entirely freed from the outflows of existence[^2].

"Maitreya, what is your assessment? Does this great benefactor's merit appear considerable?" Maitreya replied to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, this benefactor's merit is extraordinarily abundant! Even to distribute merely the objects of enjoyment to such countless beings would generate immeasurable merit. How much more so that he guides them to arhatship and complete liberation?"

The Buddha declared: "I shall explain explicitly. This benefactor distributes all objects of enjoyment to four hundred million billion nayuta world-realms' worth of six-path beings and leads them to arhatship. Yet if we compare this merit with that of a fiftieth person who hears the Lotus Sutra through the chain of five retransmissions and rejoices at even a single verse, the latter's merit exceeds the former by a hundred-fold, a thousand-fold, a million-fold, or immeasurable multiples thereof. Indeed, enumeration and analogy cannot capture the disparity. Maitreya, consider: the merit of a fiftieth person receiving the sutra through sequential rejoicing is already immeasurable and infinite. How much greater is the merit of one who hears it first-hand in the assembly and rejoices[^3]?"

Furthermore, Maitreya: "Should anyone come to a monastic dwelling with intention to hear the Lotus Sutra, and sit or stand to listen momentarily, the karmic fruits of such action shall cause that being to be reborn among gods and humans where they obtain excellent elephants, fine horses, precious conveyances, and celestial palaces[^4].

"Moreover, should one be in a place where the dharma is taught and another person arrives, and one encourages that second person to sit and listen to the dharma—or even offers one's own seat to them—the merit accrued causes that person to be reborn where they obtain the seat of Śakra Devendra, the seat of Brahma, or the seat of a Cakravartin king.

"Again, Maitreya: should someone say to another, 'There exists a sutra called the Lotus—let us go together to hear it taught.' And that person, receiving this encouragement, attends the teaching and hears it even briefly—the karmic fruition of such action is remarkable indeed. From that point onward, across successive rebirths, that person shall be reborn together with bodhisattvas who have attained dhāraṇī-powers. They shall possess keen intelligence and wisdom, never experiencing muteness for a hundred thousand lifetimes. Their breath shall never emit foul odor; their tongue shall not become diseased or disabled; their mouth shall be free from all illness. Their teeth shall neither become sparse nor yellow nor black, neither crooked nor gapped nor uneven nor protruding nor stunted nor blackened, neither unpleasant to behold nor defective. Their lips shall be neither thick nor thin, neither sunken nor protruding, neither cracked nor diseased nor scarred, neither deformed nor twisted nor thick nor large nor dark nor displeasing in any way. Their nose shall be straight, refined, and perfectly proportioned. Their face shall remain round and complete throughout their life. Their eyebrows shall be elevated and extended. Their forehead shall be broad, level, and perfectly symmetric. All marks of human perfection shall be complete. In each world where they are born, they shall perceive the Buddha, hear the dharma, and develop authentic faith in the teachings. This is the benefit that accrues when one person encourages another to hear the Lotus Sutra[^5]."

The Buddha continued: "Maitreya, consider the merit accruing from merely encouraging one person to attend the dharma-teaching. How much greater must be the merit of those who listen with unified attention, comprehend the dharma's meaning, and practice accordingly?"
## The Cascading Benefits of Rejoicing-Transmission
*At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

A person hearing this dharma in the assembly,
Even a single verse, with sincere rejoicing,
Teaches it to another, who also rejoices,
The transmission continuing through fifty successive recipients—
The fifty-fold retransmission holds merit of this nature:

A great benefactor supplies all pleasures
To countless beings numbering like dust-grains,
Sustaining their delight through eighty full years,
Each receiving whatever their hearts desire.
Observing their aging—white hair, wrinkled faces,
Teeth sparse, forms withered and declining—
He thinks: "Death approaches these beings now.
I shall guide them through the dharma to liberation,"
And immediately teaches them the true dharma:
"All existence is impermanent as mist and foam and flame—
Each of you should cultivate the mind of renunciation."

All who heard this dharma-teaching
Attained arhatship directly,
Possessed six divine penetrations,
Three knowledges and eight deliverances[^6].

The last person in the fiftieth transmission
Who heard one verse with sincere joy—
That person's merit surpasses this benefactor's
Beyond all possible comparison or reckoning.

When retransmitted through successive hearers,
The accumulated merit remains immeasurable.
How much greater is the merit
Of those who heard first in the assembly?

If one person encourages another:
"This sutra called the Lotus Dharma is profound and subtle,
Encountered only once in thousands of eons—
Come, let us hear its teaching together!"

And that person, heeding the encouragement,
Attends to hear, even for a brief moment—
The fruit of such action shall now be explained:

Throughout the person's world-to-world rebirths,
The mouth shall bear no fault:
Teeth shall not be sparse, yellow, or black,
Lips shall not be thick, sunken, or broken,
The tongue shall not be parched, dark, or shortened,
The nose shall be refined, elevated, and perfectly straight,
The forehead broad and level and symmetric,
The face complete in all features,
Beloved by all who see them,
With breath naturally sweet-scented,
And fragrance of utpala blossoms
Shall emanate from the mouth itself[^7].

Those who intentionally visit a monastery
Desiring to hear the Lotus Sutra,
Finding joy in the teaching, even momentarily—
The karma-fruit is such as this:

Subsequently reborn in divine and human realms,
They obtain excellent elephants and horses,
Precious vehicles and palanquins,
And heavenly mansions as dwellings[^8].

Should one encourage another to sit and listen
To the dharma taught in that assembly,
Or share one's own seat with the listener—
The merit-result is to obtain in rebirth
The seat of Śakra the Lord,
The seat of Brahma,
Or the seat of a Cakravartin King[^9].

What need be said of one who hears with perfect attention,
Who understands the dharma's meaning thoroughly,
And practices exactly as the sutra instructs?
Such merit possesses no measure,
Boundless and infinite in its extent[^10].

## Philosophical Implications

Chapter 18 operates as a mirror and extension of Chapter 17, exploring the consequences of dharma-transmission from a different angle. Where Chapter 17 emphasized the astonishing merit accruing from a single moment of authentic recognition (hearing one verse and rejoicing), Chapter 18 emphasizes the exponential multiplication of merit through sequential transmission.

The chapter's central logical move involves what might be called "recursive equivalence." The merit of the fiftieth person in a transmission chain equals or exceeds the merit of a great benefactor who practices unimaginable charity. Yet this second benefactor surpasses the first in effort and intention. Why this reversal of proportionality?

The text suggests that dharma-transmission operates according to principles foreign to conventional causality. When material goods are distributed, the act completes; the giver has less, the receiver has more. But when dharma is transmitted, something peculiar occurs: the transmitter retains the dharma while the receiver also gains it. Moreover, the receiver's joy (rejoicing) is not diminished by sharing but magnified through the act of communication. The fifty-fold retransmission does not dissipate the original teaching but concentrates it through repeated recognition.

The architectural components repeated throughout this chapter—the enormous benefactor providing seventy-two varieties of precious substances to universe-spanning populations—function as a counter-example. The text deliberately inflates this hypothetical to the point of absurdity. Four hundred million billion nayuta worlds, each populated with sentient beings numbering like dust-grains, each supported for eighty years with treasures from the seven jewels: even this immeasurable generosity pales before the simple fact of hearing one verse and rejoicing.

This apparent contradiction reveals a fundamental Buddhist insight regarding the nature of merit and spiritual value. Conventional merit (dana-maya, virtue through giving) addresses suffering in cyclic existence; it improves circumstances within the world. Ultimate merit (dharma-jnana, wisdom through dharma-recognition) addresses the structure of cyclic existence itself. A being who gives treasure for eighty years to universe-spanning populations still operates within the framework of cyclical existence, still accumulates conventional karma. A being who hears one verse and recognizes its truth begins to transcend that framework entirely.

The text also introduces a crucial Buddhist principle regarding transmission-chains: that later hearers need not be "less enlightened" than earlier ones. In many religious systems, the founder carries unique authority; later teachers are mere conduits. The Lotus Sutra suggests something radically different—that each act of transmission is a fresh encounter with dharma-truth, equally vivifying, equally transformative. The fiftieth person is not a secondary recipient but a primary one. Their rejoicing is not a pale echo of the first person's response but an equally authentic response to the same eternal truth.

The physical benefits enumerated—dental perfection, vocal sweetness, freedom from stuttering—again appear to represent symbolic transformations signifying readiness for dharma-transmission. These are not cosmetic improvements but functional enhancements. A dharma-teacher must speak clearly, be heard without difficulty, be remembered by listeners. These mundane physical attributes become instruments of sacred communication.

The text also pioneers a sophisticated Buddhist understanding of "encouragement" (upapreksha) as dharmic action. To encourage another to hear the dharma is presented as carrying merit equivalent to direct participation in that hearing. This suggests that facilitating dharma-transmission carries its own spiritual efficacy. The person who merely says "let us go hear the sutra together" participates in dharma-transmission as surely as one who sits in the assembly. This opens pathways of merit to those who lack the capacity for direct practice—the disabled, the elderly, the socially isolated—who can still participate through encouragement.

# Chapter 19: The Dharma-Teacher's Merits

## The Six Perfected Senses of the Dharma-Teacher
At that time, the Buddha addressed Avalokiteśvara the Bodhisattva of Constant Exertion: "When a virtuous man or woman maintains this Lotus Sutra—whether by reading it, reciting it, explaining it, or writing it—that person shall acquire eight hundred eye-perfections, one thousand two hundred ear-perfections, eight hundred nose-perfections, one thousand two hundred tongue-perfections, eight hundred body-perfections, and one thousand two hundred mind-perfections[^1]. Through these perfections, the six sense-organs shall become completely purified.

"The virtuous man or woman, having such purification, shall perceive through the naturally-born physical eye—unenhanced by supernatural power—the three thousand great thousand-worlds in all their extent and interior. They perceive mountains and forests, great rivers and seas, extending downward to Avīci hell and upward to the Akaniṣṭha realm. All beings inhabiting these realms, together with their karmic deeds, causes, and destinies, the virtuous person sees and knows completely[^2].

"Furthermore, Avalokiteśvara, when a virtuous man or woman maintains this sutra—whether reading, reciting, explaining, or writing it—they acquire one thousand two hundred ear-perfections. The naturally-born ear, without supernatural augmentation, shall hear the three thousand great thousand-worlds in all their dimensions. They shall perceive:

"All animal sounds—the trumpeting of elephants, neighing of horses, bellowing of cattle, bleating of sheep, and cries of other beasts. The sounds of carriages and carts. The cries of human suffering and lamentation, the sounds of sorrow and anguish. The sounds of spiral shells and drums, bells and chimes, flutes and pipes, stringed instruments and musical instruments of every description. The sounds of song and speech, the voices of men and women, of young boys and young girls. Dharmic sounds and non-dharmic sounds. Sounds of suffering and sounds of joy. The sounds of common beings and the voices of sages. Sounds expressing pleasure and sounds expressing displeasure.

"They shall hear the voices of gods and the songs of celestial beings, the voices of dragons and serpent-beings, the cries of night-roaming spirits, the voices of gandharvas and asuras, of kinnara-musicians and great serpents, the sounds of fire and water and wind, the groans from hell, the voices of hungry ghosts, and the sounds of animal realms. The voices of bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs reciting sutras, the voices of those who have heard the dharma completely, the voices of solitary buddhas.

"They shall hear the voices of bodhisattvas reading and reciting the dharma, explaining it to others, and analyzing its meaning. They shall hear the voices of all buddhas in all the ten directions, expounding the dharma in their assemblies. The dharma-maintainer, dwelling in this Sahā world, hears all of these voices without limit, and their ear-faculty is not harmed or confused in this perception. Though not possessing the supernatural ear-penetration, merely through the naturally-born ear purified by maintaining this sutra, the dharma-teacher hears all these sounds simultaneously, perfectly discriminating their natures[^3].

"Moreover, Avalokiteśvara, when a virtuous man or woman maintains this sutra—whether reading, reciting, explaining, or writing it—they acquire eight hundred nose-perfections. The naturally-born nostril, though not possessing supernatural smell-penetration, shall perceive from above and below, from near and far, all scents within the three thousand great thousand-worlds[^4].

"Such scents include: the fragrances of sumana flowers, jasmine flowers, and other blossoms; the scents of tree-blossoms and fruit-trees; the fragrances of sandalwood, aloeswood, tamālapattra, and tagara; the scents of thousands upon thousands of incenses and perfumes, whether in powdered form, pill form, or anointing oil—all these scents the person perceives and discriminates perfectly.

"The dharma-maintainer perceives the scents of human bodies—those of men and women, youth and maidens—and from near or far, whether approaching or departing, identifies the beings by their scent. The dharma-maintainer perceives the scents of turumeric-trees and other fragrant trees, perceives all scents throughout the cosmos from the greatest depths to the highest realms. They perceive the scents of heavenly incenses and perfumes, the scents of heavenly flowers and celestial sandalwood, and of all beings in all realms—whether gods, nagas, or other celestial beings. The dharma-maintainer perceives all these scents without confusion and can precisely explain them to others without error[^5].

"Furthermore, Avalokiteśvara, when a virtuous man or woman maintains this sutra—whether reading, reciting, explaining, or writing it—they acquire one thousand two hundred tongue-perfections. Whatever flavors enter the mouth—whether pleasing or displeasing, delicious or bitter, pungent or astringent—all are transformed into the supreme taste, becoming sweet as the amrita of the divine realms. No unpleasant flavor exists[^6].

"When such a person speaks the dharma before a great assembly, their speech produces a profound and subtle voice that naturally penetrates the hearts of all listeners, bringing them joy and delight. All celestial beings—gods and goddesses, Śakra and Brahma, the divine assembly—hearing this profound and subtle voice, assemble to listen with reverence. Dragons and nagas, night-spirits and gandharvas, asuras, kinnara-musicians, and great serpents, all come near, showing respect and honor. Monks and nuns, male and female lay followers, kings and princes, ministers and attendants, small and great Cakravartin kings with their thousand sons and retinues, all bring celestial palaces and come to hear the teaching. Through the dharma-teacher's skillful exposition, Brahmins, householders, and all people of the realm give service and support throughout their lives.

"All śrāvakas and solitary buddhas, bodhisattvas, and buddhas constantly delight in seeing such a person. All the buddhas in the regions where such a person dwells direct their teaching toward that person. All these buddhas entrust their dharma to that person, and all dharma established by all buddhas becomes available to them. Such a person's consciousness becomes perfectly clear, and they can speak profound and subtle dharma-voices, reaching any distance. Whatever they speak becomes consistent with what all buddhas have taught in the past; nothing they say is false or inconsistent[^7].

"Finally, Avalokiteśvara, when a virtuous man or woman maintains this sutra—whether reading, reciting, explaining, or writing it (particularly after the Buddha's passing)—they acquire one thousand two hundred mind-perfections. The mind-faculty becomes so refined that upon hearing even a single verse or a single phrase, the person comprehends immeasurable and boundless significance. Once comprehending the meaning, they can then explain one verse or one phrase through a single month, four months, or even an entire year, expounding its meaning according to principle. All their discourse is consistent with the dharma and conforms to true reality[^8].

"If they speak of worldly affairs, political administration, or practical matters of livelihood, all such speech accords with the dharma and is entirely true and genuine. The mind becomes so refined that they perceive the thoughts, intents, and mental preoccupations of all six-path beings inhabiting the three thousand great thousand-worlds. Though not yet possessing unreleased wisdom, such a person's mind-faculty is purified to this degree.

"Whatever the person thinks, ponders, and speaks becomes dharmic teaching—entirely true and never false. These teachings are identical to those taught by all the buddhas of the past. Because such a person speaks the dharma, they possess no fear before any assembly. All beings recognize them as one who has approached the way-place; they will not long delay before attaining unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment and bringing benefit to countless beings[^9]."
## The Enumeration of Dharma-Teacher's Powers
*At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

When a person speaks this sutra
Before a great assembly without fear,
Listen to the perfections they obtain:

Eight hundred eye-perfections they achieve,
Granting the eyes extraordinary clarity.
Through the naturally-born eye alone,
They perceive all of the three thousand worlds,
The interior and exterior mountains—Sumeru and Cakravada—
The iron-circling ranges, and all terrestrial features,
The vast oceans and flowing rivers,
Down to the Great Hell,
Up to the Akaniṣṭha realm,
Seeing all beings in between,
And perfectly knowing their karma and destinies.
Though not yet possessing the divine eye,
The power of the naturally-born eye is such as this[^10].

One thousand two hundred ear-perfections they obtain,
Achieving extraordinary auditory clarity.
Through the naturally-born ear alone,
They hear all sounds within the three thousand worlds:
The sounds of elephants, horses, cattle, and sheep,
The cries of carts and chariots,
The sounds of weeping and lamentation,
The sounds of sorrow and anguish,
The calls of conches and beating of drums,
The sounds of bells and tinkling chimes,
The music of harps, zithers, and stringed instruments,
The sounds of flutes and pipes and wind-instruments,
The clear sounds of excellent singing,
Hearing these without attachment,
The countless sounds of humans speaking,
Understanding all voices completely[^11].

They also hear divine voices singing,
The subtle songs of celestial melodies,
And the voices of male and female beings,
Of young boys and young maidens.
From the mountain valleys and deep ravines,
The sounds of kalaviṅka-birds and other species,
The magnificent cries of various birds,
The sounds of those in the Hell realms,
The suffering screams of tortured beings,
And the cries of hungry ghosts,
Driven by hunger and thirst to seek food,
The voices of the asura-realm,
Dwelling at the edges of the great oceans,
Speaking among themselves in loud voices[^12].

Such a dharma-teacher, dwelling in this place,
Hears all these sounds from afar,
Yet the ear-faculty remains unharmed.
From the ten directions and all world-systems,
Cries of beasts answering one another,
The dharma-teacher hears them all[^13].

In the Brahma realms and higher,
The light-sphere and immeasurable-light realms,
Up to the highest realm of existence,
The divine speech of beings dwelling there,
The dharma-teacher, standing here,
Hears perfectly all these voices.
All monks and nuns,
And all those reading scripture,
Or explaining it to others—
The dharma-teacher hears them all.
Likewise, all bodhisattvas,
Reading and reciting the dharma,
Or explaining it to others,
Or analyzing its meanings—
All such voices the teacher hears perfectly[^14].

All the buddhas of all directions,
Possessed of the hundred marks of beauty,
Teaching all sentient beings,
The dharma-teacher hears their voices completely,
While remaining in this place.
From the superb and subtle speech,
The dharma-teacher is able to hear
All these sounds without injury to the ear-organ,
And the keenness of the ear is such
That all voices can be understood and known.

The dharma-teacher thus equipped
Though not yet possessing the divine ear,
Merely from this naturally-born ear,
Such are the merits already present[^15].

The person's nose becomes quite pure,
And through this world in particular,
All scents, whether fragrant or foul,
The person perceives and knows completely.
From sumana and from jasmine flowers,
And from other fragrant blossoms,
From fragrant woods and fruited trees,
Sandalwood, aloeswood-wood, and other aromatics,
From the various sandalwood species,
And the countless mixed incenses—
Both powdered form and pill-shaped form,
And anointing oils—
The dharma-teacher, dwelling here, can distinguish them all[^16].

Also the scents of all beings—
Elephant scents, horse scents, cattle scents,
The scents of men and scents of women,
Youth and maiden fragrances,
And understanding all these scents from afar,
Whether drawing near or moving away,
The dharma-teacher knows the location through scent.
From mighty monarchs and lesser kings,
And the sons and ministers thereof,
All the precious adornments,
And underground treasure-stores,
The royal harem with its fragrances—
All these the teacher knows by scent[^17].

The dharma-teacher smells beautiful flowers,
Both heavenly and earthly blossoms,
And the sandal-trees and great forests—
All plants and flowers blooming there,
The dharma-teacher, dwelling in this realm,
Understands all their locations.
From Brahma realms and higher spheres,
Even to the highest existence realm,
The heavenly incenses and perfumes,
The heavenly fragrances of celestial flowers—
All such heavenly scents are perceived and known.
And understanding the scents of all beings—
Gods, dragons, and celestial folk—
Their locations are known.
Though not yet possessing bodhisattva's
Unreleased-wisdom-generated nose,
Already such is the power obtained[^18].

The person's tongue becomes quite pure,
Never receiving any unpleasant taste:
Whatever enters the mouth—
The pleasant and the unpleasant,
Whatever is eaten—
All becomes supreme taste,
Like the divine amrita nectar itself,
Where nothing is unpleasant.
When expounding the dharma,
From the mouth emerges profound voice,
Able to enter all hearts,
Bringing all who hear to joy and happiness[^19].

Heavenly devas and their consorts,
Śakra and Lord Brahma,
And all the assembled deities,
Come to hear the dharma being taught.
Dragons and nagas alike,
Night-wandering spirits and gandharvas,
Asuras, kinnaras, and great serpents—
They all approach with respect and honor[^20].

All bhikṣu and bhikṣuṇī crowds,
And lay followers, male and female,
Kings and royal princes,
Ministers and palace attendants,
Small and great Cakravartin Kings,
With a thousand sons and full retinues,
Bringing forth celestial palaces,
All come together to hear the teaching.
Through the dharma-teacher's skill in explaining,
Brahmins, householders, and all common folk
Give their service throughout their lives.
All śrāvakas and solitary buddhas,
Bodhisattvas and the buddhas themselves,
Constantly take joy in seeing such a person[^21].

In all the world-regions where they dwell,
The buddhas all turn their attention there.
Toward such a dharma-teacher's presence,
All the buddhas direct their teaching.
All dharma that all buddhas possess
Becomes available to such a person.
Whatever they speak always proves,
To be Buddha-dharma, never false.
Because they speak such dharma,
They face all assemblies without any fear[^22].

For this dharma-teacher's good fortune,
When first encountering this dharma,
One should scatter heavenly flowers,
Should cover the body with heavenly garments,
Should bow the head to their feet,
And cultivate a mind-attitude of Buddha-reverence.

Furthermore, consider this well:
This person shall not long remain
Before reaching the enlightenment-place,
Obtaining unsurpassed wisdom,
And broadly benefiting all beings
Of the human and celestial realms.
The location where they dwell and teach—
Standing, sitting, walking, or resting,
Even when speaking a single verse—
That place should have a stupa erected,
Adorned with elaborate beauty,
And honored with manifold offerings.
In such places dwell enlightenment-beings,
Constantly dwelling there in coming and going,
In sitting and sleeping positions.

## Philosophical Implications

Chapter 19 represents a theological milestone in the Lotus Sutra's argument: the elevation of dharma-teachers to Buddha-equivalence. Where earlier chapters established that all beings possess Buddha-nature and can attain enlightenment, Chapter 19 specifies what happens to those who devote themselves to maintaining and teaching this supreme sutra.

The chapter constructs a meticulous taxonomy of sensory perfection, detailing how each of the six senses—sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch (implicit in the body-perfection), and mind—becomes transformed through dharma-maintenance. This anatomical approach to enlightenment contradicts the notion that liberation is merely mental or spiritual. The text insists that dharma-transformation permeates the entire organism.

The eye-perfections manifest as unobstructed vision of all three-thousand-worlds simultaneously. In Buddhist cosmology, the three thousand great thousand-worlds (trisahara-mahasahasra-lokadhatu) represents all sentient existence. The dharma-maintainer perceives not merely physical geography but the karmic situations of all beings—their deeds, causes, and destinies. This is significant because it suggests that dharma-penetration includes moral-causal understanding. One who truly comprehends the dharma perceives the entire structure of cause-and-effect that binds existence.

The ear-perfections catalogs an extraordinary range of sounds: animal cries, human voices in all emotional registers, divine music, the groans of hell-beings. Importantly, the text specifies that this comprehensive auditory perception does not overwhelm or confuse the teacher. They hear all sounds simultaneously yet maintain perfect discrimination. This suggests that dharma-consciousness transcends the normal human limitation of sequential auditory processing.

The nose-perfections describe the capacity to perceive scents across all realms, identifying beings and substances by fragrance. The olfactory metaphor deserves careful attention. In Buddhist symbolism, fragrance often represents the spreading of dharma. That the teacher perceives all scents reflects their capacity to recognize dharma-presence throughout all realms, even in places where dharma is not explicitly taught.

The tongue-perfections involve two transformations: first, the alchemical conversion of all tastes into divine nectar (amrita), suggesting that dharma-consciousness renders all experience sacred; second, the capacity for profound speech that penetrates hearts and brings joy. This combination of inner transformation and outer expression indicates that the dharma-teacher's speech is not merely informative but spiritually transformative.

The mind-perfections represent the sutra's deepest claim about the dharma-teacher's consciousness. A single verse yields infinite meanings (pratibhana, inexhaustible eloquence). The teacher can expound that single verse for a month, four months, or a year, finding new layers of significance without exhaustion. This reflects the Buddhist principle that the dharma possesses infinite depth—that sacred text is not merely literary but ontologically inexhaustible.

Most strikingly, the text declares that the dharma-teacher's speech, even when discussing mundane affairs, accords with dharma and truth. This is because the teacher's consciousness has become so thoroughly saturated with dharmic understanding that even ordinary communication reflects ultimate reality. There is no longer a division between dharma-speech and ordinary speech; all speech becomes dharmic.

The chapter also introduces a crucial principle: that dharma-teachers become recipients of Buddha-authorization. "All the buddhas entrust their dharma to such a person." This suggests that across all time and space, all Buddhas recognize and support those who maintain the Lotus Sutra. The dharma-teacher is not merely an individual practitioner but a node in a vast network of Buddha-activity.

# Chapter 20: The Bodhisattva of Never-Despiser

## The Eternal Practitioner of Universal Respect
At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta: "You should understand that among those who maintain the Lotus Sutra, should any individual curse, revile, or disparage such a keeper of the sutra, the karmic consequences shall be severe, as described previously. But understand equally: those who maintain this Lotus Sutra thereby acquire the perfected senses mentioned—eye-purity, ear-purity, nose-purity, tongue-purity, body-purity, and mind-purity[^1].

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, in ages long past—across immeasurable, incalculable eons—there existed a Buddha named Majestic Voice King, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, the One Perfectly Accomplished in Knowledge and Conduct, the Sugata, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassable Guide, the Tamer of the Untamed, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. His lifespan extended across four million billion nayuta eons. In his world, an age called the Age of Prosperity prevailed, and his realm was named the Great Achievement.

"The Buddha Majestic Voice King taught the dharma to gods, humans, and asuras. To those seeking arhatship, he explained the dharma of the four truths, enabling them to transcend birth, old age, sickness, and death, ultimately reaching the final peace of nirvāṇa. To those seeking solitary-buddha realization, he taught the dharma of dependent origination in twelve aspects. To the bodhisattvas and all beings, he explained the dharma of the six perfections, ultimately leading them to perfect enlightenment[^2].

"In that age, the Buddha Majestic Voice King possessed eighty billion great bodhisattvas and assemblies of seventy-two trillion enlightened śrāvakas. That Buddha's lifespan extended four million billion nayuta eons. The dharma remained as the Buddha's living teaching for a period of years equal in number to the dust-particles of an entire Jambudvīpa continent. The semblance dharma (the era after the Buddha's departure when the form of the teachings remains but their living force diminishes) also persisted through numbers of years equal to the dust-particles of an entire continent. After the correct dharma and semblance dharma had been exhausted, in that realm there appeared destructive, arrogant monks. During this degenerate epoch, the true dharma had become obscured.

"At that time, within this degraded assembly, there was a bodhisattva-monk named Never-Despiser. Why was he called Never-Despiser? Because whenever he encountered monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen of any station, he would immediately bow in reverence, praise them, and speak these words: 'I profoundly honor you. I dare not belittle or despise you. Why? Because you all practice the bodhisattva path. You shall inevitably attain Buddhahood.' This Never-Despiser Bodhisattva did not devote himself primarily to reading and reciting the sutras but concentrated entirely on the practice of reverence. Whenever he encountered the four assemblies from a distance, he would deliberately approach them, prostrate himself before them, and praise them with the same declaration: 'I dare not despise you. You are all destined to become Buddhas.' Those among these four assemblies who possessed conceit or impure minds would revile him, saying: 'This ignorant monk! Why does he presume to declare that we shall become Buddhas? What authority does he have to grant us such predictions? We do not want such false prophecies!' So Never-Despiser endured decades of abuse and vilification without becoming angry. His practice remained constant: 'I dare not despise you. You are destined for Buddhahood.'

"When these contentious monks, nuns, and laypeople approached with sticks, stones, and tiles, attempting to strike him, Never-Despiser would flee to a distance, continuing to proclaim loudly: 'I dare not despise you. You shall become Buddhas!' Because of his constant proclamation of this message, both the arrogant monks and the four assemblies came to call him 'Never-Despiser'[^3].

"When the end of this bodhisattva's life approached, he heard suspended in the void the voice of the Buddha Majestic Voice King reciting the Lotus Sutra—specifically the dharma of all twenty thousand million billion verses from the first exposition. Never-Despiser absorbed and retained all these verses completely. He immediately acquired the six perfected senses: eye-clarity, ear-clarity, nose-clarity, tongue-clarity, body-clarity, and mind-clarity, exactly as previously described[^4]. Having attained these purified senses, his lifespan was extended two hundred billion nayuta years, and he proceeded to widely expound the Lotus Sutra for the benefit of all beings.

"At that time, those arrogant monks, nuns, and laypeople who had previously reviled him—observing that he possessed great supernatural powers, eloquent wisdom-speech, and profound tranquility—abandoned their contempt and began to follow him. This Never-Despiser Bodhisattva thus transformed millions of billions of beings, establishing them in unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.

"When Never-Despiser ultimately completed his remaining lifespan, he encountered two billion buddhas, all called the Sunny-Moon Radiant Buddhas, in whose dharma he received, maintained, read, and recited this Lotus Sutra. Because he always proclaimed this sutra among the four assemblies, he attained the six purified senses. Later, he encountered another two billion buddhas, all called the Cloud-Radiance Kings of Liberation Buddhas, in whose dharma he again received, maintained, read, and recited this sutra. Through his proclamation of the dharma to the four assemblies, he continued developing the six purified senses.

"Subsequently, Never-Despiser encountered countless billions of buddhas, through whom he continued to receive, maintain, read, recite, and proclaim this Lotus Sutra, until his merits were completed and he attained perfect enlightenment.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, do you comprehend the meaning of this account? The Never-Despiser Bodhisattva of that ancient time—he was none other than my own previous embodiment! Had I not received, maintained, read, recited, and proclaimed this Lotus Sutra to others in my past existences, I could never have attained swift enlightenment. The four assemblies of that era—the monks, nuns, male and female laypeople—those who despised me: through contempt, they passed two hundred billion eons never encountering a Buddha, never hearing the dharma, never seeing the sangha. Only after exhausting this karmic consequence did they begin again meeting the Never-Despiser Bodhisattva, who guided them toward unsurpassed enlightenment.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, consider this: the Lotus Sutra provides immeasurable benefit to all bodhisattvas and great beings. It swiftly carries them to unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. For this reason, all bodhisattvas, after the Buddha's passing, should constantly receive, maintain, read, recite, explain, and write this sutra[^5]."
## The Story of the Perpetual Reverent One
*At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

In ages past, there was a Buddha
Called Majestic Voice King,
Possessed of supernatural wisdom,
Who guided countless beings.
Gods and humans and asuras alike
Received his universal honor and worship.

This Buddha having reached parinirvāṇa,
When the true dharma was nearly exhausted,
The arrogant and contentious monks
Possessed tremendous power.

At that time appeared a bodhisattva,
Named the Never-Despiser,
Who came before all beings—
Monks, nuns, male and female laypeople—
And spoke these words of respect:

"I dare not despise you all,
Because you practice the bodhisattva path
And shall inevitably achieve Buddhahood."

The contentious monks and assembly
Replied with anger and disdain:
"Who granted you such wisdom
To declare our future enlightenment?
We need not your false declarations!"

Yet Never-Despiser, enduring this abuse
Through many years of practice,
Continued speaking his message of respect:
"You shall become Buddhas!"

When struck with sticks and stones,
The bodhisattva would withdraw,
Yet continue from a distance proclaiming:
"I do not despise you—
You shall become Buddhas!"

Through such constant proclamation,
The monks, nuns, and lay assemblies
Named him "the Never-Despiser."

As his final moments approached,
He heard in the void
The Buddha Medicine King's voice
Reciting the Lotus Sutra's verses—
Twenty million billion verses in total[^6].

Having received these complete verses,
His six sense-organs became purified,
His eye-sight became perfectly clear,
His hearing became keenly acute,
His sense of smell became perfectly refined,
His taste-perception became supremely exquisite,
His body-sensitivity became completely refined,
His mind became penetratingly clear[^7].

His lifespan was extended
Two hundred billion nayuta years,
And he proceeded to widely expound
This Lotus Sutra throughout the world.

The arrogant four assemblies,
Witnessing his great supernatural powers,
His eloquent dharma-speech,
His profound peaceful mastery,
All abandoned their contempt
And followed him as devoted disciples.

The Never-Despiser Bodhisattva
Thus led millions of billions of beings
To unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.

After his passing,
He encountered two billion buddhas,
All bearing the name Sunny-Moon Radiance,
In whose teachings he received and maintained
This Lotus Sutra,
Proclaiming it to the four assemblies,
Thus continuously perfecting his six senses.

He then encountered another two billion buddhas,
All called Cloud-Radiance Liberation Kings,
In whose dharma he again received, maintained,
And widely proclaimed this sutra
To countless assemblies,
Further developing the six purified senses.

He subsequently encountered countless billions of buddhas,
Through whom he continuously received and maintained
This Lotus Sutra,
Proclaiming it through innumerable assemblies,
Until his merits were fully perfected
And he attained perfect enlightenment[^8].

The Never-Despiser of ancient times—
He is none other than I myself!
Had I not received and maintained
This Lotus Sutra
In my former lives,
Had I not proclaimed it to others,
I could never have swiftly attained
This supreme enlightenment.

Those four assemblies of that age,
The monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—
Those who despised the Never-Despiser:
Through their contempt,
They were unable for two hundred billion eons
To encounter any Buddha,
To hear any dharma,
To perceive any sangha community.

Only after that karmic consequence was exhausted
Did they encounter the Never-Despiser again,
Who gradually guided them
Toward unsurpassed enlightenment[^9].

## Philosophical Implications

Chapter 20 represents the practical embodiment of all preceding teachings. The Never-Despiser story answers a question implicit throughout the sutra: "What does dharma-realization look like in concrete practice?" The answer is stunning in its simplicity and universality.

The chapter's brilliance lies in its apparent paradox. Never-Despiser practices contrary to Buddhist convention: he does not study sutras intensively, does not practice meditation, does not seek supernatural powers. Instead, he engages in what appears to be the simplest practice imaginable—reverence toward all beings. Yet through this single practice, he transforms himself and countless others.

The principle underlying Never-Despiser's practice is Buddha-nature universalism taken to radical extremes. Rather than recognizing Buddha-nature as a theoretical doctrine ("all beings possess Buddha-nature and can attain enlightenment"), Never-Despiser acts as if all beings have already achieved enlightenment. His proclamation "You shall become Buddhas!" is not a prediction of future attainment but a present-tense recognition. He sees through the degraded surface to the eternal Buddha-reality beneath.

The response to Never-Despiser's practice reveals the profound difficulty of recognizing one's own Buddha-nature. Those who despise him—who revile, strike, and curse him—are actually harming themselves. The text explicitly states that through contempt, they create the karma that separates them from Buddha-encounter for immense eons. Yet even this separation is eventually overcome. The Never-Despiser's dharma-transmission ultimately reaches even those who despised him, gradually transforming them.

This creates a paradoxical temporality. Never-Despiser encounters beings who are simultaneously in two conditions: they are future Buddhas (which is what Never-Despiser sees), yet they are currently unable to recognize this truth. They must undergo two hundred billion eons of karmic separation from Buddha-truth before they can receive the bodhisattva's teaching. The future and the present overlay one another; enlightenment exists eternally while its actualization in consciousness unfolds temporally.

# Chapter 21: The Tathāgata's Supernatural Powers

## The Cosmic Demonstration of Dharma-Transmission
At that time, myriads of bodhisattvas—numbering like the dust-particles of entire world-realms—emerged from beneath the earth. These were bodhisattvas who had previously dwelt in the Sahā world. They approached the Buddha, bowed with their heads to his feet, and addressed him: "World-Honored One, after you enter final nirvāṇa, in the lands where your various emanations have taught and subsequently passed away, we shall extensively proclaim this Lotus Sutra. Why? Because we ourselves desire to obtain this true, pure, supreme dharma. We shall receive it, maintain it, read and recite it, explain it, and offer reverent worship to it[^1]."

At that moment, the Tathāgata revealed his great supernatural powers before all assembled—before myriads of old bodhisattvas dwelling in the Sahā world, before myriads of monks and nuns, before male and female lay followers, before gods, dragons, and all types of supernatural beings. The Buddha extended his broad, long tongue upward until it reached the Brahma heavens, and from every pore of his body, he emitted innumerable rays of light, illuminating all ten directions of the world-system. All the precious trees beneath which were seated the Buddhas from the ten directions, as well as Śākyamuni Buddha and the eternally present Buddha (Prabhūtaratna), similarly extended their broad, long tongues and emitted vast rays of light[^2]. The display of supernatural power continued for one hundred thousand years.

Afterward, the Buddha and all those Buddhas withdrew their tongues. At that moment, all the Buddhas produced a single sound of coughing and a simultaneous finger-snap. These two sounds echoed throughout the ten directions of all world-systems. In all those world-systems, the very earth underwent six kinds of trembling: trembling, quaking, roaring, cracking, heaving, and surging upward. Through the Buddha's supernatural power, all beings throughout the ten directions perceived this Sahā world-realm: they saw the endless precious trees beneath which the Buddhas sat, and they perceived Śākyamuni Buddha together with the eternally present Buddha, surrounded by infinite assemblies of bodhisattvas and the four categories of disciples—all offering reverent worship[^3].

All the celestial beings then proclaimed aloud in the void: "Beyond myriads of incalculable billion-billion world-systems, there exists a realm named Sahā. Within it dwells a Buddha called Śākyamuni, who now teaches all bodhisattvas a great Mahāyāna sutra named the Lotus Sutra, teaching the bodhisattva-path, guarded and protected by all the Buddhas. You should all generate profound reverence, offer sincere worship, and respectfully honor Śākyamuni Buddha!"

When those innumerable beings heard this proclamation, all brought their palms together toward the Sahā world. They offered varieties of flowers, fragrances, garlands, silk banners, jeweled canopies, and precious objects from the ten directions. All these offered substances rose through the air like clouds accumulating, transforming into precious canopies that covered the Buddhas of the ten directions[^4]. In this moment, the ten directions became unified and unobstructed, appearing as a single Buddha-realm.

At that time, the Buddha addressed the bodhisattva assembly led by Viśiṣṭa Bodhisattva: "The supernatural power of all the Buddhas is immeasurable, incalculable, boundless, and inconceivable. If I were to spend immeasurable, incalculable billions upon billions of eons explaining the supernatural powers, the merit, and the benefit of this sutra, I could never exhaust them. Therefore, in brief: all the dharmas possessed by the Tathāgata, all the sovereign powers of the Tathāgata, and all the profoundest secret treasures of the Tathāgata, all the exceedingly profound matters of the Tathāgata—all are revealed and proclaimed in this sutra. For this reason, after the Tathāgata's passing, you should receive, maintain, read, recite, explain, and write this sutra in all lands. In any land where this sutra is received and maintained—whether in a monastic garden, forest, tree-shade, monastic dwelling, or lay residence, whether in a hall or pavilion, in mountain valleys or wilderness—all such places should have stupas erected and offerings presented. Why? Because you should understand that all such places are bodhi-seats. It is in such places that all the Buddhas have attained unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment. It is in such places that all the Buddhas have turned the dharma-wheel. It is in such places that all the Buddhas have entered final nirvāṇa[^5]."
## The Cosmic Verification of Dharma
*At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

All the Buddhas, saviors of the world,
Possess great supernatural powers,
Manifesting boundless miraculous deeds
To delight all sentient beings.

The tongue-faculty extends to the Brahma realms,
The body emits countless rays of light,
All to establish the bodhisattva path,
Revealing these extraordinary phenomena.

The sound of the Buddhas coughing,
And the sound of their finger-snapping,
Echo throughout the ten world-directions,
While the earth trembles with six kinds of motion.

Through the supernatural power of the Buddha,
All enable the maintenance of this sutra,
All the Buddhas rejoice together,
Revealing boundless supernatural powers[^6].

The merit and virtue of this person
Possesses no limits or boundary,
Like the endless space extending
In all ten directions without obstruction[^7].

Those who maintain this sutra
Have already seen me,
Have also perceived the Buddha Prabhūtaratna,
And all the emanation-Buddhas alike.

They have seen me in this present moment
Teaching the bodhisattva assembly.
Those who maintain this sutra
Enable me and my emanations,
Enable the eternally present Buddha,
All together to rejoice.

The Buddhas of the ten directions—
Both those of the present moment,
And those of the three times (past, present, future)—
All are seen and honored,
All receive offerings and attain joy[^8].

The Buddhas seated at the bodhi-tree,
The supreme secret dharma they obtained—
Those who maintain this sutra
Shall not long remain before obtaining them[^9].

Those who maintain this sutra
Possess inexhaustible eloquence
Regarding all dharma-meanings, terminology, and linguistic expressions,
Like wind moving through space with no obstruction.

After the Tathāgata's passing,
Know the sutra's meaning well,
Understand its causes and sequences,
And explain it according to the dharma.

Like the sun and moon illuminating
All darkness and obscurity,
Such a person walks through the world
Bringing light to all beings' darkness,

Teaching infinite bodhisattvas,
Establishing them in the one path (the Lotus teaching).

Therefore, those possessing wisdom,
Hearing of these merits,
After the Buddha's passing,
Should receive and maintain this sutra[^10].

Regarding the Buddha's path,
Without doubt or hesitation,
This person shall truly attain it[^11].

## Philosophical Implications

Chapter 21 functions as a cosmic exclamation point, a demonstration that validates everything taught in the preceding chapters. The supernatural display—the extended tongue reaching Brahma realms, the light-rays illuminating all directions, the earth's six-fold trembling, the voice proclaiming across cosmos—are not mere theatrical effects. They constitute a metaphysical claim: that the dharma of the Lotus Sutra is verified by the entire Buddha-universe.

The extended tongue reaching the Brahma realms possesses profound symbolic significance. In Buddhist cosmology, the Brahma realms represent the highest reaches of conditional existence. The tongue—the organ of speech—extended to this limit suggests that dharma-transmission reaches the extremity of what can be expressed. Moreover, in Buddhist physiology, the tongue symbolizes the power of communication. A tongue extended to the heavens suggests that the sutra's words possess cosmic-spanning power.

The simultaneous display by Buddhas in all ten directions creates a mandala of verification. The historical Buddha Śākyamuni does not stand alone; he is surrounded and supported by all Buddhas across all space. Each Buddha from every direction performs the identical supernatural display, creating a unified, cosmic dharma-transmission. No Buddha differs from any other; all teach the identical sutra. This suggests that the Lotus Sutra represents not a particular teacher's innovation but the universal dharma of all Buddhas.

The six-fold earth trembling—trembling, quaking, roaring, cracking, heaving, and surging—represents a complete cosmic response to the dharma's revelation. Earth is not passive matter but a responsive being. The dharma's truth manifests physically, affecting the fundamental structure of reality. These tremors can be understood as the universe's acknowledgment of dharma-truth.

Most significantly, the chapter establishes that dharma-transmission is not limited to living Buddha-presence. The historical Buddha will pass away into final nirvāṇa. Yet the sutra itself becomes a continuing manifestation of Buddha-presence. Any location where the sutra is received and maintained—whether monastery or forest or lay residence—becomes a bodhi-seat, a place of enlightenment-attainment. This radical principle means that the Buddha's teaching function continues eternally through the sutra-text itself.

The instruction to erect stupas wherever the sutra is maintained reflects this principle at the architectural level. The stupa traditionally houses relics of the Buddha. But here, the text itself is declared to be Buddha-equivalent. The place where the sutra dwells becomes sacred space requiring stupa-honors. This suggests a sophisticated understanding that dharma is not merely abstract truth but concrete presence.

The cloud-like accumulation of offerings rising toward the heavens symbolizes the circulation of merit. The sutra's teaching generates merit that rises to support all the Buddhas; simultaneously, the Buddhas' blessings descend to support dharma-transmission. There is a continuous exchange between the Buddha-realm and the human realm, mediated by the sutra-text.

The declaration "the ten directions become unified and unobstructed, appearing as a single Buddha-realm" represents perhaps the sutra's most radical vision. Normally, the ten directions are separated by immeasurable distances; each Buddha-realm is isolated. Yet through the dharma-transmission of the Lotus Sutra, all realms merge into a single unified field. The boundaries separating Buddha-realms dissolve. This suggests that the sutra accomplishes not merely salvation of individual beings but the fundamental unification of all Buddha-realms, creating a cosmic sangha-body.

# Chapter 22: Entrustment

## The Final Assignment of Dharma-Continuity
At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha rose from his dharma-seat, revealed great supernatural powers, and with his right hand touched the heads of innumerable bodhisattvas, speaking these words: "Through countless, incalculable eons, I have cultivated and perfected the supreme dharma of unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment. Now I entrust this dharma to all of you. You should all unite in mind and widely proclaim this dharma, causing it to increase and flourish[^1]."

Thus did the Buddha touch the heads of the bodhisattva assembly three times, each time declaring: "Through countless, incalculable eons, I have cultivated and perfected the supreme dharma of unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment. Now I entrust this dharma to all of you. You should receive and maintain it, widely proclaim it in all realms, allowing all beings to hear it completely. Why? Because I possess great compassion, complete absence of stinginess or miserliness, and no fear whatsoever. I am able to bestow upon all sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom, the Tathāgata's wisdom, and the spontaneously arising wisdom[^2]. All the Tathāgatas are great benefactors to all sentient beings. You too should follow the example of the Tathāgata, abandoning all stinginess. In the future age, when virtuous men and women who possess faith in the Tathāgata's wisdom approach you, you should widely expound this Lotus Sutra to them so that they may hear it fully. For what reason? In order that they might attain Buddha-wisdom[^3].

"Should any sentient beings not believe, not receive, and not maintain this sutra, then you should guide them through the remaining profound dharmas taught by the Tathāgata, demonstrating benefits to them through skillful teachings, giving joy and delight so that they gradually attain the bodhisattva path. All of you should thereby repay the graciousness of all the Tathāgatas[^4]."

At that moment, hearing the Buddha's instructions, all the bodhisattva assembly experienced profound joy that pervaded their entire being. Even greater reverence and respect arose within them. Bowing low with bent bodies, lowering their heads, and bringing their palms together, they collectively declared: "Just as the World-Honored One has instructed, we shall certainly fulfill this teaching completely. Please have no concern or anxiety, World-Honored One. We shall certainly receive and maintain, read and recite, widely proclaim, and explain this dharma in all lands, enabling all beings to hear it. We shall widely teach it, fulfilling the World-Honored One's instructions[^5]."

The bodhisattva assembly made this declaration three times: "Just as the World-Honored One has instructed, we shall certainly fulfill this teaching completely. Please have no concern, World-Honored One. We shall certainly comply with the World-Honored One's instructions, receiving, maintaining, reading, and reciting this dharma in all lands."

At that moment, Śākyamuni Buddha caused all the emanation-Buddhas from the ten directions—Buddhas seated beneath precious trees throughout the universe—to return to their respective lands. The Buddha then declared: "Each of you Buddhas should rest content. The multi-jeweled stupa of the eternally present Buddha (Prabhūtaratna), may it return to its original condition." Hearing this instruction, all these things occurred as the Buddha proclaimed[^6].

At that time, Prabhūtaratna Buddha, together with Śākyamuni Buddha and all the emanation-Buddhas, the boundless company of bodhisattvas numbering like dust-particles, the leaders of the bodhisattva assembly (the Viśiṣṭa group), the śrāvaka assemblies of the four categories (monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen), and all beings throughout the world—gods, humans, asuras, and all—heard the Buddha's proclamation and all experienced great delight. Bowing respectfully with their heads to the Buddha's feet, they accepted his instruction as an eternal law[^7].
## The Eternal Transmission
*At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

All the Buddhas, saviors of the world,
Dwelling in great supernatural power,
For the sake of the bodhisattva path,
Now entrust this dharma to you all.

My Buddha-dharma, accumulated across eons,
Through the cultivation of difficult practices,
Now I place within your hands—
Guard it and cause it to flourish[^8].

In all future worlds,
You should widely proclaim this teaching,
Never allowing it to be exhausted or lost,
So all beings may hear of it[^9].

Buddhas throughout the ten directions,
Both those present now and those of past and future,
Have all proclaimed through the gateway of skillful means,
But this sutra is supreme among all dharmas[^10].

Whoever receives and maintains this sutra,
Receives and maintains all the buddhas' dharmas;
Whoever reads and recites this sutra,
Reads and recites all the dharma spoken by all buddhas[^11].

Therefore practice with single-minded devotion,
Treat the sutra as the Buddha himself,
Just as you honor me with supreme respect,
So too honor this sutra without distinction.

In all places where this sutra dwells,
Whether in monasteries or in forests,
In gardens beneath trees or in dwellings,
Or in lecture-halls or any building—
In all such places should stupas be erected,
And all should make reverent offerings,
Gathering in masses like clouds,
Honoring this place as the Buddha's sacred site.

The Buddha, having attained enlightenment here,
Turns the dharma-wheel here,
Enters final nirvāṇa here—
All the Buddha-functions occur where the dharma dwells[^12].

After I enter the final extinction,
You should spread this sutra,
Causing all the world-systems
To hear of its teachings.

By this, you shall all repay
The kindness of the Tathāgata,
And quickly attain
Perfect enlightenment[^13].

## Philosophical Implications

Chapter 22 completes the Lotus Sutra's structure with an act of formal transmission. The Buddha, about to enter final nirvāṇa, entrusts the sutra-dharma to the assembled bodhisattvas and beings. This creates a legal and spiritual bond: the assembly vows to continue transmission; the Buddha authorizes this continuation.

The threefold touching of the bodhisattvas' heads carries profound significance. This is a gesture of blessing and authorization, appearing in multiple Buddhist contexts. More specifically, it echoes the Buddha's original awakening at the bodhi-tree, where he touched the earth to witness his enlightenment. Here, the Buddha touches the bodhisattvas' heads to witness and authorize their dharma-transmission capacity.

The language of the assignment itself deserves careful attention. The Buddha does not give merely a teaching or instruction but assigns "the dharma of unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment" itself. This is not a verbal transfer but a trans-temporal event. The Buddha places within the bodhisattvas' "hands" (metaphorically) the actual enlightenment-dharma that took him countless eons to perfect. This suggests a radical Buddhist principle: that enlightenment is not a personal achievement but a cosmic dharma that passes from Buddha to bodhisattva to future-Buddha across eons.

The emphasis on "refusing none and fearing none" deserves attention. The Buddha declares that he possesses "complete absence of stinginess" and "no fear whatsoever." In Buddhism, stinginess (mātcharya) is listed as a fundamental obstacle to generosity and enlightenment. The Buddha's complete absence of stinginess means unlimited generosity—specifically, the unreserved gift of enlightenment-dharma to all beings. His fearlessness means that this gift is offered regardless of whether beings believe or reject it.

The principle that Buddhas possess three wisdoms—the Buddha's wisdom, the Tathāgata's wisdom, and spontaneously-arising wisdom—represents a sophisticated Buddhist epistemology. The first wisdom involves knowing all dharmas; the second involves knowing all beings' capacities and inclinations; the third involves spontaneous, effortless knowing that requires no deliberation. The bodhisattvas are authorized to transmit these wisdoms.

The provision for those who "do not believe, do not receive, do not maintain" the sutra deserves careful attention. The Buddha does not declare such beings forever lost. Rather, he instructs the bodhisattvas to guide them through "remaining profound dharmas" and "skillful teachings" appropriate to their capacity. This reflects the principle of upaya (skillful means): dharma-teachers adjust their teaching to each being's capacity, recognizing that the Lotus Sutra represents one of infinite dharma-gates through which all beings eventually approach enlightenment.

The response of the assembly—their declaration made three times—mirrors the Buddha's threefold transmission. This creates a symmetrical structure: the Buddha speaks three times assigning the dharma; the assembly responds three times vowing to maintain it. This parallelism suggests perfect understanding and alignment.

The geographical distribution of the emanation-Buddhas returning to their respective lands symbolizes that dharma-transmission is not spatially limited. Buddhas in all directions return to their realms, yet remain connected through the unified dharma-transmission of the Lotus Sutra. Distance becomes irrelevant; through the sutra, all Buddha-realms maintain continuous connection.

The reincorporation of Prabhūtaratna Buddha's stupa—returning to its "original condition"—suggests that the stupa's manifestation served a specific function (verifying the sutra through its presence) that is now completed. The stupa dematerializes or returns to its eternal form, suggesting that temporal manifestations serve temporary purposes while eternal dharma persists.

The final declaration that all beings—"gods, humans, asuras, and all"—accept the instruction "as an eternal law" is crucial. The transmission is not merely to bodhisattvas or humans but to all categories of beings. Moreover, they accept it "as eternal law," suggesting that dharma-transmission acquires cosmic legal status. It becomes not merely spiritual practice but ontological necessity, woven into the structure of existence itself.

# Chapter 23: The Medicine King Bodhisattva's Original Practice

## The Bodhisattva's Extreme Offering
At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Prabhūtaratna: "Inquire of me regarding the Medicine King Bodhisattva's original practice. How did this bodhisattva cultivate? What dharma does he teach? Pray tell us the history of this one we honor[^1]."

Buddha replied: "In ages past, beyond measurement in incalculable eons, there existed a Buddha named Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue—the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, the One Perfectly Accomplished in Knowledge and Conduct, the Sugata, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassable Guide, the Tamer of the Untamed, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. He possessed eighty billion great bodhisattvas and an assembly of seventy-two trillion enlightened śrāvakas. That Buddha's lifespan spanned four million billion nayuta eons. The true dharma remained in that realm for a period measured in years equal to the dust-particles of a continent. The semblance dharma likewise persisted through such measure.

"In that realm, there existed a bodhisattva named All-Beings-Are-Delighted-by-the-Sight—a bodhisattva who had long cultivated the roots of virtue, offered reverence to innumerable Buddhas, and perfected profound wisdom. This bodhisattva had achieved numerous samādhis: the samādhi of displaying all forms, the samādhi of dharma-blossoming, the samādhi of pure virtue, the samādhi of celestial play, and countless others[^2].

"At that time, the Buddha Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue taught the Dharma-Blossom Sutra to all sentient beings. All-Beings-Are-Delighted-by-the-Sight heard this teaching and, wishing to demonstrate his understanding, entered the samādhi of displaying all forms. From within this samādhi, he caused himself to manifest in an ocean of amrita (divine nectar) within the void itself. Having perceived one hundred thousand kinds of precious flowers blooming in that ocean, he declared: 'The dharma I now perceive through the Dharma-Blossom Sutra is so profound! I vow to honor the Buddha and this supreme teaching through ultimate offering.'

"Having made this vow, the bodhisattva collected all the flowers from the ocean of amrita and, gathering them together, presented them to Buddha Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue. The vast assembly received this offering and rejoiced greatly[^3].

"Afterward, the bodhisattva reflected: 'Though I have offered precious flowers, my heart is not yet satisfied. I now vow to offer my very body as a gift of honor to this Supreme Dharma Sutra.'

"The bodhisattva then gathered together all the celestial bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, and beings of the heavens, and spoke: 'All sentient beings, now listen! I vow to make an offering of my own body to the Buddha Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue and to the Dharma-Blossom Sutra!' Having spoken, the bodhisattva began an extreme practice. He ingested all manner of fragrant waters and precious oils—sandalwood, aloeswood, and other aromatics—for one thousand two hundred years. His body became saturated with these precious substances. Then, wrapping himself in silk and jeweled vestments, and anointing himself with expensive oils, the bodhisattva used supernatural power to ignite his own body as an eternal offering.

"His burning body radiated light across eighty billion nayuta realms. All the Buddhas in these realms perceived this offering and spoke these words simultaneously: 'Excellent! Excellent! This virtuous man has accomplished the supreme offering! To offer flowers, fragrances, garlands, or even entire kingdoms and beloved family members to the Buddha cannot equal this supreme gift of one's own body! This is the supreme offering among all offerings, the most exalted offering among all offerings, given in honor of the dharma and Buddha-realization. O virtuous man, through this supreme sacrifice of your body, you have completed the bodhisattva path!'

"After the bodhisattva's body burned for one thousand two hundred years and was finally consumed, he was reborn in that same Buddha-realm in the royal family. His consciousness re-emerged in his mother's womb. At that moment, the bodhisattva addressed his father in verse:

*'Great King, hear now my words—*
*I have wandered in that place,*
*And suddenly obtained the samādhi*
*That manifests all forms.*
*I have cultivated the supreme offering,*
*And I have burned my body,*
*For I seek the incomparable wisdom,*
*The wisdom of the perfectly enlightened Buddha.'*

"Having spoken this verse, the bodhisattva said to his father: 'The Buddha Sun-Moon-Pure-Bright-Virtue remains present in that realm. I previously made offering to him and heard the Dharma-Blossom Sutra containing eight hundred trillion billion verses. Great King, I now vow to return to that Buddha's presence to honor him again.' With these words, the bodhisattva levitated into the void, ascending seven palm-trees' height, and approached the Buddha's presence where he again paid reverence and made offerings[^4].

"When this All-Beings-Are-Delighted-by-the-Sight Bodhisattva completed his remaining lifespan, he encountered two billion Buddhas, all called the Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddhas—Buddhas whose radiance illuminated all worlds—and in each Buddha's teaching he received, maintained, recited, and widely proclaimed the Dharma-Blossom Sutra. Because he taught this dharma to the four categories of disciples, his vision continuously clarified and he continued the practice of bodily offering.

"Subsequently, he encountered another two billion Buddhas, all called the Cloud Sovereign Lamp King Buddhas, and similarly received their teaching of the Dharma-Blossom Sutra. Through his continued proclamation, he further perfected the vision-clarity.

"Having encountered countless billions of Buddhas, received the Dharma-Blossom Sutra from all, and proclaimed it widely to the four categories of disciples, his complete enlightenment-wisdom was perfected. He thus attained supreme, perfect enlightenment.

"Prabhūtaratna, do you comprehend the meaning of my account? This All-Beings-Are-Delighted-by-the-Sight Bodhisattva—he is none other than the Medicine King Bodhisattva who sits here before us! Such are the bodhisattva's past accomplishments. This Medicine King has offered his own body to countless billions of Buddhas, sacrificing his form as supreme homage to the dharma. This bodhisattva has completed practice across countless eons. These accomplishments are immeasurable[^5].

"Should a virtuous man or woman aspire to perfect enlightenment and yet offer only a single finger or a single toe in homage to the Buddha-stupa—such an offering exceeds all offerings of kingdoms, wives, children, and entire world-systems! Furthermore, if a virtuous person fills the entire three-thousand-great-thousand-world-system with the seven jewels and offers them to Buddhas, bodhisattvas, solitary-buddhas, and arhats—such an offering pales before the merit of simply receiving and maintaining even a single four-line verse of this Dharma-Blossom Sutra!"

> **Note**: The Kumārajīva translation (T0262) does not contain verses for Chapter 23. Verses found in some other translations and the Sanskrit version are omitted here to maintain fidelity to the Taishō text.

## Philosophical Implications

Chapter 23 presents enlightenment-practice through its most extreme form: bodily self-immolation as dharma-offering. This raises profound questions about the nature of sacrifice, suffering, and the transformation of physical body into sacred presence.

The bodhisattva's practice unfolds in carefully structured stages. First comes the perception through samādhi (samadhi of displaying all forms). Second comes the flower-offering, which is subsequently recognized as insufficient. Third comes the ultimate sacrifice: the burning of one's own body sustained through aromatic-saturation for centuries.

The comparative logic is essential: even the most elaborate material offerings—kingdoms, treasures, family members—cannot equal the supreme offering of bodily self-immolation. This suggests a metaphysical claim that the body is ultimately the most valuable asset a being possesses. To surrender it is to surrender one's fundamental claim to existence.

Yet paradoxically, the chapter does not treat this sacrifice as termination but as transformation. The body burns for twelve hundred years yet consciousness is not destroyed. The bodhisattva is reborn immediately in that same realm, now embodied as a prince. What burns is not consciousness but form. The text presents this paradox without resolving it: the body can be simultaneously consumed and retained, destroyed and renewed.

The multiplication of Buddha-encounters is significant. This bodhisattva does not encounter one Buddha and achieve enlightenment. Rather, the pattern repeats across billions of Buddha-epochs. Each encounter involves the same practice: receiving the dharma-blossom sutra, proclaiming it, maintaining it. There is no final arrival, no termination of practice. Enlightenment emerges not from a single achievement but from eternal recurrence of the same fundamental practice.

The naming of this bodhisattva is itself instructive. "All-Beings-Are-Delighted-by-the-Sight" later becomes "Medicine King." The transformation from a name emphasizing visible form to one emphasizing healing suggests a spiritual development. The bodhisattva begins focused on perceptual transformation (all beings seeing) and ends focused on healing transformation (medicine-application).

The chapter also articulates a sophisticated economics of merit. Material offering, no matter how elaborate, produces merit limited by scarcity and finiteness. A person can give treasures and kingdoms because they are finite. But self-offering is infinite: the body's burning does not deplete the dharma; rather, each moment of burning constitutes a new offering. Time itself becomes the measure of gift-magnitude.

# Chapter 24: The Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva

## The Interdimensional Visitor
At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha emitted the light-marks of universal brilliance from between his eyebrows, illuminating to the east one hundred eight hundred million nayuta realms. Beyond that number of worlds, there existed a realm named Pure-Light-Adorned. In that realm dwelt a Buddha named Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom-Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, the One Perfectly Accomplished in Knowledge and Conduct, the Sugata, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassable Guide, the Tamer of the Untamed, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. He was surrounded and honored by innumerable and incalculable assemblies of great bodhisattvas as he expounded the dharma[^1].

At that time, the light from the Buddha's eyebrow-mark illuminated the Pure-Light-Adorned realm, causing that Buddha and his assembly to perceive Śākyamuni Buddha's dharma-transmission. Within that realm dwelt a bodhisattva named Wonderful-Sound, one who had long cultivated roots of virtue, paid reverence to countless billions of Buddhas, and achieved profound wisdom. This bodhisattva had perfected eighteen kinds of dharma-gates (meditative absorptions and capacities), including the Marvelous-Banner Samādhi, the Dharma-Blossom Samādhi, the Pure-Virtue Samādhi, the Celestial-Play Samādhi, the Boundless Samādhi, the Wisdom-Seal Samādhi, the Gate of Understanding-All-Beings'-Language, the Samādhi of Gathering All Merits, the Pure Samādhi, the Divine-Play-Through-Powers Samādhi, the Wisdom-Torch Samādhi, the Sovereign-Adornment Samādhi, the Pure-Illumination Samādhi, the Treasury-of-Purity Samādhi, the Unshared Samādhi, the Solar-Revolution Samādhi, and countless billions of other dharma-gates[^2].

When the Buddha's light illuminated this bodhisattva's body, Wonderful-Sound immediately addressed his Buddha, Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom: "World-Honored One, I perceive that the light from Śākyamuni Buddha's form reaches here. I wish to journey to the Sahā world-realm, to pay reverence to, to draw near to, to offer worship to Śākyamuni Buddha, and to see Mañjuśrī the Dharma-Prince and other bodhisattvas, including Medicine King and Courageous-Giver. I also wish to hear the Dharma-Blossom Sutra[^3]."

His Buddha, Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom, replied: "My child, do not regard the Sahā realm with disdain or contempt. Why? Because the Sahā world is rocky and uneven, filled with dirt and soil. The body of Śākyamuni Buddha is diminutive, and the bodhisattvas too are small in stature. Yet your body measures forty-two thousand yojanas, while my body measures six hundred eighty thousand yojanas. Your form is supremely beautiful, adorned with hundreds of thousands of blessings and resplendent light, incomparably magnificent. When you travel there, do not regard that realm or its Buddha and bodhisattvas with contempt[^4]."

Wonderful-Sound replied to his Buddha: "World-Honored One, my journey to the Sahā world is entirely the power of the Tathāgata. It is the Tathāgata's miraculous display, the Tathāgata's virtue and wisdom adorning all things[^5]."

Having said this, Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva did not rise from his seat, his body remained unmoved, yet through the power of samādhi, he manifested in the Sahā realm at Vulture Peak Mountain. Before the Buddha's dharma-seat, he created eighty-four thousand jeweled lotus flowers: their stems were made of refined gold, their leaves of white silver, their pistils of vajra-stone, their calyxes of precious carnelian-ruby stone[^6].

At that time, Mañjuśrī the Dharma-Prince, observing these lotus flowers, addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what is the cause and significance of this miraculous manifestation? What auspicious sign do these countless thousands of lotus flowers, with stems of refined gold, leaves of silver, pistils of vajra, and calyxes of precious stones, portend[^7]?"

Śākyamuni Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī: "The Great Bodhisattva Wonderful-Sound desires to come from the Pure-Light realm, together with eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas, to visit this Sahā world-realm, to pay reverence, to draw near, to offer worship to me, and to hear the Dharma-Blossom Sutra[^8]."

Mañjuśrī asked: "World-Honored One, what virtuous roots has this bodhisattva cultivated? What dharma has this bodhisattva practiced? What samādhi does this bodhisattva dwell in? I wish to understand the name of this samādhi, that we too might cultivate and practice it. If one cultivates this samādhi, one may behold this bodhisattva's magnificent form, the marks of his bearing and deportment. I pray that the World-Honored One will display his miraculous power so that this bodhisattva comes, and allow us all to perceive him[^9]."

The Buddha told Mañjuśrī: "The eternally-present Buddha Prabhūtaratna shall display his form and reveal this bodhisattva's appearance[^10]."

At that moment, Prabhūtaratna Buddha addressed Wonderful-Sound from the jeweled stupa: "Come, virtuous man. The Dharma-Prince Mañjuśrī wishes to perceive your form[^8]."

Then Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva disappeared from the Pure-Light realm and, together with eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas, journeyed to the Sahā world. Wherever they passed, the six kinds of earth-trembling occurred, and the sky rained precious lotus flowers. Celestial music played spontaneously without being played. The Great Bodhisattva's eyes resembled vast blue lotus flowers. His face was exceedingly beautiful and dignified, surpassing the magnificence created by the merger of a hundred thousand billion moons. His body shone with the radiance of refined gold, adorned with hundreds of thousands of merits and virtues. His magnificence blazed with resplendent light; his marks and signs were all complete, as if embodying the steadfast nature of the mighty Nārāyaṇa[^11].

He ascended the jeweled platform, rose seven palm-trees high in the void, and approached Vulture Peak Mountain together with his bodhisattva-assembly. Upon arrival, he descended from the jeweled platform and, holding an ornament of pearls worth hundreds of thousands, approached Śākyamuni Buddha, bowed with his head to the Buddha's feet, and presented the ornament, speaking:

"World-Honored One, the Buddha Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom sends his regards. He inquires: Does the World-Honored One experience few ailments, few sufferings, and does he dwell in ease? Do the four elements remain in harmony? Is the world bearable? Are the people easy to teach? Do they experience little greed, anger, delusion, jealousy, and stinginess? Do they show respect to parents, honor monks, avoid perverse views and unwholesome thoughts, and guard their five senses well? Are the people able to overcome demonic armies? Has the eternally-present Buddha Prabhūtaratna, who entered final extinction ages ago, come to listen to the dharma? And how is the eternally-present Buddha—is he peaceful, few-suffering, and able to remain permanently? World-Honored One, I wish to behold the eternally-present Buddha. Please reveal him so that I may see[^12]."

Śākyamuni Buddha said to Prabhūtaratna: "This Great Bodhisattva Wonderful-Sound wishes to meet you."

Prabhūtaratna replied to Wonderful-Sound: "Excellent, excellent, virtuous man! You have come to this realm to honor Śākyamuni Buddha, to hear the Dharma-Blossom Sutra, and to see Mañjuśrī and others. You have accomplished this well[^13]."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Dharma-Virtue asked the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what virtuous roots has this Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva cultivated? What dharmas does he practice to possess such miraculous power?"

The Buddha replied to Dharma-Virtue: "In ages past, there was a Buddha named Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Sovereign—the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One. In the dharma of that Buddha, Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva cultivated celestial music as offering for twelve thousand years, presenting to that Buddha one hundred thousand varieties of musical instruments. Additionally, he offered eighty-four thousand seven-jeweled bowls. Through this karma, he was born in the Pure-Light-Adorned realm and acquired this miraculous power[^14].

"Dharma-Virtue, do you now see Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva sitting here before you? Though his body appears to dwell in this place, he simultaneously manifests in countless forms throughout the ten directions, teaching the Dharma-Blossom Sutra to all sentient beings. Sometimes he appears as a Brahma-king, sometimes as Śakra, sometimes as a self-mastering deity, sometimes as a great self-mastering deity, sometimes as a celestial general, sometimes as King Vaiśravaṇa, sometimes as a Cakravartin-king, sometimes as a smaller king, sometimes as a clan-leader, sometimes as a householder, sometimes as an official, sometimes as a Brahmin, sometimes as a monk or nun, sometimes as a male or female lay follower, sometimes as a wife of a householder or official, sometimes as a Brahmin woman, sometimes as a boy or girl, or even as a divine dragon, nāga, yakṣa, gandharva, asura, garuda, kinnara, mahoraga, human or non-human being. He manifests in these forms to teach the dharma. And he saves even those in the hell-realms, hungry ghost realms, animal realms, and the difficult-to-escape realms. He even appears in royal palaces as a female form to teach the dharma[^15]."

The Buddha continued: "Dharma-Virtue, Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva performs such miraculous transformations and through wisdom illuminates the Sahā world, enabling all sentient beings to understand according to their capacities. Likewise, in the ten-directional worlds numbering like the sands of the Ganges River, he manifests in similar ways. Depending on whom he encounters: if a being requires the form of a śrāvaka to be taught, he manifests that form; if a solitary-buddha, he manifests that form; if a bodhisattva, he manifests that form; if a Buddha, he manifests the Buddha-form; if a being requires extinction to reach liberation, he demonstrates that extinction[^16]."

Dharma-Virtue Bodhisattva asked: "World-Honored One, this bodhisattva has cultivated such profound virtue. In what samādhi does he dwell such that he can manifest these transformations and benefit countless beings?"

The Buddha replied: "This samādhi is called 'Manifesting All Forms.' Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva dwells in this samādhi and thereby benefits countless sentient beings[^17]."

When the Dharma-Blossom Sutra regarding the Coming and Going of Wonderful-Sound was taught, the eighty-four thousand beings who had journeyed with Wonderful-Sound all obtained the Samādhi of Manifesting All Forms. Moreover, countless bodhisattvas throughout the Sahā world and the ten directions obtained this samādhi and dharma-gate[^8].

After paying reverence and offering to Śākyamuni Buddha and the stupa of the eternally-present Buddha, Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva returned to his own realm together with the eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas. As they traveled through all the lands they passed, six-fold trembling occurred, precious lotus flowers rained, and hundreds of millions of kinds of celestial music played.

Having returned to his realm, Wonderful-Sound approached the Buddha Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom together with the eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas and addressed him: "World-Honored One, I have journeyed to the Sahā world and derived great benefit for all sentient beings. I have seen Śākyamuni Buddha, perceived the stupa of the eternally-present Buddha Prabhūtaratna, and met Mañjuśrī the Dharma-Prince and other bodhisattvas including Medicine King and Courageous-Giver. I have also enabled these eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas to obtain the Samādhi of Manifesting All Forms. Moreover, through teaching this teaching of the Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva's Coming-and-Going, forty-two thousand celestial deities have obtained the recognition of the non-arising of dharmas, and the Bodhisattva Dharma-Virtue has obtained the Dharma-Blossom Samādhi[^19]."
## The Transformation-Manifestation
*At that time, the Buddha wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

From the eastern realm, beyond reckoning,
From the Pure-Light-Adorned World,
There came a bodhisattva named Wonderful-Sound,
Together with eighty-four thousand beings[^20].

He cultivated virtue in the ancient past,
And made celestial-music offerings
To the Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Sovereign,
For twelve thousand years continuously.

Through this offering, he attained realization,
And was born in that pure realm,
Where he dwells perfected in all merits,
In the light-adorned paradise.

He manifests infinite forms,
In all the worlds of the ten directions,
Teaching the dharma in countless ways,
Transforming according to each being's need[^21].

If one requires a Buddha-form for teaching,
He manifests as Buddha;
If one requires a bodhisattva-form,
He manifests accordingly.

If one requires extinction to reach peace,
He demonstrates that nirvāṇa;
In such boundless manifestations,
He performs his sacred work.

Upon hearing Śākyamuni Buddha's name,
And learning of the Dharma-Blossom Sutra,
He journeyed across incalculable worlds,
With eighty-four thousand attending companions.

Eighty-four thousand precious lotus flowers,
With golden stems and silver leaves,
Adorned with diamond pistils,
And ruby calyxes in profusion[^22].

The earth trembled with six-fold motion,
While precious flowers fell like rain,
And celestial music played spontaneously,
As the great assembly perceived his coming.

This bodhisattva's body measures vastly,
Forty-two thousand yojanas in extent,
Adorned with hundreds of thousands of marks,
Resplendent with wisdom and merit[^23].

The Buddha's eyebrow-light revealed him,
And all beheld the great being's form,
And heard the dharma he expounded,
The path of manifesting all forms.

All those who traveled with him,
Gained the samādhi of manifestation,
And forty-two thousand celestial deities,
Obtained the dharma-eye of recognition.

After paying reverence to the eternal Buddha,
And to the stupa of Prabhūtaratna,
The Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva returned,
To his own Pure-Light realm.

## Philosophical Implications

Chapter 24 demonstrates a revolutionary principle: that bodhisattvas can exist in multiple Buddha-realms simultaneously and maintain autonomous agency even while being expressions of another being's miraculous power. The paradox is emphasized repeatedly: Wonderful-Sound "did not rise from his seat, his body remained unmoved, yet through the power of samādhi" he manifested elsewhere.

This suggests a Buddhist understanding of consciousness that is radically non-local. The bodhisattva's consciousness is not confined to a single body but can inhabit multiple manifestations without fragmentation. This is not reincarnation (sequential birth in different forms) but simultaneous manifestation (existing in multiple forms at once).

# Chapter 25: Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva's Gateway of Universal Access

---

## Imperial Preface to the Avalokiteśvara Universal Gate Chapter
### 御製觀世音普門品經序

*Imperial Preface by the Yongle Emperor*
*(永樂九年五月初一日 — May 1, 1411)*

---

Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, with a heart of adamantine resolve, responds inexhaustibly to all transformations. Through sovereign spiritual powers, [this Bodhisattva] travels freely throughout the Dharma-realm, entering micro-dust lands to expound the Dharma and bring salvation. Possessed of wondrous marks in full, [this Bodhisattva's] great vow is vast as the ocean. Whoever has the karmic connection and arouses a pure mind—the moment they raise their voice to call upon [this Bodhisattva], [this Bodhisattva] immediately responds to that sound, and all their desires are fulfilled according to their wishes.

The Universal Gate Chapter of the *Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma* is the true teaching for liberating [beings] from suffering and affliction. If one can constantly contemplate this sutra, the moment a single thought arises, one immediately perceives the victorious marks of Great Compassion, able to extinguish all suffering; its merit is inconceivable.

I [the Emperor] reflect that the Way of Heaven brings fortune to the good and calamity to the licentious; therefore, the Buddha revealed karmic retribution to make people do good and not dare to do evil. Heaven and Hell are both made by human actions—they do not depart from within one's own heart. Therefore, those who do good ascend to Heaven; those who do evil fall into Hell.

Loyal ministers, filial children, auspicious people, and steadfast gentlemen—their minds are Buddha. Therefore, divine spirits protect them and their karmic obstructions are entirely eliminated. Thus, in life they do not transgress the laws, and in death they do not fall into uninterrupted [Hell].

As for cruel and obstinate people who are bent on doing evil, who discard the Five Relationships like worn-out brooms and tread upon criminal law as if drinking something sweet, who would rather feed rākṣasas than revere the Buddha's Way—human nature is fundamentally good. Those who do evil are merely distorted by their temperament. If they can transform their minds, change their thoughts, cultivate self-reflection, and approach with caution, then in an instant evil can become good. To do good is to become a good person. The faults accumulated in the past become like a speck of dust in the vast sky, like a flake of snow in a red-hot furnace—cleansed and purified completely. Though karmic retribution exists, where shall it be applied?

I constantly reflect upon this. I only fear that people of the world, having faults, do not know to reform, but willingly abandon themselves. Therefore, I have promulgated this sutra so that virtuous gentlemen may forever strengthen their minds in upholding the precepts and broadly receive immeasurable blessing. The merit of doing good—how can it have any limit!

*The first day of the fifth month of the ninth year of the Yongle reign*

## The Bodhisattva of Boundless Compassion
At that time, the Bodhisattva Boundless-Intention rose from his seat, bowed respectfully with his head to the Buddha's feet, and posed this inquiry: "World-Honored One, I wish to ask: For what reason is the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara called by this name[^1]?"

The Buddha replied: "Excellent question, Boundless-Intention. If countless billions of sentient beings experiencing suffering hear the name Avalokiteśvara and call upon this bodhisattva with sincere intention, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will immediately perceive the sound of their invocation. That being will at once gain liberation. For this reason, this bodhisattva is named Avalokiteśvara—the One Who Perceives the World's Sounds of Suffering[^2].

"If a being faces great fire and calls upon Avalokiteśvara, the flames cannot burn such a person, because the bodhisattva's majestic spiritual power prevents the fire from destroying them. If one is swept away by a great flood and cries out to Avalokiteśvara, one will suddenly find oneself in shallow water. If a hundred thousand billion sentient beings venture onto the great ocean seeking treasures—silver, lapis lazuli, crystal, agate, coral, amber, pearls and other jewels—and their boat is caught in a black wind and driven toward the realm of the rākṣasa demons, a single person among them calling upon Avalokiteśvara will rescue all from the danger of the demons[^3].

"If someone faces impending execution and invokes Avalokiteśvara, the executioner's weapons will shatter into fragments and the condemned person will escape. If a being is bound with chains or shackles and calls upon this bodhisattva, all restraints will break free, and that person will attain liberation. If a region is filled with countless night-demons and rākṣasas intending to cause harm, and they hear the name Avalokiteśvara invoked, these harmful beings will not dare even look upon the invocant with malice, much less cause injury[^4].

"Moreover, Boundless-Intention, if a being harbors excessive lust and constantly honors and reveres Avalokiteśvara, that being will be liberated from lust. If one is enslaved by anger, constant reverence to Avalokiteśvara brings liberation from anger. If one is trapped in delusion, such reverence brings freedom from delusion. Therefore, in this Sahā world, he is called the Giver of Fearlessness (施無畏者)[^5].

"Avalokiteśvara possesses such great divine power. If one wishes to bear a son, one should reverence and offer to this bodhisattva, and one will birth a virtuous, wise, and meritorious son. If one wishes a daughter, one will birth a beautiful, accomplished, and virtuous daughter, beloved and respected by all.

"Boundless-Intention, any sentient being who venerates Avalokiteśvara will not lose the fruit of that reverence. For this reason, all beings should always turn their thoughts toward this bodhisattva.

"If someone sustains the names of sixty-two billion Bodhisattvas equal to the dust of the Ganges River, and provides them with all necessities—food, clothing, bedding, and medicine—throughout their lives, what merit would they accumulate?"

Boundless-Intention replied: "Immeasurable, World-Honored One."

The Buddha declared: "If another person sustains the name of Avalokiteśvara, even offering a single moment of reverence, the merit would be identical—no difference whatsoever. Even through incalculable billions of eons, the merit could never be exhausted[^6].

"Boundless-Intention, if I were to teach all the dharmas concerning how Avalokiteśvara traverses this Sahā world, in what manner Avalokiteśvara teaches the dharma through skillful means, the discussion would require incalculable eons. Therefore, in summary: all sentient beings experiencing anxiety and distress, if they hear of Avalokiteśvara, will find immediate relief through the bodhisattva's power of wise compassion. For this reason, all should trust in Avalokiteśvara[^7]."
## The Thirty-Three Manifestations
Then Buddha continued: "Boundless-Intention, if sentient beings require the form of a Buddha to be taught and liberated, Avalokiteśvara will manifest as a Buddha and teach them the dharma. If they require the form of a solitary-buddha to achieve liberation, the bodhisattva will manifest as a solitary-buddha. If they require a śrāvaka-form, the bodhisattva manifests accordingly—the bodhisattva can manifest as a Brahma-king, as Śakra, as a self-mastering deity, as a great self-mastering deity, as a celestial general, as King Vaiśravaṇa, as a Cakravartin-king, as a smaller king[^8].

"If they require the form of a householder to be taught, Avalokiteśvara manifests as a householder. If they require the form of an official, merchant, Brahmin, or member of any other occupation, the bodhisattva manifests accordingly.

"If they require the form of a monk, nun, male lay follower, or female lay follower, the bodhisattva manifests as such. If a being is to be liberated through the appearance of a wife, the bodhisattva manifests as a wife; through a concubine, as a concubine; through a daughter, as a daughter; through a mother, as a mother. If one requires manifestation as a divine being, a dragon, a yakṣa, a gandharva, an asura, a garuda, a kinnara, a mahoraga, a human, or a non-human being—in all these forms, Avalokiteśvara manifests to teach and liberate.

"If a being is to be liberated through the appearance of an arhat, the bodhisattva manifests as an arhat. If one requires the manifestation of a Pratyeka-Buddha, the form manifests accordingly. Moreover, Avalokiteśvara manifests even as a Vajrapāṇi (Vajra-holding Spirit). In such unlimited ways, through countless forms, in all the worlds of the ten directions, the bodhisattva travels, liberating all beings. For this reason, all should turn their sincere attention toward Avalokiteśvara and cultivate reverence[^9]."
## *[Verses Translated by the Sui Dynasty Śramaṇa Jñānagupta]*

> **Note**: Kumārajīva's original Chinese translation (姚秦, 406 CE) contained only the prose section above. The following verses (重頌) were translated later by the North Indian Śramaṇa Jñānagupta (闍那崛多) during the Sui Dynasty and subsequently integrated into the canonical text.

*At that time, Boundless-Intention wished to restate these teachings in verse:*

O World-Honored One of wondrous form,
I now inquire of you again:
Why is this bodhisattva called by this name?
What is the source of Avalokiteśvara's designation[^10]?

The Buddha replied to Boundless-Intention:
Listen to the Practice of Avalokiteśvara,
This bodhisattva responds skillfully in all realms,
Establishing profound vows across countless eons.

The power of Avalokiteśvara's vow is immeasurable as the ocean,
Having served infinite billions of Buddhas, continuing without measure,
By cultivating profound wisdom and boundless compassion,
The bodhisattva responds to all cries and delivers all beings[^11].

If malicious intent arises and someone pushes you into a great pit of fire,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And the fire will transform into a lotus pond.
Or if swept away by a violent flood,
Drowning seems certain,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And you will find yourself in shallow waters.

If you are caught in a great ocean storm,
While seeking precious treasures,
With waves high as mountains and demons threatening,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And you shall be delivered safely.

If facing execution, blades and weapons raised against you,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And the weapons will shatter into fragments,
And you will escape unharmed.

If bound in chains or locked in prison stocks,
Your hands and feet shackled,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And the restraints will fall away,
Your liberation complete.

When a region is filled with demons and yakṣas,
Intending to disturb and torment people,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And even their hateful glances will not fall upon you,
Much less can they do you harm[^12].

If curses, poisons, or witchcraft are employed against you,
Meant to injure your body,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And all such harm will rebound to the sender.

If you encounter wicked rākṣasas or poisonous dragons,
Fierce beasts with sharp teeth and claws,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And all will flee in all directions.

If surrounded by threatening serpents, scorpions,
Their poison smoke burning like fire,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And these will immediately turn back and flee.

When thunder roars and lightning flashes,
Hail falls and rain pours down,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And all these disturbances will clear away.

Boundless beings in distress,
Oppressed by countless sufferings,
Through the wondrous wisdom and power of Avalokiteśvara,
All can be liberated from suffering.

The Bodhisattva possesses supernatural power,
With vast expedient skill and boundless compassion,
In all lands throughout the ten directions,
The bodhisattva manifests in every place.

In all the evil realms—
Hell-realm, hungry ghost realm, animal realm—
And in all the places of difficulty and hardship,
The Bodhisattva manifests to liberate all beings.

He appears as the king of all heavens,
Or as the king of universal rulers,
As the sovereign Brahma-king,
Or as Śakra, lord of the thirty-three heavens,
Or as governors and ministers,
Appearing wherever called, in whatever form needed.

In the palaces of royalty and nobility,
The bodhisattva appears as a female form,
Teaching the dharma to those who need such manifestation.

Perfect perception of all sounds—pure light!
The light of wisdom breaking through all darkness,
The light that vanquishes all suffering and disaster,
This is why all should revere this bodhisattva.

With the eyes of compassion watching all beings,
With the heart of compassion radiating boundless love,
With countless merits and virtues,
Avalokiteśvara sees and relieves the world's pain[^13].

O bodhisattva of sincere vow,
Ocean-deep compassion, immeasurable in extent,
World after world, throughout all times,
You manifest as protector of all sentient beings.

True Regard, Pure Regard,
Vast Wisdom Regard,
Regard of Pity and Regard of Loving-Kindness—
Constantly desired, constantly looked up to[^14].

All who hear of Avalokiteśvara,
And keep that name ever in their heart,
Never falling back in their practice,
Will swiftly attain Buddhahood.

If one vows to support sixty-two billion bodhisattvas,
Offering them sustenance throughout their lives,
The merit would be immeasurable indeed,
But not to compare with one who hears

And venerates Avalokiteśvara's name,
Even for a single moment, with sincere heart,
The merit is exactly equal,
Enduring through all future eons.

## Philosophical Implications

Chapter 25 represents the Lotus Sutra's most accessible teaching. Where earlier chapters emphasized abstract doctrines (Buddha-nature universality, eternal transmission, cosmic verification), Chapter 25 offers immediate, practical compassion available through simple invocation.

The principle of Avalokiteśvara's responsiveness—"perceives the sound of suffering"—suggests that compassion is not earned through elaborate practice but is eternally available to those in distress. The bodhisattva does not require payment, ritual preparation, or spiritual qualification. One need only call. This democracy of access contradicts hierarchical religious systems requiring priestly mediation or prolonged study.

The enumeration of thirty-three manifestation-forms (Buddha, solitary-buddha, śrāvaka, Brahma-king, Śakra, various deities, kings, officials, merchants, Brahmins, monks, nuns, lay followers, various family members, diverse beings from dragons to demons, arhat, pratyeka-buddha, bodhisattva) represents the principle that compassion adapts to every condition. There is no being too lowly, no situation too hopeless for compassionate manifestation.

The paradox of manifestation deserves attention. Avalokiteśvara's true form remains metaphysically unclear. The chapter does not specify what Avalokiteśvara "really is" beneath the manifestations. This suggests that the bodhisattva's essence is precisely this capacity for unlimited adaptation. Compassion has no fixed form; it becomes whatever is needed.

The comparison of merit (sustaining sixty-two billion bodhisattvas versus invoking Avalokiteśvara once) inverts conventional merit-hierarchies. Enormous effort and elaborate practice produce less merit than a single moment of sincere invocation. This emphasizes that enlightenment-potential is immediately available, not something requiring lengthy cultivation.

The emphasis on "hearing the name" is significant. The name "Avalokiteśvara" is not merely verbal but carries power. To speak or hear this name is to activate compassion-presence. The name and the bodhisattva are not separable; calling the name calls forth the reality.

# Chapter 26: The Dharani of Protective Formulas

## The Protective Commitments
At that time, the Bodhisattva Medicine King rose from his seat, bowed respectfully, and addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, if virtuous men and women receive and maintain this Dharma-Blossom Sutra, whether they read it, recite it, understand it, or write it out, how much merit would they obtain?"

The Buddha replied to Medicine King: "If a virtuous man or woman were to make offerings to eight hundred million billion nayuta Ganges-river-sand-number of Buddhas, what do you think? Would they accumulate immeasurable merit?"

Medicine King responded: "Immeasurable indeed, World-Honored One."

The Buddha declared: "If a virtuous man or woman receives and maintains this sutra—even simply receiving one four-line verse, reading it aloud, understanding its meaning, and practicing according to it—the merit accumulated would be equally immeasurable[^1]."

Then Medicine King Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I now offer to all dharma-teachers the protective mantra-formula (dharani), so that those who recite it will be protected and guarded."

Then Medicine King spoke the protective mantra:

*Ān-ěr (安爾), Màn-ěr (曼爾), Mó-nì (摩禰), Mó-mó-nì (摩摩禰), Zhǐ-lì (旨隸), Zhē-lí-dì (遮梨第), Shē-miē (賒咩)[^ph1], Shē-lǚ-duō-wěi (賒履多瑋), Shān-dì (羶帝), Mù-dì (目帝), Mù-duō-lǚ (目多履), Suō-lǚ (娑履), Ā-wěi-suō-lǚ (阿瑋娑履), Sāng-lǚ (桑履), Suō-lǚ (娑履), Chā-yì (叉裔), Ā-chā-yì (阿叉裔), Ā-qí-nì (阿耆膩), Shān-dì (羶帝), Shē-lǚ (賒履), Tuó-luó-ní (陀羅尼), Ā-lú-jiā-pó-suō-bǒ-zhè-pí-chā-nì (阿盧伽婆娑簸蔗毗叉膩), Nǐ-pí-tì (禰毗剃), Ā-biàn-duō-luó-nǐ-lǚ-tì (阿便哆邏禰履剃), Ā-dàn-duō-bō-lì-shū-dì (阿亶哆波隸輸地), Ōu-jiū-lì (漚究隸), Móu-jiū-lì (牟究隸), Ā-luó-lì (阿羅隸), Bō-luó-lì (波羅隸), Shǒu-jiā-chà (首迦差), Ā-sān-mó-sān-lǚ (阿三磨三履), Fó-tuó-pí-jí-lì-zhì-dì (佛馱毗吉利袠帝), Dá-mó-bō-lì-chà-dì (達磨波利差帝), Sēng-qié-niè-qú-shā-nǐ (僧伽涅瞿沙禰), Pó-shě-pó-shě-shū-dì (婆舍婆舍輸地), Màn-duō-luó (曼哆邏), Màn-duō-luó-chā-yè-duō (曼哆邏叉夜多), Yóu-lóu-duō (郵樓哆), Yóu-lóu-duō-jiāo-shě-lüè (郵樓哆憍舍略), È-chā-luó (惡叉邏), È-chā-yě-duō-yě (惡叉冶多冶), Ā-pó-lú (阿婆盧), Ā-mó-ruò-nà-duō-yè (阿磨若那多夜)*

Medicine King declared: "World-Honored One, this mantra-formula of protection has been spoken by sixty-two billion Ganges-river-sand-number of Buddhas. Any who harm this dharma-teacher through this protection would thereby harm all those Buddhas[^2]."

At that time, the Buddha praised Medicine King: "Excellent! Excellent, Medicine King! Through compassion for the dharma-teachers, you have spoken this protective formula. This brings immeasurable benefit to all sentient beings."

Then Courageous-Giver Bodhisattva rose from his seat and addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I too wish to offer protection to those who receive, read, recite, understand, and practice this Dharma-Blossom Sutra, by proclaiming a protective formula. If any yakṣa, rākṣasa, hungry ghost, or other malevolent being attempts to harm such a dharma-teacher, this protection will ensure they cannot succeed."

Then Courageous-Giver spoke his mantra:

*Cuò-lì (痤隸)[^ph2], Mó-hē-cuò-lì (摩訶痤隸), Yù-zhī (鬱枳), Mù-zhī (目枳), Ā-lì (阿隸), Ā-luó-pó-dì (阿羅婆第), Niè-lì-dì (涅隸第), Niè-lì-duō-pó-dì (涅隸多婆第), Yī-zhì-nǐ (伊致柅), Wéi-zhì-nǐ (韋致柅), Zhǐ-zhì-nǐ (旨致柅), Niè-lì-chí-nǐ (涅隸墀柅), Niè-lì-chí-pó-dǐ (涅犁墀婆底)*

[^ph2]: **Phonetic Note**: The Taishō source provides the *fanqie* pronunciation **誓螺反** (*Shì-Luó fǎn*): combine *Shì* initial with *Luó* final.

Then the Heavenly King Vaiśravaṇa, guardian of the north direction, surrounded by a thousand billion celestial beings, approached the Buddha and declared: "World-Honored One, I too wish to protect those who maintain this sutra through proclaiming my protective formula."

Vaiśravaṇa spoke:

*Ā-lì (阿梨), Nà-lì (那梨), Nóu-nà-lì (㝹那梨), Ā-nà-lú (阿那盧), Nà-lǚ (那履), Jū-nà-fù (拘那覆)*

Vaiśravaṇa declared: "World-Honored One, through this protection, I shall myself guard the dharma-teachers within a hundred yojanas, ensuring they are free from all afflictions and disturbances[^3]."

Then the Heavenly King Dhṛtarāṣṭra, guardian of the east direction, surrounded by countless celestial attendants, approached the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I also wish to protect the dharma-teachers through proclaiming my protective formula."

Dhṛtarāṣṭra spoke:

*Ā-qié-nǐ (阿伽禰), Qié-nǐ (伽禰), Qú-lì (瞿利), Qián-tuó-lì (乾陀利), Zhān-tuó-lì (旃陀利), Mó-dèng-qí (摩蹬耆), Cháng-qiú-lì (常求利), Fú-lóu-shā-nǐ (浮樓莎柅), È-dǐ (頞底)*

Dhṛtarāṣṭra declared: "World-Honored One, this protection, spoken by forty-two billion Buddhas, ensures that if one seeks to harm the dharma-teacher, one thereby harms all those Buddhas[^4]."

Then the ten Rakṣasī (female protective demons) approached the Buddha, together with the Yakṣa Mother and her children and retinue. The ten Rakṣasīs were named: (1) Lambā, (2) Vilambā, (3) Crooked-Teeth, (4) Flower-Teeth, (5) Black-Teeth, (6) Many-Haired, (7) Insatiable, (8) Holding-Necklaces, (9) Kuntī, and (10) Stealer-of-Vital-Spirit.

[^fn_rakshasi]: **Ten Rākṣasī Daughters (十羅剎女):** The names follow Kumārajīva's specific mix of transliteration and translation: (1) Lambā (藍婆), (2) Vilambā (毘藍婆), (3) Crooked-Teeth (曲齒), (4) Flower-Teeth (華齒), (5) Black-Teeth (黑齒, Skt. Makuṭadantī), (6) Many-Haired (多髮), (7) Insatiable (無厭足, Skt. Acalā—distinct from "Immovable"), (8) Holding-Necklaces (持瓔珞), (9) Kuntī (睪帝), and (10) Stealer-of-Vital-Spirit (奪一切眾生精氣).

These ten Rakṣasīs, together with the Yakṣa Mother, her children, and retinue, approached the Buddha and declared: "World-Honored One, we too wish to protect those who read, recite, receive, and maintain this Dharma-Blossom Sutra, relieving them of afflictions. If any seeks to harm the dharma-teacher, we shall ensure they cannot succeed."

Then the ten Rakṣasīs spoke their protection:

*Yī-tí-lǚ (伊提履), Yī-tí-mǐn (伊提泯), Yī-tí-lǚ (伊提履), Ā-tí-lǚ (阿提履), Yī-tí-lǚ (伊提履), Ní-lǚ (泥履), Ní-lǚ (泥履), Ní-lǚ (泥履), Ní-lǚ (泥履), Ní-lǚ (泥履), Lóu-xǐ (樓醯), Lóu-xǐ (樓醯), Lóu-xǐ (樓醯), Lóu-xǐ (樓醯), Duō-xǐ (多醯), Duō-xǐ (多醯), Duō-xǐ (多醯), Dōu-xǐ (兜醯), Nóu-xǐ (㝟醯)*

The Rakṣasīs then declared: "Those who fail to obey our protection and harm the dharma-teacher: may their heads split into seven pieces like the branches of the Arjuna tree; may they experience the karma of those who kill their parents; may they experience the suffering of those who crush oil; may they experience the karma of those who deceive with false weights; may they experience the karma of Devadatta who split the sangha. This is the retribution for harming the dharma-teacher[^5]."

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Rakṣasīs: "Excellent, excellent! If you simply protect those who maintain the sutra's name, the merit is immeasurable. How much greater is the merit when you protect those who fully receive and maintain the complete sutra, offering flowers, fragrances, garlands, powdered incenses, anointing oils, burning incenses, banners, jeweled coverings, silk tapestries, various kinds of musical instruments, and oil-lamps of every description[^6]!"
## The Assembled Protections
*At that time, the Buddha wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

When the dharma-teachers maintain this sutra,
All the bodhisattvas offer their protection,
Medicine King proclaims his mantra,
Courageous-Giver adds his power.

The four Heavenly Kings—
Guardians of the four directions,
Vaiśravaṇa of the north,
Dhṛtarāṣṭra of the east,
And their companions—
All pledge their protection.

The ten Rakṣasīs, female protective demons,
Together with the Yakṣa Mother and her retinue,
Vow to guard all dharma-teachers,
Ensuring no harm can befall them.

Whoever harms these dharma-teachers
Will incur terrible retribution:
Their head will split into seven pieces,
They will experience the karma of parent-killers,
The suffering of oil-pressing,
The deception of false weights,
The breaking of the sangha's unity.

Thus protected by bodhisattvas and celestial beings,
The dharma-teachers dwell in safety,
Proclaiming the Dharma-Blossom Sutra
Throughout the world, without fear[^7].

## Philosophical Implications

Chapter 26 represents the sutra's integration of protective practice with doctrinal teaching. The mantras themselves—rendered in transliterated form that resists literal translation—possess power not through semantic meaning but through sonic resonance. This suggests a Buddhist understanding that language operates on multiple levels: semantic (conveying meaning), magical (activating power), and spiritual (creating consciousness-states).

The enumeration of protectors is significant. Rather than presenting a single ultimate guardian, Chapter 26 shows an entire assembly of beings committed to protection: bodhisattvas (Medicine King, Courageous-Giver), heavenly kings (the four directional guardians), female demons (the ten Rakṣasīs), the Yakṣa Mother. This suggests that protection operates through multiple channels and that cosmic beings of all types participate in dharma-defense.

The principle that harming a dharma-teacher equates to harming all Buddhas establishes the dharma-teacher as sacred. To injure the teacher is not merely a personal wrong but a cosmic crime against the entire Buddha-family. This consecrates the dharma-teacher's status.

The threats enumerated—yakṣas, demons, hungry ghosts, malevolent beings—reflect popular Buddhist cosmology where evil forces threaten practitioners. Yet the sutra's response is not to condemn these beings as permanently evil but to recruit them as protectors. The Rakṣasīs (female demons) and Yakṣa Mother represent transformation of potentially hostile powers into protective allies. This reflects a sophisticated Buddhist understanding that even demonic forces can be converted to dharma-service through proper cultivation.

The mantras' lack of literal meaning directs attention to their sonic-magical dimension. In tantric Buddhism, mantras are understood as embodying the actual presence of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. To recite the mantra is not merely to speak words but to invoke and manifest those beings. The mantra is not a request for protection but an actualization of protective presence.

# Chapter 27: The Wonderful-Adornment King's Original Practice

## The Transformation of a Skeptical Ruler
At that time, the Buddha addressed the assembled great audience: "In ages long past—spanning incalculable eons beyond measurement—there existed a Buddha named Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Constellation-King-Flower-Wisdom, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, the One Perfectly Accomplished in Knowledge and Conduct, the Sugata, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassable Guide, the Tamer of the Untamed, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. His realm was named Radiance-Flourishing, and the age was called Joyful-Perception[^1].

"In that realm, there was a king named Wonderful-Adornment. His queen was named Pure-Virtue. The king had two sons: one was named Pure-Treasury, the other Pure-Vision. Both sons possessed great supernatural powers, deep karmic-roots, long-cultivated merit, and profound wisdom. They had perfected the six perfections (generosity, discipline, patience, effort, meditation, wisdom), bodhisattva-methods of skillful means, and compassion-love. They had also mastered countless samādhis and absorbed the thirty-seven aids-to-enlightenment[^2].

"At that time, Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Constellation-King-Flower-Wisdom wished to transform the Wonderful-Adornment King and to liberate all beings in his realm, so he expounded the Dharma-Blossom Sutra. The two princes approached their mother and said: 'Dear Mother, we wish to go to the Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Constellation-King-Flower-Wisdom to pay reverence, draw near, make offerings, and receive the teachings. We earnestly desire to hear the Dharma-Blossom Sutra[^3].'

"Their mother replied: 'Your father, the king, is deeply attached to the teachings of external religions and cannot easily accept the dharma. You must first convince your father to go with us.'

"The two princes responded respectfully: 'Mother, we understand that our father has incorrect views. We shall show him miracles so that his heart becomes pure and clear. Then he will listen to us and agree to go to the Buddha.'

"Thereupon, the two pure sons, desiring to transform their father, soared into the void. They rose seven palm-trees high and demonstrated miraculous powers. Standing in the air, they walked, stood, sat, and reclined. From their upper bodies, they manifested fire; from their lower bodies, they manifested water. From their lower bodies, they manifested fire; from their upper bodies, they manifested water. They caused their bodies to appear large, filling the sky, then small again. They appeared and disappeared in the void, demonstrating miraculous transformations that enabled the king's heart to become pure and faithful[^4].

"When the king witnessed such supernatural powers, he experienced great joy and, speaking to his sons, said: 'Who is your teacher? To whom do you offer reverence?'

"The two sons replied: 'Great King, the Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Constellation-King-Flower-Wisdom dwells beneath the seven-jeweled Bodhi tree, seated on a dharma-throne, teaching the Dharma-Blossom Sutra to all the gods and humans. We are his disciples[^5].'

"The king then addressed his sons: 'I too wish to see your teacher. Shall we go together?'

"At that moment, the two sons descended from the void and approached their mother, saying: 'Dear Mother, Father's mind is now pure and ready for enlightenment. We have accomplished our bodhisattva-work for him. We now request permission to leave the household and renounce worldly life to practice under that Buddha'[^6].

"The two sons then spoke this verse to their mother:

*'We ask your blessing, beloved mother,*
*To leave this world and become monks,*
*For Buddhas are so rarely encountered,*
*Like the lotus flower that blooms once in eons.*

*To find one's way to a Buddha,*
*Is harder than finding a one-eyed turtle,*
*Floating in a vast ocean,*
*Encountering a wooden yoke with a single hole.*

*Our karmic roots are deep and mature,*
*We have been born in this Buddha's age,*
*This is why, dear parents,*
*We ask permission to renounce[^7].'*

"The mother replied: 'Go forth, my sons. The Buddha is so rarely encountered that your desire to leave the household is indeed justified.'

"Thereupon, the two sons addressed their parents: 'Dear Father and Mother, we earnestly invite you to go to the Buddha's presence with us, to make offerings and receive teachings. The Buddha is so rare to encounter—like the lotus that blooms once in countless eons. Meeting a Buddha is rarer still, like a one-eyed turtle encountering a wooden yoke with a single hole floating in the vast ocean. Our karmic roots are deep, and we have been born in the Buddha's age. Therefore, you must permit us to leave the household and practice[^8].'

"At that time, the Wonderful-Adornment King, together with his officials and retinue, the Pure-Virtue Queen with all her attendants, and the two sons with their four thousand two hundred followers, all journeyed together to the Buddha's presence. Upon arrival, they bowed with their heads to the Buddha's feet, circumambulated him three times, and stood reverently to the side.

"The Buddha then expounded the dharma to the Wonderful-Adornment King, revealing its significance and teaching its benefits. The king received great joy from this teaching. At that moment, the King and Queen removed from their necks pearl and jeweled ornaments worth hundreds of thousands and scattered them before the Buddha as offerings. In the void, these scattered jewels were transformed into four jeweled platforms, each bearing a jeweled throne as wide as a hand's span. Upon each throne sat a Buddha, shining with radiant light[^9].

"The Wonderful-Adornment King then perceived the miraculous transformation and reflected: 'The Buddha's body is rare and extraordinary, possessing supreme beauty and perfection, adorned with the marks of a supreme being[^10].'

"At that time, Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Constellation-King-Flower-Wisdom addressed the assembly: 'Do you see the Wonderful-Adornment King standing here in reverence? This king will become a monk and diligently cultivate the dharma, assisting the Buddha's way. This king will become a Buddha named Sal-Tree-King (娑羅樹王). His realm will be named Great-Light, and the age will be called Great-Exalted-Kings. The Buddha Sal-Tree-King will have innumerable bodhisattvas and incalculable śrāvakas. His realm will be perfectly even, adorned with extraordinary merits[^11].'

"Immediately upon hearing this prophecy, the Wonderful-Adornment King, relinquishing his kingdom to his younger brother, together with his queen, two sons, and all retinue, entered the monastic order.

"The king diligently practiced for eighty-four thousand years, eventually achieving the samādhi of Complete Purification and Merit-Adornment. Rising into the void to a height of seven palm-trees, he addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, these two sons of mine have already accomplished bodhisattva-work for me through their miraculous powers and transformations. They converted my incorrect views, enabling me to dwell purely in the Buddha-dharma and to see you, the World-Honored One. These two sons are my virtuous teachers. They were born in my family to awaken my original karmic-roots from past eons, and to benefit me greatly, showing me the path to awakening[^12].

'All who wish to attain enlightenment should know: virtuous teachers (kalyāṇa-mitras) are the great cause and circumstance for transformation. Through virtuous teachers' guidance, liberation is accomplished. Virtuous teachers teach us the dharma, show us benefits, bring us joy, and establish us in unsurpassed enlightenment[^13]. Great King, you have seen these two sons. They have served as transformative virtuous teachers to you, converting you and all your retinue toward enlightenment. They cultivated this dharma-teaching in past Buddha-realms[^14].'

"The king then descended from the void, bowed respectfully, and addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the Tathāgata is exceedingly rare! The Tathāgata's dharma is complete and unsurpassable, perfected through wisdom and virtue. Your body radiates with divine marks of perfection. Your eyes are vast and beautiful, azure-blue in color. Your eyebrow-marks gleam white as the moon. Your teeth are bright and perfectly aligned, always emitting light. Your lips are beautifully colored, resembling ripe pomegranate fruit.'

"Having offered such praise, the Wonderful-Adornment King addressed the Buddha once more: 'World-Honored One, the dharma is most extraordinary! I have never encountered teachings so wondrous and complete. From this day forward, I shall no longer follow my heart's incorrect inclinations, nor shall I harbor arrogance, anger, or malice. I shall purely dwell in the Buddha-dharma, forever forsaking all false views[^15].'

"With these words, the king bowed reverentially and departed."

## Narrative Conclusion

"The Buddha then addressed the assembly: 'Do you comprehend this account? The Wonderful-Adornment King of that ancient time was none other than the Bodhisattva Dharma-Excellence who sits before you now. That Pure-Virtue Queen was the Bodhisattva Light-Illumination-Excellence-Adornment, who was reborn in that realm through compassion for the Wonderful-Adornment King and his retinue. Those two sons, Pure-Treasury and Pure-Vision, are the bodhisattvas Medicine King and Medicine-Excellence. These two great bodhisattvas, through their accumulated spiritual practice and extraordinary virtues, have perfected such profound capacities. They have already made offerings to innumerable Buddhas, cultivated roots of virtue in countless realms, and accomplished inconceivable virtuous deeds. If any being simply knows these two bodhisattvas' names, the entire celestial and human assembly should offer them reverence[^16].'

"The Buddha concluded: 'Understand this: the Dharma-Blossom Sutra provides inconceivable benefit to all bodhisattva-practitioners. It swiftly brings them to unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. Therefore, all bodhisattva-practitioners should, after the Tathāgata's passing, constantly receive, maintain, read, recite, explain, and write out this sutra[^17].'

"When the Buddha expounded this Wonderful-Adornment King chapter, eighty-four thousand beings immediately abandoned dusty defilements and attained the pure dharma-eye. Transcending the realm of discrimination, they obtained pure dharma-vision regarding all phenomena."

# Chapter 28: The Encouragement of the Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva

## The Final Exhortation
At that time, the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra (the Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva) approached the Buddha with his innumerable, boundless, incalculable bodhisattva-retinue from the east, manifesting his transcendent power and magnificence, renowned throughout the ten directions. Wherever he passed, the ground trembled with six kinds of motion, precious lotus flowers rained down, and hundreds of millions of kinds of celestial music played spontaneously.

Samantabhadra arrived at Vulture Peak Mountain, bowed with his head to the feet of Śākyamuni Buddha, circumambulated him seven times, and addressed him: "World-Honored One, in my realm called Precious-Glory, I heard, from far away, that this Sahā world-realm teaches the Dharma-Blossom Sutra. Together with innumerable bodhisattvas, I have journeyed here to listen. I earnestly request that you teach this dharma. If there are virtuous men or women who will receive, maintain, read, recite, remember, learn, and practice this Dharma-Blossom Sutra after the Tathāgata's passage, how will they accomplish this? How will they protect themselves[^1]?"

The Buddha replied to Samantabhadra: "If virtuous men and women are to receive this dharma after the Tathāgata's passing, they must accomplish four conditions. First, they must be held in mindfulness by all the Buddhas. Second, they must plant the roots of virtue. Third, they must enter the cluster of correct determination. Fourth, they must awaken the mind to rescue all sentient beings. Those virtuous men and women who accomplish these four conditions will definitely obtain this Dharma-Blossom Sutra after the Tathāgata's passage[^fn_four_conditions].

[^fn_four_conditions]: **The Four Conditions (四法):** The precise Kumārajīva terminology for these prerequisites is: (1) To be held in mindfulness by the Buddhas (*wei zhu fo hu nian* 為諸佛護念); (2) To plant the roots of virtue (*zhi zhong de ben* 殖眾德本—using the specific character *zhí* 殖); (3) To enter the cluster of correct determination (*ru zheng ding ju* 入正定聚); and (4) To awaken the mind to rescue all sentient beings (*fa jiu yi qie zhong sheng zhi xin* 發救一切眾生之心).
## Samantabhadra's Vow
"Samantabhadra, in the degenerate age five hundred years after the Tathāgata's passage, among those who maintain this sutra, I shall guard and protect them, relieving them of all afflictions. I will ensure that no spirits, demons, demon-children, demon-women, demon-followers, demon-possessed individuals, yakṣas, rākṣasas, kumbhāṇḍas, piśācas, yakṣa-spirits, rich-demons, vetālas, and other harmful beings find any opportunity to molest them. Whether the person walks, stands, reads, recites, or contemplates this sutra, I shall ride my six-tusked white elephant, together with my great bodhisattva-assembly, travel to their location, appear before them, and supply them with all forms of comfort and safety, additionally supporting their dharma-practice[^3].

"When one sits in contemplation of this sutra, and one forgets or loses even a single phrase or verse, I shall appear on the white elephant, ride down, and personally teach you, helping you restore what was forgotten and recover full fluency[^4].

"When practitioners of the Dharma-Blossom Sutra practice intensely for three seven-day cycles—meaning twenty-one days of single-minded dedication—they should perceive my form. I shall then ride my white elephant, together with countless bodhisattvas, surround them, manifest myself in whatever form the practitioner needs to see, teach the dharma, supply whatever support is required, and grant protective formulas[^5].

"In the degenerate age of five hundred years, if monks, nuns, male lay followers, or female lay followers desire to maintain this sutra and practice its dharma through continuous effort, I shall personally protect them with the power of all the other bodhisattvas. Not a single non-human being will be able to cause harm, nor will any woman suffer confusion or seduction through unwanted attractions. I shall provide a protective mantra-formula:

*Ā-tán-dì (阿檀地)[^ph3], Tán-tuó-pó-dì (檀陀婆地), Tán-tuó-pó-dì (檀陀婆地), Tán-tuó-jiū-shě-lì (檀陀鳩舍隷), Tán-tuó-xī-lì (檀陀渫梨), Tán-tuó-bō-tuó-ní (檀陀波陀尼), Xiū-tán-tuó (修檀陀), Xiū-duō-lóu-tán-tuó (修多樓檀陀), Sā-pó-hē (薩婆訶)*

[^ph3]: **Phonetic Note**: The Taishō source provides the *fanqie* pronunciation **途賣反** (*Tú-Mài fǎn*) for the character 地 (*Dì*): combine *Tú* initial with *Mài* final.

"The benefits of this dharani are such that whoever hears it shall escape demon-influence, avoid seduction by unwanted attractions, and be protected with unbreakable security[^6].

"World-Honored One, in ages past when there were Buddhas, I practiced this dharma in their presence. When this era's Buddha has passed and the final five hundred years of degeneration arrive, if there are earnest practitioners who practice this sutra, I shall manifest my presence before them on a white elephant, maintain and protect them throughout all time, ensuring their practice proceeds without interruption[^7]."
## The Fruit of Practice
The Buddha then addressed Samantabhadra: "Excellent! Excellent! You possess such incomparable miraculous power and compassionate vow that all practitioners of this sutra will attain liberation. Your virtue is profound, your compassion vast, and your original intention of enlightenment is deep and ancient. You accomplish these protective vows for the benefit of countless beings[^8]."

"Such practitioners need not construct stupas or establish monastic dwellings and support the sangha. Why? Because such persons are already constructing the greatest stupas, establishing the greatest monastic dwellings, supporting the greatest sangha. Those who write this sutra achieve such merits as this[^10].

"If such a person writes out this sutra, after their lifetime is complete, they shall be born in the Trayastriṃśa Heaven (the Heaven of the Thirty-Three), surrounded by eighty-four thousand divine maidens, immediately adorned with a crown of seven treasures, experiencing every pleasure among the heavenly consorts.[^11] But how much greater are the merits of those who receive and maintain, read and recite, understand and practice this sutra!

"If there are people who receive, read, recite, understand and practice this sutra, in their next lifetime they shall be reborn in the Tuṣita heaven before Maitreya Bodhisattva, who will grasp their hand with compassion. When Maitreya Bodhisattva becomes the Buddha and presides in the Three Dragon Flower Assemblies (龍華三會), such practitioners shall be among the assembly and shall achieve unsurpassed perfect enlightenment[^12].

"Samantabhadra, if those who receive, maintain, and practice this sutra encounter those who ridicule them and say, 'You are a fool! You will gain nothing by this practice!'—such practitioners should cultivate these thoughts: 'The Buddha has explained this sutra as the foremost among all teachings. Those who practice it are assured of enlightenment. Even if people criticize me, I will continue without doubt.' Through such resolve, the practitioner accomplishes the practice of the Bodhisattva Way[^13].

"Samantabhadra, know this: if one sees a practitioner of this sutra, one should rise up to greet them just as one would greet the Buddha himself. If one places flowers, fragrances, garlands, musical instruments, silk banners, burning incenses, oil-lamps, and all other precious offerings before such practitioners, considering them equivalent to the Buddha, one will acquire immeasurable merits[^14].

"Samantabhadra, in the ages after the Tathāgata's passing, if one encounters a practitioner of this sutra and hears them speak even a single verse of this dharma, one should understand: this person has not long before entering the bodhi-seat, defeating all demonic forces, turning the dharma-wheel, striking the dharma-drum, blowing the dharma-conch, raining the dharma-rain, seated upon a lion-throne in the midst of the celestial and human assembly[^15]."
## The Final Benediction
"Samantabhadra, if one encounters someone lightly reviling a practitioner, commenting on their faults (whether true or false), this person shall in the present lifetime develop pale-white leprosy. If one encounters such a practitioner and fails to honor them, or criticizes them, or shows contempt, one shall experience these consequences: eyelessness, blindness, deafness, severe stammering, cleft lip, a malformed face, a shortened form, offensive odor, tumorous growths, putrid sores, water-swollen belly, shortness of breath, and numerous serious illnesses[^16].

"Therefore, Samantabhadra, you should recognize that all those who receive, read, recite, understand, and practice this Dharma-Blossom Sutra are themselves performing the practices of the Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva. Such practitioners will not cling to material pleasures, will not seek external doctrines, will not cultivate frivolous associations, will not pursue false attachments, will not be tormented by greed, anger, or delusion, nor by jealousy, pride, arrogance, or superiority. Such practitioners will develop few desires, knowing contentment, able to practice the Universally-Worthy Way[^17]."

The Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva,
Pure-hearted and compassionate,
Has arrived from his distant realm,
Leading countless bodhisattvas in his retinue.

To protect those who maintain this sutra,
He rides upon a white elephant with six tusks,
With his assembly of great bodhisattvas,
Traveling to support the practitioners.

When a sutra-practitioner walks or stands,
When they read, recite, or contemplate,
Samantabhadra appears before them,
Offering comfort and protection always[^19].

If one writes this supreme dharma-teaching,
After completing their lifetime,
They shall be reborn in Trayastriṃśa heaven,
Adorned with a seven-jeweled crown,
Surrounded by celestial maidens dancing,
Experiencing all heavenly delights.

When Maitreya descends and becomes Buddha,
And gathers the three assemblies,
Such practitioners shall be present,
Achieving supreme enlightenment together[^20].

Those who maintain and practice this sutra,
Should be honored as buddhas themselves,
Receiving offerings of flowers and incense,
Revered in the midst of all assemblies.

Those who criticize such practitioners,
Shall suffer terrible consequences:
Paleness, blindness, deafness,
Severe deformity and disease[^21].

But those who honor the practitioners,
And make offerings and reverential bows,
Shall attain boundless merits,
Dwelling in the eternal dharma-way.

Samantabhadra's protective vow,
Extends across all future ages,
Ensuring that none can harm,
Those devoted to this supreme teaching[^22].

All those who practice with sincere heart,
Will gradually progress toward enlightenment,
Will not long delay before becoming Buddhas,
Achieving the wisdom of all-knowing Buddha-nature.

The Dharma-Blossom Sutra is supreme,
The sovereign of all teachings,
Those who practice it shall attain,
The highest wisdom, the Buddha's enlightenment[^23].

# Postscript to the Lotus Sutra
## 妙法蓮華經後序

*Composed by the Śramaṇa Sengrui of Later Qin*
*(後秦沙門僧叡述)*

---

The *Lotus Sutra* is the secret treasury of all the Buddhas, the true substance of all the sutras. It takes "flower" as its name to illumine its origin; it is called *Puṇḍarīka* to extol its flourishing. Its arising is profoundly mysterious, its meaning extremely elegant. Unless one of penetrating insight transmits it, rarely does anyone find their way to its gate.

The blossoms of a hundred plants and herbs are the origin of their fruits and seeds; the eighty-four thousand treasury of dharmas is the source of the fruit of the Way—hence the metaphor. Among all flowers, the lotus is supreme. When not yet open, it is called *kumuda*; when open yet about to fall, *kamala*; in its prime at mid-stage, *puṇḍarīka*. The unopened flower symbolizes the Two Vehicles; the falling flower signifies nirvāṇa; but its radiant glory alone suffices to symbolize this scripture.

As for the *Prajñā* sutras, their depth is without limit, hence those of the Way take refuge in them; their vastness leaves nothing uncovered, hence those of the Vehicle cross over by means of them. Yet in broad outline, all take adaptive transformation as their greatness. In the gate of responding to affairs, they cannot but employ skillful expedients. Expedient transformation, though vast in awakening beings, is insufficient regarding the true substance—all such [teachings] belong to the *Lotus Sutra*, as is fitting.

Tracing its profound meaning—expansive, vast, and deep—what it encompasses is far-reaching. How could it be merely speaking the real and returning to the root, or definitively distinguishing different paths? Rather, it truly illumines the great principle of awakening and encompasses past and present.

It says the Buddha's lifespan is immeasurable—even eternal kalpas are insufficient to clarify its duration. It says the emanation-bodies are countless—even myriad forms are insufficient to differentiate its substance. Thus, the "Lifespan" chapter establishes that it is beyond number; the "Emanation Bodies" reveal that it is without substantiality; Samantabhadra displays that it is without becoming; Prabhūtaratna illumines that it is without extinction.

To transcend the mysterious ancient to reach the present, ten thousand generations become a single day; to awaken to the mysterious through ten thousand transformations, a thousand paths have no divergent tracks. Being thus, birth after birth is insufficient to anticipate existence, and eternal stillness likewise cannot be said to be extinction. Tracing the profound lineage to cut off the past, one loses accomplishment in original non-being; controlling the reins of the mind in samādhi, one forgets expectation in the two stages.

Though this sutra has flowed to this land for nearly a hundred years, translators have been unclear about its empty crossing-place, and the spiritual gate has never been opened. Commentators have deviated from its standard, and few have been able to follow its hidden traces. Despite searching and researching until white-haired, none had glimpsed its gate.

Yao Song, Prefect of the Capital Region, General of the Left, and Marquis of Ancheng of the Qin [dynasty], attuned himself to the profound gate, dwelling his mind beyond the world. He devoted his sincerity to this scripture with ever-increasing faith. Each time he sought to trace its text, he deeply recognized the translators' errors. Upon encountering the Dharma Master Kumārajīva, [Yao Song] had him transmit and transcribe it. [Kumārajīva] pointed to its great principle of truth—it was as if parting the layered clouds to tread on high, ascending Kunlun to look down below.

At that time, the monks who listened, received, and comprehended numbered over eight hundred—all were outstanding talents from various regions, the finest of their generation.

*This was the eighth year of the Hongshi era [406 CE], the year of the Lesser Fire Star.*

# Song Dynasty Donor Dedication

*(紹興二十一年正月十五日 — January 15, 1151 CE)*

Lady Zhang, Grand Lady of the State of Lu, on the occasion of the anniversary of her deceased husband's passing—the Grand Tutor and Grand Chancellor, Lord Li—respectfully contributed pure funds to the Tripitaka Repository of Fuzhou Kaiyuan Temple. [The funds] were used to carve the *Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma* in seven fascicles, the *Lotus Samādhi* and other sutras in three fascicles, totaling ten fascicles altogether. May this superior karmic cause make solemn offerings and enable [Lord Li] to transcend rebirth in the Pure Land.

*Respectfully inscribed on the fifteenth day of the first month of the twenty-first year of the Shaoxing era [1151 CE]*
