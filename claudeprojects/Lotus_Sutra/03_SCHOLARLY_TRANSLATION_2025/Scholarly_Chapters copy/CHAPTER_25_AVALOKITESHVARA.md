### Prose Section: The Bodhisattva of Boundless Compassion

At that time, the Bodhisattva Boundless-Intention rose from his seat, bowed respectfully with his head to the Buddha's feet, and posed this inquiry: "World-Honored One, I wish to ask: For what reason is the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara called by this name¹?"

The Buddha replied: "Excellent question, Boundless-Intention. If countless billions of sentient beings experiencing suffering hear the name Avalokiteśvara and call upon this bodhisattva with sincere intention, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara will immediately perceive the sound of their invocation. That being will at once gain liberation. For this reason, this bodhisattva is named Avalokiteśvara—the One Who Perceives the World's Sounds of Suffering².

"If a being faces great fire and calls upon Avalokiteśvara, the flames cannot burn such a person, because the bodhisattva's power of wisdom prevents the fire from destroying them. If one is swept away by a great flood and cries out to Avalokiteśvara, one will suddenly find oneself in shallow water. If a hundred thousand billion sentient beings venture onto the great ocean seeking treasures—silver, lapis lazuli, crystal, agate, coral, amber, pearls and other jewels—and their boat is caught in a black wind and driven toward the realm of the rākṣasa demons, a single person among them calling upon Avalokiteśvara will rescue all from the danger of the demons³.

"If someone faces impending execution and invokes Avalokiteśvara, the executioner's weapons will shatter into fragments and the condemned person will escape. If a being is bound with chains or shackles and calls upon this bodhisattva, all restraints will break free, and that person will attain liberation. If a region is filled with countless night-demons and rākṣasas intending to cause harm, and they hear the name Avalokiteśvara invoked, these harmful beings will not dare even look upon the invocant with malice, much less cause injury⁴.

"Moreover, Boundless-Intention, if a being harbors excessive lust and constantly honors and reveres Avalokiteśvara, that being will be liberated from lust. If one is enslaved by anger, constant reverence to Avalokiteśvara brings liberation from anger. If one is trapped in delusion, such reverence brings freedom from delusion⁵.

"Avalokiteśvara possesses such great divine power. If one wishes to bear a son, one should reverence and offer to this bodhisattva, and one will birth a virtuous, wise, and meritorious son. If one wishes a daughter, one will birth a beautiful, accomplished, and virtuous daughter, beloved and respected by all.

"Boundless-Intention, any sentient being who venerates Avalokiteśvara will not lose the fruit of that reverence. For this reason, all beings should always turn their thoughts toward this bodhisattva.

"If someone sustains the names of sixty-two billion Bodhisattvas equal to the dust of the Ganges River, and provides them with all necessities—food, clothing, bedding, and medicine—throughout their lives, what merit would they accumulate?"

Boundless-Intention replied: "Immeasurable, World-Honored One."

The Buddha declared: "If another person sustains the name of Avalokiteśvara, even offering a single moment of reverence, the merit would be identical—no difference whatsoever. Even through incalculable billions of eons, the merit could never be exhausted⁶.

"Boundless-Intention, if I were to teach all the dharmas concerning how Avalokiteśvara traverses this world, in what manner Avalokiteśvara teaches the dharma through skillful means, the discussion would require incalculable eons. Therefore, in summary: all sentient beings experiencing anxiety and distress, if they hear of Avalokiteśvara, will find immediate relief through the bodhisattva's power of wise compassion. For this reason, all should trust in Avalokiteśvara⁷."

### Prose Section: The Thirty-Three Manifestations

Then Buddha continued: "Boundless-Intention, if sentient beings require the form of a Buddha to be taught and liberated, Avalokiteśvara will manifest as a Buddha and teach them the dharma. If they require the form of a solitary-buddha to achieve liberation, the bodhisattva will manifest as a solitary-buddha. If they require a śrāvaka-form, the bodhisattva manifests accordingly—the bodhisattva can manifest as a Brahma-king, as Śakra, as a self-mastering deity, as a great self-mastering deity, as a celestial general, as King Vaiśravaṇa, as a Cakravartin-king, as a smaller king⁸.

"If they require the form of a householder to be taught, Avalokiteśvara manifests as a householder. If they require the form of an official, merchant, Brahmin, or member of any other occupation, the bodhisattva manifests accordingly.

"If they require the form of a monk, nun, male lay follower, or female lay follower, the bodhisattva manifests as such. If a being is to be liberated through the appearance of a wife, the bodhisattva manifests as a wife; through a concubine, as a concubine; through a daughter, as a daughter; through a mother, as a mother. If one requires manifestation as a divine being, a dragon, a yakṣa, a gandharva, an asura, a garuda, a kinnara, a mahoraga, a human, or a non-human being—in all these forms, Avalokiteśvara manifests to teach and liberate.

"If a being is to be liberated through the appearance of an arhat, the bodhisattva manifests as an arhat. If one requires the manifestation of a Pratyeka-Buddha, the form manifests accordingly. Moreover, Avalokiteśvara manifests even as a Bodhisattva. In such unlimited ways, through countless forms, in all the worlds of the ten directions, the bodhisattva travels, liberating all beings. For this reason, all should turn their sincere attention toward Avalokiteśvara and cultivate reverence⁹."

### Verse Section: The Gateway of Compassion

*At that time, Boundless-Intention wished to restate these teachings in verse:*

O World-Honored One of wondrous form,
I now inquire of you again:
Why is this bodhisattva called by this name?
What is the source of Avalokiteśvara's designation¹⁰?

The Buddha replied to Boundless-Intention:
Listen to the Practice of Avalokiteśvara,
This bodhisattva responds skillfully in all realms,
Establishing profound vows across countless eons.

The power of Avalokiteśvara's vow is immeasurable as the ocean,
Having served infinite billions of Buddhas, continuing without measure,
By cultivating profound wisdom and boundless compassion,
The bodhisattva responds to all cries and delivers all beings¹¹.

If malicious intent arises and someone pushes you into a great pit of fire,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And the fire will transform into a lotus pond.
Or if swept away by a violent flood,
Drowning seems certain,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And you will find yourself in shallow waters.

If you are caught in a great ocean storm,
While seeking precious treasures,
With waves high as mountains and demons threatening,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And you shall be delivered safely.

If facing execution, blades and weapons raised against you,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And the weapons will shatter into fragments,
And you will escape unharmed.

If bound in chains or locked in prison stocks,
Your hands and feet shackled,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And the restraints will fall away,
Your liberation complete.

When a region is filled with demons and yakṣas,
Intending to disturb and torment people,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And even their hateful glances will not fall upon you,
Much less can they do you harm¹².

If curses, poisons, or witchcraft are employed against you,
Meant to injure your body,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And all such harm will rebound to the sender.

If you encounter wicked rākṣasas or poisonous dragons,
Fierce beasts with sharp teeth and claws,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And all will flee in all directions.

If surrounded by threatening serpents, scorpions,
Their poison smoke burning like fire,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And these will immediately turn back and flee.

When thunder roars and lightning flashes,
Hail falls and rain pours down,
Call upon the power of Avalokiteśvara,
And all these disturbances will clear away.

Boundless beings in distress,
Oppressed by countless sufferings,
Through the wondrous wisdom and power of Avalokiteśvara,
All can be liberated from suffering.

The Bodhisattva possesses supernatural power,
With vast expedient skill and boundless compassion,
In all lands throughout the ten directions,
The bodhisattva manifests in every place.

In all the evil realms—
Hell-realm, hungry ghost realm, animal realm—
And in all the places of difficulty and hardship,
The Bodhisattva manifests to liberate all beings.

He appears as the king of all heavens,
Or as the king of universal rulers,
As the sovereign Brahma-king,
Or as Śakra, lord of the thirty-three heavens,
Or as governors and ministers,
Appearing wherever called, in whatever form needed.

In the palaces of royalty and nobility,
The bodhisattva appears as a female form,
Teaching the dharma to those who need such manifestation.

Perfect perception of all sounds—pure light!
The light of wisdom breaking through all darkness,
The light that vanquishes all suffering and disaster,
This is why all should revere this bodhisattva.

With the eyes of compassion watching all beings,
With the heart of compassion radiating boundless love,
With countless merits and virtues,
Avalokiteśvara sees and relieves the world's pain¹³.

O bodhisattva of sincere vow,
Ocean-deep compassion, immeasurable in extent,
World after world, throughout all times,
You manifest as protector of all sentient beings.

With true perception watching all the world,
With compassion vast as the ocean,
With boundless wisdom breaking through all doubt,
The bodhisattva leads all beings to enlightenment¹⁴.

All who hear of Avalokiteśvara,
And keep that name ever in their heart,
Never falling back in their practice,
Will swiftly attain Buddhahood.

If one vows to support sixty-two billion bodhisattvas,
Offering them sustenance throughout their lives,
The merit would be immeasurable indeed,
But not to compare with one who hears

And venerates Avalokiteśvara's name,
Even for a single moment, with sincere heart,
The merit is exactly equal,
Enduring through all future eons.

### Philosophical Implications

Chapter 25 represents the Lotus Sutra's most accessible teaching. Where earlier chapters emphasized abstract doctrines (Buddha-nature universality, eternal transmission, cosmic verification), Chapter 25 offers immediate, practical compassion available through simple invocation.

The principle of Avalokiteśvara's responsiveness—"perceives the sound of suffering"—suggests that compassion is not earned through elaborate practice but is eternally available to those in distress. The bodhisattva does not require payment, ritual preparation, or spiritual qualification. One need only call. This democracy of access contradicts hierarchical religious systems requiring priestly mediation or prolonged study.

The enumeration of thirty-three manifestation-forms (Buddha, solitary-buddha, śrāvaka, Brahma-king, Śakra, various deities, kings, officials, merchants, Brahmins, monks, nuns, lay followers, various family members, diverse beings from dragons to demons, arhat, pratyeka-buddha, bodhisattva) represents the principle that compassion adapts to every condition. There is no being too lowly, no situation too hopeless for compassionate manifestation.

The paradox of manifestation deserves attention. Avalokiteśvara's true form remains metaphysically unclear. The chapter does not specify what Avalokiteśvara "really is" beneath the manifestations. This suggests that the bodhisattva's essence is precisely this capacity for unlimited adaptation. Compassion has no fixed form; it becomes whatever is needed.

The comparison of merit (sustaining sixty-two billion bodhisattvas versus invoking Avalokiteśvara once) inverts conventional merit-hierarchies. Enormous effort and elaborate practice produce less merit than a single moment of sincere invocation. This emphasizes that enlightenment-potential is immediately available, not something requiring lengthy cultivation.

The emphasis on "hearing the name" is significant. The name "Avalokiteśvara" is not merely verbal but carries power. To speak or hear this name is to activate compassion-presence. The name and the bodhisattva are not separable; calling the name calls forth the reality.

### Apparatus Summary

**Context**: Chapter 25 continues the exemplar-sequence but shifts focus from bodhisattvas as distant practitioners (Chapters 23-24) to the bodhisattva as immediately accessible respondent to all suffering.

**Central Teaching**: Avalokiteśvara, the Bodhisattva of Universal Compassion, responds to all invocations, manifests in all forms, and liberates all beings through wisdom-compassion. Access to this compassion requires only sincere invocation of the bodhisattva's name.

**Structural Function**: Chapter 25 brings the sutra's teachings from abstract cosmic revelation into practical everyday application. It provides a dharmic framework for popular religious practice while maintaining the sutra's philosophical sophistication.

**Key Doctrinal Claims**:
- "The bodhisattva perceives and responds to all cries of suffering"—establishes universal compassion-presence
- "Thirty-three manifestations adapt to all sentient conditions"—demonstrates radical upaya principle
- "Invoking the name produces merit equal to supporting countless bodhisattvas"—establishes instant accessibility
- "All manifestations teach the dharma regardless of apparent form"—suggests that compassion itself is teaching

**Philosophical Connections**:
- **Upaya (skillful means)**: Chapter 25 illustrates the ultimate expression of adaptation to beings' conditions
- **Buddha-nature universality**: All beings can invoke compassion without discrimination
- **Non-dual dharma**: The bodhisattva's manifestations suggest that ultimate reality adapts to conditioned perceptions
- **Compassion as ontological**: Compassion is not merely an emotion but a fundamental reality-principle

**Footnotes**:

¹ **Avalokiteśvara's name**: The Sanskrit term Avalokiteśvara literally means "The Lord Who Perceives Sounds/Cries." In Chinese Buddhism, known as Guanyin (觀音), and in Japanese as Kannon. The name emphasizes perception of suffering (sound = cry of suffering).

² **Immediate response principle**: The text emphasizes "immediately" (即時), suggesting that compassion-response is instantaneous, not requiring processing time or decision-making. Compassion is automatic.

³ **Multi-form deliverance**: The enumeration of dangers (fire, water, demons, execution, bondage, spiritual threats) covers material, psychological, and spiritual forms of suffering, suggesting that compassion addresses all dimensions of existence.

⁴ **Protective power**: The text specifies that even malevolent beings cannot harm one invoking Avalokiteśvara. Protection is unconditional and absolute.

⁵ **Psychological liberation**: Beyond physical dangers, the bodhisattva liberates from the three poisons (lust, anger, delusion). This represents transformation of consciousness itself.

⁶ **Merit-equality principle**: The statement that invoking Avalokiteśvara once equals supporting sixty-two billion bodhisattvas throughout their lives demonstrates the sutra's principle that certain dharma-actions carry disproportionate merit.

⁷ **Incalculable teaching scope**: The acknowledgment that describing Avalokiteśvara's full teaching would require incalculable eons is repeated from earlier chapters. The actual teaching transcends words.

⁸ **Thirty-three forms enumerated**: The classical list includes: Buddha, solitary-buddha, śrāvaka, Brahma-king, Śakra, self-mastering deity, great self-mastering deity, celestial general, King Vaiśravaṇa, Cakravartin-king, smaller king, householder, official, merchant, Brahmin, monk, nun, male lay follower, female lay follower, wife, concubine, daughter, mother, and various non-human forms. Some manuscripts enumerate thirty-three, others fewer or more.

⁹ **Manifestation-principle extended**: The phrase "in such unlimited ways" suggests that the thirty-three forms are merely exemplary. The bodhisattva can manifest in any form required by any being.

¹⁰ **Boundless-Intention's role**: The Bodhisattva Boundless-Intention (無盡意), meaning infinite intention/aspiration, represents the assembly's limitless desire to understand compassion.

¹¹ **Ocean metaphor**: Compassion is compared to the ocean—boundless, deep, life-supporting, and containing innumerable beings.

¹² **No harm to the invocant**: The text emphasizes that those invoking Avalokiteśvara are protected even from the "hateful glances" of demons, suggesting that even angry intention cannot penetrate the compassion-field surrounding the invocant.

¹³ **Eyes and heart of compassion**: The verse emphasizes that Avalokiteśvara "perceives" (with eyes) and "loves" (with heart) all beings, suggesting that perception and compassion are unified in the bodhisattva.

¹⁴ **True perception principle**: "真觀" (true perception) appears multiple times, suggesting that perceiving reality clearly is itself the compassionate response.
