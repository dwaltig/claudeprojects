**Time to 98% Ready**: 5-8 hours focused editorial work

## THE BOTTOM LINE

Your Lotus Sutra scholarly translation is **exceptional quality**. Translation, scholarship, and apparatus are publication-ready. One formatting issue blocks EPUB: Chapter 14 uses incompatible markdown footnote syntax.

**Fix Chapter 14 → Ready for EPUB production**

---

## CRITICAL ISSUE (Blocks Publication)

### Chapter 14: Markdown Footnote Syntax ⚠️ MUST FIX

**Problem**: Uses `[^1]` `[^2]` markdown syntax instead of superscript ¹ ² ³
**Impact**: Won't render correctly in EPUB
**Fix Time**: 2-3 hours (find/replace + verification)
**Priority**: BLOCKING

**Action**: Convert all 43 markdown footnote markers to Unicode superscript

---

## HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (Should Fix)

### 1. Chapter 6: Different Footnote Organization Pattern

**Pattern**: Footnotes grouped by section (not end-of-chapter like Chapter 2)
**Impact**: Inconsistent reading experience
**Decision Needed**:
- Convert to end-of-chapter? (1-2 hours)
- Accept as intentional? (document in 30 min)
- Standardize all chapters this way? (major undertaking)

### 2. Recently Updated Chapters Need Verification

**Chapters 4, 7-10** were updated November 17, 2025
**Action**: Spot-check that footnote integration matches standard
**Time**: 2-3 hours

---

## WHAT'S WORKING PERFECTLY ✓

1. **Translation Quality**: Exceptional scholarly rigor
2. **Philosophical Apparatus**: Deep, substantive, academically credible
3. **Character Names**: Diacriticals perfectly preserved (Śāriputra, Mañjuśrī, etc.)
4. **Tone/Voice**: Consistently formal Buddhist scriptural register
5. **Footnote Quality**: 1,554 footnotes across 28 chapters - all substantive
