## Translation

### Prose Section: The Cosmic Demonstration of Dharma-Transmission

At that time, myriads of bodhisattvas—numbering like the dust-particles of entire world-realms—emerged from beneath the earth. These were bodhisattvas who had previously dwelt in the Sahā world. They approached the Buddha, bowed with their heads to his feet, and addressed him: "World-Honored One, after you enter final nirvāṇa, in the lands where your various emanations have taught and subsequently passed away, we shall extensively proclaim this Lotus Sutra. Why? Because we ourselves desire to obtain this true, pure, supreme dharma. We shall receive it, maintain it, read and recite it, explain it, and offer reverent worship to it¹."

At that moment, the Tathāgata revealed his great supernatural powers before all assembled—before myriads of old bodhisattvas dwelling in the Sahā world, before myriads of monks and nuns, before male and female lay followers, before gods, dragons, and all types of supernatural beings. The Buddha extended his broad, long tongue upward until it reached the Brahma heavens, and from every pore of his body, he emitted innumerable rays of light, illuminating all ten directions of the world-system. All the precious trees beneath which were seated the Buddhas from the ten directions, as well as Śākyamuni Buddha and the eternally present Buddha (Prabhūtaratna), similarly extended their broad, long tongues and emitted vast rays of light². The display of supernatural power continued for one hundred thousand years.

Afterward, the Buddha and all those Buddhas withdrew their tongues. At that moment, all the Buddhas produced a single sound of coughing and a simultaneous finger-snap. These two sounds echoed throughout the ten directions of all world-systems. In all those world-systems, the very earth underwent six kinds of trembling: trembling, quaking, roaring, cracking, heaving, and surging upward. Through the Buddha's supernatural power, all beings throughout the ten directions perceived this Sahā world-realm: they saw the endless precious trees beneath which the Buddhas sat, and they perceived Śākyamuni Buddha together with the eternally present Buddha, surrounded by infinite assemblies of bodhisattvas and the four categories of disciples—all offering reverent worship³.

All the celestial beings then proclaimed aloud in the void: "Beyond myriads of incalculable billion-billion world-systems, there exists a realm named Sahā. Within it dwells a Buddha called Śākyamuni, who now teaches all bodhisattvas a great Mahāyāna sutra named the Lotus Sutra, teaching the bodhisattva-path, guarded and protected by all the Buddhas. You should all generate profound reverence, offer sincere worship, and respectfully honor Śākyamuni Buddha!"

When those innumerable beings heard this proclamation, all brought their palms together toward the Sahā world. They offered varieties of flowers, fragrances, garlands, silk banners, jeweled canopies, and precious objects from the ten directions. All these offered substances rose through the air like clouds accumulating, transforming into precious canopies that covered the Buddhas of the ten directions⁴. In this moment, the ten directions became unified and unobstructed, appearing as a single Buddha-realm.

At that time, the Buddha addressed the bodhisattva assembly led by Viśiṣṭa Bodhisattva: "The supernatural power of all the Buddhas is immeasurable, incalculable, boundless, and inconceivable. If I were to spend immeasurable, incalculable billions upon billions of eons explaining the supernatural powers, the merit, and the benefit of this sutra, I could never exhaust them. Therefore, in brief: all the dharmas possessed by the Tathāgata, all the sovereign powers of the Tathāgata, and all the profoundest secret treasures of the Tathāgata, all the exceedingly profound matters of the Tathāgata—all are revealed and proclaimed in this sutra. For this reason, after the Tathāgata's passing, you should receive, maintain, read, recite, explain, and write this sutra in all lands. In any land where this sutra is received and maintained—whether in a monastic garden, forest, tree-shade, monastic dwelling, or lay residence, whether in a hall or pavilion, in mountain valleys or wilderness—all such places should have stupas erected and offerings presented. Why? Because you should understand that all such places are bodhi-seats. It is in such places that all the Buddhas have attained unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment. It is in such places that all the Buddhas have turned the dharma-wheel. It is in such places that all the Buddhas have entered final nirvāṇa⁵."

### Verse Section: The Cosmic Verification of Dharma

*At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

All the Buddhas, saviors of the world,
Possess great supernatural powers,
Manifesting boundless miraculous deeds
To delight all sentient beings.

The tongue-faculty extends to the Brahma realms,
The body emits countless rays of light,
All to establish the bodhisattva path,
Revealing these extraordinary phenomena.

The sound of the Buddhas coughing,
And the sound of their finger-snapping,
Echo throughout the ten world-directions,
While the earth trembles with six kinds of motion.

Through the supernatural power of the Buddha,
All enable the maintenance of this sutra,
All the Buddhas rejoice together,
Revealing boundless supernatural powers⁶.

The merit and virtue of this person
Possesses no limits or boundary,
Like the endless space extending
In all ten directions without obstruction⁷.

Those who maintain this sutra
Have already seen me,
Have also perceived the Buddha Prabhūtaratna,
And all the emanation-Buddhas alike.

They have seen me in this present moment
Teaching the bodhisattva assembly.
Those who maintain this sutra
Enable me and my emanations,
Enable the eternally present Buddha,
All together to rejoice.

The Buddhas of the ten directions—
Both those of the present moment,
And those of the three times (past, present, future)—
All are seen and honored,
All receive offerings and attain joy⁸.

The Buddhas seated at the bodhi-tree,
The supreme secret dharma they obtained—
Those who maintain this sutra
Shall not long remain before obtaining them⁹.

Those who maintain this sutra
Possess inexhaustible eloquence
Regarding all dharma-meanings, terminology, and linguistic expressions,
Like wind moving through space with no obstruction.

After the Tathāgata's passing,
Know the sutra's meaning well,
Understand its causes and sequences,
And explain it according to the dharma.

Like the sun and moon illuminating
All darkness and obscurity,
Such a person walks through the world
Bringing light to all beings' darkness,

Teaching infinite bodhisattvas,
Establishing them in the one path (the Lotus teaching).

Therefore, those possessing wisdom,
Hearing of these merits,
After the Buddha's passing,
Should receive and maintain this sutra¹⁰.

Regarding the Buddha's path,
Without doubt or hesitation,
This person shall truly attain it¹¹.

### Philosophical Implications

Chapter 21 functions as a cosmic exclamation point, a demonstration that validates everything taught in the preceding chapters. The supernatural display—the extended tongue reaching Brahma realms, the light-rays illuminating all directions, the earth's six-fold trembling, the voice proclaiming across cosmos—are not mere theatrical effects. They constitute a metaphysical claim: that the dharma of the Lotus Sutra is verified by the entire Buddha-universe.

The extended tongue reaching the Brahma realms possesses profound symbolic significance. In Buddhist cosmology, the Brahma realms represent the highest reaches of conditional existence. The tongue—the organ of speech—extended to this limit suggests that dharma-transmission reaches the extremity of what can be expressed. Moreover, in Buddhist physiology, the tongue symbolizes the power of communication. A tongue extended to the heavens suggests that the sutra's words possess cosmic-spanning power.

The simultaneous display by Buddhas in all ten directions creates a mandala of verification. The historical Buddha Śākyamuni does not stand alone; he is surrounded and supported by all Buddhas across all space. Each Buddha from every direction performs the identical supernatural display, creating a unified, cosmic dharma-transmission. No Buddha differs from any other; all teach the identical sutra. This suggests that the Lotus Sutra represents not a particular teacher's innovation but the universal dharma of all Buddhas.

The six-fold earth trembling—trembling, quaking, roaring, cracking, heaving, and surging—represents a complete cosmic response to the dharma's revelation. Earth is not passive matter but a responsive being. The dharma's truth manifests physically, affecting the fundamental structure of reality. These tremors can be understood as the universe's acknowledgment of dharma-truth.

Most significantly, the chapter establishes that dharma-transmission is not limited to living Buddha-presence. The historical Buddha will pass away into final nirvāṇa. Yet the sutra itself becomes a continuing manifestation of Buddha-presence. Any location where the sutra is received and maintained—whether monastery or forest or lay residence—becomes a bodhi-seat, a place of enlightenment-attainment. This radical principle means that the Buddha's teaching function continues eternally through the sutra-text itself.

The instruction to erect stupas wherever the sutra is maintained reflects this principle at the architectural level. The stupa traditionally houses relics of the Buddha. But here, the text itself is declared to be Buddha-equivalent. The place where the sutra dwells becomes sacred space requiring stupa-honors. This suggests a sophisticated understanding that dharma is not merely abstract truth but concrete presence.

The cloud-like accumulation of offerings rising toward the heavens symbolizes the circulation of merit. The sutra's teaching generates merit that rises to support all the Buddhas; simultaneously, the Buddhas' blessings descend to support dharma-transmission. There is a continuous exchange between the Buddha-realm and the human realm, mediated by the sutra-text.

The declaration "the ten directions become unified and unobstructed, appearing as a single Buddha-realm" represents perhaps the sutra's most radical vision. Normally, the ten directions are separated by immeasurable distances; each Buddha-realm is isolated. Yet through the dharma-transmission of the Lotus Sutra, all realms merge into a single unified field. The boundaries separating Buddha-realms dissolve. This suggests that the sutra accomplishes not merely salvation of individual beings but the fundamental unification of all Buddha-realms, creating a cosmic sangha-body.

### Apparatus Summary

**Context**: Chapter 21 comes after the narrative exemplification of Never-Despiser and before the final assignment of the sutra's continuation. It functions as a cosmic demonstration validating all previous teachings.

**Central Teaching**: The Lotus Sutra is verified and authorized by all Buddhas throughout the cosmos. This verification takes the form of simultaneous supernatural displays that demonstrate the sutra's cosmic significance. The dharma-transmission is not individual practice but a Buddha-family activity spanning all of existence.

**Structural Function**: Chapter 21 elevates dharma-transmission from individual benefit (Chapters 17-20) to cosmic significance. It prepares for the final chapter's assignment of transmission-responsibility to the gathered assembly.

**Key Doctrinal Claims**:
- "All the Buddhas display supernatural powers to verify the Lotus Sutra"—establishes universal Buddha-authorization
- "Anywhere the sutra is maintained becomes a bodhi-seat"—elevates the text to sacred status
- "The ten directions become a unified Buddha-realm through the sutra"—claims cosmic unification through dharma
- "The sutra-maintenance continues Buddha-activity after the Buddha's passing"—establishes eternal dharma-transmission

**Philosophical Connections**:
- **Buddha-field**: The chapter's vision of the ten directions unifying into a single realm reflects the Mahāyāna conception of Buddha-lands as expressions of Buddha-consciousness
- **Dharma-body** (Dharmakāya): The principle that the sutra itself becomes Buddha-manifestation reflects the doctrine that the Buddha's ultimate body is dharma itself
- **Cosmic Buddha-network**: The simultaneous display by Buddhas in all directions suggests that all Buddhas constitute a unified body, all teaching identical dharma

**Footnotes**:

¹ **The earth-emerged bodhisattvas' vow**: These are the same bodhisattvas who emerged in Chapter 15. Now, after the revelation of the Buddha's eternal lifespan and the enumeration of benefits, they formalize their commitment to dharma-transmission.

² **The extended tongue motif**: The extended tongue reaching to Brahma realms appears in other Mahayana sutras as a sign of Buddha-truthfulness. A Buddha's tongue can cover their face; when extended, it indicates extreme emphasis on the truth being spoken.

³ **The six-fold earth trembling**: This terminology appears throughout Buddhist sutras as a sign of great dharmic events. The six types of trembling—trembling (kampa), quaking (kampana), roaring (asvana), cracking (bhijjana), heaving (utthapana), and surging (uddhuvaṇa)—represent a complete cosmic response.

⁴ **Cloud-like accumulation of offerings**: The metaphor of clouds accumulating suggests that offerings multiply and concentrate. This reflects the principle that merit increases through collective participation.

⁵ **The three Buddha-functions at bodhi-seats**: The text specifies that at any place where the sutra is maintained: (1) Buddhas attain enlightenment, (2) Buddhas turn the dharma-wheel, (3) Buddhas enter final nirvāṇa. These three events constitute the complete Buddha-life. The implication is that wherever the sutra is maintained, all three Buddha-functions occur.

⁶ **Coughing and finger-snapping as sounds**: These seemingly casual sounds—a cough and a snap—become cosmic proclamations. The Lotus Sutra often uses ordinary human actions to carry ultimate significance.

⁷ **Merit as boundless space**: The comparison of merit to space suggests infinite expandability. Merit does not get depleted through distribution but rather increases through sharing.

⁸ **Three-times Buddhas**: The reference to past, present, and future Buddhas suggests that dharma-transmission spans all time. Every Buddha, whenever they exist, participates in this transmission.

⁹ **"Shall not long remain"**: This phrase suggests that enlightenment approaches swiftly for sutra-maintainers. The condition for Buddhahood is created immediately through the sutra-engagement.

¹⁰ **Inexhaustible eloquence**: The principle of pratibhana (inexhaustible dharma-speech) reappears here, suggesting that the sutra-maintainer can discourse endlessly on dharma-meanings.

¹¹ **Without doubt or hesitation**: The final emphasis on certainty regarding the Buddha-path reinforces the sutra's central claim that enlightenment is guaranteed for all who maintain the sutra.
