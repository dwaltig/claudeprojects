## Summary

After review, the Lotus Sutra Blues translation is **already rich in Blues vernacular**. The key passages (burning house, Never Disparaging, physician father, eternal Buddha) are beautifully written and don't need significant revision.

The enhancement strategy should focus on:
1. **Chapter title variations** (one change already suggested)
2. **Transitional passages** between major sections
3. **Reader introductions** where doctrinal concepts are first explained

## Implementation Priority

### HIGH PRIORITY (Greatest impact)
1. Chapter 16 Reader Introduction (add weather/water imagery for eternal Buddha)
2. Chapter 25 Avalokiteśvara (add "troubled waters" reference)
3. Chapter 13 title change (Storm instead of Road)

6. Chapter 7 phantom city transition

### LOW PRIORITY

## Next Steps

Since the main translation text is already excellent, these additions should be:
- Added to **Reader Introductions** (prose sections that precede chapters)
- Added to **Interpretation Notes** (analytical sections)
- Used in **future audio companion scripts**

This preserves the integrity of the translation while enriching the supporting materials.
