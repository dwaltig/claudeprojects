## Philologist's Summary

The Blues translation is a highly interpretative, narrative-driven rendition. Its primary characteristics are:

1. **Extensive Over-Translation:** It consistently adds explanatory glosses, similes, and colloquial narrative framing to enhance accessibility and rhetorical impact.
2. **Minimal Ghost Characters:** It successfully conveys the core content of every sentence. No significant semantic units are omitted.
3. **Proper Nouns:** Generally adheres to standard Kumārajīva-based transliterations, with some bodhisattva names translated rather than transliterated.
4. **Fidelity Assessment:** Scores are lower (4-6) for passages with significant explanatory additions, and higher (7-9) for straightforward enumerations.

---

## Overall Confidence Score: 6.8/10

The translation is **theologically sound** and **liturgically powerful**, but *not suitable for direct philological citation*. It excels as a pastoral or liturgical translation for communities seeking an accessible entry to the Lotus Sutra.
