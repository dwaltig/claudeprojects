## Sentence-by-Sentence Comparison

| # | Chinese Phrase | Blues Rendering | Over-Translation | Ghost Characters | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 如是我聞 | "Listen now, this is what I heard with my own ears." | **Y**: "Listen now" (call-to-attention) and "with my own ears" are additions for emphasis. | N | **7/10** |
| 2 | 一時、佛住王舍城、耆闍崛山中 | "One time—and ain't it always one time when truth comes calling—the Buddha was staying up on Vulture Peak Mountain, right outside the city called King's House." | **Y**: "ain't it always one time when truth comes calling" is a wholly added colloquial aside not in the source. | N | **6/10** |
| 3 | 與大比丘眾萬二千人俱 | "And he wasn't alone, no sir. He had twelve thousand monks with him..." | **Y**: "And he wasn't alone, no sir" is a dramatic addition. The underlying count (12,000) is accurate. | N | **8/10** |
| 4 | 皆是阿羅漢 | "...every last one of them a brother who'd made it through to the other side." | **Y**: "brother who'd made it through to the other side" is an interpretive expansion of "Arhat." | N | **7/10** |
| 5 | 諸漏已盡 | "They'd dried up all the leaking wounds of craving." | **Y**: "leaking wounds of craving" is a powerful metaphor, but *āsrava* (漏) is not "wounds" but "outflows/defilements." The addition of "craving" narrows the meaning (漏 includes ignorance and existence, not just craving). | N | **6/10** |
| 6 | 無復煩惱 | "They'd burned out every last bit of that fever we call desire." | **Y**: "fever we call desire" is not in the source. 煩惱 (*kleśa*) is broader than "desire." | N | **6/10** |
| 7 | 逮得己利 | "They'd gotten what they came for..." | **Y**: Slightly colloquial expansion, but semantically accurate for 己利 ("self-benefit/what they came for"). | N | **8/10** |
| 8 | 盡諸有結 | "...broke every chain that binds a person to this wheel of suffering..." | **Y**: "wheel of suffering" is not present in the source. 有結 ("bonds of existence") is accurately captured as "chains that bind." | N | **7/10** |
| 9 | 心得自在 | "...and their minds were finally free—free like a bird that's been caged all its life and somebody finally opens the door." | **Y**: The "bird" simile is a complete addition. | N | **5/10** |
| 10 | 其名曰：阿若憍陳如... (full name list) | "Let me tell you their names, 'cause names matter..." (then the full name list is provided in subsequent paragraphs) | N | **N** (names were translated in the next section) | **9/10** |

## Major Finding: Ghost Characters in the Opening Section

The Blues translation correctly preserves the **Arhat name list** in its own detailed paragraph. All major Sanskrit names (阿若憍陳如 = Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya, etc.) are rendered according to Kanding/Taisho standards.

**However**, the following Arhat-quality terms were **not explicitly rendered** but rather collapsed into the poetic imagery:

| Ghost Phrase | Meaning | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 逮得己利 | "attained self-benefit" | Collapsed into "gotten what they came for." |
| 盡諸有結 | "exhausted all bonds of existence" | Collapsed into "broke every chain." |
| 心得自在 | "mind attained freedom" | Collapsed into "minds were finally free." |

**Assessment**: These are acceptable interpretive collapses for a vernacular edition, but a scholarly edition should gloss these terms separately.

---

## Overall Confidence Score: **7.2/10**

The translation is a **theologically sound interpretation** of the source, prioritizing accessibility and cultural resonance over lexical precision. It is **not suitable for philological citation** but excels as a **liturgical or pastoral translation**.
