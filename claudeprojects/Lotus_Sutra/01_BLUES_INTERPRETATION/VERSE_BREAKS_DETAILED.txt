LONG VERSE BREAKS - DETAILED BREAKDOWN
November 9, 2025
================================================================================

PROJECT: Blues Interpretation of the Lotus Sutra - ElevenReader Audiobook

================================================================================
OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Added strategic single-line breaks every 50 lines (~500 words) within extended
verse passages. This creates natural narration pause points for ElevenReader
without compromising the poetic flow.

================================================================================
WHAT ARE VERSE BREAKS?
================================================================================

VERSE SECTIONS are identified by markers such as:
- "spoke in verse"
- "sings out his own verse"
- "wishing to say it again in another way"
- "wanted to speak in verse"

When a verse section is detected:
✓ Script counts consecutive lines of poetry
✓ Every 50 lines, a single blank line is inserted
✓ This creates a natural pause point for narration
✓ Verse continues seamlessly after the break

WHY 50 LINES?
- 50 lines of verse ≈ 500+ words when in single-line format
- Matches professional audiobook standards
- Allows narrator to take a breath without interrupting meaning
- Improves listener comprehension in complex passages

================================================================================

CHAPTER 1: THE OPENING
- Maitreya's question to Mañjuśrī (Lines 46+)

================================================================================
BREAK FREQUENCY PATTERN
================================================================================

SINGLE LINE BREAK (within verses):
- Inserted every 50 lines of verse
- Creates brief narration pause (0.5-1 second)
- Maintains poetic flow
- Prevents excessive breaks

DOUBLE LINE BREAK (chapter/subsection boundaries):
- Before each chapter header
- Before each subsection header (THE ...)
- Creates longer pause (1-2 seconds)
- Clearly delineates sections

MAX 2 CONSECUTIVE BREAKS:
- No triple+ blank lines in file
- Prevents awkward extended silences
- Follows ElevenLabs best practices

================================================================================
HOW IT SOUNDS IN ELENREADER
================================================================================

WITHOUT VERSE BREAKS:
"Mañjuśrī, tell me why—
Why the Teacher's shining bright
From that white hair between his eyes,
Pouring out that great big light?
[continues for 50 more lines without pause...]"

NARRATOR IMPACT: Voice gets monotonous, listener loses attention

WITH VERSE BREAKS:
"Mañjuśrī, tell me why—
Why the Teacher's shining bright
From that white hair between his eyes,
Pouring out that great big light?
[breathes/pauses slightly]
Mandarava flowers raining down,
Manjusaka falling all around,
[continues with natural pacing...]"

NARRATOR IMPACT: Clearer delivery, listener maintains engagement, professional quality

================================================================================
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

SCRIPT: add_long_verse_breaks.py

DETECTION LOGIC:
1. Scan file for verse start markers
2. Count lines from marker until section end
3. If more than 50 lines, divide into segments
4. Insert single blank line every 50 lines

SECTION END MARKERS:
- "THE " (subsection header)
- "CHAPTER " (new chapter)
- "--- CHAPTER" (chapter divider)
- "INTERPRETATION NOTES:" (notes section)

OUTPUT:
- Original file: 7,792 lines
- With chapter/subsection breaks: 7,974 lines
- With long verse breaks added: 7,984 lines
- Total breaks added: 192 lines strategic spacing

================================================================================
QUALITY ASSURANCE
