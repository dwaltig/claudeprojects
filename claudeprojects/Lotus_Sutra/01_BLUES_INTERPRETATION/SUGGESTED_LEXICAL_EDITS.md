# Lotus Sutra Blues Translation: Suggested Lexical Edits
## Addressing "Road" Metaphor Repetition

**Date**: January 12, 2026  
**Based on**: MAS Audit Report findings

---

## Overview

The Blues translation uses "road" approximately **90+ times**. Many of these are appropriate—particularly the recurring "Buddha-road" phrase which mirrors the Chinese 佛道 (fódào). However, some transitional and descriptive uses can be varied for freshness.

**Note**: The term "tune" was NOT overused—this was a misperception. The audit should be updated.

## Recommended Edits by Category

### Category 1: KEEP AS-IS (Doctrinal/Technical Use)
These uses translate 道 (dào/road/way) and should remain:

- "Buddha-road" — translates 佛道, the Buddha Way
- "accomplished the Buddha-road" — formulaic prophecy phrase
- "enter the Buddha-road" — entering the path to Buddhahood
- "road of one vehicle" — 一乘道, the One Vehicle teaching

**No changes recommended for these ~60 instances.**

|------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 252 | "the hard road of human trouble" | "the long midnight of human trouble" | More evocative Blues image |
| 419 | "It was a hard road, and it was final" | "It was a steep climb, and it was final" | Varies the journey metaphor |
| 451 | "walked the long hard road" | "walked through the valley of shadows" | Biblical/Blues resonance |
| 505 | "walking the bodhisattva road" | "following the bodhisattva path" | Simple variation |
| 580 | "Walking many different roads" | "Riding many different rails" | Train imagery = classic Blues |
| 606 | "Seeking that road to wisdom supreme" | "Seeking that light of wisdom supreme" | Varies the metaphor |
| 1142 | "he walked them roads" | "he crossed them rivers" | Water imagery |
| 1167 | "Walked every single road there was to walk" | "Crossed every bridge there was to cross" | Variation |
| 1286 | "Praising the road you walked yourself" | "Praising the journey you made yourself" | Subtle variation |
| 1311 | "Or is it just the road we walk?" | "Or is it just the way we travel?" | Avoids "road" |
| 1326 | "They wanting to hear about the complete road" | "They wanting to hear about the whole journey" | Variation |
| 1838 | "Entering the dangerous road of birth and death" | "Crossing the troubled waters of birth and death" | Powerful Blues image |

### Category 3: CHAPTER TITLES

**Consider varying one chapter title:**

| Current | Suggestion |
|---------|------------|
| Chapter 13: "When the Road Gets Rough, You Gotta Keep Walking" | "When the Storm Comes Down, You Gotta Keep Standing" |

This provides variety while maintaining the resilience theme.
