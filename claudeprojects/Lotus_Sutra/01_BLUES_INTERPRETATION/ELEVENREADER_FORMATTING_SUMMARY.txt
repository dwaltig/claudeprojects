HOW BREAKS WORK IN ELENREADER
================================================================================

When ElevenReader processes the formatted file:

1. DOUBLE LINE BREAKS are recognized as natural pause points
2. ElevenReader will:
   - Create audible pauses at chapter boundaries
   - Create audible pauses at subsection boundaries
   - Maintain natural narration rhythm
   - Allow listeners to follow chapter/section structure clearly

3. RESULT:
   - Each chapter is clearly delineated in audio
   - Each subsection gets its own distinct pause
   - Natural narration flow maintained
   - Professional audiobook structure

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED UPLOAD SETTINGS
================================================================================

When uploading to ElevenReader:

1. File Format: Use lotus_sutra_for_elevenreader_FORMATTED.txt
2. Voice Selection: Choose voice that conveys:
   - Blues/gospel vernacular authenticity
   - Spiritual reverence
   - Narrative warmth and accessibility
   - Strong pronunciation of Sanskrit diacritics

3. Pronunciation Dictionary: Consider creating entries for:
   - Śākyamuni → "Shakya-moo-nee"
   - Avalokiteśvara → "Ah-vah-loh-key-tesh-vah-rah"
   - Mañjuśrī → "Mahn-joo-shree"
   - All other Sanskrit terms with unusual pronunciation

4. Chapter Structure: File is already organized by chapters
   - ElevenReader will recognize breaks
   - Consider labeling chapters in metadata

5. Production Settings:
   - Maintain default speech rate for vernacular clarity
   - Enable emotional expression for verse sections
   - Preview narration quality on first chapter before full production

================================================================================
LONG VERSE BREAK STRATEGY (NEW FEATURE)
================================================================================

VERSE DETECTION:
- Automatic detection of verse sections using markers like "spoke in verse"
- Verses identified in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and others

BREAK INSERTION:
- Every 50 lines (~500 words) within a verse passage gets a single line break
- This creates natural narration pause points for ElevenReader
- Prevents narrator fatigue in very long poetic sections
- Improves listener comprehension of complex verse passages

EXAMPLE:
Chapter 1 long verse (Maitreya asks Mañjuśrī about the light):
- Line 46: Verse begins ("spoke in verse")
- Lines 47-96: First verse segment (50 lines) [BREAK HERE]
- Lines 97-146: Second verse segment (50 lines) [BREAK HERE]
- Lines 147-end: Remaining verse until next section

EFFECT ON AUDIO:
- Listener hears natural pause every ~500 words
- Maintains engagement during long poetic passages
- Professional audiobook narration quality
- Follows published audiobook standards
