    <h1>CHAPTER NINE: WHEN THE FAITHFUL GET THEIR DUE</h1>
    <h2>(Prophecies for the Learners and the Learned)</h2>

    <p>Now Ānanda and Rāhula, they been sitting there watching all these prophecies going out, and something starts stirring in their hearts. They thinking to themselves: "We been here all along, ain't we? Don't we get a word too? Wouldn't that be something—wouldn't that be sweet?"</p>
    <p>So they rise up from where they sitting, and they walk right up to the Teacher, and they bow down low, faces to his feet, showing proper respect. And together they speak up:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, we been thinking—we got a place in this too, don't we? Ain't nobody else we can turn to but you, Lord. You the only one. And everybody knows us—all the heavenly beings and earthly folk, even the demons know who we are. Ānanda here, he been standing by your side, keeping watch over every word you spoke, holding the teaching safe like a mama holds her baby. And Rāhula, well, he your own flesh and blood, your actual son. So if you gonna speak that supreme enlightenment over us, if you gonna call our names too—well, that would fill up what we been hoping for. That would satisfy what all these people been expecting. Our cup would overflow, and the crowd's cup too."</p>

    <p>Now there was two thousand disciples in that assembly—some still learning, working it out, still on the journey; some already graduated, got their lessons down. And when they heard Ānanda and Rāhula speak up, every last one of them rises to their feet. They slip their right shoulder out of their robes—that's the way you show respect—and they come forward to the Buddha, and they put their palms together, and they just stand there looking up at him with one heart, one hope, same desire Ānanda and Rāhula got. Just standing there on the side, waiting. Patient people. Faithful people. Been there all along.</p>

    <p>Then the Buddha, he turns to Ānanda and he says:</p>
    <p>"Ānanda, listen now. In the world that's coming, you gonna become a Buddha. They gonna call you Mountain-Sea-Wisdom-Free-Penetration-King Tathāgata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.</p>
    <p>"You gonna serve sixty-two billion Buddhas, gonna keep watch over the teaching for every one of them, protecting that Dharma like you been protecting mine. And after all that faithful service, after all that holding and keeping and remembering—then you gonna reach that supreme perfect enlightenment your own self.</p>
    <p>"You gonna teach twenty thousand million billion Ganges-river-sands worth of bodhisattvas, gonna bring them all the way up to that supreme perfect enlightenment. Your land gonna be called Constant-Victory-Banner-Standing—and child, that land gonna be clean. Pure as pure can be. The ground gonna be lapis lazuli, that deep blue stone, smooth and precious. And the era you teaching in, they gonna call it Wonderful-Sound-Pervading, 'cause your voice gonna fill everything, gonna reach everywhere.</p>
    <p>"Your life as a Buddha gonna last countless thousands of millions of billions of immeasurable eons—you can't even count it. You could spend a thousand million billion immeasurable eons trying to calculate it with your finest mathematics, and you still couldn't get the number. The true Dharma gonna last twice as long as your lifetime. The reflected Dharma gonna last twice as long as the true Dharma.</p>
    <p>"And Ānanda, this Mountain-Sea-Wisdom-Free-Penetration-King Buddha—that's you, child—you gonna be praised by innumerable thousands of millions of billions of Ganges-sands worth of Buddhas in all ten directions. They all gonna be singing your name, speaking your merit, telling what you done."</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>Right here in this assembly, I'm speaking it plain:<br>
        Ānanda, who holds the Dharma like a vessel holds rain,<br>
        You gonna serve the Buddhas, every one that you meet,<br>
        Then you gonna wake up perfect, gonna claim your own seat.</p>
        <p>They'll call you Mountain-Sea-Wisdom, Self-Mastered-King,<br>
        Your land gonna be spotless, purest precious thing,<br>
        Called Constant-Victory-Banner, that's the name of your ground,<br>
        You gonna teach bodhisattvas thick as stars all around.</p>
        <p>Countless as the Ganges sand, that's how many you'll raise,<br>
        Your Buddha-power gonna be mighty, your reputation gonna blaze,<br>
        Your name gonna fill ten directions, everywhere they gonna know,<br>
        Your lifetime can't be measured—mercy makes it overflow.</p>
        <p>You gonna live so long, child, out of love for what you teach,<br>
        True Dharma gonna last double that, extending your reach,<br>
        And the reflected Dharma, it gonna double that again—<br>
        Like Ganges-river-sandgrains, countless people you'll bring in.</p>
        <p>All those innumerable beings gonna plant their seeds<br>
        In this Buddha-Dharma of yours, gonna meet their deepest needs,<br>
        They gonna start their journey to Buddhahood right there,<br>
        In the field you tended faithful, with your patient care.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Now there was eight thousand bodhisattvas in that gathering who just recently started out on the path, beginners really, and they looking at all this and they start wondering. They thinking to themselves: "Hold on now—we ain't even heard the great bodhisattvas, the advanced ones, getting prophecies like this. So what's the reason, what's the cause, that these voice-hearers, these disciples, getting such clear predictions?"</p>
    <p>The World-Honored One, he knows what they thinking—he can read a heart like you read a book. So he speaks to them directly:</p>
    <p>"Good sons, listen here. Me and Ānanda, we made our vows together way back when, under the Buddha called Empty-King. We both set our hearts on that supreme perfect enlightenment at the same time, same place.</p>
    <p>"But Ānanda, he always loved learning. He wanted to hear it all, study it all, remember it all. Me, I went the route of vigorous practice, constant pushing, hard work, discipline. That's why I already reached that supreme perfect enlightenment, and Ānanda—he been protecting my teaching, keeping the Dharma safe. He gonna protect the Dharma-treasure of all the Buddhas coming in the future too. He gonna teach and bring to completion multitudes of bodhisattvas.</p>
    <p>"That was his original vow, you see. That was his heart's desire from way back. That's why he gets this prophecy now. He been faithful to his calling."</p>

    <p>Now Ānanda, standing right there before the Buddha, hearing his own name called, hearing about that pure land that's coming, hearing every single thing he ever hoped for being confirmed—his heart just fills up. Joy like he never known before washes over him. It's unprecedented. Never felt nothing like it.</p>
    <p>And right then, in that moment, he remembers. He remembers the Dharma-treasures of countless thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas from the ancient past. All of it comes flooding back, and he understands it perfectly, no obstacles, clear as day—just like what he hearing right now. And he understands his original vow too. He remembers who he always been.</p>
    <p>So Ānanda, he sings out his own verse:</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>World-Honored One, you so rare, so precious, so unique—<br>
        You made me remember the past, made the ancient present speak,<br>
        All those countless Buddha-teachings from so long ago<br>
        Coming back clear as today, now I finally know.</p>
        <p>I ain't got no doubts no more, I'm settled on this road,<br>
        I'm standing firm in Buddha-way, carrying this load,<br>
        I played my part with skillful means, standing by your side,<br>
        Protecting all the Buddhas' Dharma, faithful as a bride.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Then the Buddha turns to Rāhula and he says:</p>
    <p>"Rāhula, in the world to come, you gonna become a Buddha. They gonna call you Stepping-on-Seven-Jewel-Flowers Tathāgata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.</p>
    <p>"You gonna serve Buddhas numbering like the dust-motes in ten worlds, and you gonna always be the eldest son to all of them, just like you are to me right now. Always the firstborn. Always that close.</p>
    <p>"This Stepping-on-Seven-Jewel-Flowers Buddha—the purity of your land, how long you gonna live, how long the era lasts, how many disciples you gonna teach, the true Dharma period, the reflected Dharma period—all of it gonna be just like Mountain-Sea-Wisdom-Free-Penetration-King Tathāgata. No different. And you gonna be the eldest son to that Buddha too, before you step into your own enlightenment and become a Buddha yourself."</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>When I was a prince in the palace, living that royal life,<br>
        Rāhula was my firstborn son, before all the strife,<br>
        Now I've awakened to Buddha-way, and he's my son in Dharma too,<br>
        Receiving the teaching, carrying it on, loyal and true.</p>
        <p>In the ages yet to come, he gonna see billions of Buddhas rise,<br>
        Gonna be the eldest son to every one, that's his prize,<br>
        Single-hearted, seeking Buddha-way with everything he got,<br>
        Faithful to that one true path, never forgot.</p>
        <p>Rāhula practices in secret, hidden deep inside,<br>
        Only I can see it, only I know what he hides,<br>
        Right now he shows himself as my eldest son for all to see,<br>
        Teaching these multitudes by his example, humble as can be.</p>
        <p>Billions and billions of merit, countless virtues he done stored,<br>
        Settled firm in Buddha-Dharma, seeking that supreme reward,<br>
        Standing steady on the path, walking toward that highest light,<br>
        Patient as the morning, faithful as the night.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Now the World-Honored One, he looks out at those two thousand people—learners and learned, still-training and beyond-training—and he sees that their hearts are soft now, quiet and clean, peaceful and pure, all of them looking at him with one mind, one gaze.</p>
    <p>The Buddha says to Ānanda: "You see these two thousand people—the learners and the learned?"</p>
    <p>Ānanda says: "Yes, Lord, I see them."</p>
    <p>"Ānanda, every single one of these people gonna serve Buddhas numbering like the dust-motes in fifty worlds. They gonna honor them, respect them, protect the Dharma-treasure for every one.</p>
    <p>"And then, at the end, they all gonna become Buddhas at the same time, in the same moment, in lands throughout the ten directions. And they all gonna have the same name—every last one. They gonna be called Jewel-Mark Tathāgata, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.</p>
    <p>"They all gonna live for one eon. The purity of their lands, the number of voice-hearers and bodhisattvas, the true Dharma period, the reflected Dharma period—all of it gonna be exactly equal, exactly the same. No difference between them. All equal. All honored."</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>These two thousand voice-hearers standing here today,<br>
        I'm giving prophecy to every one, showing them the way,<br>
        In the future they gonna become Buddhas, gonna reach that goal,<br>
        After serving countless Buddhas, they gonna make it whole.</p>
        <p>They gonna serve as many Buddhas as the dustmotes I described,<br>
        Protecting the Dharma-treasure, keeping the truth alive,<br>
        After all that faithful service, they gonna wake up at last,<br>
        Gonna sit in perfect enlightenment, free from the past.</p>
        <p>Each in their own direction, in lands spread all around,<br>
        But they gonna share one name, one title, one renown,<br>
        All sitting in the place of enlightenment at the exact same time,<br>
        All bearing witness to supreme wisdom, all in their prime.</p>
        <p>Every one called Jewel-Mark—that's the name they'll bear,<br>
        Their countries and their students, everything they'll share,<br>
        True Dharma and reflected Dharma lasting just the same,<br>
        Equal in every measure, equal in their fame.</p>
        <p>All of them using supernatural powers to save beings far and wide,<br>
        Their reputation spreading everywhere, reaching every side,<br>
        Gradually they gonna enter into nirvāṇa's peaceful rest,<br>
        After a lifetime of teaching, after giving their very best.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When those two thousand learners and learned ones heard the Buddha speak their prophecy, they couldn't hold it in. Joy jumped up in them, they started leaping and dancing, and they sang back to him:</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>World-Honored One, you a lamp of wisdom burning bright,<br>
        We heard you call our names, we heard you speak our plight,<br>
        Our hearts are overflowing, filled up to the brim,<br>
        Like we been touched by immortal nectar, like sweet dew on the rim.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>END OF CHAPTER NINE: WHEN THE FAITHFUL GET THEIR DUE</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This chapter is about the dignity of service, the honor of patience, and the vindication of the faithful. I made several key interpretive choices:</p>
        <p><strong>Central Metaphors:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Holding the teaching like a mama holds her baby" - for Ānanda's role as protector of the Dharma</li>
            <li>"Our cup would overflow" - blues/gospel language for fulfillment and satisfaction</li>
            <li>"Faithful as a bride" - for Ānanda's loyal devotion</li>
            <li>"Patient as the morning, faithful as the night" - for Rāhula's steady practice</li>
            <li>"Like sweet dew on the rim" - transforming "nectar" (甘露/amṛta) into something both familiar and transcendent</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Character Voices:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ānanda and Rāhula speak with humility but also with legitimate desire for recognition</li>
            <li>The 2,000 are characterized by their patient silence and collective hoping</li>
            <li>The Buddha speaks with both formality (in the official prophecies with full titles) and intimacy (in explanation)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key Teachings Preserved:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ānanda chose the path of learning/remembering while Buddha chose vigorous practice</li>
            <li>This explains their different roles and timing of enlightenment</li>
            <li>Rāhula's practice is "secret" (密行) - hidden, inner work</li>
            <li>The 2,000 are all equal in their eventual attainment - democracy of enlightenment</li>
            <li>Service and waiting have their own dignity and lead to full realization</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The title "When the Faithful Get Their Due" captures the chapter's essence: this is about patient people, background people, faithful servants finally receiving public acknowledgment and prophecy.</p>
