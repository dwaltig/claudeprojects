    <h1>CHAPTER FIFTEEN: WHEN THE UNDERGROUND ARMY ROSE UP</h1>
    <h2>(Springing Up from the Earth)</h2>

    <h3>THE OFFER THAT GOT TURNED DOWN</h3>
    <p>Now at that time, all them bodhisattvas from other worlds—countless worlds beyond counting, more than eight Ganges rivers full of sand—they stood up in that great gathering. They pressed their palms together, bowed down low, and said to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, if you let us—when you gone from this world, after you passed on—we will stay right here in this Śākyamuni realm, this troubled world called Sahā. We will work hard, we will stay diligent, we will protect this sutra, read it, recite it, write it down, make offerings to it. We will teach it far and wide in this land here."</p>
    <p>But then the Buddha, he told all them bodhisattvas—all them great beings from other worlds:</p>
    <p>"Stop. Stop right there, good sons. You don't need to protect this sutra. You don't need to worry yourselves about it.</p>
    <p>Why's that?</p>
    <p>Because my Śākyamuni world—this world right here—it already got 60,000 times the sands of the Ganges River worth of great bodhisattvas. And every single one of them bodhisattvas, they each got their own retinue—60,000 Ganges-sands worth of followers each.</p>
    <p>And these people—all these beings right here—they able to protect this sutra after I'm gone. They can hold it, read it, recite it, teach it wide."</p>

    <h3>THE EARTH SPLITS WIDE OPEN</h3>
    <p>Now when the Buddha spoke them words, the whole Śākyamuni world—all three thousand great thousand realms of it—the ground started shaking and trembling and splitting apart.</p>
    <p>And out from them cracks, out from underneath, there came bursting forth countless thousands, tens of thousands, millions, billions of bodhisattvas—great bodhisattvas, mighty bodhisattvas—all at the same time, all rising up together like a flood, like a army, like the morning breaking.</p>
    <p>And these bodhisattvas, every one of them had bodies of gold—golden like the sunrise, golden like pure truth. They all had the thirty-two marks, they all shining with boundless light, they all radiant beyond measure.</p>
    <p>And all along, all this time before now, they'd been living right underneath this Śākyamuni world—down below in the empty space beneath this realm—just dwelling there, waiting there, ready there.</p>
    <p>These bodhisattvas, they heard Śākyamuni Buddha's voice when he spoke, and they came up from below. They answered the call.</p>

    <h3>THE VAST NUMBERS THAT NOBODY CAN COUNT</h3>
    <p>Now every one of these bodhisattvas, they was leaders—great leaders, mighty leaders—leading the masses, guiding the multitudes.</p>
    <p>And each one was bringing their own followers with them:</p>
    <p>Some had retinues of 60,000 Ganges-sands worth,<br>
    Some had 50,000 Ganges-sands,<br>
    Some 40,000, some 30,000, some 20,000, some 10,000 Ganges-sands of followers.</p>
    <p>And then there was those with one Ganges-sand worth,<br>
    Or half a Ganges-sand,<br>
    Or a quarter, or one-eighth,<br>
    Or down to a thousand million billion nayutas fraction of a Ganges-sand.</p>
    <p>And some had a thousand million billion nayutas of disciples,<br>
    Some had a hundred million or ten million,<br>
    Some had a million, hundred thousand, down to ten thousand.</p>
    <p>Some had a thousand, a hundred, down to ten.</p>
    <p>Some brought five disciples, some four, some three, some two, some just one.</p>
    <p>And some came alone—single and solitary, loving the quiet path, walking the remote road by themselves.</p>
    <p>On and on like this—countless, boundless, beyond all calculation, beyond all comparison, beyond all arithmetic, beyond what numbers can measure or words can tell.</p>

    <h3>THE GREAT ASSEMBLY AND THE LONG PRAISE</h3>
    <p>When all these bodhisattvas came up from the earth, they each went to the jeweled stupa in the sky—to where Abundant Treasures Tathāgata and Śākyamuni Buddha was sitting together.</p>
    <p>When they got there, they bowed down before both World-Honored Ones, touched their heads to the feet of both Buddhas. They went to all the Buddha-copies sitting under the jeweled trees on lion thrones throughout the realms, and they bowed before each one too.</p>
    <p>They circled them three times to the right, then stood with palms pressed together in deep respect. And they praised the Buddhas with all manner of bodhisattva praise-forms—praising and honoring, then standing to one side, gazing up joyfully at the two World-Honored Ones.</p>
    <p>Now these great bodhisattvas, from the time they first burst forth from the earth, they was praising the Buddhas with all kinds of bodhisattva praise-forms. And this praising—this honoring and celebrating—it went on for FIFTY SMALL KALPAS. Fifty ages. Fifty long stretches of time.</p>
    <p>And during all this time, Śākyamuni Buddha sat there silent. And all the four assemblies—they was silent too. Fifty small kalpas they was silent.</p>
    <p>But because of the Buddha's spiritual power, he made it seem to that great assembly like only half a day had passed. Half a day! Time got bent, time got folded, time got compressed by the Buddha's power.</p>
    <p>And also because of the Buddha's spiritual power, the four assemblies could see all them bodhisattvas filling up the empty space of countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of realms—filling it all up, everywhere you looked.</p>

    <h3>THE FOUR GREAT LEADERS STEP FORWARD</h3>
    <p>Now among all that vast bodhisattva multitude, there was four leaders—four chief guides, four head teachers:</p>
    <p>The first was named SUPERIOR PRACTICE (上行 - Viśiṣṭhacāritra),<br>
    The second was named BOUNDLESS PRACTICE (無邊行 - Anantacāritra),<br>
    The third was named PURE PRACTICE (淨行 - Viśuddhacāritra),<br>
    The fourth was named WELL-ESTABLISHED PRACTICE (安立行 - Supratiṣṭhitacāritra).</p>
    <p>These four bodhisattvas—they was the highest leaders, the chief guides among all that crowd.</p>
    <p>They came forward in front of the great assembly. They pressed their palms together, gazed at Śākyamuni Buddha, and asked respectfully:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, are you well? Do you have few sicknesses? Few troubles? Are you dwelling in peace and ease? Are the beings you teaching—are they easy to teach? Are they receiving instruction without resistance? We hope you not worn out, not exhausted, not burdened down by the work."</p>

    <h3>THE FOUR LEADERS SPEAK IN VERSE</h3>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>Is the World-Honored One dwelling in peace,<br>
        with few sicknesses, few troubles?<br>
        Teaching all these living beings—<br>
        do you find yourself growing weary?</p>
        <p>And are these living beings<br>
        easy to teach, easy to reach?<br>
        We hope they don't make the World-Honored One<br>
        tired, worn down, heavy-burdened.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>THE BUDDHA SAYS: "IT AIN'T BEEN HARD"</h3>
    <p>Then the World-Honored One, there in the midst of that vast bodhisattva assembly, he said:</p>
    <p>"Yes, yes, good sons. The Tathāgata is dwelling in peace. I got few sicknesses, few troubles. And these living beings—they easy to teach. There ain't been no weariness, no fatigue.</p>
    <p>Why's that?</p>
    <p>Because these living beings, life after life, world after world, age after age, they been receiving my teaching all along. And also in ages past, under previous Buddhas, they showed respect and reverence, and they planted all kinds of good roots.</p>
    <p>So when these beings first saw my body, when they first heard what I was saying, they believed right away. They received it and entered into the Tathāgata's wisdom—just like that.</p>
    <p>Now there's some exceptions—those who studied the small vehicle before, the lesser teachings. But even those people, I'm making sure they hear this sutra now, so they can enter into the Buddha's wisdom too."</p>

    <h3>THE GREAT BODHISATTVAS REJOICE</h3>
    <p>Then at that time, all them great bodhisattvas spoke in verse, saying:</p>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>Excellent! Excellent!<br>
        Great Hero, World-Honored One,<br>
        All these living beings—<br>
        they easy to teach, easy to guide.</p>
        <p>They able to ask the Buddhas<br>
        about deep wisdom, profound truth.<br>
        Hearing it, they believe and practice—<br>
        and we rejoice along with them!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>THE BUDDHA PRAISES HIS STUDENTS</h3>
    <p>Then the World-Honored One praised them chief bodhisattvas, saying:</p>
    <p>"Excellent! Excellent, good sons! You able to rejoice along with the Tathāgata—able to be glad in the Tathāgata's work. That's good, that's real good."</p>

    <h3>MAITREYA'S MIND STARTS SPINNING</h3>
    <p>Now at that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva and 8,000 Ganges-sands worth of other bodhisattvas—they all had this thought arise in their minds:</p>
    <p>"All this time up till now—from way back, from the beginning—we never seen, never heard tell of such a vast assembly of great bodhisattvas bursting up from the earth like this, standing before the World-Honored One, palms pressed together, making offerings, asking after the Tathāgata.</p>
    <p>Where did they come from? What is this?"</p>

    <h3>MAITREYA ASKS THE EXPLOSIVE QUESTION</h3>
    <p>So Maitreya Bodhisattva, knowing what was on the minds of them 8,000 Ganges-sands worth of bodhisattvas—and wanting to clear up his own doubts too—he pressed his palms together, faced the Buddha, and asked in verse:</p>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>Countless thousands of millions of billions—<br>
        this vast assembly of bodhisattvas,<br>
        we never seen before, never once.<br>
        Will the Honored One of Two Feet explain:</p>
        <p>Where did they come from?<br>
        What causes and conditions brought them here?<br>
        They got giant bodies, great spiritual powers,<br>
        wisdom that can't be fathomed—</p>
        <p>Their will and intention is rock-solid firm,<br>
        they got the power of great patience and endurance,<br>
        living beings love to see them—<br>
        but where they come from?</p>
        <p>Every single one of these bodhisattvas<br>
        got their own retinue of followers,<br>
        and the numbers got no measure—<br>
        like the sands of the Ganges River.</p>
        <p>Some of these great bodhisattvas<br>
        leading 60,000 Ganges-sands worth,<br>
        and all these vast crowds<br>
        seeking the Buddha-way with one mind.</p>
        <p>These great teachers—<br>
        all 60,000 Ganges-sands of them—<br>
        they come together to make offerings to Buddha<br>
        and to protect and uphold this sutra.</p>
        <p>Some leading 50,000 Ganges-sands,<br>
        and the numbers go even higher than that.<br>
        Some got 40,000, some 30,000,<br>
        some 20,000 down to 10,000,</p>
        <p>Some with a thousand, a hundred,<br>
        down to one Ganges-sand worth,<br>
        or half, or a third or quarter,<br>
        or down to one billion-millionth fraction,</p>
        <p>Thousands of millions of nayutas,<br>
        ten thousands of billions of disciples,<br>
        down to half a billion,<br>
        and the numbers keep going higher still.</p>
        <p>A hundred thousand down to ten thousand,<br>
        a thousand down to a hundred,<br>
        fifty, ten,<br>
        down to three, two, one,</p>
        <p>Or coming alone with no retinue,<br>
        loving the solitary path—<br>
        all coming to the Buddha's place,<br>
        and the numbers beyond even that.</p>
        <p>If someone tried to count this vast assembly,<br>
        using counting-sticks for more than Ganges-sand kalpas,<br>
        they still wouldn't be able to finish knowing—<br>
        couldn't reach the end.</p>
        <p>These great beings of awesome virtue,<br>
        these vigorous bodhisattvas—<br>
        who taught them the Dharma?<br>
        Who educated and perfected them?</p>
        <p>Under whom did they first set their minds on enlightenment?<br>
        What Buddha's teaching did they praise?<br>
        Whose sutras did they receive and uphold?<br>
        What Buddha's way did they practice and study?</p>
        <p>These bodhisattvas<br>
        with spiritual powers and great wisdom-strength—<br>
        the earth in the four directions split open,<br>
        and they all burst forth from the middle.</p>
        <p>World-Honored One, since ancient times till now<br>
        I never seen such a thing.<br>
        Please tell us where they from,<br>
        what country, what land they came from.</p>
        <p>I been traveling through all the nations,<br>
        but I never seen this assembly before.<br>
        In this whole crowd here<br>
        I don't recognize a single person—</p>
        <p>Suddenly they bursting from the earth.<br>
        Please explain the causes and conditions.<br>
        Right now in this great assembly—<br>
        countless hundreds of thousands of billions—</p>
        <p>All these bodhisattvas<br>
        want to know about this matter.<br>
        The root and branch of these bodhisattvas,<br>
        the beginning and end of their causes and conditions—</p>
        <p>World-Honored One of boundless virtue,<br>
        we only asking you: please resolve our doubts.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>THE BUDDHAS IN ALL DIRECTIONS WONDER TOO</h3>
    <p>Then at that time, all them emanation-bodies of Śākyamuni Buddha—all them Buddha-copies who came from countless thousands of millions of billions of other lands, sitting on lion thrones under jeweled trees throughout the eight directions—each one of their attendants saw this great assembly of bodhisattvas bursting up from the earth in the four directions of the three thousand great thousand worlds, rising up into empty space.</p>
    <p>And each attendant said to their Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, where did all these countless, boundless, innumerable bodhisattvas come from?"</p>
    <p>And each of them Buddhas told their attendant:</p>
    <p>"Good sons, wait just a moment. There's a bodhisattva here named Maitreya, who Śākyamuni Buddha done given a prophecy to—said he gonna be the next Buddha after this one. He already asked about this very matter. The Buddha about to answer him now. You'll hear it yourselves when he explains."</p>

    <h3>THE BUDDHA TELLS MAITREYA TO GET READY</h3>
    <p>Then at that time, Śākyamuni Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva:</p>
    <p>"Excellent! Excellent, Ajita! That you able to ask the Buddha about such a great matter—this is good, this is right.</p>
    <p>Now all of you need to gather yourselves together with one mind. Put on the armor of vigor and diligence. Make your intention firm and solid.</p>
    <p>Because the Tathāgata is about to reveal and display and proclaim:</p>
    <p>The wisdom of all Buddhas,<br>
    The Buddhas' self-mastered spiritual power,<br>
    The Buddhas' lion-like charging forth,<br>
    The Buddhas' awesome and mighty great force."</p>

    <h3>THE BUDDHA SPEAKS IN VERSE: PAY ATTENTION NOW</h3>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>You need to be vigorous with one mind—<br>
        I'm about to explain this matter.<br>
        Don't let yourself have doubts or regrets.<br>
        The Buddha's wisdom can't be thought or measured.</p>
        <p>Now bring forth your power of faith,<br>
        dwell in patience and goodness.<br>
        This Dharma you never heard before—<br>
        today you all gonna hear it.</p>
        <p>I'm comforting you now,<br>
        don't let yourself harbor doubts or fears.<br>
        The Buddha don't speak no falsehoods,<br>
        his wisdom can't be calculated.</p>
        <p>The supreme Dharma he obtained—<br>
        it's deep, can't be discriminated or divided up.<br>
        And now I'm about to speak it,<br>
        so all of you listen with one mind.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>THE SHOCKING TRUTH BEGINS TO EMERGE</h3>
    <p>Then after the World-Honored One finished speaking this verse, he told Maitreya Bodhisattva:</p>
    <p>"I'm now declaring to all of you in this great assembly—</p>
    <p>Ajita! These great bodhisattvas, these innumerable, uncountable, inconceivable numbers of great beings bursting up from the earth that you never seen before—</p>
    <p>After I attained supreme perfect enlightenment here in this Śākyamuni world, I taught and guided these bodhisattvas. I tamed their minds, caused them to give rise to the intention for the Way.</p>
    <p>All these bodhisattvas have been dwelling right here—underneath this Śākyamuni world, in the empty space below this realm.</p>
    <p>As for the sutras and scriptures, they read them, recite them, understand them thoroughly. They think about them, analyze them, contemplate them correctly and remember them right.</p>
    <p>Ajita, these good sons—they don't love being in crowds with a lot of talking. They always love quiet places where they can practice vigorously without ever resting.</p>
    <p>They don't depend on human or heavenly realms for their dwelling.</p>
    <p>They always love deep wisdom without obstacles or hindrances. And they always love the Dharma of all Buddhas. With single mind and vigorous effort, they seeking supreme wisdom without cease."</p>

    <h3>THE BUDDHA SPEAKS IN VERSE: THESE ARE MY CHILDREN</h3>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>Ajita, you need to know:<br>
        These great bodhisattvas,<br>
        for countless kalpas past,<br>
        been practicing Buddha-wisdom.</p>
        <p>Every one of them is who I taught,<br>
        who I caused to give rise to the great Way-seeking mind.<br>
        These are my children,<br>
        dwelling and depending on this world.</p>
        <p>Always practicing ascetic practices,<br>
        loving quiet places,<br>
        leaving behind the noise and confusion of crowds,<br>
        not loving a lot of talk.</p>
        <p>Children like these,<br>
        they studying and practicing my Way and Dharma.<br>
        Day and night always vigorous,<br>
        for the sake of seeking the Buddha-way.</p>
        <p>They dwelling underneath the Śākyamuni world,<br>
        down in the empty space below,<br>
        their will and mindfulness power rock-solid firm,<br>
        always diligently seeking wisdom,</p>
        <p>Speaking all manner of wonderful Dharma,<br>
        their hearts without any fear.<br>
        I sat underneath the Bodhi tree<br>
        in the city of Gayā,</p>
        <p>Attained the supreme perfect enlightenment,<br>
        turned the unsurpassed Dharma wheel.<br>
        And then I taught and guided them,<br>
        caused them to first give rise to the Way-seeking mind.</p>
        <p>Now they all dwelling in non-retreat,<br>
        and they all gonna attain Buddhahood.<br>
        I'm speaking the real truth now—<br>
        all of you need to believe with one mind:</p>
        <p>From the distant past till now<br>
        I been teaching and guiding this assembly.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>MAITREYA'S MIND CAN'T TAKE IT: THE IMPOSSIBLE MATH</h3>
    <p>Now at that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva and countless other bodhisattvas—their minds filled up with doubt. They bewildered, amazed, never experienced nothing like this before.</p>
    <p>And they thought:</p>
    <p>"How could the World-Honored One in such a short time teach and guide such countless, boundless, innumerable great bodhisattvas and cause them to dwell in supreme perfect enlightenment?"</p>
    <p>So Maitreya said directly to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, when the Tathāgata was still a prince, he left the palace of the Śākya clan. He went not far from the city of Gayā, sat at the place of enlightenment, and attained supreme perfect enlightenment.</p>
    <p>From that time till now, it's only been a little more than forty years.</p>
    <p>World-Honored One, how could you in this short time accomplish such a great Buddha-work? How could you, with the Buddha's power and the Buddha's merit, teach and guide such countless great bodhisattvas to the point where they gonna attain supreme perfect enlightenment?</p>

    <h3>THE STORY NOBODY CAN BELIEVE</h3>
    <p>"World-Honored One, this great assembly of bodhisattvas—even if someone spent a thousand million billion kalpas trying to count them, they couldn't finish, couldn't reach the end.</p>
    <p>These beings—from the distant, remote past—they been planting good roots under countless, boundless Buddhas. They done perfected the bodhisattva way. They always been practicing the pure conduct.</p>
    <p>World-Honored One, such a thing as this—the world finds it hard to believe.</p>
    <p>It's like if there was a man with beautiful features and black hair, only twenty-five years old, and he pointed at a hundred-year-old man and said, 'This is my son.' And the hundred-year-old man also pointed at the young one and said, 'This is my father who gave birth to me and raised me.'</p>
    <p>Now that would be hard to believe, wouldn't it?"</p>

    <h3>THE DEPTH OF THE PROBLEM</h3>
    <p>"It's the same with the Buddha. You only attained the Way a short while ago—that's the truth of it.</p>
    <p>But this great assembly of bodhisattvas—they already been practicing for countless thousands of millions of billions of kalpas for the sake of the Buddha-way. They been practicing vigorously, diligently.</p>
    <p>They skilled at entering, leaving, and dwelling in countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of samādhis—deep meditations beyond measure. They obtained great spiritual powers. For a long time they been practicing pure conduct.</p>
    <p>They able to practice good dharmas in proper sequence, step by step. They skillful at questions and answers. They treasures among human beings. They extremely rare in all the worlds.</p>
    <p>And yet today the World-Honored One is saying that when you first attained the Buddha-way, you caused them to first give rise to the aspiration, then taught and guided them, directing them toward supreme perfect enlightenment.</p>
    <p>World-Honored One, you ain't been Buddha for long—and yet you been able to accomplish this great work of merit!</p>
    <p>Now we do believe in the Buddha. We believe whatever the Buddha says is appropriate to the situation. We know the Buddha's words never empty or false. We know the Buddha's knowledge penetrates everything thoroughly.</p>
    <p>But still—</p>
    <p>Those bodhisattvas who newly given rise to intention, who just starting out—if they hear these words after the Buddha passes away, they might not believe and accept it. And that might cause them to commit the sin of slandering the Dharma, breaking faith with the teaching.</p>
    <p>So please, World-Honored One, explain this for us. Remove our doubts. And also for the good sons and daughters of future ages—when they hear about this matter, let them not have doubts either."</p>

    <h3>MAITREYA SPEAKS IN VERSE: THIS DON'T ADD UP</h3>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>Long ago the Buddha left the Śākya clan,<br>
        went not far from the city of Gayā,<br>
        sat underneath the Bodhi tree—<br>
        and since then it ain't been that long.</p>
        <p>But all these children of the Buddha,<br>
        their numbers beyond all counting—<br>
        they already been walking the Buddha-way for ages,<br>
        dwelling in spiritual powers,</p>
        <p>Well-learned in the bodhisattva path,<br>
        unstained by worldly dharmas,<br>
        like lotus flowers in the water<br>
        bursting up from the earth.</p>
        <p>All of them arising with respectful hearts,<br>
        standing before the World-Honored One.<br>
        This matter is hard to think about—<br>
        how can it be believed?</p>
        <p>The Buddha attained the Way so recently,<br>
        yet what he accomplished is so vast!<br>
        Please remove the doubts of this assembly,<br>
        explain it truly and clearly.</p>
        <p>It's like a young man in his prime,<br>
        only twenty-five years old,<br>
        pointing to people a hundred years old,<br>
        their hair white and faces wrinkled,</p>
        <p>Saying, 'These are the ones I gave birth to.'<br>
        And the sons also saying, 'He is our father.'<br>
        The father young and the sons old—<br>
        the whole world wouldn't believe it.</p>
        <p>The World-Honored One is like that too:<br>
        You attained the Way so recently.<br>
        But these bodhisattvas,<br>
        their will is firm without weakness or cowardice.</p>
        <p>For countless kalpas past<br>
        they been practicing the bodhisattva way.<br>
        They skillful at difficult questions and answers,<br>
        their minds without any fear.</p>
        <p>Their patience-hearts decided and determined,<br>
        dignified and proper with great virtue.<br>
        Praised by Buddhas in the ten directions,<br>
        able to explain distinctions skillfully.</p>
        <p>They don't love being in crowds of people,<br>
        they always prefer deep meditation.<br>
        For the sake of seeking the Buddha-way,<br>
        they dwelling in the empty space below.</p>
        <p>We done heard all this from the Buddha—<br>
        about this matter we got no doubt.<br>
        But we asking Buddha for the sake of future generations:<br>
        Explain it so they can understand.</p>
        <p>If someone has doubts about this sutra,<br>
        doesn't believe it,<br>
        they gonna fall into the evil paths right away.<br>
        So please explain it now:</p>
        <p>How did you, in such a short time,<br>
        teach these countless bodhisattvas,<br>
        cause them to give rise to the aspiration,<br>
        and establish them in the ground of non-retreating?</p>

    <h3>END OF CHAPTER FIFTEEN: WHEN THE UNDERGROUND ARMY ROSE UP</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This is the chapter where everything the assembly thought they knew gets turned upside down. They thought Śākyamuni Buddha was a man who lived 80 years ago, who attained enlightenment 40 years back under a tree. But now he's revealing students—vast numbers of students, accomplished students, ancient students—who've been practicing for countless ages.</p>
        <p>The math don't work. The timeline don't work. It's impossible.</p>
        <p>Unless... unless the Buddha is something other than what they thought. Unless his life is deeper than one lifetime. Unless time itself works different when it comes to the Dharma-body of a Buddha.</p>
        <p>That's what Chapter 16 gonna reveal: the Buddha's eternal life, his ancient original enlightenment. But here in Chapter 15, we sitting in the shock of it—in Maitreya's bewildered question, in the image of the 25-year-old father with hundred-year-old sons.</p>
        <p>The four great leaders got names that tell you what practice looks like when it's been going on for ages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Superior Practice:</strong> Not just practicing, but practicing at the highest level</li>
            <li><strong>Boundless Practice:</strong> Practice without edges, without limits</li>
            <li><strong>Pure Practice:</strong> Practice that ain't corrupted, ain't compromised</li>
            <li><strong>Well-Established Practice:</strong> Practice that's rooted deep, that can't be shaken</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They burst from the earth—from underneath, from below, from the hidden places. They been there all along, preparing, waiting, practicing in the dark, in the quiet, in the deep.</p>
        <p>That's the power of this chapter: the revelation that the real work been happening out of sight, beneath the surface, in the underground. And when the time comes, when the call goes out, that hidden strength rises up—a vast army, a golden flood, a force that fills all space.</p>
        <p>The church been praying in the basement all this time. And now it's time to come upstairs.</p>
