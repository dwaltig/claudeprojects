    <h1>CHAPTER SIXTEEN: HOW LONG THE TATHĀGATA'S BEEN ALIVE</h1>
    <h2>A Blues Translation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese</h2>

    <h3>THE TRIPLE REQUEST—BELIEVE WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU</h3>
    <p>At that time, the Buddha spoke to all them bodhisattvas and the whole great assembly. He said:</p>
    <p>"Good sons, y'all need to believe and understand the truthful words of the Tathāgata—the honest-to-God truth I'm speaking."</p>
    <p>And he told that great crowd again:</p>
    <p>"Y'all need to believe and understand the truthful words of the Tathāgata."</p>
    <p>And once more he told that assembly:</p>
    <p>"Y'all need to believe and understand the truthful words of the Tathāgata."</p>
    <p>Now at that time, all them bodhisattvas—that great multitude with Maitreya leading them—they pressed their palms together and said to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, we asking you please—just tell us. We gonna believe what the Buddha says. We gonna receive it and hold it true."</p>
    <p>They said this three times over. Three times they asked. And then they said again:</p>
    <p>"Please, World-Honored One, just tell us. We gonna believe what the Buddha says. We gonna receive it."</p>

    <h3>THE SECRET THE BUDDHA'S BEEN KEEPING—LISTEN NOW</h3>
    <p>Then the World-Honored One, seeing them bodhisattvas ask three times and not stopping, he told them:</p>
    <p>"Y'all listen close now. Listen to the secret spiritual power of the Tathāgata.</p>
    <p>All the world—all the gods, all the humans, all the asuras—everybody thinks the same thing. They say: 'This Śākyamuni Buddha, he left the palace of the Shakya clan. He went not far from the city of Gaya. He sat down at the place of enlightenment and got that supreme perfect enlightenment—that anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.'</p>
    <p>But good sons, listen to what I'm telling you:</p>
    <p>I actually became a Buddha countless, boundless, hundred thousand million billion nayuta uncountable ages ago.</p>
    <p>That's the truth."</p>

    <h3>THE CALCULATION YOU CAN'T EVEN CALCULATE</h3>
    <p>"Let me paint you a picture. Say you took five hundred thousand million billion nayuta asamkhya three-thousand-great-thousand worlds—every single one of them worlds. And say you ground them all down into dust, into powder, into the finest grains you ever saw.</p>
    <p>Then say you started walking east. And after you passed five hundred thousand million billion nayuta asamkhya countries, you put down one single grain of dust. Just one speck.</p>
    <p>And then you kept on walking east like that, passing through all them worlds, dropping one dust grain here, skipping some worlds, dropping one there, walking and walking till every last speck of dust was gone—all used up.</p>
    <p>Now good sons, what you think? Could anybody—any mathematician, any calculator, any scholar with the best mind—could they sit down and figure out how many worlds you passed through? Could they count them up and know the number?"</p>
    <p>Maitreya Bodhisattva and all the others answered the Buddha, saying:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, them worlds—they countless, they boundless. They ain't something numbers can know. They ain't something the mind can reach. Even all them voice-hearers and pratyekabuddhas—with all their wisdom free from outflows—they couldn't think their way to knowing that limit, couldn't calculate that number.</p>
    <p>We standing here on the ground of non-backsliding, and even we don't understand this matter.</p>
    <p>World-Honored One, them worlds—they countless, they boundless."</p>
    <p>Then the Buddha told that great bodhisattva assembly:</p>
    <p>"Good sons, I'm gonna tell you clear and plain right now.</p>
    <p>Take all them worlds—the ones where you put down dust and the ones where you didn't—grind them all down into dust. Every single grain of dust, that's one age, one kalpa.</p>
    <p>The time since I became a Buddha is even MORE than that. We talking hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of nayutas of uncountable ages BEYOND all them dust specks.</p>
    <p>And from that time till now, I been constantly here in this Saha world teaching the Dharma, guiding beings. And I also been in hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of nayutas of uncountable other countries, leading and benefiting living beings."</p>

    <h3>ABOUT THEM OTHER BUDDHAS I TOLD YOU ABOUT</h3>
    <p>"Good sons, during all that time—all them ages—I talked about Dipamkara Buddha and others. I said they entered into nirvāṇa, passed away into final rest.</p>
    <p>But all that—all them stories—they was just skillful means, just ways of teaching that fit what folks could understand.</p>
    <p>Good sons, when living beings come to me, I look at them with the Buddha-eye. I see their faith, see their roots—are they sharp or are they dull? Are they ready or not ready?</p>
    <p>And according to what they need to hear—according to how they need to be taught—I show up in different places, call myself by different names, say I'm different ages—young or old, early or late in my teaching career.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I even say: 'I'm about to enter nirvāṇa soon. I'm getting ready to pass on.'</p>
    <p>And I use all kinds of skillful means, all kinds of subtle and wonderful teachings to make living beings feel joy, to help them generate happiness.</p>
    <p>Good sons, the Tathāgata sees that some living beings—they love the small teachings. They got thin virtue and heavy dirt on them. For people like that, I tell them:</p>
    <p>'When I was young, I left home and got that supreme perfect enlightenment.'</p>
    <p>But the truth is, I been a Buddha for a vast, long time—so long you can't measure it. I just use skillful means to teach living beings, to help them enter the Buddha-path. That's why I say what I say."</p>

    <h3>EVERYTHING THE BUDDHA SAYS IS TRUE—EVEN WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE A LIE</h3>
    <p>"Good sons, all the sutras the Tathāgata speaks—every teaching, every scripture—they all for saving living beings, for setting them free.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I talk about my own life.<br>
    Sometimes I talk about someone else's life.<br>
    Sometimes I show my own body.<br>
    Sometimes I show someone else's body.<br>
    Sometimes I talk about my own affairs.<br>
    Sometimes I talk about someone else's affairs.</p>
    <p>But everything I say—every word spoken—is real. It ain't false. It ain't empty.</p>
    <p>Why's that?</p>
    <p>Because the Tathāgata sees the three worlds just like they really are. He sees them truly, sees them clearly.</p>
    <p>There ain't no birth and death.<br>
    Ain't no retreating, ain't no going forth.<br>
    Ain't nobody really in the world, ain't nobody really passing out of it.<br>
    It ain't real, it ain't false.<br>
    It ain't like this, it ain't like that.<br>
    It ain't the way the three worlds see the three worlds.</p>
    <p>All this—the Tathāgata sees it clearly, sees it plainly, without a single mistake, without one error.</p>
    <p>Living beings got all kinds of natures, all kinds of desires, all kinds of actions, all kinds of thoughts and imaginings running through their minds.</p>
    <p>I want them to plant good roots. So I use all kinds of causes and conditions, all kinds of parables and stories, all kinds of words and ways of speaking. I teach the Dharma in every way you can imagine.</p>
    <p>The Buddha-work I do—it ain't never stopped. It ain't never rested. Not for one single moment.</p>
    <p>And so—I been a Buddha for a vast, great, long time. My lifespan is countless uncountable ages. I'm constantly dwelling here. I don't pass away."</p>

    <h3>WHY THE BUDDHA PLAYS LIKE HE'S DYING WHEN HE AIN'T</h3>
    <p>"Good sons, the lifespan I got—the life I achieved when I first walked the bodhisattva path—that lifespan still ain't finished yet. It's still going. It's twice as long as all them ages I just told you about, and more.</p>
    <p>But even though I ain't really gonna pass into extinction, I announce it anyway. I say: 'I'm about to enter final nirvāṇa.'</p>
    <p>The Tathāgata uses this skillful means to teach living beings.</p>
    <p>Why's that? Why do I do it this way?</p>
    <p>Because if the Buddha stayed in the world a long time—if I was always here, always visible, always present—then people with thin virtue, people who ain't planted good roots yet, people who poor and low-down and greedy and attached to the five desires, people caught up in the net of wrong thoughts and false views—</p>
    <p>If they saw the Tathāgata always here and never passing away, they'd get arrogant. They'd get lazy and complacent. They wouldn't feel that sense of 'This is rare! This is precious! This is hard to meet!'</p>
    <p>They wouldn't have respect. They wouldn't have reverence.</p>
    <p>So the Tathāgata uses skillful means and says to them:</p>
    <p>'Monks, you should know—it's hard to meet a Buddha in the world. It's a rare thing. It don't happen often.'</p>
    <p>Why's that? Why's it so rare?</p>
    <p>Because people with thin virtue—they can go through countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of ages, and some might see a Buddha, but some won't. They might never see one at all.</p>
    <p>Because of this—because it's so rare—I say to them:</p>
    <p>'Monks, the Tathāgata is hard to see. It ain't easy to meet the Tathāgata.'</p>
    <p>When living beings hear these words, they bound to feel it—that longing, that sense of how rare it is, how hard it is to meet a Buddha. Their hearts gonna fill up with yearning and longing. They gonna thirst after the Buddha.</p>
    <p>And then they gonna plant good roots.</p>
    <p>That's why the Tathāgata—even though he ain't really passing into extinction—he says he's gonna pass away.</p>
    <p>He says he's dying when he ain't dying.</p>
    <p>This ain't false. This is medicine."</p>

    <h3>THE PARABLE OF THE GOOD DOCTOR AND HIS POISONED CHILDREN</h3>
    <p>"And also, good sons, all the Buddhas and Tathāgatas—their way is just like this. Everything they do is real, ain't nothing false. It's all to save living beings.</p>
    <p>Let me tell you a story:</p>
    <p>Say there was a good doctor—a excellent physician, wise and intelligent, thoroughly understanding medicines and prescriptions, skilled at curing all kinds of sicknesses.</p>
    <p>This man had a lot of sons—maybe ten, maybe twenty, could be a hundred of them.</p>
    <p>One day he had to leave on some business. He traveled far away to another country.</p>
    <p>After the father left, all his children back home—they found some poison and drank it by mistake. They didn't know what they was drinking.</p>
    <p>That poison started working in their bodies. They started rolling on the ground, writhing and crying out, confused and tormented.</p>
    <p>Then the father came back home.</p>
    <p>Some of his sons—the ones who drunk the poison—some of them had completely lost their minds. But some still had a bit of sense left in them, still had some clarity.</p>
    <p>When they saw their father coming from far off, they all felt great joy. They bowed down, they greeted him, they said:</p>
    <p>'Welcome back safe and sound, father! We been foolish. We drunk poison by mistake. Please heal us! Please give us back our lives! Please don't let us die!'</p>
    <p>The father saw his children suffering like that—in such pain, in such agony. So right away, following all the medical texts and prescriptions, he went and gathered excellent medicinal herbs—herbs with perfect color, perfect fragrance, perfect taste. All the qualities was just right.</p>
    <p>He ground them up, sifted them, mixed them together real fine, and gave the medicine to his children to drink. And he said to them:</p>
    <p>'This here is excellent medicine. The color is excellent, the fragrance is excellent, the taste is excellent. Y'all take this and drink it down. It's gonna remove your suffering real quick. You won't have no more pain, no more sickness.'"</p>

    <h3>SOME TAKE THE MEDICINE, SOME DON'T</h3>
    <p>"Now among all them children, the ones who ain't completely lost their minds—the ones who still had some sense—when they saw that good medicine, saw the color and smelled the fragrance, they took it right away and drank it down.</p>
    <p>And their sickness was completely healed. All the poison left their bodies.</p>
    <p>But the other children—the ones who had completely lost their minds—when they saw their father come home, they was also happy. They also asked him to heal them, asked for the medicine.</p>
    <p>But when he gave them that medicine, they wouldn't take it. They wouldn't drink it.</p>
    <p>Why not?</p>
    <p>Because the poison had gone so deep. It had messed up their minds so bad, they had lost their original nature. Even though that medicine had perfect color and perfect fragrance, they looked at it and thought it was ugly. They thought it was nasty.</p>
    <p>The father thought to himself:</p>
    <p>'My poor children. They so pitiful. The poison done made them crazy, done made them insane. Even though they happy to see me, even though they begging me to heal them—when I give them this good medicine, they won't take it.</p>
    <p>I got to set up some skillful means to make them take this medicine.'</p>
    <p>So he said to them:</p>
    <p>'Y'all need to know something. I'm old now. I'm worn down. My time to die is coming soon.</p>
    <p>This good medicine—this excellent medicine—I'm gonna leave it right here for y'all. Y'all can take it and drink it. Don't worry that it won't heal you. It will.'</p>
    <p>After he gave them these instructions, he left again. He went far away to another country.</p>
    <p>Then he sent a messenger back home with a message:</p>
    <p>'Your father is dead.'"</p>

    <h3>THE CHILDREN WAKE UP</h3>
    <p>"When them children heard that their father had died—that he was gone, that he'd passed away—their hearts filled up with great sorrow and pain. They thought:</p>
    <p>'If our father was still alive, he would love us. He would protect us. He would take care of us.</p>
    <p>But now he done left us. He done died far away in another country.</p>
    <p>We orphans now. We ain't got nobody. We alone.'</p>
    <p>Constant grief, constant sadness—that's what they felt. And in that grieving, in that sorrow, their minds finally came back. They woke up. They sobered up.</p>
    <p>They realized that medicine—that medicine their father left—it actually had excellent color, excellent fragrance, excellent taste after all.</p>
    <p>So they took it. They drank it down.</p>
    <p>And all the poison in their bodies—it was healed. It was cured. They was completely well again.</p>
    <p>When the father heard that all his children was healed and cured, he came back right away. He came back home and showed himself to all of them.</p>
    <p>He let them see him alive."</p>

    <h3>DID THAT DOCTOR LIE? CAN YOU CALL HIM A LIAR?</h3>
    <p>"Now good sons, what you think about this?</p>
    <p>Could anybody—could any person—say that good doctor told a lie? Could they accuse him of being false when he said he was dead?"</p>
    <p>"No, World-Honored One. Nobody could say that."</p>
    <p>The Buddha said:</p>
    <p>"I'm the same way. I'm just like that doctor.</p>
    <p>I became a Buddha countless, boundless, hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of nayutas of uncountable ages ago.</p>
    <p>But for the sake of living beings, I use the power of skillful means and say: 'I'm about to enter nirvāṇa. I'm about to pass away.'</p>
    <p>And ain't nobody—ain't no one anywhere—who can truthfully say I'm speaking falsely. Ain't no one can accuse me of lying.</p>
    <p>Because what I'm doing is the Dharma. What I'm doing is the medicine. What I'm doing is truth in the form that can heal."</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>Since I became a Buddha,<br>
        The ages I been through—<br>
        Countless hundreds of thousands of millions,<br>
        Billions, uncountable, nayutas too.</p>
        <p>I been constantly teaching the Dharma,<br>
        Teaching countless billions of living souls,<br>
        Leading them into the Buddha-way,<br>
        Helping them reach them spiritual goals.</p>
        <p>For countless ages it's been like this,<br>
        And to save living beings, you know,<br>
        I skillfully appear to enter nirvāṇa—<br>
        But I ain't really going, I don't really go.</p>
        <p>I actually stay right here,<br>
        Constantly teaching this Dharma true,<br>
        I constantly dwelling in this place,<br>
        But with my spiritual power, I do—</p>
        <p>I make the upside-down, confused beings,<br>
        Even though they close, they don't see me near.<br>
        The multitudes see me passing away,<br>
        They make offerings to my relics with many a tear.</p>
        <p>They all cherish me and long for me,<br>
        Their hearts fill up with thirst and desire.<br>
        When living beings believe and submit like that,<br>
        When they honest and gentle, when they aspire—</p>
        <p>When they single-minded, wanting to see the Buddha,<br>
        Not caring even if it cost their life—<br>
        Then I appear with the whole assembly<br>
        On Vulture Peak, free from all strife.</p>
        <p>And I tell them living beings right then:<br>
        "I'm always here, I don't pass away.<br>
        It's just skillful means, the way I appear—<br>
        Sometimes here, sometimes gone—that's my way.</p>
        <p>If beings in other countries<br>
        Are reverent, full of faith and joy,<br>
        Then I appear among them too,<br>
        Teaching the unsurpassed Dharma I employ.</p>
        <p>But y'all don't hear about this,<br>
        Y'all just think I done passed on.<br>
        But I see all them living beings<br>
        Drowning in suffering, alone and forlorn.</p>
        <p>So I don't show my body to them yet,<br>
        I make them long, I make them yearn.<br>
        And when their hearts full up with longing,<br>
        Then I appear—then they learn.</p>
        <p>My spiritual power is like this,<br>
        For uncountable ages, countless time,<br>
        I been constantly on Vulture Peak<br>
        And in every other place of mine.</p>
        <p>When living beings see the age ending,<br>
        See the world burning up in flame,<br>
        My land here—it's peaceful and calm,<br>
        It's full of gods and humans, all the same.</p>
        <p>Gardens and groves, halls and towers,<br>
        Adorned with every kind of jewel and treasure.<br>
        Precious trees full of flowers and fruit,<br>
        Where living beings play at their leisure.</p>
        <p>The gods strike their heavenly drums,<br>
        Always making music, never ending.<br>
        Raining down mandarava flowers,<br>
        On the Buddha and the assembly descending.</p>
        <p>My Pure Land ain't destroyed,<br>
        But living beings see it burned to the ground.<br>
        They see worry, fear, and suffering—<br>
        All kinds of pain and trouble around.</p>
        <p>These sinful living beings,<br>
        Because of their bad karma and evil ways,<br>
        They go through uncountable ages<br>
        Never hearing the names of the Three Jewels, all their days.</p>
        <p>But those who practice merit and virtue,<br>
        Who gentle and honest and upright—<br>
        They all see me right here,<br>
        Teaching the Dharma in their sight.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I tell this assembly:<br>
        'The Buddha's lifespan is measureless, without end.'<br>
        For those who only see the Buddha rarely,<br>
        I say: 'Buddhas are hard to meet, my friend.'</p>
        <p>My wisdom power is just like this,<br>
        My light of wisdom shining without bound.<br>
        My lifespan is countless ages—<br>
        From long practice of good deeds, this life I found.</p>
        <p>Y'all who got wisdom and intelligence,<br>
        Don't be doubtful about this teaching here.<br>
        Cut off all your doubts forever—<br>
        The Buddha's words are real and true and clear.</p>
        <p>Like that doctor using skillful means,<br>
        To cure his crazy children's suffering plight—<br>
        He really was alive, but said he was dead,<br>
        And nobody can say that wasn't right.</p>
        <p>I'm also the father of the world,<br>
        Saving all them suffering ones from pain.<br>
        Because ordinary people upside-down and confused,<br>
        Though I'm really here, I say I don't remain.</p>
        <p>If they always seeing me here,<br>
        They gonna get arrogant, proud, and loose,<br>
        Selfish and lazy, attached to the five desires,<br>
        Falling down into the evil paths, no use.</p>
        <p>I always know which living beings—<br>
        Which ones walking the path, which ones ain't.<br>
        According to what they need to hear for salvation,<br>
        I teach them all kinds of Dharma, without restraint.</p>
        <p>Every single moment I'm thinking this:<br>
        'How can I make living beings see—<br>
        How can I help them enter the unsurpassed wisdom,<br>
        And quickly achieve the Buddha-body, free?'"</p>

    <h3>END OF CHAPTER SIXTEEN: HOW LONG THE TATHĀGATA'S BEEN ALIVE</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This chapter reveals the most profound teaching in the Lotus Sutra—that Buddha's enlightenment wasn't 40-some years ago near Gaya, but countless eons in the past. He's been here all along, teaching everywhere, appearing and disappearing like a good father who knows when his children need to see him and when they need to miss him.</p>
        <p>The mathematics of time in this chapter defies comprehension—grinding infinite worlds to dust, walking through infinite space, dropping dust grains, then converting every world into an eon, and Buddha's been enlightened LONGER than that. It's Buddhist teaching breaking the mind's ability to calculate, forcing us past numbers into pure mystery.</p>
        <p>The parable of the physician and his children is one of the most beautiful and troubling stories in Buddhist literature. The doctor's "lie" about his death is medicine more powerful than the herbs he left behind. His absence becomes the cure for the poison that made the good medicine look bad. This is upaya—skillful means—at its most sophisticated: truth told through apparent falsehood, healing that comes through absence rather than presence.</p>
        <p>The closing verses reveal Buddha's eternal presence on Vulture Peak, in the Pure Land that exists right here beneath the suffering world we see with our poisoned perception. Those with eyes to see—with merit and virtue—they see gardens and jewels and heavenly music. Those still poisoned see only fire and destruction. Same place, different vision.</p>
        <p>This is the blues truth: God's always been here, never left, but sometimes you can't see Him till you feel His absence so strong it breaks your heart open. Sometimes you gotta lose what you thought you had to find what was always there. Sometimes the truth comes dressed up like a lie because a lie dressed up like truth is all you ready to hear.</p>
