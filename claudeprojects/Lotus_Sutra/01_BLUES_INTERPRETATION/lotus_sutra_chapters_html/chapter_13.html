    <h1>CHAPTER THIRTEEN: WHEN THE ROAD GETS ROUGH, YOU GOTTA KEEP WALKING</h1>
    <h2>(Exhortation to Maintain)</h2>

    <h3>THE FIRST VOW - MEDICINE KING AND GREAT JOY STEP FORWARD</h3>
    <p>Now at that time, Medicine King Bodhisattva and Great Joy in Preaching Bodhisattva—these two great souls—they stood up together with twenty thousand of their brother and sister bodhisattvas. They all gathered right there in front of the Buddha, and they made a promise, you hear me, they made a VOW:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, don't you worry yourself none. Don't let your mind be troubled about what's coming. When you gone from this world, when you passed on to the other shore, WE gonna be here. We gonna hold this teaching. We gonna read it, recite it, explain it, and live it out.</p>
    <p>"Now we know—Lord, we KNOW—that the times coming after you leave gonna be dark times, evil times. The people gonna have less and less good roots growing in their hearts. They gonna be full up with pride, puffed up like balloons thinking they somebody special. They gonna be hungry for profit, greedy for respect, chasing after offerings and honors. They gonna feed the wrong seeds in their souls, and they gonna be far, far away from freedom.</p>
    <p>"Teaching them gonna be like trying to get water from a stone. It's gonna be HARD. But we making a promise right here, right now: We gonna raise up a GREAT PATIENCE inside ourselves. We gonna read this sutra, hold it, speak it, write it down, and honor it every way we can. And we ain't gonna hold back. We ain't gonna spare our bodies. We ain't gonna count the cost. Even if it take our very lives—we gonna carry this teaching forward."</p>

    <h3>THE SECOND VOW - FIVE HUNDRED ARHATS STAND UP</h3>
    <p>Now right then, five hundred arhats in that assembly—these was the ones who already got their prophecy from Buddha, who already been told their names gonna shine—they spoke up to the Buddha, saying:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, we making our own vow too. We gonna take this sutra to OTHER LANDS. We gonna go to foreign countries, strange territories, places far from here, and we gonna spread this teaching wide."</p>

    <h3>THE THIRD VOW - EIGHT THOUSAND DISCIPLES JOIN IN</h3>
    <p>And then there was eight thousand more—some still learning, some done with learning, all of them just got their prophecy too. They rose up from their seats, put their palms together in respect, and they said to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, we gonna go to other lands too. We gonna spread this sutra far and wide in those places.</p>
    <p>"And why we doing that? Why we going AWAY from here? Because THIS Sahā world, this endurance-land we standing in right now—Lord have mercy—it's FULL of sorry, trifling people. Full of folks with their chests puffed out, full of arrogance and shallow virtue. Full of anger and corruption, full of crooked hearts and lying tongues. Ain't no truth in them.</p>
    <p>"So we taking this teaching somewhere else, where maybe folks got a chance to hear it clean."</p>

    <h3>THE BUDDHA'S AUNT GETS HER PROPHECY</h3>
    <p>Now at that time, the Buddha's aunt—her name was Mahāprajāpatī, and she was a nun, a bhikṣuṇī—she stood up together with six thousand other nuns, some still learning and some done with learning. They all rose from their seats as one, pressed their palms together, and they looked up at the Blessed One's face. They looked at him with their whole hearts, couldn't take their eyes off him, not even for a second.</p>
    <p>And the World-Honored One, he saw that look on her face and he said to her:</p>
    <p>"Gautamī"—that was her family name, Gautamī—"why you looking at me with such worry in your eyes? Why you gazing at the Tathāgata like your heart about to break? You thinking maybe I ain't said your name? You thinking maybe I ain't given you your prophecy of supreme, perfect enlightenment—anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?"</p>
    <p>And then Buddha said:</p>
    <p>"Gautamī, listen here. When I spoke before about ALL the voice-hearers getting their prophecy, you was INCLUDED in that, you hear me? But now, if you want to know the particulars, if you want to know YOUR specific name and YOUR specific promise, then listen:</p>
    <p>"In the world that's coming, you gonna be a GREAT DHARMA TEACHER in the Dharma of sixty-eight thousand billion Buddhas. Count them—SIXTY-EIGHT THOUSAND BILLION! And these six thousand nuns with you, still learning and done with learning, they gonna be Dharma teachers right alongside you.</p>
    <p>"And you gonna walk that Bodhisattva path step by step, gradually perfecting yourself, until you BECOME a Buddha yourself. And your name gonna be: ALL-BEINGS-REJOICE-TO-SEE TATHĀGATA, ARHAT, PERFECTLY ENLIGHTENED ONE, PERFECT IN KNOWLEDGE AND CONDUCT, WELL-GONE, KNOWER OF THE WORLD, UNSURPASSED ONE, TAMER OF BEINGS, TEACHER OF DEVAS AND HUMANS, BUDDHA, WORLD-HONORED ONE.</p>
    <p>"And Gautamī, when you become that Buddha—All-Beings-Rejoice-to-See Buddha—you and these six thousand bodhisattvas with you, y'all gonna take turns giving prophecies to each other, passing on the promise of supreme, perfect enlightenment from one to the next like a torch that never goes out."</p>

    <h3>RĀHULA'S MOTHER GETS HER PROPHECY</h3>
    <p>Now at that time, Rāhula's mother—her name was Yaśodharā, and she was a nun too—she had a thought in her mind. She thought:</p>
    <p>"The World-Honored One, when he giving out all these prophecies, he ain't said MY name. He ain't called ME out specifically."</p>
    <p>And the Buddha, he knew her heart. He told Yaśodharā:</p>
    <p>"In the world that's coming, in a hundred thousand million billion Buddha-Dharmas, you gonna walk the Bodhisattva path. You gonna be a GREAT DHARMA TEACHER. And gradually, step by step, you gonna complete the Buddha-way.</p>
    <p>"And in a land called Excellent, a GOOD country, you gonna become a Buddha. Your name gonna be: POSSESSING-MYRIAD-LIGHT-MARKS TATHĀGATA, ARHAT, PERFECTLY ENLIGHTENED ONE, PERFECT IN KNOWLEDGE AND CONDUCT, WELL-GONE, KNOWER OF THE WORLD, UNSURPASSED ONE, TAMER OF BEINGS, TEACHER OF DEVAS AND HUMANS, BUDDHA, WORLD-HONORED ONE.</p>
    <p>"And that Buddha's lifespan? It gonna be beyond measure, countless as the grains of sand in the Ganges, lasting through innumerable, incalculable kalpas."</p>

    <h3>THE NUNS SING THEIR JOY</h3>
    <p>At that time, Mahāprajāpatī the nun and Yaśodharā the nun, along with all their companions, they were filled up with joy like they never known before. Their hearts was OVERFLOWING. And right there in front of the Buddha, they sang out in verse:</p>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>World-Honored One, you our guide and teacher,<br>
        You bring peace to all the gods and humans,<br>
        Now we done HEARD our prophecy,<br>
        And our hearts is FULL, our hearts is SATISFIED,<br>
        Our hearts is resting easy, got everything we need.</p>
    </div>
    <p>And when the nuns finished singing that verse, they said to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, we ready too. We gonna go to other lands, foreign countries, and we gonna spread this sutra far and wide."</p>

    <h3>THE GREAT VOW - EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION BODHISATTVAS MAKE THE ULTIMATE PROMISE</h3>
    <p>Now at that time, the World-Honored One, he looked out over the assembly. He looked at eight hundred million nayutas of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas—count them, EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION NAYUTAS of great beings!</p>
    <p>These wasn't no beginners. These was bodhisattvas who CANNOT FALL BACK—avinivartanīya—they done passed the point of no return. They turn the wheel of no-retreating Dharma. They got all the dhāraṇīs, all the mystical formulas and powers.</p>
    <p>These great souls, they rose up from their seats together and went before the Buddha. They pressed their palms together with one mind, one heart, and they thought to themselves:</p>
    <p>"If the World-Honored One tell us to uphold and teach this sutra, then we gonna follow his instruction. We gonna spread this Dharma wide like he say."</p>
    <p>But then they thought again:</p>
    <p>"But the Buddha, he sitting there SILENT. He ain't saying nothing. He ain't giving us no command. So what we supposed to do?"</p>
    <p>Now these bodhisattvas, they understood the Buddha's mind. They knew his heart. They wanted to RESPECT his intention, and they also wanted to FULFILL their own original vows, the promises they made long, long ago.</p>
    <p>So right there in front of the Buddha, they let out a LION'S ROAR—that's what they call it when you speak with power and authority and ain't scared of nothing—and they made this vow. They said:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, after you gone—after the Tathāgata done passed into final nirvāṇa—we gonna travel back and forth through the ten directions, all the worlds everywhere. We gonna make it so beings can WRITE this sutra down, HOLD it in their hearts, READ it with their mouths, RECITE it from memory, UNDERSTAND what it means, and PRACTICE it the right way, keeping it in their minds with right remembrance.</p>
    <p>"All of this gonna happen because of the BUDDHA'S POWER, the Buddha's authority and grace. So we asking you, World-Honored One: When you in other lands far away from here, WATCH OVER US from a distance. Guard us and protect us while we doing this work."</p>
    <p>And then all these bodhisattvas together, with ONE VOICE, they broke out into verse. They sang out their vow, and this is what they sang:</p>

    <h3>THE GREAT VOW IN VERSE</h3>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>World-Honored One, don't you worry,<br>
        Don't let your mind be troubled none,<br>
        After you done passed away,<br>
        In that terrifying, evil age,<br>
        We gonna spread this teaching WIDE.</p>
        <p>There gonna be ignorant folks,<br>
        People with no wisdom in they heads,<br>
        They gonna curse us out with evil mouths,<br>
        They gonna revile us and mock us,<br>
        Some of them gonna come at us with sticks and stones,<br>
        Beat us and try to break us down—<br>
        But we gonna ENDURE it all.<br>
        We gonna bear it with patience.</p>
        <p>In that evil age, some of the monks—<br>
        Supposed to be holy men, supposed to be our brothers—<br>
        They gonna have TWISTED wisdom, deceitful hearts,<br>
        Crooked minds and lying spirits.<br>
        They gonna CLAIM they got what they ain't got,<br>
        Say they achieved enlightenment when they ain't achieved nothing,<br>
        And they hearts gonna be FULL UP with pride,<br>
        Swollen up with arrogance like they somebody special.</p>
        <p>Some of them gonna call themselves forest-dwellers,<br>
        Ascetics living out in the wilderness,<br>
        Wearing patched-up rags like holy men,<br>
        Staying in empty, quiet places,<br>
        CLAIMING they walking the true path,<br>
        Looking DOWN on everybody else,<br>
        Acting like they better than regular folks.</p>
        <p>But you know what they REALLY after?<br>
        They GREEDY for profit and offerings!<br>
        They teach the Dharma to laypeople<br>
        Just to get gain and respect,<br>
        And the world gonna honor them,<br>
        Treat them like they arhats with six spiritual powers,<br>
        Like they got ALL the supernatural abilities.</p>
        <p>These people got EVIL in they hearts,<br>
        Always thinking about worldly things, mundane concerns,<br>
        But they PRETENDING to be forest-dwellers,<br>
        Taking that holy name in vain.<br>
        And they gonna LOVE to point out OUR faults,<br>
        Always looking for something wrong with US,<br>
        Always trying to catch us in some mistake.</p>
        <p>They gonna SAY things like this:<br>
        "These monks here, they just in it for profit,<br>
        They teaching for GAIN,<br>
        They speaking HERETICAL doctrines,<br>
        Non-Buddhist philosophy and lies!</p>
        <p>"They WROTE this sutra themselves!<br>
        Made it up out of whole cloth!<br>
        They doing it to TRICK the world,<br>
        To DECEIVE people,<br>
        'Cause they hunting for fame and reputation.<br>
        They just trying to make a name for themselves!"</p>
        <p>They gonna stand up in BIG ASSEMBLIES,<br>
        In front of CROWDS of people,<br>
        And they gonna try to SHAME us,<br>
        Try to HUMILIATE us and tear us down.<br>
        They gonna go running to kings and ministers,<br>
        To brahmins and householders,<br>
        To other monks and the whole sangha,<br>
        SLANDERING us, saying evil things about us,<br>
        Calling us "wrong-view people,"<br>
        Saying we teaching "outside-the-way doctrines,"<br>
        Heretical teachings and false philosophy.</p>
        <p>But we gonna RESPECT the Buddha,<br>
        We gonna honor what you taught us,<br>
        So we gonna ENDURE all this evil,<br>
        We gonna bear up under all this persecution.</p>
        <p>Even when they mock us and say—<br>
        And they gonna say it with CONTEMPT in they voices—<br>
        "Oh, Y'ALL gonna be Buddhas? YOU? Ha!"<br>
        Even when they throw that in our faces like an insult,<br>
        We gonna ACCEPT that contempt,<br>
        We gonna RECEIVE that mockery,<br>
        And we gonna keep on walking.</p>
        <p>In the defiled age, the corrupt times,<br>
        The evil world that's coming,<br>
        There gonna be MANY terrifying things,<br>
        Fearful things that try to shake us.<br>
        Evil spirits gonna POSSESS people's bodies,<br>
        Take them over from the inside,<br>
        And they gonna curse us, revile us, disrespect us,<br>
        Say all manner of evil against us.</p>
        <p>But WE believe in the Buddha,<br>
        WE trust in what you taught,<br>
        So we gonna PUT ON the armor of patience,<br>
        We gonna WEAR that armor like a soldier going to war.<br>
        We teaching this sutra,<br>
        And for the sake of teaching this sutra,<br>
        We gonna ENDURE all these hard things,<br>
        We gonna BEAR all these difficult trials.</p>
        <p>We don't love our own lives—<br>
        Listen to me now, we don't love our own LIVES—<br>
        But we CHERISH the unsurpassed way,<br>
        We TREASURE this supreme Dharma<br>
        More than we treasure breathing.</p>
        <p>In the world that's coming,<br>
        We gonna PROTECT what the Buddha entrusted to us,<br>
        We gonna GUARD what you asked us to hold.<br>
        And the World-Honored One,<br>
        You gonna KNOW our hearts,<br>
        You gonna see what we doing,<br>
        You gonna be a witness.</p>
        <p>Those corrupt monks in the defiled age,<br>
        They don't UNDERSTAND the Buddha's skillful means,<br>
        Don't understand how you teach according to what's appropriate,<br>
        How you speak different ways for different people.<br>
        They gonna look at us with EVIL faces,<br>
        Scowl at us and curse us with foul mouths,<br>
        And they gonna kick us OUT again and again,<br>
        Ban us from the assembly over and over,<br>
        Keep us FAR AWAY from the temples and stupas,<br>
        Won't let us near the holy places.</p>
        <p>All these kinds of persecution and trouble,<br>
        All these varieties of evil—<br>
        We gonna remember the Buddha's instruction,<br>
        We gonna think about what you told us,<br>
        And we gonna ENDURE all of it.<br>
        We gonna bear every bit of it with patience.</p>
        <p>In all the villages and cities,<br>
        All the towns and hamlets,<br>
        Wherever there's people SEEKING the Dharma,<br>
        Folks who WANT to hear the teaching,<br>
        We gonna GO to those places.<br>
        We gonna go wherever they at,<br>
        And we gonna teach the Dharma the Buddha entrusted to us,<br>
        The teaching you asked us to carry forward.</p>
        <p>We the WORLD-HONORED ONE'S MESSENGERS,<br>
        We the BUDDHA'S ENVOYS sent out into the world.<br>
        When we standing before the assembly,<br>
        We AIN'T AFRAID of nothing,<br>
        We got NO FEAR in our hearts,<br>
        'Cause we know who sent us.</p>
        <p>We gonna teach this Dharma WELL,<br>
        We gonna speak it CLEAR and TRUE.<br>
        And we asking you, Buddha:<br>

        To witness this moment,<br>
        We making this solemn vow.<br>
        We speaking this promise out loud.<br>
        And the Buddha—<br>

        The Buddha understand our commitment.<br>
        This our TESTIMONY,<br>
        And it's TRUE.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>END OF CHAPTER THIRTEEN: WHEN THE ROAD GETS ROUGH, YOU GOTTA KEEP WALKING</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This chapter is pure testimony—a series of sacred vows made by different groups of disciples, each pledging to carry the Dharma forward after Buddha's passing. The structure mirrors the call-and-response pattern of gospel testimony meetings, where individuals and groups stand up to declare their commitment.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Metaphorical Choices:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Armor of patience"</strong> - The Chinese 忍辱鎧 (rěnrù kǎi) becomes the central image of spiritual protection, rendered as something you "put on" like a soldier preparing for battle.</li>
            <li><strong>"Lion's roar"</strong> - The Sanskrit siṃhanāda becomes "speaking with power and authority, ain't scared of nothing" - the fearless proclamation of truth.</li>
            <li><strong>"We don't love our own lives"</strong> - This line echoes the martyr tradition in Christianity ("they loved not their lives unto death") while preserving the Buddhist teaching of non-attachment to the physical body.</li>
            <li><strong>"We the Buddha's messengers"</strong> - This directly parallels the Christian concept of apostleship (Greek: apostolos = "one sent forth") while maintaining fidelity to the Chinese 世尊使 (messenger/envoy of the World-Honored One).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The verse section maintains the repetitive, rhythmic structure of the Chinese original while using blues-style repetition ("we gonna... we gonna...") to create oral momentum. The confrontation with corrupt monks becomes a classic blues theme: the authentic versus the fake, the true preacher versus the charlatan, those who genuinely suffer for the cause versus those who profit from religion.</p>
        <p>The closing testimony—"The Buddha knows our hearts"—echoes both the Buddhist understanding of Buddha's omniscience and the gospel singer's assurance that "God knows my heart," creating a bridge between traditions without violating either one.</p>
        <p>This translation preserves the profound seriousness of these vows while making them accessible through vernacular language that carries its own tradition of suffering, endurance, and sacred commitment.</p>
