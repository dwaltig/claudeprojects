    <h1>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE: MEDICINE KING BODHISATTVA - THE STORY OF HOW HE GAVE IT ALL</h1>
    <h2>藥王菩薩本事品第二十三</h2>

    <h3>PART ONE: THE QUESTION</h3>
    <p>Now at that time, Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva stood up and said to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, how does Medicine King Bodhisattva walk through this suffering world of ours? World-Honored One, this Medicine King Bodhisattva—he done how many hundred thousand million billion impossible hard practices? Tell us, World-Honored One! We want to know a little bit about this story."</p>
    <p>And all the gods in heaven, all the dragons, all the spirits, all the night-wanderers, the music-makers, the jealous fighting gods, the great bird-kings, the half-human singers, the great serpent spirits, the humans and the not-quite-humans, and all the bodhisattvas come from other Buddha-lands, and all the disciples gathered there—they all wanted to hear it too, and they were glad in their hearts.</p>

    <h3>PART TWO: THE OLD STORY - A LONG TIME BACK</h3>
    <p>Then the Buddha said to Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva:</p>
    <p>"Listen now. A long time back—we talking about more ages past than there's grains of sand in the Ganges River—there was a Buddha called Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Thus Come One. He had all ten titles: Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened in Right Knowledge, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.</p>
    <p>"That Buddha, he had eighty billion great bodhisattvas—great beings, every one—and seventy-two times the sands of the Ganges River worth of great disciples who heard his teaching. That Buddha lived for forty-two thousand ages, and the bodhisattvas lived just as long.</p>
    <p>"In that Buddha-land, there wasn't no women, no hell realms, no hungry ghost realms, no animal realms, no jealous fighting gods, none of that suffering business. The ground was flat and smooth as the palm of your hand, made of lapis lazuli stone—pure blue jewel-ground. Treasure trees stood everywhere for beauty, treasure canopies spread overhead, treasure flower banners hanging down. Treasure bottles and incense burners everywhere you looked, all through that land. Seven kinds of precious things made up the platforms, and every tree had its platform—each tree standing just one arrow-shot away from its platform.</p>
    <p>"Under all them treasure trees, bodhisattvas and disciples sat in meditation. And up on all them treasure platforms, there was hundreds of billions of gods making heavenly music, singing praises to that Buddha, making offerings with their songs."</p>

    <h3>PART THREE: THE BODHISATTVA WHO EVERYBODY LOVED TO SEE</h3>
    <p>"Now at that time, that Buddha was preaching the Lotus Sutra to a bodhisattva called Gladly Seen by All Living Beings—yeah, 'Gladly Seen by All Living Beings,' that's his name—and to all the other bodhisattvas and disciples gathered there.</p>
    <p>"This Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva, he loved to practice hard things. In the Dharma of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, he practiced with intensity, walking meditation with his whole heart, seeking Buddhahood with everything he had. For twelve thousand full years he did this.</p>
    <p>"Then he attained it—he got the samādhi called 'Manifestation of All Physical Forms.' Got that samādhi, and his heart was filled with great joy.</p>
    <p>"He thought to himself: 'I got this Manifestation of All Physical Forms samādhi because I heard the Lotus Sutra. That's the power that did it. Now I got to make an offering to Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha and to the Lotus Sutra.'</p>
    <p>"Right then and there he entered that samādhi, and up in the empty sky he rained down mandarava flowers and great mandarava flowers. He rained down fine powdered hard black sandalwood—filled up the whole sky like clouds coming down. And he rained down sandalwood from the shore of the ocean—this sandalwood so precious that six ounces of it worth a whole world like ours—making offerings to that Buddha."</p>

    <h3>PART FOUR: WHEN THINGS AIN'T ENOUGH</h3>
    <p>"After making that offering, he came out of his samādhi and thought to himself:</p>
    <p>'Even though I made offerings to the Buddha with supernatural power, that ain't enough. I got to make an offering with my body.'</p>
    <p>"So he started drinking fragrant oils—sandalwood oil, frankincense oil, turpentine oil, sweet-smelling oils, camphor oil, and all kinds of oils. He drank oils made from jasmine and all kinds of fragrant flower oils. He did this for one thousand two hundred years.</p>
    <p>"After one thousand two hundred years, his whole body was saturated with fragrant oils. He rubbed more fragrant oils all over his body. Then, in front of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, he wrapped himself in heavenly treasure cloth, poured more fragrant oils all over himself, and by the power of his supernatural vow, he set his own body on fire.</p>
    <p>"The light from his burning body lit up eighty billion times the sands of the Ganges River worth of worlds.</p>
    <p>"In all those worlds, the Buddhas all praised him at the same time, saying:</p>
    <p>'GOOD! GOOD! GOOD, good son! THIS is true intensity! THIS is what we call true Dharma-offering to the Thus Come One! Even if you make offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, burning incense, powdered incense, anointing incense, heavenly silk banners and canopies, even sandalwood from the ocean shore—all kinds of things like that—can't match this. Even if you give away countries and cities, wives and children—can't match this. Good son, THIS is the first among all givings, the most honored, the most supreme among all offerings, because this is making Dharma-offerings to all the Thus Come Ones!'</p>
    <p>"They said all that, then they fell silent.</p>
    <p>"His body burned for one thousand two hundred years. After that time passed, his body was finally consumed."</p>

    <h3>PART FIVE: HE CAME BACK</h3>
    <p>"After Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva made that Dharma-offering, his life ended. But after his life ended, he was born again in the land of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha, in the house of Pure Virtue King. Sitting in full lotus position, he suddenly appeared—born by transformation.</p>
    <p>"Right away he spoke a verse to his father:</p>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>Great King, you should know this now:<br>
        I walked in practice in that place,<br>
        And right away I got the samādhi<br>
        Called Manifestation of All Physical Forms.<br>
        I practiced with great intensity,<br>
        Gave up my beloved body,<br>
        Made offerings to the World-Honored One,<br>
        Seeking that supreme wisdom.</p>
    </div>
    <p>"After speaking that verse, he said to his father:</p>
    <p>'Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha is still present right now. Before, I made offerings to that Buddha, and I gained the dhāraṇī for understanding the languages of all living beings. Plus, I heard this Lotus Sutra—eight hundred thousand million billion nayuta koṭi vimbaras and aśaṅkhyeya verses of it.</p>
    <p>'Great King, now I got to go back and make offerings to that Buddha again.'</p>
    <p>"Soon as he said that, he sat himself on a seven-treasure platform and rose up into empty space—rose up high as seven tāla trees—and went to where that Buddha was. He bowed his head to the Buddha's feet, put his ten fingertips together, and praised the Buddha with a verse:</p>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>Your face is wonderfully strange and fine,<br>
        Your light shines through the ten directions,<br>
        I made offerings once before,<br>
        Now I come again to see you face to face.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>PART SIX: THE BUDDHA'S PASSING - THE TRUST HANDED DOWN</h3>
    <p>"After Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva spoke that verse, he said to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>'World-Honored One, the World-Honored One is still present in the world!'</p>
    <p>"Then Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha said to Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva:</p>
    <p>'Good son, the time for my nirvāṇa has come. The time for extinction has arrived. You can prepare the bed and seat. Tonight, in the middle watch of the night, I will enter nirvāṇa.'</p>
    <p>"And he charged Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva:</p>
    <p>'Good son, I entrust the Buddha-Dharma to you—to you and to all the bodhisattvas and great disciples, and also the Dharma of supreme perfect enlightenment. I also entrust to you the three-thousand great thousandfold seven-treasure world—all the treasure trees, treasure platforms, and the serving gods—I hand all of it over to you. After I pass into extinction, my relics—I entrust them to you too. You should distribute them widely, set up offerings far and wide. You should build several thousand stupas.'</p>
    <p>"After Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha charged Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva like that, in the last watch of the night, he entered nirvāṇa."</p>

    <h3>PART SEVEN: GRIEF AND THE FUNERAL FIRE</h3>
    <p>"When Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva saw the Buddha pass into extinction, he was struck with grief, brokenhearted, filled with longing for the Buddha.</p>
    <p>"So he took sandalwood from the ocean shore and made a funeral pyre to honor the Buddha's body, and burned it.</p>
    <p>"After the fire went out, he gathered the relics and made eighty-four thousand treasure urns. With those, he built eighty-four thousand stupas—high as three worlds, decorated with banners and flags, adorned with hanging canopies, with all kinds of treasure bells hanging down."</p>

    <h3>PART EIGHT: THE BURNING OF THE ARMS - WHEN THE BODY AIN'T COMPLETE NO MORE</h3>
    <p>"Then Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva thought to himself again:</p>
    <p>'Even though I made these offerings, my heart still ain't satisfied. I got to make more offerings to the relics.'</p>
    <p>"So he said to all the bodhisattvas and great disciples and to the gods, dragons, night-wanderers, and all the great assembly:</p>
    <p>'Y'all should focus your hearts and minds. I'm about to make offerings now to the relics of Sun Moon Pure Bright Virtue Buddha.'</p>
    <p>"After he said that, right there in front of those eighty-four thousand stupas, he burned his two arms—adorned with a hundred blessings, those arms were—and he burned them for seventy-two thousand years, making offerings.</p>
    <p>"This caused countless people seeking to be disciples, and measureless uncountable people beyond measure, to bring forth the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment. And they all attained dwelling in the samādhi of Manifestation of All Physical Forms."</p>

    <h3>PART NINE: THE WITNESSES CRY OUT - THE BODY AIN'T WHOLE NO MORE</h3>
    <p>"Now when all them bodhisattvas, gods, humans, jealous fighting gods, and the rest saw he didn't have no arms, they were distressed and sorrowful and grief-struck, and they said:</p>
    <p>'This Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva is our teacher, the one who taught us and guided us. But now he burned his arms, and his body ain't complete no more!'</p>

    <h3>PART TEN: THE VOW - IF THIS IS REAL, LET IT RESTORE</h3>
    <p>"Right then, Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva stood there in the midst of that great assembly and made this vow:</p>
    <p>'I gave up both my arms. I WILL attain the Buddha's golden body. If that's real and not empty words, if that's true and not a lie, then let my two arms come back just like they were!'</p>
    <p>"Soon as he made that vow, his arms naturally restored themselves—came back just like they were.</p>
    <p>"This happened because of the deep merit, the thick virtue, the profound wisdom of that bodhisattva.</p>
    <p>"Right at that time, the three-thousand great thousandfold world shook six ways. Heaven rained down treasure flowers. All the humans and gods experienced what they'd never experienced before."</p>

    <h3>PART ELEVEN: WHO HE IS NOW</h3>
    <p>The Buddha said to Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva:</p>
    <p>"What do you think? Was Gladly Seen by All Living Beings Bodhisattva some other person? No sir! Right now, it's Medicine King Bodhisattva. He gave up his body and made offerings like that—countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions beyond counting, that's how many times he gave.</p>
    <p>"Constellation King Flower, if someone brings forth the mind seeking supreme perfect enlightenment, and they can burn even just one finger, or even just one toe, as an offering to a Buddha stupa—that's worth more than giving away countries, cities, wives, children, or even all the mountains, forests, rivers, and pools and precious treasures in a three-thousand great thousandfold world.</p>
    <p>"And if someone fills up a three-thousand great thousandfold world with the seven treasures and makes offerings to the Buddha and to great bodhisattvas and to pratyekabuddhas and to arhats—the merit that person gets don't compare to someone who receives and keeps this Lotus Sutra, even just one four-line verse of it. THAT blessing is the greatest."</p>

    <h3>PART TWELVE: THE PRAISES - THIS SUTRA IS SUPREME</h3>
    <p>"Constellation King Flower, listen:</p>
    <p>"Just like among all the flowing streams and rivers, among all waters, the ocean is first—this Lotus Sutra is like that. Among all the sutras preached by the Thus Come Ones, it's the deepest and the greatest.</p>
    <p>"And just like among earth mountains, black mountains, small iron-ring mountains, great iron-ring mountains, and the ten treasure mountains—among all mountains, Mount Sumeru is first—this Lotus Sutra is like that. Among all sutras, it's the highest.</p>
    <p>"And just like among all the stars, the moon-child is first—this Lotus Sutra is like that. Among thousands of millions of billions of kinds of sutra-dharmas, it's the most illuminating.</p>
    <p>"And just like the sun-child can drive out all darkness—this sutra is like that. It can break all the darkness of what ain't good.</p>
    <p>"And just like among all the little kings, the Wheel-Turning Sacred King is first—this sutra is like that. Among all sutras, it's the most honored.</p>
    <p>"And just like Indra is king among the thirty-three gods—this sutra is like that. It's king among all sutras.</p>
    <p>"And just like Great Brahma Heaven King is the father of all living beings—this sutra is like that. It's the father of all worthy saints, all learners, all who completed learning, and all who brought forth the bodhisattva mind.</p>
    <p>"And just like among all ordinary people, the stream-enterer, the once-returner, the non-returner, the arhat, and the pratyekabuddha are first—this sutra is like that. Among all sutras preached by Thus Come Ones, or preached by bodhisattvas, or preached by disciples—among all sutra-dharmas, it's the very first.</p>
    <p>"If someone can receive and keep this sutra, they're like that too—among all living beings, they're the very first.</p>
    <p>"Among all disciples and pratyekabuddhas, the bodhisattvas are first. This sutra is like that—among all sutra-dharmas, it's the very first.</p>
    <p>"Just like the Buddha is king of all dharmas, this sutra is like that—it's king among all sutras."</p>

    <h3>PART THIRTEEN: THE MEDICINE FOR EVERYTHING</h3>
    <p>"Constellation King Flower, this sutra can rescue all living beings. This sutra can cause all living beings to leave all suffering and distress. This sutra can greatly benefit all living beings, filling up their wishes.</p>
    <p>"It's like a clear cool pool that can satisfy all those who thirsty and parched.</p>
    <p>"Like someone cold getting fire.</p>
    <p>"Like someone naked getting clothes.</p>
    <p>"Like a merchant caravan finding a leader.</p>
    <p>"Like a child finding its mother.</p>
    <p>"Like someone crossing water finding a boat.</p>
    <p>"Like someone sick finding a doctor.</p>
    <p>"Like someone in darkness finding a lamp.</p>
    <p>"Like someone poor finding treasure.</p>
    <p>"Like people finding a king.</p>
    <p>"Like a merchant ship reaching the sea.</p>
    <p>"Like a torch driving out darkness.</p>
    <p>"This Lotus Sutra is like that. It can cause living beings to leave all suffering, all sickness and pain. It can loosen all the bonds of birth and death.</p>
    <p>"If a person gets to hear this Lotus Sutra—whether they copy it themselves or have someone else copy it—the merit they get, even if you measure it with the Buddha's wisdom, you can't find the edge of it.</p>
    <p>"If someone copies this sutra scroll and makes offerings with flowers, incense, necklaces, burning incense, powdered incense, anointing incense, banners, canopies, robes, and all kinds of lamps—butter lamps, oil lamps, all kinds of fragrant oil lamps, jasmine oil lamps, sumana flower oil lamps, pāṭala oil lamps, vārṣika oil lamps, navamallikā oil lamps—making offerings like that, the merit they get is also measureless."</p>

    <h3>PART FOURTEEN: THE PROMISE TO WOMEN - YOU WON'T BE WOMEN NO MORE</h3>
    <p>"Constellation King Flower, if someone hears this Chapter on the Past Deeds of Medicine King Bodhisattva, they also get measureless, boundless merit.</p>
    <p>"If a WOMAN hears this Chapter on the Past Deeds of Medicine King Bodhisattva and can receive and keep it—when she finishes this female body, she won't receive a female body ever again.</p>
    <p>"If, after the Thus Come One's extinction, in the last five hundred years, if a woman hears this sutra and practices according to what it says—when this life ends, she'll go straight to the Land of Peace and Joy, to where Amitābha Buddha and the great bodhisattvas surround and dwell. She'll be born in a lotus flower, on a jeweled seat.</p>
    <p>"She won't be troubled no more by greed and desire.</p>
    <p>"She won't be troubled no more by anger and stupidity.</p>
    <p>"She won't be troubled no more by arrogance, jealousy, and all the other defilements.</p>
    <p>"She'll get the bodhisattvas' supernatural powers and the Tolerance of Non-arising of Dharmas.</p>
    <p>"Once she gets that tolerance, her eye-faculty will become pure. With that pure eye-faculty, she'll see seven hundred twenty billion nayuta times the sands of the Ganges River worth of Thus Come One Buddhas.</p>

    <h3>PART FIFTEEN: ALL THE BUDDHAS PRAISE HER FROM FAR AWAY</h3>
    <p>"At that time, all those Buddhas will praise her from far away, saying:</p>
    <p>'GOOD! GOOD! GOOD, good son! You were able to receive and keep and read and recite and think about this sutra in the Dharma of Śākyamuni Buddha, and you explained it to others. The merit you got—measureless, boundless. Fire can't burn it. Water can't wash it away. Your merit—a thousand Buddhas speaking together couldn't finish telling it.</p>
    <p>'You already broke all the demon thieves. You destroyed the army of birth and death. All the other enemies—you smashed every one.</p>
    <p>'Good son, hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, with their supernatural power, together guard and protect you. In all the worlds, among gods and humans, there's nobody like you. Except for the Thus Come One himself, among all the disciples, all the pratyekabuddhas, even among the bodhisattvas—in wisdom and meditation concentration, nobody equals you.'</p>
    <p>"Constellation King Flower, this bodhisattva accomplished the power of merit and wisdom just like that."</p>

    <h3>PART SIXTEEN: THE FRAGRANCE THEY CARRY</h3>
    <p>"If someone hears this Chapter on the Past Deeds of Medicine King Bodhisattva and can rejoice and praise it—from that person's mouth will constantly come the fragrance of blue lotus flowers. From their body's pores will constantly come the fragrance of ox-head sandalwood. The merit they get is like what I already said.</p>
    <p>"That's why, Constellation King Flower, I'm entrusting this Chapter on the Past Deeds of Medicine King Bodhisattva to you. After my extinction, in the last five hundred years, you should spread it widely throughout this southern continent. Don't let it get cut off. Don't let evil demons, demon people, gods, dragons, night-wanderers, or kumbhāṇḍa spirits get their chance at it."</p>

    <h3>PART SEVENTEEN: THIS SUTRA IS MEDICINE - DON'T GET OLD, DON'T DIE</h3>
    <p>"Constellation King Flower, you should use your supernatural powers to guard and protect this sutra. Why? Because this sutra is good medicine for the people of this southern continent when they sick.</p>
    <p>"If a person has a disease and gets to hear this sutra, their disease will disappear and be gone. They won't get old. They won't die.</p>

    <h3>PART EIGHTEEN: WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE KEEPING THIS SUTRA</h3>
    <p>"Constellation King Flower, if you see someone who receives and keeps this sutra, you should take blue lotus flowers, fill them with powdered incense, and scatter them over that person. After you scatter them, you should think like this:</p>
    <p>'This person before long—won't be long now—they gonna take the grass and sit down at the place of enlightenment. They gonna break all the demon armies. They gonna blow the Dharma conch. They gonna beat the great Dharma drum. They gonna ferry across all living beings from the ocean of old age, sickness, and death.'</p>
    <p>"That's why—anyone seeking the Buddha Way, when they see someone receiving and keeping this sutra, they should bring forth a respectful mind just like that toward them."</p>

    <h3>PART NINETEEN: WHAT HAPPENED WHEN HE TOLD THIS STORY</h3>
    <p>When the Buddha told this Chapter on the Past Deeds of Medicine King Bodhisattva, eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas attained the dhāraṇī for understanding the languages of all living beings.</p>
    <p>Many Treasures Thus Come One, there in his treasure stupa, praised Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva, saying:</p>
    <p>"GOOD! GOOD! Constellation King Flower, you accomplished inconceivable merit. You were able to ask Śākyamuni Buddha about matters like this, benefiting measureless, all living beings."</p>
    <h3>END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE: MEDICINE KING BODHISATTVA - THE STORY OF HOW HE GAVE IT ALL</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This chapter contains some of the most extreme imagery in all of Buddhist literature: a bodhisattva who saturates his body with fragrant oils for 1,200 years, then sets himself on fire and burns for another 1,200 years. Later, he burns both his arms for 72,000 years.</p>
        <p>In the Buddhist context, this represents <strong>total self-offering</strong> as the ultimate form of generosity (dāna-pāramitā). The burning body produces <em>light</em> that illuminates eighty billion worlds. This transforms the act from destruction into illumination. The bodhisattva becomes a lamp, a torch that lights up reality for countless beings. His sacrifice becomes revelation.</p>
        <p>The most dramatic moment is when Medicine King, after burning his arms, makes a vow: "If it's true I will attain the Buddha's golden body, let my arms be restored." And they are. This is about the power of vow (praṇidhāna) and the indestructibility of the Dharma-body. What is given fully for the sake of truth is never truly lost.</p>
        <p>The chapter also contains a radical promise of liberation for women, stating that any woman who hears and keeps this chapter will not be reborn in a female body. This challenges the patriarchal context of its time, suggesting that ultimate commitment to the Dharma transcends all social and physical limitations.</p>
        <p>Finally, the theme of fragrance—saturating the body with it, emanating it—symbolizes virtue that arises naturally from practice. The practitioner doesn't just *make* offerings; they *become* an offering, their very presence a benefit to the world.</p>
