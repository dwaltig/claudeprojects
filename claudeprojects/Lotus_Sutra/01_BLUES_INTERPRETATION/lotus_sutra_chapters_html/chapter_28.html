    <h1>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT: UNIVERSAL WORTHY COMES TO ENCOURAGE YOU</h1>
    <h2>(The Final Word: You Are Not Alone, You WILL Awaken)</h2>

    <p>Listen now to how it all ends, how the whole teaching comes to its close:</p>
    <p>At that time, Universal Worthy Bodhisattva—riding on his own sovereign supernatural power, carried by his mighty virtue and his name that's known throughout all worlds—he came from the East with countless, boundless, can't-be-numbered great Bodhisattvas. And listen, everywhere those beings passed through on their journey, all those countries shook and trembled. Jeweled lotus flowers rained down from the sky. A hundred thousand million billion kinds of music played—not human music, understand, but cosmic music, the sound the universe makes when grace is moving.</p>
    <p>And he didn't come alone. No sir. He brought with him numberless gods, dragons, night-wanderers, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans—all of them surrounding him, every one of them showing their own power and virtue and supernatural might. They all came to this Saha world, to Vulture Peak Mountain. When they got there, they bowed their heads to the ground before Śākyamuni Buddha. They walked around him seven times to the right, and then Universal Worthy said to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, I was in the land of Precious Majesty Superior King Buddha, and way over there I heard that in this Saha world you were preaching this Lotus Sutra. So I came with these countless, boundless, hundred thousand million billion Bodhisattvas to listen and receive it. I'm asking you, World-Honored One—please tell us: After the Tathāgata passes away, when you're gone from this world, how can good men and good women get hold of this Lotus Sutra? How do they receive it?"</p>

    <p>The Buddha told Universal Worthy Bodhisattva:</p>
    <p>"If good men and good women accomplish four things, then after the Tathāgata passes away, they WILL get this Lotus Sutra. Listen to what these four things are:</p>
    <p>"First: They're protected and kept in mind by all the Buddhas.</p>
    <p>"Second: They've planted roots of virtue, built up good deep in themselves.</p>
    <p>"Third: They've entered the company of those who are fixed on the right path, who are determined, who won't turn back.</p>
    <p>"Fourth: They've aroused the mind that wants to save ALL living beings—every last one.</p>
    <p>"Good men and good women who accomplish these four things—after the Tathāgata passes away, they WILL get this sutra. Count on it. It's guaranteed."</p>

    <p>Then Universal Worthy Bodhisattva said to the Buddha:</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, in the last five hundred years, in that polluted evil age that's coming, whoever receives and holds this sutra—I WILL guard them. I will protect them. I will remove their troubles and their dangers. I will give them peace and safety. I will make sure that nothing—NOTHING—can find a way to harm them.</p>
    <p>"No demons, no demons' sons, no demons' daughters, no demon-followers, no demon-possessed people. No night-wanderers, no rakshasas, no kumbhandas, no pishachas, no krityas, no putanas, no vetadas—none of these beings that trouble people will be able to take advantage of them.</p>
    <p>"Whether that person is walking or standing still, whether they're reading this sutra or reciting it—at that time I will ride my six-tusked white elephant king. I will come with a great company of Bodhisattvas to where that person is. I will show myself to them. I will make offerings to them. I will guard them. I will comfort their hearts. You know why I'll do all this? Because I'm also making offerings to the Lotus Sutra itself.</p>
    <p>"And if that person is sitting down, thinking about this sutra, meditating on it—at that time I will ride that white elephant king again and appear before them. If they forget even one sentence, one verse of the Lotus Sutra, I WILL teach it to them. I will recite it together with them. I will help them understand it thoroughly.</p>
    <p>"And when that person who receives and holds and reads and recites the Lotus Sutra sees me, they will be filled with great joy—the kind of joy that makes you want to keep going. And because they see me, right then and there they will gain samādhis and dhāraṇīs. They'll gain the Revolving Dharani, the Hundred Thousand Million Billion Revolving Dharani, the Dharani of Skillful Means in the Sound of the Teaching. They'll get dhāraṇīs like these."</p>

    <p>"World-Honored One, in that later age, in the last five hundred years, in that polluted evil world—if there are monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen who seek this teaching, who receive it, who read it, who recite it, who copy it down, if they want to practice this Lotus Sutra—they should focus themselves single-mindedly for three weeks. Twenty-one days.</p>
    <p>"When those three weeks are completed, I will ride my six-tusked white elephant. I will come with countless Bodhisattvas surrounding me. I will appear to that person in a body that all beings love to see. I will preach the Dharma to them. I will show them. I will teach them. I will benefit them. I will make them glad. And I will also give them dhāraṇī-mantras.</p>
    <p>"And when they get these dhāraṇīs, no non-human being will be able to break them. No woman will be able to lead them astray. I myself will always guard that person.</p>
    <p>"So World-Honored One, please let me speak this dhāraṇī-mantra."</p>

    <p>Then right there, standing before the Buddha, he spoke the mantra:</p>
    <p>Atandi / Tandavabha-di / Tandavabha-te / Tanda-kusalai / Tanda-sudalai / Sudalai / Sudara-vabha-te-buddha-pashane / Sarva-dhāraṇī-avabha-tani / Sarva-bhasha-avabha-tani / Shu-avabha-tani / Sengha-pariksha-ni / Sengha-nirgha-tani / Asengi / Sengha-bhaga-di / Taile-ayuta-sengha-dutale / Arati-barati / Sarva-sengha-samadi-galan-di / Sarva-dharma-shubha-lishate / Sarva-sattva-rutaka-ushalya-anumga-di / Shen-avi-kilidi-te</p>

    <p>"World-Honored One, if any Bodhisattva hears this dhāraṇī, they should know it's the supernatural power of Universal Worthy at work. If this Lotus Sutra circulates in this Jambudvipa world, if anyone receives and holds it, they should think: 'This is ALL because of Universal Worthy's mighty spiritual power.'</p>
    <p>"If anyone receives it, reads it, recites it, keeps it correctly in mind, understands its meaning, practices according to what it says—know that such a person is doing Universal Worthy's practice. They've planted deep roots of goodness before countless, boundless Buddhas. The Tathāgatas themselves have put their hands on that person's head.</p>
    <p>"If someone just copies this sutra down, writes it out—when that person dies, they will be born in the Trayastrimsha Heaven. At that time, eighty-four thousand heavenly women will come to greet them, playing all kinds of music. That person will wear a crown made of seven jewels, and there among those palace women they will experience joy and happiness. How much more so for those who receive it, hold it, read it, recite it, keep it correctly in mind, and practice according to what it says!</p>
    <p>"If anyone receives and holds this teaching, reads and recites it, understands its meaning—when that person's life ends, a thousand Buddhas will reach out their hands to them. They won't be afraid. They won't fall into evil destinies. They will go straight to Tushita Heaven, to where Maitreya Bodhisattva is. Maitreya Bodhisattva has the thirty-two marks of a great being. He's surrounded by a great assembly of Bodhisattvas. He's attended by hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of heavenly women. That person will be born right there in that company. These are the kinds of merits and benefits they'll receive.</p>
    <p>"So if you're wise, you should single-mindedly copy this sutra yourself, or have someone else copy it. You should receive it, hold it, read it, recite it, keep it correctly in mind, and practice according to what it says.</p>
    <p>"World-Honored One, I will now use my supernatural powers to guard this sutra. After the Tathāgata passes away, I will cause it to spread widely throughout this Jambudvipa. I will make sure it never dies out."</p>

    <p>At that time Śākyamuni Buddha praised him, saying:</p>
    <p>"Excellent! Excellent, Universal Worthy! You can protect and help this sutra, causing many beings to gain peace, benefit, and happiness. You have already accomplished inconceivable merit and deep great compassion. From the distant past you have aroused the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment, and now you are able to make this supernatural vow to guard this sutra.</p>
    <p>"I will use my own supernatural power to guard and protect anyone who can receive and hold the name of Bodhisattva Universal Worthy."</p>

    <p>"Universal Worthy, if anyone receives, holds, reads, recites, keeps correctly in mind, practices, and copies this Lotus Sutra—know that such a person SEES Śākyamuni Buddha. It's as if they hear this sutra directly from the Buddha's mouth.</p>
    <p>"Know that such a person is MAKING OFFERINGS to Śākyamuni Buddha.</p>
    <p>"Know that the Buddha is saying to them: 'Excellent! Well done!'</p>
    <p>"Know that Śākyamuni Buddha is placing his hand on that person's head.</p>
    <p>"Know that Śākyamuni Buddha's robe is covering them, protecting them.</p>
    <p>"Such a person will no longer be greedy for worldly pleasures. They won't like the scriptures or writings of non-Buddhist paths. They won't take pleasure in getting close to such people or to those who do evil—butchers, those who raise pigs, sheep, chickens, or dogs, hunters, those who sell sex.</p>
    <p>"That person's mind and intentions will be straight and true. They will have right mindfulness. They will have the power of merit and virtue.</p>
    <p>"That person will not be troubled by the three poisons. They also will not be troubled by jealousy, arrogance, self-deception, or inflated pride.</p>
    <p>"That person will have few desires. They will know contentment. They will be able to practice Universal Worthy's way."</p>

    <p>"Universal Worthy, after the Tathāgata passes away, in the last five hundred years—if anyone sees someone who receives, holds, reads, and recites the Lotus Sutra, they should think:</p>
    <p>'This person will not be long in going to the place of enlightenment. This person is about to break through all the demon armies. This person is about to attain supreme perfect enlightenment. This person is about to turn the Dharma wheel, beat the Dharma drum, blow the Dharma conch, rain down the Dharma rain. This person is about to sit on the lion throne of Dharma in the great assembly of gods and humans.'</p>
    <p>"Universal Worthy, if in later ages anyone receives, holds, reads, and recites this sutra—that person will no longer be greedy for clothes, bedding, food, drink, or the things that sustain life. Their wishes will not be empty. Even in this present life they will receive the rewards of blessing.</p>
    <p>"If anyone slights and insults them, saying 'You're just a crazy person! You do this practice for nothing! In the end you'll gain nothing!'—the karmic retribution for speaking like that is this: that person will be eyeless, blind, world after world after world.</p>
    <p>"But if anyone makes offerings to them and praises them, they will see the fruit of that reward in this very life.</p>
    <p>"If anyone sees someone who receives and holds this sutra and exposes their faults—whether those faults are real or made up—that person in this present life will get white leprosy.</p>
    <p>"If anyone mocks and laughs at them, that person world after world will have gapped and broken teeth, ugly lips, a flat nose, twisted hands and feet, squinting eyes, a body that stinks, evil sores, pus and blood, bloated belly, short breath, and all kinds of severe and evil diseases.</p>
    <p>"Therefore, Universal Worthy, if you see anyone who receives and holds this sutra, you should rise up and go meet them from far away. You should respect them just as you would respect a Buddha."</p>

    <p>When the Buddha spoke this Chapter of Universal Worthy's Encouragement, Bodhisattvas countless as the sands of the Ganges River gained hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Revolving Dharanis. Bodhisattvas as numerous as the dust motes in a great thousand-fold world system fully accomplished Universal Worthy's Way.</p>
    <p>When the Buddha was speaking this sutra, Universal Worthy and all the other Bodhisattvas, Śāriputra and all the other disciples, and the gods, dragons, humans, non-humans, and everyone in that entire great assembly—they all received it with great joy. They accepted and held the Buddha's words. They bowed in respect and departed.</p>
    <h3>END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT: UNIVERSAL WORTHY COMES TO ENCOURAGE YOU</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This final chapter is the ultimate encouragement. After all the teachings, parables, and cosmic displays, Universal Worthy Bodhisattva arrives from the East to make a personal promise: he will protect anyone who holds this sutra in the difficult ages to come. He is the guarantor, the protector, the one who ensures the teaching will not be lost.</p>
        <p>The four conditions for receiving the sutra are a summary of the path: 1) Be mindful of the Buddhas, 2) Plant good roots, 3) Enter the correct concentration, and 4) Arouse the mind to save all beings. This isn't a passive reception; it's an active state of being.</p>
        <p>Universal Worthy's vow to appear on his six-tusked white elephant to any practitioner who is struggling, who forgets a line, or who needs encouragement is one of the most intimate and comforting promises in the sutra. It says: you are not alone in your practice. When you sincerely engage with this teaching, help will come.</p>
        <p>The chapter ends with a stark warning about the karmic consequences of slandering those who uphold the sutra (blindness, leprosy, etc.) and the immediate rewards for honoring them. This final section underscores the sutra's ultimate point: the teaching is not an abstract text, but a living reality embodied in the people who hold it. To honor them is to honor the Buddha himself.</p>
