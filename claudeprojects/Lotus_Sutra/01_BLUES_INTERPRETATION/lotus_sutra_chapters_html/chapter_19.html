    <h1>CHAPTER NINETEEN: WHEN YOUR SENSES WAKE UP</h1>
    <h2>(The Merit of the Dharma Teacher)</h2>

    <h3>THE BUDDHA SPEAKS TO CONSTANT EXERTION</h3>
    <p>Right then, the Buddha turned to Constant-Exertion Bodhisattva and said:</p>
    <p>"Listen here now. If there's a good man or a good woman who holds this Lotus Sutra—I mean really holds it, reads it out loud, recites it, explains it to folks, or writes it down with their own hand—</p>
    <p>That person gonna get EIGHT HUNDRED eye-merits.</p>
    <p>They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED ear-merits.</p>
    <p>They gonna get EIGHT HUNDRED nose-merits.</p>
    <p>They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED tongue-merits.</p>
    <p>They gonna get EIGHT HUNDRED body-merits.</p>
    <p>They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED mind-merits.</p>
    <p>And all these merits gonna PURIFY their six senses—gonna make them clean and clear and new.</p>
    <p>Now this good person—their eyes, just the plain eyes their mama and daddy gave them, their regular flesh-and-blood eyes—they gonna see clear through the whole three-thousand-world system:</p>
    <p>All the mountains inside and mountains outside,<br>
    All the forests, all the rivers, all the seas,<br>
    Down to the deepest hell (that's Avīci, the pit of no-interval suffering),<br>
    Up to the highest heaven (that's the Peak of Existence, where being goes as far as being goes).</p>
    <p>And they gonna see all the beings in between.</p>
    <p>They gonna see the karma that brought folks here.<br>
    They gonna see the causes and the effects.<br>
    They gonna see where beings gonna be born next and why.</p>
    <p>They gonna see EVERYTHING. Know EVERYTHING.</p>
    <p>All with the regular eyes they was born with."</p>

    <h3>VERSE: SEEING WITH NEW EYES</h3>
    <div class="verse">
        <p>If in a great assembly,<br>
        With a heart that ain't afraid,<br>
        You speak this Lotus Sutra—<br>
        Listen to the merit you done made.</p>
        <p>That person gets eight hundred<br>
        Superior merits for the eye,<br>
        And with this decoration,<br>
        Their vision's purified.</p>
        <p>With the eyes their parents gave them,<br>
        They see the whole three-thousand sphere—<br>
        The inner and the outer mountains,<br>
        Mount Sumeru standing clear,</p>
        <p>The Iron Ring and all the rest,<br>
        The forests and the mountain wood,<br>
        The oceans and the flowing rivers,<br>
        Down to where the hell-fires burn for good,</p>
        <p>Up to the Peak of Existence,<br>
        The highest place a being goes—<br>
        All creatures living in between,<br>
        Everything there is, they knows.</p>
        <p>Though they ain't got the heavenly eye yet,<br>
        Their flesh-eye power's just like this—<br>
        Seeing clear through everything,<br>
        Nothing that their vision gonna miss.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>EARS THAT HEAR EVERYTHING</h3>
    <p>"Now listen, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down—</p>
    <p>They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED ear-merits.</p>
    <p>And with those purified ears, they gonna hear EVERY SOUND in the three-thousand-world system:</p>
    <p>Down to Avīci hell, up to the Peak of Existence, inside and outside, every kind of sound and voice—</p>
    <p>Elephant sounds, horse sounds, ox sounds, chariot sounds.</p>
    <p>Crying sounds and grieving sounds and sighing sounds.</p>
    <p>Conch-shell sounds, drum sounds, bell sounds, chime sounds.</p>
    <p>Laughing sounds and talking sounds.</p>
    <p>Male voices, female voices, boy voices, girl voices.</p>
    <p>Dharma sounds (that's truth-speaking).<br>
    Non-dharma sounds (that's lie-speaking).</p>
    <p>Suffering sounds, pleasure sounds.</p>
    <p>Common folks' sounds, holy people sounds.</p>
    <p>Joy sounds, sorrow sounds.</p>
    <p>Heaven sounds.<br>
    Dragon sounds.<br>
    Night-demon (yakṣa) sounds.<br>
    Gandharva sounds (that's the music-spirits).<br>
    Asura sounds (that's the fighting-titans).<br>
    Garuda sounds (that's the great birds).<br>
    Kiṃnara sounds (that's the song-spirits).<br>
    Mahoraga sounds (that's the great serpents).</p>
    <p>Fire crackling. Water rushing. Wind blowing.</p>
    <p>Hell-screams. Animal cries. Hungry-ghost moaning.</p>
    <p>Monks chanting. Nuns reciting.</p>
    <p>Śrāvaka voices (that's the hearers).<br>
    Pratyekabuddha voices (that's the solitary realizers).<br>
    Bodhisattva voices.<br>
    Buddha voices.</p>
    <p>To sum it up quick: EVERY SOUND in the three-thousand-world system—every sound inside and every sound outside—</p>
    <p>Even though they ain't got the heavenly ear yet, just with the regular ears their mama and daddy gave them, the clean natural ears they was born with—</p>
    <p>They hear it ALL.</p>
    <p>They can tell one sound from another.<br>
    They understand what everything means.</p>
    <p>And their ears don't break. Don't get damaged. Don't go deaf from all that listening.</p>
    <p>That's what holding this sutra does."</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>With the ears their parents gave them,<br>
        Clean and pure without no stain,<br>
        With these ordinary, common ears,<br>
        They hear the three-thousand-world domain.</p>
        <p>Elephant, horse, carriage, cattle,<br>
        Bell and chime and conch and drum,<br>
        Zither, harp and lute sounds,<br>
        Flute and pipe—when music come,</p>
        <p>Pure and lovely singing voices—<br>
        They listen but don't get attached.<br>
        Countless kinds of human speaking,<br>
        They hear and understand the batch.</p>
        <p>And they hear the heaven-voices,<br>
        Subtle music, wondrous song,<br>
        Male and female speaking,<br>
        Boy and girl voices going strong.</p>
        <p>In mountain canyons, dangerous valleys,<br>
        The kalavinka bird that sings,<br>
        The jīvaṃjīvaka and others—<br>
        They hear all these feathered things.</p>
        <p>In the hells where beings suffer,<br>
        All the tortured, painful cries,<br>
        Hungry ghosts pressed by thirst and hunger,<br>
        Seeking food with desperate sighs,</p>
        <p>The asuras and their families<br>
        Living by the great sea-shore,<br>
        When they speaking to each other,<br>
        Making voices loud that roar—</p>
        <p>The dharma-speaker sitting here<br>
        Safe and settled in this place,<br>
        Can hear all these distant sounds<br>
        Without their ears losing grace.</p>
        <p>In the ten-direction world systems,<br>
        Where birds and beasts call out their name,<br>
        The dharma-speaking person<br>
        Hears every creature all the same.</p>
        <p>In the Brahma Heaven high above,<br>
        The Light-Sound and All-Pure sphere,<br>
        Up to the Peak of Existence,<br>
        Every word they speaking there—</p>
        <p>The dharma teacher dwelling here<br>
        Can hear it all, can hear it true.<br>
        All the monks in assembly,<br>
        All the nuns reciting too—</p>
        <p>Whether reading from the scriptures,<br>
        Whether teaching to the crowd—<br>
        The dharma teacher right here<br>
        Hears every word they speak out loud.</p>
        <p>And all the Bodhisattvas<br>
        Reading sutras, studying dharma deep,<br>
        Teaching others, writing commentaries,<br>
        Explaining meanings—not one peep</p>
        <p>Goes unheard by this dharma teacher.<br>
        The Buddhas—those Great Holy Ones—<br>
        Teaching beings, guiding creatures,<br>
        In great assemblies, every one,</p>
        <p>Speaking subtle, wondrous teachings—<br>
        The one who holds this Lotus here<br>
        Hears every single dharma,<br>
        Every Buddha-word comes clear.</p>
        <p>In the three-thousand-world system,<br>
        Every sound outside and in,<br>
        Down to Avīci suffering,<br>
        Up to where the heavens begin—</p>
        <p>They hear every voice and sound<br>
        Without their hearing getting broke.<br>
        Their ears are sharp and sensitive,<br>
        Can tell apart each kind of folk.</p>
        <p>The one who holds this Lotus Sutra,<br>
        Though they ain't got the heavenly ear,<br>
        Just using what they born with—<br>
        The merit's already right here.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>NOSE THAT SMELLS EVERYTHING</h3>
    <p>"Now again, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down—</p>
    <p>They gonna get EIGHT HUNDRED nose-merits.</p>
    <p>And with that purified nose-root, they gonna smell EVERY SCENT in the three-thousand-world system—up and down, inside and outside, every kind of fragrance:</p>
    <p>Sumana flower scent (that's jasmine).<br>
    Jāti flower scent (that's champak).<br>
    Mallikā flower scent (that's Arabian jasmine).<br>
    Campaka flower scent.<br>
    Pāṭala flower scent.</p>
    <p>Red lotus scent. Blue lotus scent. White lotus scent.</p>
    <p>Flowering tree scent. Fruit tree scent.</p>
    <p>Sandalwood scent.<br>
    Agarwood scent (that's aloeswood).<br>
    Tamālapatra scent.<br>
    Tagara scent.</p>
    <p>A thousand, ten-thousand kinds of mixed incense—<br>
    Whether powder incense, whether pellet incense, whether smearing incense—</p>
    <p>The person holding this sutra, sitting right here in this spot, can tell them all apart.</p>
    <p>And they can smell beings too:</p>
    <p>Elephant scent, horse scent, ox scent, sheep scent.<br>
    Man scent, woman scent, boy scent, girl scent.</p>
    <p>The smell of grass and trees and thickets and forests—whether near or whether far—all the scents that are, they smell them. Separate them out. Don't get it wrong.</p>
    <p>The person holding this sutra, though they living right here, they also smell the heaven-scents:</p>
    <p>The Pārijātaka tree scent (that's the coral tree).<br>
    The Kovidāra tree scent.<br>
    Mandārava flower scent.<br>
    Mahā-mandārava flower scent.<br>
    Mañjūṣaka flower scent.<br>
    Mahā-mañjūṣaka flower scent.<br>
    Sandalwood, agarwood, all kinds of powder incense,<br>
    All kinds of flower incense mixing together—</p>
    <p>Heaven-incense combined in its fragrance—they know it, they don't miss nothing.</p>
    <p>And they smell the bodies of the heaven-beings:</p>
    <p>Indra (that's Śakra, the king of the gods) sitting in his Victory Hall, enjoying the five pleasures, playing around—they smell that.</p>
    <p>When he in the Wonderful Dharma Hall teaching the Thirty-Three Gods—they smell that.</p>
    <p>When he playing in the celestial gardens—they smell that.</p>
    <p>All the other gods, male and female—they smell all their body-scents too.</p>
    <p>And it keeps going up, turning and rising, all the way to the Brahma realm, up to the Peak of Existence—</p>
    <p>All the heaven-beings' body-scents, they smell them all.</p>
    <p>And they smell the incense the heaven-folk are burning too.</p>
    <p>And they smell the śrāvakas' scent.<br>
    The pratyekabuddhas' scent.<br>
    The Bodhisattvas' scent.<br>
    The Buddhas' body-scent.</p>
    <p>They smell it all from far away. They know exactly where each one is.</p>
    <p>And even though they smelling all this, their nose don't get damaged. Don't get broke. Don't get confused.</p>
    <p>If they want to tell somebody else, want to explain what they smelling—they remember it perfect. Don't get it wrong."</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>This person's nose is purified—<br>
        In this world where we all live,<br>
        Whether fragrance, whether stinking,<br>
        Every kind of smell there is,</p>
        <p>Sumana and jāti flowers,<br>
        Tamāla, sandalwood as well,<br>
        Agarwood and cinnamon,<br>
        All kinds of fruit and flower smell,</p>
        <p>And they know the scent of beings—<br>
        Man scent, woman scent they find.<br>
        The dharma-speaker living distant<br>
        Smells the scent and knows their mind.</p>
        <p>Great wheel-turning kings and lesser,<br>
        Their sons and all the court inside,<br>
        Ministers and palace women—<br>
        By scent they know where they reside.</p>
        <p>The precious things adorning bodies,<br>
        Treasures buried in the ground,<br>
        The jewel-women of wheel-turners—<br>

        Clothing, beads and necklace-chains,<br>
        All the different ointments smeared—<br>
        By smell they know from whom it came.</p>
        <p>When heavenly beings walk or sit,<br>
        When they playing or they change their shape,<br>
        The one who holds this Lotus Sutra<br>
        Smelling knows, don't make mistake.</p>
        <p>The flowering and fruiting trees,<br>
        The butter-oil and ghee perfume—<br>
        The sutra-holder sitting here<br>
        Knows where everything's in bloom.</p>
        <p>In deep mountains, dangerous passes,<br>
        When sandalwood trees flower bright,<br>
        And beings dwelling in those places—<br>
        By smell they know them all on sight.</p>
        <p>In the Iron Ring Mountain, the great sea,<br>
        Underground where creatures dwell—<br>
        The sutra-holder, by the fragrance,<br>
        Knows exactly where they dwell.</p>
        <p>Asura men and women,<br>

        <p>In the wild and dangerous places,<br>
        Lions, elephants, tigers, wolves,<br>
        Buffalo and water-buffalo—<br>
        By smell they know where each one roams.</p>
        <p>If there's a woman pregnant,<br>
        Can't tell yet if it's girl or boy,<br>
        If it's no-gender or non-human—<br>
        By smell they know what she'll enjoy.</p>
        <p>By the power of smelling-knowledge,<br>
        They know the first time pregnancy take,<br>
        Whether it'll reach completion,<br>
        Whether she'll deliver safe, a blessed child she'll make.</p>
        <p>By the power of smelling-knowledge,<br>
        They know what men and women thinking—<br>
        Lustful thoughts or angry, foolish,<br>
        Or if they practicing virtue, not sinking.</p>
        <p>Underground where treasures hidden—<br>
        Gold and silver, precious stones,<br>
        Copper vessels holding riches—<br>
        By smell they find what's lying lone.</p>
        <p>All kinds of beads and necklaces<br>
        That nobody can price or measure—<br>
        By smell they know if they expensive,<br>
        Where they from, where hides the treasure.</p>
        <p>Heaven-flowers up above—<br>
        Mandārava, mañjūṣaka blooms,<br>
        The Pārijātaka tree—<br>
        By smell they know each flower's perfume.</p>
        <p>Heaven-palaces above,<br>
        Whether high or middle, whether low they fall,<br>
        Adorned with precious jewels and flowers—<br>
        By smell they know them, one and all.</p>
        <p>Heaven-gardens, splendid halls,<br>
        Fine pavilions, dharma towers standing tall,<br>
        Where beings sport and take their pleasure—<br>
        By smell they know it all.</p>
        <p>When heavenly beings listening to dharma,<br>
        When they enjoying the five desires complete,<br>
        Coming, going, walking, sitting, lying down—<br>
        By smell they know it all, concrete.</p>
        <p>The robes the heaven-women wearing,<br>
        Fine flowers, incense, ornaments so fair,<br>
        When they moving in their circle-dancing—<br>
        By smell they know it everywhere.</p>
        <p>Like this, turning, rising upward,<br>

        <p>Though they ain't yet got the Bodhisattva<br>
        No-outflow dharma-nature nose complete,<br>
        Still this sutra-holding person<br>
        First obtains this nose so sweet.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>TONGUE THAT TASTES HEAVEN</h3>
    <p>"Now again, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down—</p>
    <p>They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED tongue-merits.</p>
    <p>Whether it's good stuff or bad stuff, whether it's beautiful or whether it's ugly, whether it's delicious or whether it ain't—all the bitter and sour things—</p>
    <p>When they touch that person's tongue-root, it ALL TURNS INTO SUPREME FLAVOR.</p>
    <p>It tastes like heaven-nectar. Ain't nothing that don't taste good.</p>
    <p>And if they use their tongue to speak in a great assembly, they gonna bring forth a DEEP AND SUBTLE VOICE that enters people's hearts. Makes everybody joyful and delighted.</p>
    <p>And the heaven-sons and heaven-daughters—Indra, Brahmā, all the heaven-folk—when they hear this deep, subtle sound-voice speaking and teaching with its orderly words, they ALL COME TO LISTEN.</p>
    <p>And the dragons and dragon-daughters,<br>
    The yakṣas and yakṣa-daughters,<br>
    The gandharvas and gandharva-daughters,<br>
    The asuras and asura-daughters,<br>
    The garuḍas and garuḍa-daughters,<br>
    The kiṃnaras and kiṃnara-daughters,<br>
    The mahoragas and mahoraga-daughters—</p>
    <p>They all come near to listen to the dharma. Come close. Show respect. Make offerings.</p>
    <p>And the monks, the nuns, the laymen, the laywomen.</p>
    <p>Kings, princes, ministers, retinues.</p>
    <p>Small wheel-turning kings, great wheel-turning kings, their seven treasures and thousand sons, inner and outer attendants—</p>
    <p>They all ride up in their palace-carriages and come together to listen to the dharma.</p>
    <p>Why? Because this Bodhisattva speaks the dharma WELL.</p>
    <p>Brahmins, householders, people of the nation—all their life long, they stay close and make offerings.</p>

        Using parables and metaphors told loud,</p>

    <h3>BODY LIKE CRYSTAL MIRROR</h3>
    <p>"Now again, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down—</p>
    <p>They gonna get EIGHT HUNDRED body-merits.</p>
    <p>They gonna get a PURE BODY—pure like clean lapis lazuli, like crystal glass.</p>
    <p>Beings gonna LOVE to see a body like that.</p>
    <p>And because their body so pure, the whole three-thousand-world system gonna show up in it:</p>
    <p>When beings are born, when beings die,<br>
    Whether they born in good places or bad places,<br>
    Whether they high-quality or low-quality—</p>
    <p>It all appears in that body.</p>
    <p>And the Iron Ring Mountain, the Great Iron Ring Mountain, Mount Meru, Mahā-Meru Mountain, all the various mountains, and all the beings living in them—</p>
    <p>They all appear in that body.</p>
    <p>Down to Avīci hell, up to the Peak of Existence, all the places and all the beings—</p>
    <p>They all appear in that body.</p>
    <p>When the śrāvakas, the pratyekabuddhas, the Bodhisattvas, the Buddhas are teaching dharma—</p>
    <p>They all appear in that body, showing their form and features."</p>
    <h3>END OF CHAPTER NINETEEN: WHEN YOUR SENSES WAKE UP</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This chapter is about TRANSFIGURATION OF THE SENSES. It ain't talking about gaining supernatural powers that separate you from ordinary life—it's talking about what happens when ordinary perception gets purified by holding the truth.</p>
        <p>The blues has always known this: When you see clear, you see EVERYTHING. When you hear true, you hear EVERY VOICE—the suffering and the joy all mixed together. When you taste life after you've tasted grace, even the bitter turns to something you can swallow.</p>
        <p>This chapter saying: The dharma don't take you OUT of the body—it wakes the body UP. It makes your eyes into telescopes, your ears into receivers, your nose into a compass, your tongue into a bell, your body into a mirror, your mind into a lamp.</p>
        <p>You still using what your mama gave you. You still got the same flesh-and-blood senses you was born with. But now they PURIFIED. Now they AWAKE. Now they tell you the truth about what's really going on in this whole vast world.</p>
        <p>And that's the merit—that's the blessing—that comes from HOLDING this sutra. From reading it, reciting it, explaining it, writing it down. From CARRYING this truth in your body and your life.</p>
        <p>You want to see the whole world? You want to hear every voice? You want to know what folks are thinking, want to speak words that enter hearts, want your very body to become a mirror of all creation?</p>
        <p>Then hold this dharma. Hold it close. Hold it true.</p>
        <p>And your senses gonna wake up and tell you what's real.</p>
