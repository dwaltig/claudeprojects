    <h1>CHAPTER SIX: THE NAMING</h1>
    <h2>(When the Teacher Calls Out Who You're Gonna Be)</h2>

    <p>Now when the World-Honored One finished singing that verse, he turned to all the folks gathered round and he said it loud and clear:</p>
    <p>"I got something to tell you about this disciple of mine, Mahākāśyapa. I see him. I see who he's gonna be. In the world that's coming, he gonna meet three hundred million billion Buddhas. Three hundred million billion! He gonna serve them, honor them, respect them, praise them. He gonna spread the boundless teaching far and wide. And then—you hear me now—in his very last body, he gonna become a Buddha himself.</p>
    <p>"His name gonna be Light Brightness Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed Guide, the Tamer of Hearts, the Teacher of Gods and Human Folk, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.</p>
    <p>"His world gonna be called Light and Virtue. The age gonna be called Great Majesty. That Buddha gonna live twelve small ages. The true Dharma gonna stand for twenty small ages, and the reflected Dharma gonna stand another twenty.</p>
    <p>"And let me tell you about that land: It gonna be beautiful. No filth, no rubble, no thorns, no waste. That ground gonna be level—no hills, no valleys, no pits, no bumps. The ground gonna be made of lapis lazuli, and treasure trees gonna stand in rows. Golden ropes gonna mark the boundaries of the roads, and precious flowers gonna be scattered everywhere. That whole land gonna be clean, clean, clean.</p>
    <p>"In that country, there gonna be countless thousands of billions of bodhisattvas. The voice-hearers gonna be beyond counting too. There won't be no trouble from demons—though demons and demon-folk will be there, they all gonna protect the Buddha's teaching."</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>I'm telling you monks here,<br>
        I'm telling you what I see with my Buddha-eye—<br>
        I see Kassapa clear,<br>
        I see where he's going by and by.</p>
        <p>After ages beyond counting,<br>
        He gonna become a Buddha too.<br>
        In the world that's coming,<br>
        He gonna serve and honor what's true—</p>
        <p>Three hundred million billion Buddhas,<br>
        World-Honored Ones every one.<br>
        For the sake of Buddha-wisdom,<br>
        That pure holy life gonna be done.</p>
        <p>After serving the highest,<br>
        The Two-Footed Honored Ones,<br>
        After learning all wisdom,<br>
        The unsurpassed wisdom that comes—</p>
        <p>In his very last body,<br>
        He gonna become a Buddha at last.<br>
        That land gonna be pure and holy,<br>
        Lapis lazuli ground stretched vast.</p>
        <p>Many treasure trees standing,<br>
        All lined up along the road,<br>
        Golden ropes dividing,<br>
        Joy in everyone who beholds.</p>
        <p>Sweet fragrance always rising,<br>
        Flowers of every name scattered round,<br>
        All manner of wonders surprising,<br>
        Making that whole land renowned.</p>
        <p>That ground gonna be level,<br>
        No hills and no pits to see.<br>
        Bodhisattvas beyond measure,<br>
        More than you could count, more than could be—</p>
        <p>Their hearts gonna be gentle,<br>
        They gonna have mighty spiritual power,<br>
        Holding to the Buddha-teaching central,<br>
        The Great Vehicle every hour.</p>
        <p>Voice-hearers beyond counting,<br>
        In their final flawless frame,<br>
        Sons and daughters of the Dharma-King mounting,<br>
        More than you could name—</p>
        <p>Even with the eye of heaven<br>
        You couldn't count them all.<br>
        That Buddha gonna live eleven,<br>
        Twelve small ages standing tall.</p>
        <p>The true Dharma gonna last<br>
        Twenty small ages true,<br>
        The reflected Dharma past<br>
        Twenty small ages too.</p>
        <p>Light Brightness, World-Honored One—<br>
        This is how it's gonna be done.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Now at that time, Mahāmaudgalyāyana and Subhūti and Mahākātyāyana, they all started trembling. They put their palms together and they looked up at the Honored One's face and they couldn't take their eyes away. And together, with one voice, they sang out in verse:</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>Great Hero, World-Honored One,<br>
        Dharma-King of all Śākya's line,<br>
        Have mercy on us, every one,<br>
        And give us that Buddha-voice divine.</p>
        <p>If you know what's in our deep heart,<br>
        If you see us and call our name,<br>
        It'll be like cool water when the heat departs,<br>
        Like sweet dew putting out the flame.</p>
        <p>Like a man from a hungry land<br>
        Who suddenly sees a royal feast—<br>
        His heart still scared to understand,<br>
        Still afraid, to say the least.</p>
        <p>He don't dare just eat right away,<br>
        Not till the king himself says "Come."<br>
        Then and only then, that day,<br>
        He knows it's safe and he ain't dumb.</p>
        <p>We're just like that, you know—<br>
        We been thinking about our small-vehicle mistake.<br>
        We don't know how we gonna go<br>
        And get that Buddha-wisdom for wisdom's sake.</p>
        <p>We heard you say with your Buddha-voice<br>
        That we all gonna become Buddhas too,<br>
        But our hearts still scared to rejoice,<br>
        Still afraid it ain't really true.</p>
        <p>But if you name us, if you call our name,<br>
        If you give us that prophecy—<br>
        Then we gonna be happy, and ain't no shame,<br>
        Then we gonna rest easy.</p>
        <p>Great Hero, World-Honored One,<br>
        You always trying to give the world peace—<br>
        Please give us that naming, every one,<br>
        Like a hungry man needs to feast.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Now the World-Honored One, he knew what was in his great disciples' hearts, and he turned to all the monks and said:</p>
    <p>"This Subhūti here—in the world that's coming, he gonna meet and serve three hundred million billion nayuta Buddhas. He gonna serve them, honor them, respect them, praise them. He gonna practice that pure holy life always. He gonna complete the bodhisattva way. And then in his very last body, he gonna become a Buddha.</p>
    <p>"His name gonna be Fame Mark Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed Guide, the Tamer of Hearts, the Teacher of Gods and Human Folk, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.</p>
    <p>"The age gonna be called Having Treasure. The world gonna be called Treasure Born.</p>
    <p>"That land gonna be level, with crystal for the ground. Treasure trees gonna make it beautiful. No hills, no pits, no sand, no gravel, no thorns, no filth. Precious flowers gonna cover the ground, clean all over. The people of that land gonna live in jeweled pavilions, in wonderful towers and terraces.</p>
    <p>"The voice-hearer disciples gonna be beyond measure, beyond counting—you couldn't calculate them with numbers or comparisons. The bodhisattvas gonna number in the countless thousands of millions of billions of nayutas.</p>
    <p>"That Buddha gonna live twelve small ages. The true Dharma gonna stand twenty small ages, and the reflected Dharma gonna stand another twenty.</p>
    <p>"That Buddha gonna dwell always in emptiness, teaching the Dharma to the assembly, liberating countless bodhisattvas and voice-hearers."</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>You monks gathered here,<br>
        I'm telling you now,<br>
        Listen with your whole heart clear,<br>
        Hear what I'm gonna avow.</p>
        <p>My great disciple here,<br>
        Subhūti, this one—<br>
        He gonna become a Buddha, it's clear,<br>
        His name gonna be Fame Mark, the Honored One.</p>
        <p>He gonna serve countless,<br>
        Millions and billions of Buddhas every one,<br>
        Following where each Buddha goes,<br>
        Step by step till the great way is done.</p>
        <p>In his very last body earned,<br>
        The thirty-two marks gonna be his,<br>
        Handsome and beautiful, we learned,<br>
        Like a treasure mountain is.</p>
        <p>That Buddha's land gonna be<br>
        The purest and the best,<br>
        And everyone who comes to see<br>
        Gonna love it, gonna be blessed.</p>
        <p>That Buddha in the middle there<br>
        Gonna liberate countless souls.<br>
        In that Buddha's teaching, everywhere,<br>
        Many bodhisattvas gonna fill the roles—</p>
        <p>All of them sharp and keen,<br>
        Turning the wheel that don't turn back.<br>
        That country always gonna be seen<br>
        Full of bodhisattvas, nothing lack.</p>
        <p>Voice-hearers beyond all count,<br>
        All perfected in the threefold knowledge,<br>
        The six spiritual powers paramount,<br>
        Dwelling in the eightfold liberation's privilege.</p>
        <p>That Buddha's teaching gonna be<br>
        A display of boundless power,<br>
        Spiritual transformations you gotta see,<br>
        Beyond thought every hour.</p>
        <p>Gods and human folk there<br>
        Countless as the Ganges sand,<br>
        All with their palms together,<br>
        Listening to the Buddha's word firsthand.</p>
        <p>That Buddha gonna live, we're told,<br>
        Twelve small ages long.<br>
        True Dharma twenty ages old,<br>
        Reflected Dharma twenty ages strong.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Then the World-Honored One turned again to the assembly and said:</p>
    <p>"Now I'm telling you about this Great Kātyāyana here. In the world that's coming, he gonna serve and honor eight thousand billion Buddhas with all manner of offerings. He gonna respect them, revere them.</p>
    <p>"After each of those Buddhas passes on, he gonna build them a stupa—a thousand yojanas high, five hundred yojanas wide and deep, all perfectly square. He gonna make them out of gold and silver and lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl and agate and pearl and rose quartz—all seven precious things combined. He gonna offer to those stupas flowers and garlands, ointments and incense powders and burning incense, silk canopies and banners.</p>
    <p>"After that's done, he gonna serve another twenty million billion Buddhas, just the same way.</p>
    <p>"After serving all those Buddhas, after completing the bodhisattva way, he gonna become a Buddha himself.</p>
    <p>"His name gonna be Jambū River Gold Light Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed Guide, the Tamer of Hearts, the Teacher of Gods and Human Folk, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.</p>
    <p>"That land gonna be level, with crystal for the ground. Treasure trees gonna make it beautiful. Golden ropes gonna mark the roads. Wonderful flowers gonna cover the ground, clean all over, and everyone who sees it gonna rejoice.</p>
    <p>"There won't be no four evil paths there—no hell, no hungry ghosts, no animals, no fighting demons. There gonna be many gods and many human folk, many voice-hearers and many bodhisattvas—countless millions and billions beautifying that land.</p>
    <p>"That Buddha gonna live twelve small ages. The true Dharma gonna stand twenty small ages, and the reflected Dharma gonna stand another twenty."</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>All you monks here,<br>
        Listen with one heart,<br>
        What I'm saying is true and clear,<br>
        Ain't no false part.</p>
        <p>This Kātyāyana here,<br>
        He gonna serve with all kinds of<br>
        Beautiful offerings sincere<br>
        All the Buddhas above.</p>
        <p>After those Buddhas gone,<br>
        He gonna raise up seven-jeweled towers,<br>
        He gonna offer flowers and incense on<br>
        Those relics for hours and hours.</p>
        <p>In his very last frame,<br>
        He gonna gain the Buddha-wisdom complete,<br>
        The perfect awakening by name.<br>
        That land gonna be pure and sweet,</p>
        <p>Liberating countless souls,<br>
        Millions and billions set free,<br>
        All the ten directions' goals—<br>
        They gonna honor him, you see.</p>
        <p>That Buddha's light gonna be<br>
        Unmatched, can't be outdone.<br>
        That Buddha's name gonna be<br>
        Jambū River Gold Light, the Honored One.</p>
        <p>Bodhisattvas and voice-hearers there,<br>
        All existence cut through and done—<br>
        Countless, beyond compare,<br>
        Beautifying that land, every one.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Then the World-Honored One turned once more to the great assembly and said:</p>
    <p>"Now I'm telling you about Great Maudgalyāyana here. He gonna serve eight thousand Buddhas with all manner of offerings, honoring them, revering them.</p>
    <p>"After each of those Buddhas passes on, he gonna build them a stupa—a thousand yojanas high, five hundred yojanas wide and deep, all perfectly square. He gonna make them out of gold and silver and lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl and agate and pearl and rose quartz—all seven precious things combined. He gonna offer to those stupas flowers and garlands, ointments and incense powders and burning incense, silk canopies and banners.</p>
    <p>"After that's done, he gonna serve another two hundred million billion Buddhas, just the same way.</p>
    <p>"Then he gonna become a Buddha himself.</p>
    <p>"His name gonna be Tamāla Sandalwood Fragrance Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened, the One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, the Well-Gone, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassed Guide, the Tamer of Hearts, the Teacher of Gods and Human Folk, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.</p>
    <p>"The age gonna be called Joy Fulfilled. The world gonna be called Delightful.</p>
    <p>"That land gonna be level, with crystal for the ground. Treasure trees gonna make it beautiful. Pearls gonna be scattered like flowers, clean all over, and everyone who sees it gonna rejoice.</p>
    <p>"There gonna be many gods and many human folk, many bodhisattvas and many voice-hearers, beyond all counting.</p>
    <p>"That Buddha gonna live twenty-four small ages. The true Dharma gonna stand forty small ages, and the reflected Dharma gonna stand another forty."</p>

    <div class="verse">
        <p>This disciple of mine here,<br>
        Great Maudgalyāyana by name—<br>
        When he sheds this body, it's clear,<br>
        He gonna see eighty-two hundred million</p>
        <p>Buddhas, World-Honored Ones.<br>
        For the sake of the Buddha-way, you understand,<br>
        He gonna serve with honor, every one,<br>
        Everything that the teaching demands.</p>
        <p>In the presence of all those Buddhas there,<br>
        He gonna practice that pure life holy,<br>
        For countless ages everywhere<br>
        He gonna uphold the Buddha-Dharma solely.</p>
        <p>After those Buddhas passed away,<br>
        He gonna raise up seven-jeweled towers,<br>
        Long poles with golden banners to display,<br>
        Offerings of music, incense, and flowers</p>
        <p>To honor all those Buddha-stupas high.<br>
        Step by step completing, you can tell,<br>
        The bodhisattva way by and by,<br>
        In the land called Delightful he gonna dwell.</p>
        <p>There he gonna become a Buddha true,<br>
        Called Tamāla Sandalwood Fragrance by name.<br>
        That Buddha's life—I'm telling you—<br>
        Twenty-four ages, that's his claim.</p>
        <p>Always for gods and human folk<br>
        Teaching the Buddha-way profound.<br>
        Voice-hearers beyond what could be spoke,<br>
        Like Ganges River sands, that's how they're found—</p>
        <p>All perfected in the threefold sight,<br>
        The six spiritual powers theirs to claim,<br>
        Having great majestic might.<br>
        Bodhisattvas you can't number or name,</p>
        <p>Their will set firm, their effort strong,<br>
        In Buddha-wisdom never turning back.<br>
        After that Buddha's gone,<br>
        True Dharma gonna stand—ain't nothing it lack—</p>
        <p>Forty small ages long,<br>
        Reflected Dharma just the same.<br>
        My disciples, healthy and strong,<br>
        Five hundred of them I'm gonna name—</p>
        <p>All of them I'm gonna call,<br>
        In the world that's coming they gonna be<br>
        Buddhas, every one and all.<br>
        Me and you, this company—</p>
        <p>We got causes from way back when,<br>
        From ancient lifetimes, you and me.<br>
        What I'm about to tell you then,<br>
        You listen good, you gonna see.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>END OF CHAPTER SIX: THE NAMING</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This chapter is all about <strong>being seen and being named</strong>—one of the most powerful acts in any tradition. The Buddha is saying: "I see you. I know who you are. And I'm gonna tell you who you're going to become."</p>
        <p><strong>Key Metaphors and Choices:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"The Naming" as the chapter title</strong> - In blues and gospel traditions, naming carries profound power. To be named is to be called into existence, to have your destiny spoken aloud. The Buddha isn't just predicting; he's recognizing and affirming who these disciples already are and will be.</li>
            <li><strong>"I see him clear, I see where he's going by and by"</strong> - The blues has always been about seeing clearly, about truth-telling. The Buddha's vision isn't mystical abstraction; it's recognition, the way a master bluesman sees the music in a young player.</li>
            <li><strong>The disciples' request: "Like a hungry man needs to feast"</strong> - They use this metaphor themselves in the Chinese text. The hunger for recognition, for validation, for being seen—this is human hunger at its deepest. They're saying: "We heard you say it, but we're still scared to believe it. We need you to say our names."</li>
            <li><strong>Each prophecy's details matter</strong> - The specifics aren't filler. Each Buddha-name, each world-name, each measurement tells these disciples: "This is real. This is particular. This is YOUR future, not just anybody's." That's why I kept the details—the twelve ages, the twenty ages, the crystal ground, the jeweled towers. Particularity is how love speaks.</li>
            <li><strong>"In his very last body"</strong> - This phrase recurs like a refrain, like the turn in a blues verse. It marks the culmination, the arrival, the moment when all that walking finally gets you home.</li>
            <li><strong>The Buddha's epithets</strong> - I kept the full tenfold list for each Buddha-to-be because in oral tradition, repetition isn't redundancy—it's respect, it's rhythm, it's the way you mark something sacred.</li>
        </ul>
