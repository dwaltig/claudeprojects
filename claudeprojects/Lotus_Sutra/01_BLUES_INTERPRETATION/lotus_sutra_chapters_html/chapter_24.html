    <h1>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR: WONDERFUL SOUND BODHISATTVA</h1>
    <h2>A Blues Translation from the Classical Chinese</h2>

    <h3>THE SIGNAL ACROSS THE DISTANCE</h3>
    <p>Now listen here. The Buddha Śākyamuni, he let loose a light—<br>
    not just any light, but the light from the mark between his eyes,<br>
    that white hair curl that shines like truth itself,<br>
    and the light from the crown of his head, that bump of wisdom.<br>
    And that light, it didn't just shine local, you understand,<br>
    it went traveling east across one hundred and eight million billion<br>
        countless worlds,<br>
    crossing distances that ain't got no names,<br>
    reaching further than numbers can count,<br>
    further than the mind can follow.</p>
    <p>That light traveled and traveled until it reached a world<br>
    called Pure Light Adorned,<br>
    and in that world there was a Buddha named<br>
    Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Tathāgata—<br>
    all them ten names: the One Who Comes, the Worthy One,<br>
    the Perfectly Awakened, the one who knows and walks right,<br>
    the one who went well, the one who understands this world,<br>
    the supreme one, the tamer of beings,<br>
    teacher of gods and humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.<br>
    And he was teaching countless bodhisattvas,<br>
    all them beings gathered round respectful,<br>
    and Śākyamuni's white light came flooding through that world.</p>

    <h3>THE CALL</h3>
    <p>Now in that Pure Light Adorned world,<br>
    there was a bodhisattva named Wonderful Sound—<br>
    and brother, that name ain't just decoration.<br>
    He'd been planting good roots for a long, long time,<br>
    serving and learning from countless hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhas,<br>
    and he'd achieved deep wisdom, you hear me?<br>
    He had samādhi like you wouldn't believe:<br>
    the Wonderful Banner samādhi, the Lotus Flower samādhi,<br>
    the Pure Virtue samādhi, the Constellation King Play samādhi,<br>
    the samādhi of No Conditions, the Wisdom Seal samādhi,<br>
    the samādhi that understands every language every being speaks,<br>
    the samādhi that gathers all merit together,<br>
    the Pure samādhi, the Spiritual Powers Play samādhi,<br>
    the Wisdom Torch samādhi, the Adorning King samādhi,<br>
    the Pure Light samādhi, the Pure Storehouse samādhi,<br>
    the Uncommon samādhi, the Sun Rotation samādhi—<br>
    hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of samādhis<br>
    like grains of sand in the Ganges River.</p>
    <p>And when Śākyamuni Buddha's light touched his body,<br>
    Wonderful Sound felt it.<br>
    He felt that call reaching across all them worlds.<br>
    And he turned to his own Buddha, Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom,<br>
    and he said: "World-Honored One,<br>
    I got to go to that Saha world.<br>
    I got to pay my respects to Śākyamuni Buddha,<br>
    I got to draw near and make offerings.<br>
    I got to see Mañjuśrī, that Dharma Prince,<br>
    and Medicine King Bodhisattva, and Brave Giving Bodhisattva,<br>
    and Constellation King Flower Bodhisattva,<br>
    and Superior Practice Bodhisattva, and Adorning King Bodhisattva,<br>
    and Superior Medicine Bodhisattva.<br>
    I got to go, Lord. That light is calling me."</p>

    <h3>THE WARNING</h3>
    <p>Now Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha,<br>
    he looked at Wonderful Sound with love and concern,<br>
    and he said: "Son, don't you look down on that world.<br>
    Don't you go developing no inferior thoughts about it.<br>
    Good man, listen to me:<br>
    that Saha world, it's rough.<br>
    It ain't level—it's got high places and low places,<br>
    mountains of dirt and stone,<br>
    filled up with pollution and trouble.<br>
    The Buddha there, his body looks small.<br>
    The bodhisattvas there, their forms look small too.<br>
    But you, your body is forty-two thousand yojanas tall.<br>
    Me, my body is six million eight hundred thousand yojanas tall.<br>
    Your body is beautiful, you understand—<br>
    adorned with hundreds of thousands of millions of blessings,<br>
    your light especially wonderful.<br>
    So when you go—don't you look down on that country,<br>
    don't you look down on that Buddha or them bodhisattvas,<br>
    don't you look down on that land and develop inferior thoughts."</p>

    <h3>THE PILGRIM'S FAITH</h3>
    <p>Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva, he bowed to his Buddha and said:<br>
    "World-Honored One, when I go to that Saha world,<br>
    it's all the Tathāgata's power that sends me.<br>
    It's the Tathāgata's spiritual powers at play.<br>
    It's the Tathāgata's merit, wisdom, and adornment<br>
    that makes this journey possible.<br>
    I ain't going on my own strength, Lord.<br>
    This is all you."</p>

    <h3>TRAVELING WITHOUT MOVING</h3>
    <p>And then, right there,<br>
    Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva didn't rise from his seat.<br>
    His body didn't shake, didn't move.<br>
    But he entered into samādhi,<br>
    and by the power of that samādhi,<br>
    over there at Vulture Peak Mountain,<br>
    not far from where the Buddha was sitting on his Dharma seat,<br>
    there appeared eighty-four thousand jeweled lotus flowers—<br>
    gold from the Jambu River for the stems,<br>
    white silver for the leaves,<br>
    diamond for the stamens,<br>
    and manikya jewels for the platforms.</p>
    <p>You see, he sent his calling card ahead.<br>
    He announced himself through beauty.<br>
    The flowers arrived before the man,<br>
    preparing the way.</p>

    <h3>THE QUESTION</h3>
    <p>Now Mañjuśrī, that Dharma Prince,<br>
    he saw them lotus flowers appear,<br>
    and he said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One,<br>
    what's the cause and condition for this?<br>
    Why we seeing this auspicious sign first—<br>
    all these thousands and tens of thousands of lotus flowers,<br>
    gold stems and silver leaves,<br>
    diamond stamens and jewel platforms?"</p>
    <p>And Śākyamuni Buddha told Mañjuśrī:<br>
    "This is Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva Mahasattva.<br>
    He wants to come from Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha's country,<br>
    bringing eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas with him,<br>
    coming here to this Saha world<br>
    to make offerings to me, to draw near, to pay respects,<br>
    and also to make offerings to and hear the Lotus Sutra."</p>

    <h3>THE DESIRE TO SEE</h3>
    <p>Mañjuśrī said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One,<br>
    what good roots did this bodhisattva plant?<br>
    What merit did he cultivate<br>
    that he got this kind of great spiritual power?<br>
    What samādhi does he practice?<br>
    Please tell us the name of this samādhi—<br>
    we want to practice it diligently too.<br>
    By practicing this samādhi,<br>
    we'll be able to see this bodhisattva's form and appearance,<br>
    large or small, his bearing and deportment, his way of moving.<br>
    We pray that the World-Honored One, by your spiritual power,<br>
    will let that bodhisattva come so we can see him."</p>
    <p>Śākyamuni Buddha told Mañjuśrī:<br>
    "That Tathāgata who passed into extinction long ago, Many Treasures,<br>
    he'll make this happen for you,<br>
    he'll show you what you need to see."</p>

    <h3>THE INVITATION</h3>
    <p>And Many Treasures Buddha, from inside that treasure tower,<br>
    he called out to that bodhisattva:<br>
    "Good man, come on!<br>
    Mañjuśrī, that Dharma Prince, he wants to see you."</p>

    <h3>THE ARRIVAL</h3>
    <p>And right then, Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva,<br>
    he vanished from that other country,<br>
    and he set out with eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas together.<br>
    And in every country they passed through,<br>
    the earth shook six ways—<br>
    it trembled and quaked, it swayed and rocked,<br>
    it pounded and crashed.<br>
    And in every place, seven-jeweled lotus flowers rained down,<br>
    and hundreds of thousands of heavenly music<br>
    started playing without nobody touching them—<br>
    instruments sounding all by themselves,<br>
    heaven itself making music for this pilgrim.</p>
    <p>And this bodhisattva—<br>
    his eyes were like the leaves of great blue lotus flowers,<br>
    and even if you combined the beauty of a hundred thousand million moons,<br>
    his face was more perfect than that.<br>
    His body was the color of true gold,<br>
    adorned with countless hundreds of thousands of merits,<br>
    his awesome virtue blazing,<br>
    his light shining and glowing,<br>
    all his marks complete,<br>
    his body strong and firm like Narayana's adamantine body.</p>
    <p>He entered a seven-jeweled platform<br>
    that rose up into space,<br>
    seven tala trees high above the ground.<br>
    And surrounded respectfully by all them bodhisattvas,<br>
    he came to this Saha world,<br>
    to Vulture Peak Mountain.</p>

    <h3>THE OFFERING AND THE QUESTIONS</h3>
    <p>When he arrived, he came down from that seven-jeweled platform,<br>
    and he took necklaces worth hundreds of thousands<br>
    and went to where Śākyamuni Buddha was.<br>
    He bowed his head to the Buddha's feet,<br>
    he offered up them necklaces,<br>
    and he said: "World-Honored One,<br>
    Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha<br>
    sends his greetings to the World-Honored One.<br>
    He asks: Are you free from illness and troubles?<br>
    Are you dwelling at ease?<br>
    Are you able to move about lightly?<br>
    Are you practicing joyfully?<br>
    Are the four elements in harmony?<br>
    Are worldly affairs bearable?<br>
    Are living beings easy to save?<br>
    Are they without much greed, anger, ignorance, jealousy, and stinginess?<br>
    Are they without disrespect to parents, without disrespect to monks,<br>
    without wrong views, without unwholesome minds,<br>
    without failure to control the five sense faculties?<br>
    World-Honored One, are living beings able to conquer<br>
        the demon enemies?<br>
    And Many Treasures Tathāgata, who passed into extinction long ago—<br>
    is he in that seven-jeweled tower, coming to hear the Dharma?<br>
    My Buddha also sends greetings to Many Treasures Tathāgata:<br>
    Is he peaceful and free from troubles?<br>
    Can he endure and remain long?<br>
    World-Honored One, I want now to see Many Treasures Buddha's body.<br>
    I pray the World-Honored One will show him to me."</p>
    <p>And Śākyamuni Buddha spoke to Many Treasures Buddha:<br>
    "This Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva wants to see you."</p>
    <p>And Many Treasures Buddha told Wonderful Sound:<br>
    "Excellent, excellent!<br>
    You've come here to make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha,<br>
    to hear the Lotus Flower Sutra,<br>
    and to see Mañjuśrī and the others.<br>
    This is good, good."</p>

    <h3>THE PAST CAUSE</h3>
    <p>Now Flower Virtue Bodhisattva, he asked the Buddha:<br>
    "World-Honored One, what good roots did Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva plant?<br>
    What merit did he cultivate that he got this spiritual power?"</p>
    <p>The Buddha told Flower Virtue Bodhisattva:<br>
    "In the past, there was a Buddha named<br>
    Cloud Thunder Sound King Tathāgata, Arhat,<br>
        Perfectly Enlightened One.<br>
    His country was called Manifesting All Worlds.<br>
    The kalpa was called Joyfully Seen.<br>
    Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva, for twelve thousand years,<br>
    he made offerings to Cloud Thunder Sound King Buddha<br>
    with a hundred thousand kinds of music,<br>
    and he also presented eighty-four thousand seven-jeweled bowls.<br>
    Because of this cause and condition, this karmic result,<br>
    he's now born in Pure Flower Constellation King Wisdom Buddha's country,<br>
    and he has this spiritual power.</p>
    <p>Flower Virtue, what do you think?<br>
    That Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva back then,<br>
    who made offerings with music and presented jeweled vessels<br>
        to Cloud Thunder Sound King Buddha—<br>
    was that somebody else?<br>
    No, that was this Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva Mahasattva right here.</p>
    <p>Flower Virtue, this Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva<br>
    has already made offerings to and drawn near countless Buddhas.<br>
    He's been planting roots of virtue for a long, long time.<br>
    And he's met hundreds of thousands of millions of billions<br>
        of countless Buddhas,<br>
    as many as grains of sand in the Ganges River."</p>

    <h3>THE POWER TO MANIFEST IN ALL FORMS</h3>
    <p>"Flower Virtue, you just seeing Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva's body here,<br>
    but this bodhisattva, he manifests all kinds of bodies,<br>
    appearing everywhere to teach this sutra to all living beings.</p>
    <p>Sometimes he manifests as Brahma King,<br>
    sometimes as Shakra,<br>
    sometimes as Ishvara Deva,<br>
    sometimes as Mahesvara Deva,<br>
    sometimes as a great heavenly general,<br>
    sometimes as Vaishravana Heavenly King,<br>
    sometimes as a wheel-turning sage king,<br>
    sometimes as various lesser kings,<br>
    sometimes as an elder,<br>
    sometimes as a householder,<br>
    sometimes as a chief minister,<br>
    sometimes as a brahman,<br>
    sometimes as a bhikshu, bhikshuni, upasaka, or upasika,<br>
    sometimes as an elder or householder's wife,<br>
    sometimes as a chief minister's wife,<br>
    sometimes as a brahman woman,<br>
    sometimes as a boy or girl,<br>
    sometimes as a deva, dragon, yaksha, gandharva,<br>
    asura, garuda, kinnara, mahoraga,<br>
    human or nonhuman being—<br>
    and in all these forms, he teaches this sutra.</p>
    <p>To those in the hells, the hungry ghosts, the animals,<br>
    and all the difficult places—he can bring salvation.<br>
    Even in the inner palaces of kings,<br>
    he transforms into a woman's body to teach this sutra."</p>

    <h3>THE SCOPE OF THE WORK</h3>
    <p>"Flower Virtue, this Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva<br>
    can protect and save all living beings in the Saha world.<br>
    This Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva manifests and transforms like this,</p>
    <h3>END OF CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR: WONDERFUL SOUND BODHISATTVA</h3>
    <div class="translator-note">
        <h3>TRANSLATION NOTES:</h3>
        <p>This chapter is a pilgrimage story—a narrative about answering a call, making a sacred journey, and returning home transformed and transformative. It's structured like a classic hero's journey, but the hero here is already enlightened. He ain't going to learn something; he's going to witness something and to serve.</p>
        <p><strong>The Warning About Looking Down:</strong> The Buddha's warning to Wonderful Sound not to look down on the "rough" Saha world is a crucial teaching on respect and not confusing appearance with essence. The Saha world may look small and troubled, but it's where the work is, where beings need saving.</p>
        <p><strong>Traveling Without Moving:</strong> Wonderful Sound doesn't physically leave his seat but enters samādhi, and by that power, he appears at Vulture Peak. This is a teaching on the nature of spiritual travel and the power of a concentrated mind to transcend physical distance.</p>
        <p><strong>The Power to Manifest in All Forms:</strong> The heart of this chapter is the list of forms that Wonderful Sound can take to teach the Dharma. He becomes whatever form people need to see in order to hear the teaching. This is radical adaptability in the service of truth, the ultimate expression of skillful means. The samādhi that allows this is called "Manifesting All Bodies."</p>
        <p>The chapter follows the classic structure of a spiritual journey: The call is heard, the journey is made in faith, respect is paid, the teaching is received and given, and the pilgrim returns to share the fruits of the journey, transforming others in the process.</p>
