This chapter is about viral transmission before there was such a thing—about how truth spreads from person to person like fire, like news, like a song everybody needs to hear. The Buddha's teaching here is mathematical and mystical at once: merit doesn't just add, it MULTIPLIES. It grows exponentially with each telling.

The shocking comparison is the heart of it: the greatest material generosity in the universe (giving everything to everyone for eighty years PLUS leading them all to Arhat-hood) is LESS than the merit of the fiftieth person who just heard a verse and felt joy. Why? Because the Lotus Sutra itself IS the teaching that leads to Buddhahood—not just to Arhat-hood. It's the higher truth, the bigger vehicle. One verse of it carries more potential than all the arhats in all the worlds.

And notice the progression of blessings:
- Just show up to listen → you get treasure in the next life
- Give someone a seat → you get a throne in the next life
- Invite someone to come hear it → you get a beautiful body and you meet Buddhas forever

The "beautiful mouth" passage is profound: the mouth that speaks Dharma becomes beautiful because it's doing what mouths were made for—speaking truth, passing on liberation. Form follows function. The body that serves the teaching becomes perfected by that service.

This is word-of-mouth gospel. This is "each one teach one." This is the mathematics of grace: one person tells one person tells one person, and fifty tellings later, the last person in the chain has more blessing than the richest philanthropist who ever lived.

Pass it on.
