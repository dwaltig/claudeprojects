This chapter is survival wisdom for spiritual teachers in corrupt times. The Buddha ain't talking theory here—he's giving practical instructions for how to keep your soul clean when the world's gone wrong.

The four practices are like concentric circles of protection:
1. Your inner ground (patience, non-grasping, seeing clearly)
2. Your outer associations (who you don't run with, what you don't do)
3. Your speech and heart (how you talk, what you hold inside)
4. Your ultimate compassion (even for those who reject you)

The crown jewel parable is central: The Lotus Sutra is what the Buddha held back until his spiritual warriors had proven themselves, until they'd fought through their own demons and poisons. It's the final gift, the supreme teaching, given only when folks are ready.

And the beautiful dreams at the end—that's confirmation. That's how you know you're on the right path. When you hold this teaching right, it holds you back. You walk protected. Your dreams become prophecies. Even sleep becomes teaching.

This is practical mysticism. This is how you teach the highest truth in the lowest times without becoming what you're fighting against.
