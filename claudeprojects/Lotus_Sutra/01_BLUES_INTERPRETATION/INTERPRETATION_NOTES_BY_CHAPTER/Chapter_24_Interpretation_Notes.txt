This chapter is a pilgrimage story—a narrative about answering a call, making a sacred journey, and returning home transformed and transformative. It's structured like a classic hero's journey, but the hero here is already enlightened. He ain't going to learn something; he's going to witness something and to serve.

THE SIGNAL ACROSS IMPOSSIBLE DISTANCES

The chapter opens with light traveling across "one hundred and eight million billion countless worlds"—a distance that breaks mathematics, that breaks imagination. This ain't a metaphor for "far away." This is genuinely unimaginable distance. And yet the light reaches. The signal gets through.

In blues and gospel terms, this is the call that comes from beyond—the call that reaches you no matter how far you think you are from the source. It's the voice that speaks across every barrier, every distance, every separation. When God calls, when truth calls, when the Dharma calls—ain't no distance too far for that signal to reach you.

Wonderful Sound feels that light touch him, and he knows immediately: "I got to go." That's the nature of a real call. You don't have to study on it. You don't have to think it through. You feel it in your body, and you know.

THE WARNING ABOUT LOOKING DOWN

The Buddha's warning is crucial: "Don't look down on that world." Because Wonderful Sound is forty-two thousand yojanas tall (that's about 160,000 miles), his own Buddha is six million eight hundred thousand yojanas tall (about 26 million miles), and Shakyamuni Buddha's body in our world looks "small." The world itself is "rough, uneven, filled with dirt and stone mountains and pollution."

This is a teaching about respect. About not confusing appearance with essence. About not letting where you come from make you disrespect where you going.

Every person who's ever left their neighborhood and came back educated, who's ever made it out and returned, who's ever risen up and had to go back down—this teaching is for you. Don't look down. Don't develop inferior thoughts about people or places just because they look smaller, rougher, poorer than where you are now.

The Saha world—this world right here—it looks small and troubled from a distance. But that's where the work is. That's where beings need saving. That's where the Dharma needs teaching.

TRAVELING WITHOUT MOVING

"Without rising from his seat, without his body shaking, he entered samadhi"—and by spiritual power alone, he traveled across all them countless worlds. This is supernatural movement. This is the soul traveling while the body sits still.

But notice: before HE arrives, the flowers appear. Eighty-four thousand jeweled lotus flowers show up first at Vulture Peak. The place is prepared. The announcement is made. Beauty arrives before the teacher.

This is how real spiritual work happens. The atmosphere changes before the person shows up. The space is prepared. You can feel something coming before it gets there.

THE PILGRIM'S HUMILITY

When warned about the rough world, Wonderful Sound doesn't puff up with pride, doesn't say "Don't worry, I can handle it." He says: "It's all the Tathagata's power. It's the Tathagata's spiritual powers at play. It's all you, Lord."

This is the humility of the truly powerful. The person who's got real ability knows that ability came from somewhere. It was given. It was cultivated through connection to something greater. "I ain't going on my own strength, Lord. This is all you."

That's the faith that makes pilgrimage possible. You don't go to sacred places on your own strength. You go because you're sent. You go because you're called. You go because the power that called you is the power that will carry you.

HIS BEAUTIFUL APPEARANCE

When Wonderful Sound arrives, the description is stunning: "His eyes were like the leaves of great blue lotus flowers, and even if you combined the beauty of a hundred thousand million moons, his face was more perfect than that. His body was the color of true gold, adorned with countless hundreds of thousands of merits, his awesome virtue blazing, his light shining and glowing."

This ain't false modesty. This ain't "the messenger must be humble and ugly." This is: the truth is beautiful. Holiness is beautiful. Virtue shines. Merit glows.

We get confused sometimes, thinking humility means making yourself small, making yourself ugly, hiding your light. But the Dharma says: let your light shine. Let your merit show. Let the work you've done be visible in your very body.

Wonderful Sound is beautiful because he's good. He shines because he's practiced. His appearance testifies to his virtue. That's not pride; that's just truth.

THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WORLD

When Wonderful Sound arrives, he delivers greetings from his Buddha to Shakyamuni: "Are you free from illness and troubles? Are you dwelling at ease? Are worldly affairs bearable? Are living beings easy to save? Are they without much greed, anger, ignorance, jealousy, and stinginess?"

These ain't small talk. These are real questions about the conditions of teaching in a difficult world. Is it bearable? Can you endure it? Are people willing to learn, or are they too caught up in greed and ignorance?

This is one Buddha, through his messenger, asking another Buddha: "How you holding up in that hard place? Is it too much? You making it?"

Even enlightened beings check on each other. Even Buddhas ask: "You alright? Can you bear it?" That's compassion among teachers.

THE CORE TEACHING: THE POWER TO MANIFEST IN ALL FORMS

The heart of this chapter is the list of forms that Wonderful Sound can take. He manifests as:
- Gods (Brahma, Shakra, Ishvara, Mahesvara)
- Heavenly generals and kings
- Earthly kings, great and small
- Elders, householders, ministers, brahmans
- Monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen
- Wives of various classes
- Boys and girls
- Devas, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas
- Even nonhuman beings
- Even in hells, among hungry ghosts, among animals
- Even as women in kings' inner palaces

"In all these forms, he teaches this sutra."

And then the Buddha makes it even more radical: "If someone should be saved by a voice-hearer form, he manifests a voice-hearer form. If someone should be saved by a pratyekabuddha form, he manifests that. If someone should be saved by a bodhisattva form, he manifests that. If someone should be saved by a Buddha form, he immediately manifests a Buddha form. Even if someone should be saved by passing into extinction, he shows the appearance of passing into extinction."

He becomes whatever form people need to see in order to hear the teaching.

This is the spiritual superpower of meeting people where they are. Not where you wish they were. Not where you think they should be. Where they ARE.

If somebody needs to see a king to listen, he's a king. If somebody needs to see a woman to trust, he's a woman. If somebody needs to see a child to open their heart, he's a child. If somebody needs to see suffering to understand, he shows suffering. If somebody needs to see death to wake up, he shows death.

This is radical adaptability in the service of truth. This is infinite flexibility in the service of liberation. This is the willingness to be whatever the moment needs, to show up however people can receive you, to set aside your own preferred identity in order to give people what they need.

In the black church, we say: "God will meet you where you are." This chapter is teaching that, and more: the bodhisattva will BECOME where you are. Will take your form. Will speak your language. Will show up in your life wearing a face you can recognize.

THE NAME OF THE SAMADHI

When asked what samadhi gives this power, the Buddha says: "That samadhi is called Manifesting All Bodies."

That's the practice. That's the door. The samadhi of Manifesting All Bodies—the meditation, the concentration, the spiritual absorption that gives you the power to show up as whoever needs to show up, to take the form that serves, to be the teacher that this particular being can hear.

And then comes the gift: when this chapter was taught, the eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas who came with Wonderful Sound all attained this samadhi. And countless bodhisattvas in our Saha world also attained it.

Just from HEARING about this power, beings gained the power itself. Just from witnessing this teaching, they received the ability to manifest in all forms.

That's how the Dharma works. The teaching itself transmits the ability. The story itself conveys the power.

THE RETURN

After making offerings to both Buddhas (Shakyamuni and Many Treasures), Wonderful Sound returns home. And on the way back, just like on the way there, the earth shakes, jeweled lotus flowers rain down, heavenly music plays.

He returns to his own Buddha and reports: "I went to that Saha world and benefited living beings. I saw Shakyamuni Buddha, I saw Many Treasures Buddha's tower, I paid respects and made offerings. I also saw Manjushri and Medicine King and the others. And I also caused these eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas to attain the samadhi of Manifesting All Bodies."

The pilgrimage is complete. He went, he witnessed, he served, he returned. And he brought back fruit: not just his own experience, but the transmission of the power to all those who went with him.

That's what a real pilgrimage does. You don't go just for yourself. You go as a representative. You go to bring something back. You go to witness something that others can't witness, so you can testify when you return.

THE STRUCTURE OF CALL AND RESPONSE

This chapter follows the classic structure of spiritual call and response:
1. The signal is sent (Buddha's light)
2. The call is received (Wonderful Sound feels it)
3. The pilgrim answers (I got to go)
4. Warning is given (Don't look down on that rough place)
5. Faith responds (It's all your power, Lord)
6. Journey is made (traveling without moving)
7. Arrival is announced (flowers appear first)
8. Respect is paid (offerings and prostrations)
9. Teaching is given (the power to manifest in all forms)
10. Return is made (shaking earth and raining flowers)
11. Testimony is delivered (reporting back)
12. Fruit is shared (others receive the power)

This is the pattern of spiritual pilgrimage across every tradition. You hear the call. You answer. You're warned of difficulties. You go anyway in faith. You arrive. You witness. You receive. You return. You testify. Others are transformed by your testimony.

WHY THIS MATTERS

In a world that demands you be one thing, have one identity, fit one box—this chapter teaches that the highest spiritual achievement is the ability to be everything, to manifest in all forms, to meet every being where they are.

Not by losing yourself. Wonderful Sound doesn't lose his identity. He's always Wonderful Sound. But he can appear as anything while remaining himself.

This is the spiritual power that our world desperately needs: people who can cross boundaries, speak multiple languages, show up in multiple communities, take multiple forms—all while maintaining their core integrity, all while serving the same truth.

The teacher who can speak to the scholar and the street sweeper. The preacher who can comfort the dying and celebrate with the living. The friend who can be strong when you need strength and soft when you need softness. The parent who can be authority and playmate. The leader who can be visionary and servant.

This is the samadhi of Manifesting All Bodies—the spiritual practice of infinite adaptability in service of liberation.

And the promise of this chapter is: this power is available. Just by hearing about it, beings receive it. Just by understanding it, you gain access to it. The teaching itself transmits the ability.

So this chapter asks: What form do you need to take today? Who needs to see you? How do you need to show up? What body does this moment need you to manifest?

And it promises: You have the power. The samadhi is available. The light has reached you across all them countless worlds. You felt it touch you. Now answer the call. Make the journey. Meet people where they are. Show up in whatever form serves. And when you return, testify. Share the fruit. Pass on the power.

That's the teaching of Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva—the pilgrim who travels without moving, who manifests in all forms, who goes anywhere beings need saving, even to the hells, even to the palaces, even to this rough and troubled world.

He came. He witnessed. He served. He returned. And by his coming, others gained the power to do the same.

May it be so for all who hear this chapter. May the samadhi of Manifesting All Bodies be yours. May you have the power to show up however the world needs you. May you answer the call that reaches across impossible distances. May you make the pilgrimage and return to testify.

This is the Wonderful Sound—not just a name, but a way of being. The sound that adapts to every ear. The voice that speaks every language. The teaching that takes every form. The Dharma that meets you exactly where you are.

Amen. And amen. And let the church say amen.
