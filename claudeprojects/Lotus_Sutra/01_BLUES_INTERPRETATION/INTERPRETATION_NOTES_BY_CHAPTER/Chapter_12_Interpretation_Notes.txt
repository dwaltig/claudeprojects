This is Chapter 12 of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra, translated from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese (406 CE) into blues/gospel vernacular English.

This chapter carries one of the most revolutionary messages in the entire sutra: that enlightenment is immediate and available to all, regardless of social barriers. The Buddha reveals that Devadatta—his cousin who tried to kill him, who split the sangha, who is in hell for his crimes—was actually his greatest teacher. Through opposition and resistance, Devadatta pushed the Buddha toward complete awakening.

Then comes the dragon princess—an eight-year-old girl, non-human, doubly excluded by the "five obstacles" doctrine—who demonstrates instant enlightenment right there in front of everyone who said it was impossible.

Key metaphors in this translation:

**"Your Enemy Was Your Teacher"** - The chapter title captures the radical teaching that life's hardest trials and greatest opponents can be our deepest educators. This resonates with the blues tradition's understanding that suffering teaches, that the hard road makes you wise.

**The King Becoming a Servant** - I rendered the Buddha's past-life story of royal power surrendered for truth as a blues narrative of status reversed: "I was a king / Had everything a man could want." This mirrors the gospel theme of the last being first, the high brought low.

**"Beat a drum and sent out a proclamation"** - Kept the visceral action of the king literally calling out for teaching, like a town crier, like a preacher calling for testimony.

**"Laid down flat so he could sit on my back"** - Made concrete and physical what the Chinese describes: using one's own body as furniture for the sake of learning truth.

**"Watch how fast this is"** - The dragon princess's challenge becomes vernacular direct speech, the kind of thing someone would actually say before demonstrating impossible grace: "Use your spiritual power. Watch me become a buddha. It's gonna be even faster than that."

**Instant transformation** - The sudden shift from female to male to enlightened buddha happens "right at that moment," "in an instant," "suddenly"—language of the spontaneous grace moment central to gospel testimony, when everything changes in the blink of an eye.

The verse sections maintain rhythm and internal rhyme ("in my prime," "throne/owned," "wide/inside," "man/plan") to create oral memorability and musical flow, appropriate to the blues tradition's method of carrying wisdom.

This chapter is about barriers broken, impossibilities made possible, enemies revealed as friends, and the instantaneous nature of awakening—themes that resonate deeply with the African American spiritual tradition's understanding of liberation, reversal, and sudden grace.
