This chapter is about the dignity of service, the honor of patience, and the vindication of the faithful. I made several key interpretive choices:

**Central Metaphors:**
- "Holding the teaching like a mama holds her baby" - for Ānanda's role as protector of the Dharma
- "Our cup would overflow" - blues/gospel language for fulfillment and satisfaction
- "Faithful as a bride" - for Ānanda's loyal devotion
- "Patient as the morning, faithful as the night" - for Rāhula's steady practice
- "Like sweet dew on the rim" - transforming "nectar" (甘露/amṛta) into something both familiar and transcendent

**Character Voices:**
- Ānanda and Rāhula speak with humility but also with legitimate desire for recognition
- The 2,000 are characterized by their patient silence and collective hoping
- The Buddha speaks with both formality (in the official prophecies with full titles) and intimacy (in explanation)

**Structural Choices:**
- Maintained the prose/verse alternation of the original
- Used verse for the Buddha's confirmations to create memorable, singable moments
- Employed repetition and rhythmic patterns characteristic of both sutras and blues ("gonna" as a future marker creates forward momentum)
- The phrase "learners and learned" preserves the original's 學無學 (those in training and beyond training) while making it accessible

**Key Teachings Preserved:**
- Ānanda chose the path of learning/remembering while Buddha chose vigorous practice
- This explains their different roles and timing of enlightenment
- Rāhula's practice is "secret" (密行) - hidden, inner work
- The 2,000 are all equal in their eventual attainment - democracy of enlightenment
- Service and waiting have their own dignity and lead to full realization

The title "When the Faithful Get Their Due" captures the chapter's essence: this is about patient people, background people, faithful servants finally receiving public acknowledgment and prophecy.
