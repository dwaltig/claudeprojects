================================================================================

William Altig is an author, spiritual practitioner, and cultural translator who
brings together deep knowledge of Buddhist philosophy with the spiritual
language of African American blues and gospel tradition.

For over four decades, Altig has engaged in intensive study of Buddhism, focusing
on the Mahayana tradition and the Lotus Sutra—one of Buddhism's most
revolutionary texts. His work is distinguished by a unique approach: making
complex Buddhist teachings accessible to contemporary readers without
sacrificing doctrinal depth or intellectual rigor.

This translation emerges from Altig's conviction that spiritual wisdom belongs
to everyone, and that the blues tradition—with its unflinching confrontation
of suffering and its transcendent vision of redemption—offers a natural and
authentic language for expressing Buddhist Dharma. Rather than imposing
Buddhist concepts onto blues vernacular, Altig shows how both traditions arise
from the same essential human experiences: the struggle to understand suffering,
the search for freedom, and the possibility of profound transformation.

The Lotus Sutra itself has always been countercultural and accessible. Written
more than two thousand years ago, it argues that enlightenment is available to
all beings—not just monks, not just scholars, not just men—but women,
children, animals, even demons. That radical inclusivity finds a natural home
in blues and gospel traditions, which have historically been voices for those
excluded from institutional power: African American communities claiming their
own spiritual authority and wisdom.

Altig's translation maintains gender-inclusive language throughout, amplifying
the text's original message that all beings possess Buddha-nature and the
capacity for enlightenment. The work includes comprehensive study apparatus—
glossaries, discussion questions, a character guide, and a performance guide—
making it suitable for individual contemplative reading, group study, classroom
use, and oral performance.

This project represents the convergence of Altig's spiritual practice,
scholarly engagement with Buddhist philosophy, deep appreciation for African
American cultural and spiritual traditions, and commitment to bringing these
wisdom traditions into dialogue for contemporary seekers.

The complete project includes three complete versions of the Lotus Sutra: this
blues/gospel vernacular interpretation, a scholarly English translation, and
the classical Chinese source text (Kumārajīva's 406 CE version). All versions
preserve full Sanskrit diacritical marks and maintain the integrity of Buddhist
terminology while serving different audiences and purposes.

Altig lives in [City], where he continues his Buddhist practice, engages with
spiritual communities, and develops new forms of dharmic expression through
creative translation and interpretation. He is available for workshops,
readings, performances, and educational presentations on the Lotus Sutra,
Buddhist translation philosophy, and the intersection of spiritual wisdom
traditions.

SHORT BIO (150-200 words)
For use in book jacket copy, promotional materials, and condensed front matter
================================================================================

William Altig is an author and spiritual practitioner who brings together deep
study of Buddhism with the spiritual language of African American blues and
gospel tradition. Over four decades of intensive engagement with the Lotus Sutra—
one of Buddhism's most revolutionary texts—has led to this unique translation,
which makes complex Buddhist teachings accessible to contemporary readers
without sacrificing doctrinal depth.

This translation reflects Altig's conviction that spiritual wisdom belongs to
everyone, and that the blues tradition offers an authentic language for
expressing Buddhist Dharma. Like the original Lotus Sutra, which declares that
enlightenment is available to all beings, blues and gospel are traditions of
profound spiritual wisdom born from communities claiming their own authority
and freedom.

The work includes comprehensive study apparatus—glossaries, discussion
questions, character guides, and performance notes—making it suitable for
individual practice, group study, classroom use, and oral performance.

Altig is available for workshops, readings, and educational presentations on
Buddhist translation, the Lotus Sutra, and the intersection of wisdom
traditions.

EXTENDED SHORT BIO (250-300 words)
For use in conference programs, speaking engagements, and detailed promotional
contexts
================================================================================

William Altig is an author, spiritual practitioner, and cultural translator
specializing in bringing Buddhist philosophy into the language of contemporary
seekers. His primary work has been four decades of engagement with the Lotus
Sutra—one of Mahayana Buddhism's most influential and revolutionary texts.

Rather than producing another academic translation, Altig created something
unprecedented: a complete translation of the Lotus Sutra into African American
blues and gospel vernacular. This unique approach reflects his conviction that
spiritual wisdom belongs to everyone, and that blues and gospel traditions—
rooted in African American spiritual authority and claiming freedom in the face
of systemic oppression—offer an authentic and natural language for expressing
Buddhist Dharma.

Altig's translation maintains full doctrinal accuracy while making complex
Buddhist concepts accessible to readers without formal training. It preserves
and amplifies the text's original radical message: that enlightenment is
available to all beings, regardless of gender, status, or capacity. The work
includes gender-inclusive language, strategic centering of women bodhisattvas,
and careful attention to the text's most paradigm-shifting moments.

The complete project encompasses three versions of the Lotus Sutra: this blues/
gospel vernacular interpretation, a scholarly English translation, and the
classical Chinese source text (Kumārajīva's 406 CE version). All versions
maintain full Sanskrit diacritical marks and preserve the integrity of Buddhist
terminology.

In addition to translation work, Altig has developed comprehensive study
apparatus—glossaries, discussion questions, character guides, and performance
guides—making the text suitable for contemplative reading, group study,
classroom use, and oral performance. He is engaged with Buddhist communities,
spiritual centers, and educational institutions.

Altig is available for workshops, readings, performances, and educational
presentations on Buddhist translation philosophy, the Lotus Sutra, accessible
Buddhism, and the intersection of Buddhist and African American spiritual
wisdom traditions.
