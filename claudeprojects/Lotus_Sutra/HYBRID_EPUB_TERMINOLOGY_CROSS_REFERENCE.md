## TABLE 3: USAGE NOTES FOR EPUB FOOTNOTING

Strategic guidance for handling terminology divergences between versions to help readers understand and navigate both texts.

### CORE TECHNICAL TERMS

#### Arhat / Arhats
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: formal "Arhat" / those "whose outflows had been exhausted"
- Blues: "brother who'd made it through to the other side"

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When Blues: "brother who'd made it through to the other side"
Add footnote: "Scholarly version: Arhat (Skt. arahant), one who has
attained complete personal liberation from suffering and attachment.
Importantly, the Lotus Sutra reframes this achievement not as the
final destination but as a stage on the path to universal Buddhahood."
```
**Rationale**: The Blues version emphasizes the colloquial accessibility while hiding the technical Buddhist achievement. The footnote restores scholarly precision while honoring the spiritual aspiration of the Blues rendering.

---

#### Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: formal Sanskrit "Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva" (Great Being dedicated to enlightenment)
- Blues: "ones who've set their hearts on the highest freedom, not just for themselves but for everybody"

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When Blues: "ones who've set their hearts on the highest freedom..."
Add footnote: "Scholarly version: Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva (Skt.), a being
whose essence is awakening (bodhi) and who vows to postpone their own
final liberation to help all sentient beings achieve enlightenment.
The 'Great Being' (Mahāsattva) emphasizes the vastness and power of
their commitment."
```
**Rationale**: Blues emphasizes the ethical motivation; note provides the cosmic scope and technical meaning.

---

#### anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi (Supreme Perfect Enlightenment)
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: formal "anuttara-samyak-sambodhi" (appears multiple times)
- Blues: "the highest freedom" / "supreme perfect enlightenment"

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When Blues: "the highest freedom"
Add footnote: "Scholarly version: anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, literally
'unsurpassed, complete, perfect enlightenment.' In Sanskrit: anuttar-
(unsurpassed), samyak (perfect/complete), and sambodhi (enlightenment).
This represents the highest attainment achievable in Buddhism—not freedom
from responsibility but freedom fully realized in service to all beings."
```
**Rationale**: Blues emphasizes liberation; note provides Sanskrit etymology and nuance about universal application.

---

#### upāya (Skillful Means)
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: "skillful means" / "expedient means" / "loving tricks" (poetic register)
- Blues: "skillful means" / "loving tricks" / "compassionate tricks"

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When Blues: "loving tricks" or "compassionate tricks"
Add footnote: "Scholarly version: upāya (Skt.), literally 'way' or 'means.'
Refers to the Buddha's ability to teach different doctrines to different
beings according to their capacity. These are not deceptions but
compassionate adaptations—'tricks' in the sense that a parent might use
different strategies with different children, all aimed at the same goal."
```
**Rationale**: Both versions use unconventional language intentionally. Note contextualizes the metaphor within Buddhist philosophy.

---

#### dhāraṇī (Sacred Formula / Protective Power)
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: "dhāraṇī" / "eloquence in joyful exposition"
- Blues: "a power to hold onto the truth no matter how hard the wind blows"

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When Blues: "a power to hold onto the truth..."
Add footnote: "Scholarly version: dhāraṇī (Skt.), literally 'to hold' or
'preserve.' Traditionally understood as protective incantations or mantras
believed to hold power beyond conventional meaning. The Blues rendering
emphasizes the protective and stabilizing function: the ability to maintain
one's commitment to the teaching despite external pressures."
```
**Rationale**: Blues emphasizes function (holding fast); note provides Sanskrit origin and traditional understanding.

---

#### nirvāṇa (Final Peace / Extinction of Craving)
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: "nirvana" / "the ending of all suffering's limits"
- Blues: "the final peace beyond peace" / "peace"

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When Blues: "that final peace beyond peace"
Add footnote: "Scholarly version: nirvāṇa (Skt.), literally 'blowing out'
or 'extinguishing.' The cessation of craving, aversion, and delusion that
causes suffering. Crucially, the Lotus Sutra reframes nirvāṇa not as the
ultimate destination but as a 'phantom city'—a compassionately created
rest stop on the path to universal Buddhahood through the One Vehicle."
```
**Rationale**: Both versions use "peace"; note clarifies the crucial Lotus Sutra innovation of reframing nirvāṇa as intermediate stage.

---

#### Dharma (The Teaching / Law / Way)
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: "Dharma" (always capitalized as teaching) / "dharmas" (lowercase for phenomena)
- Blues: "the teaching" / "the Way" / "the word" / "the Dharma"

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When Blues uses multiple terms: "the teaching," "the Way," "the word"
Add note: "Throughout this text, 'Dharma' (capitalized, with diacriticals
in scholarly version: Dharma) refers to the Buddha's teaching. When
appearing in lowercase as 'dharmas' or 'phenomena,' it refers to things
as they actually are. The Blues version uses poetic equivalents—'the
teaching,' 'the Way,' 'the word'—to capture the sense that Dharma is
not abstract doctrine but living guidance."
```
**Rationale**: Clarifies the distinction that readers need to understand the text fully.

---

#### Tathāgata (Thus-Come One / The Buddha)
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: "Tathagata" / "Thus Come One" / formal epithet
- Blues: "Thus-Come One" / "the Tathagata" / often rendered as "Buddha"

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When Scholarly: "Tathagata" appears frequently
Add footnote (first occurrence only): "Tathāgata (Skt.), literally 'thus come'
or 'thus gone.' One of the Buddha's ten principal epithets, emphasizing that
he has followed the same path of enlightenment that all Buddhas follow. While
formally applied to the Buddha, it also points to the universal principle
that anyone who achieves enlightenment becomes a Tathagata."
```
**Rationale**: Scholarly version uses technical epithet frequently; footnote provides context for lay readers.

---

### BODHISATTVA AND DISCIPLE NAMES

#### Named Bodhisattvas (Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Maitreya)
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: Consistent Sanskrit names with diacriticals
- Blues: Names used directly, with occasional English glosses

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When Blues introduces Bodhisattva by name (e.g., "Mañjuśrī"):
Add footnote: "Mañjuśrī (Skt.), the Bodhisattva of Transcendent Wisdom.
Often depicted carrying a sword that cuts through ignorance. Plays a major
role in the Lotus Sutra as the primary teacher and revealer of the dharma.
The name means 'gentle glory.'"
```
**Rationale**: Readers need context for these major figures even when names are used consistently.

---

#### Named Arhats (21 disciples)
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: All 21 named individually with Sanskrit spellings preserved
- Blues: Generic reference as "brothers" / "Arhats" with occasional glosses for key figures

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
First assembly reference (Scholarly lists all 21 names):
Add collective footnote: "These 21 Arhats (Skt. arahant, one who has
attained personal liberation) represent the Buddha's foremost disciples
in the Traditional Vehicle (Śrāvaka Vehicle). The Lotus Sutra,
revolutionarily, promises that even these 'completed' practitioners will
advance to Buddhahood. Key figures include: [list by function: Śāriputra
(wisdom), Mahākāśyapa (asceticism), Ānanda (memory), Rāhula (practice)]."
```
**Rationale**: The comprehensive naming in Scholarly version deserves explanation; highlighting key figures helps readers navigate the roster.

---

#### Four Divine Categories (Dragons, Gandharvas, Kiṃnaras, Asuras, Garuḍas)
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: Eight Dragon Kings named individually; Four of each other type
- Blues: Generic collective reference ("Dragon Kings," "celestial beings")

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When Blues: "celestial beings" or generic "Dragon King"
Add footnote: "In Buddhist cosmology, Dragon Kings represent divine beings
capable of transformation and power over weather. The eight named Dragon Kings
listed in the Scholarly version (Nanda, Upananda, Sāgara, Vāsukin, Takṣaka,
Anavatapta, Manasvin, Utpalaka) each represent different domains or qualities.
Similarly, Kiṃnaras are celestial musicians, Gandharvas are heavenly musicians,
Asuras are jealous demigods, and Garuḍas are golden-winged birds—all present
to witness and support the teaching."
```
**Rationale**: Blues uses generic terms for flow; note provides taxonomy and significance of the presence of different divine realms.

---

### COSMOLOGICAL AND SACRED LOCATIONS

#### Gṛdhrakūṭa / Vulture Peak Mountain
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: Consistent "Gṛdhrakūṭa" or "Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa"
- Blues: "Vulture Peak Mountain" (English translation) or implicit reference to "the mountain"

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When first mentioned:
Add footnote: "Gṛdhrakūṭa (Skt.), literally 'Vulture Peak,' near the city
of Rājagṛha in ancient India. The entire Lotus Sutra is set on this mountain,
which becomes a sacred geography—the place where the Buddha teaches universal
Buddhahood to the assembled multitude of disciples and heavenly beings."
```
**Rationale**: Establishes the sacred geography that grounds the teaching.

---

#### Rājagṛha (King's House / City)
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: Formal "Rājagṛha" (Sanskrit name preserved)
- Blues: Often implicit; focus on "the mountain" rather than city

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When Scholarly mentions "Rājagṛha":
Add footnote: "Rājagṛha (Skt.), literally 'King's House' or 'Palace of the
King,' was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Magadha. It lies at the
foot of Vulture Peak Mountain and serves as the geographical anchor for
the Lotus Sutra's assembly. The presence of King Ajātaśatru underscores
the teaching's reach across all social levels."
```
**Rationale**: Provides historical and geographical context.

---

#### Sahā World / Akaniṣṭha Heaven / Mount Sumeru
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: Full cosmological references with Sanskrit names
- Blues: Generic "the world" / implicit understanding of Buddhist cosmology

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When Scholarly references cosmological realms:
Add footnote: "Buddhist cosmology envisions multiple interconnected realms.
The Sahā world (Skt.) is our current world system characterized by suffering.
Akaniṣṭha (the highest heaven) represents the uppermost celestial realm. Mount
Sumeru (Skt. Meru) is the cosmic center around which the world systems are
arranged. The light from the Buddha's brow illuminates 18,000 of these worlds,
revealing that the teaching embraces all realms simultaneously."
```
**Rationale**: Explains the cosmological context without overwhelming readers with Sanskrit terminology.

---

### SUPERNATURAL PHENOMENA AND DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS

#### Light from Brow (ūrṇā Light)
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: "ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows"
- Blues: "light between the brows" / "great light illuminating"

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When mentioned:
Add footnote: "This light emission is a standard Buddhist supernatural sign
indicating extraordinary teaching. The tuft of white hair (ūrṇā) between the
Buddha's eyebrows is one of his 32 distinguishing marks. The light's
illumination of 18,000 worlds to the east is the primary sign that prompts
the assembly's recognition that the Buddha is about to teach something
revolutionary."
```
**Rationale**: Clarifies the symbolic and cosmological significance.

---

#### Mandārava and Mañjūṣaka Flowers
**Terminology Divergence**:
- Scholarly: "heavenly mandārava flowers, great mandārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, and great mañjūṣaka flowers"
- Blues: "celestial flowers" / "heavenly flowers"

**EPUB Footnote Strategy**:
```
When flowers are mentioned:
Add footnote: "These flowers are symbolic of celestial celebration. Mandārava
(Skt.) flowers bloom in the heavenly realms and rarely manifest on earth. Their
presence signals that even the heavens recognize the extraordinary nature of
this teaching. The raining of flowers represents joy, tribute, and the alignment
of all realms in support of the Buddha's proclamation."
```
**Rationale**: Explains the symbolic language without requiring knowledge of celestial botany.

---

### SUMMARY GUIDANCE FOR EPUB IMPLEMENTATION

**Footnote Placement Guidelines**:
1. **First significant occurrence**: Add explanatory footnote contextualizing terminology
2. **Subsequent occurrences**: Only footnote if there's additional nuance or if the term shifts meaning contextually
3. **Parallel passages**: Where both versions express the same concept differently, use interlinked footnotes
4. **Reader benefit**: Every footnote should help readers understand either (a) Buddhist technical meaning, (b) how the versions differ, or (c) why the difference matters spiritually/philosophically

**Example Footnote Implementation**:
- Scholarly text: "All were Arhats whose outflows had been exhausted..."
- Add footnote: "[FN] Arhat (Skt. arahant): one who has attained complete liberation. In the Blues version, this appears as 'a brother who'd made it through to the other side.' The Lotus Sutra radically promises that even these advanced practitioners will achieve universal Buddhahood."

- Blues text: "brothers who'd made it through to the other side"
- Add footnote: "[FN] Scholarly version: 'Arhats whose outflows had been exhausted.' An Arhat is one who has achieved the ultimate goal of the traditional Buddhist path—complete liberation from craving and attachment. The Lotus Sutra's promise is that this is only a milestone, not the final destination."

**Tone Guidelines**:
- Academic but accessible (assume educated lay reader, not specialist)
- Respectful of both versions' integrity
- Clarify rather than judge
- When versions conflict, explain the philosophical difference rather than choosing sides
