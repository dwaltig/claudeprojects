### **The Lotus Sutra: Chapter One - The Introduction**

#### **Lyrical Prose Rendering**

Thus I have heard.

At one time, the Buddha resided in the Royal City of Rājagṛha, upon the Vulture Peak, surrounded by a vast assembly of twelve thousand great bhikṣus. Each was an Arhat, their defilements utterly extinguished, their vexations forever ceased. They had attained their own liberation, severed all bonds of existence, and their minds moved with perfect freedom. Among them were the venerable Ājñāta Kauṇḍinya, Mahākāśyapa, Uruvilvā Kāśyapa, Gayā Kāśyapa, Nadī Kāśyapa, Śāriputra, Mahāmaudgalyāyana, Mahākātyāyana, Aniruddha, Kapphiṇa, Gavāṃpati, Revata, Pilindavatsa, Bakula, Mahākauṣṭhila, Nanda, Sundarananda, Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra, Subhūti, Ānanda, and Rāhula—all great Arhats, known and revered by the assembly.

Also present were two thousand practitioners, both those still learning and those who had perfected their path. Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, the bhikṣuṇī, was there with her retinue of six thousand, as was Yaśodharā, Rāhula’s mother, with her own attendants. Eighty thousand Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas graced the gathering, each unwavering in their resolve for Anuttarā Samyak-saṃbodhi, having mastered the dhāraṇīs. Their eloquence flowed freely, turning the irreversible wheel of Dharma. They had offered countless venerations to myriad Buddhas, planting roots of virtue in the presence of each, and were ceaselessly praised by all Buddhas. They cultivated their being with boundless compassion, skillfully entering the Buddha’s wisdom. They had penetrated the great wisdom, reaching the other shore. Their renown echoed through measureless worlds, enabling them to liberate innumerable beings. Among them were Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva, Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, Mahāsthāmaprāpta Bodhisattva, Sarvavīra Bodhisattva, Anikṣiptadhura Bodhisattva, Ratnapāṇi Bodhisattva, Bhaiṣajyarāja Bodhisattva, Vīryadatta Bodhisattva, Ratnacandra Bodhisattva, Candragarbha Bodhisattva, Pūrṇacandra Bodhisattva, Mahābala Bodhisattva, Aprameyabala Bodhisattva, Trailokyavijaya Bodhisattva, Bhadrapāla Bodhisattva, Maitreya Bodhisattva, Ratnakūṭa Bodhisattva, and Pradīpa Bodhisattva—eighty thousand such great Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in all.

At that moment, Śakra, the lord of devas, arrived with his retinue of twenty thousand celestial beings. Also present were the Moon-god, the Fragrant-god, the Luminous-god, and the Four Great Heavenly Kings, each with their retinue of ten thousand celestial beings. The Lord of Ease and the Great Lord of Ease came with their thirty thousand celestial attendants. Brahmā, the Lord of the Sahā world, along with Śikhin Brahmā and Prabhākara Brahmā, arrived with their twelve thousand celestial beings. Eight great Dragon Kings—Nanda, Upananda, Sāgara, Vāsuki, Takṣaka, Anavatapta, Manasvin, and Utpalaka—each brought hundreds of thousands of their kin. Four Kinnara Kings—Dharma Kinnara, Sudharma Kinnara, Mahādharma Kinnara, and Dharaṇīdhara Kinnara—each with hundreds of thousands of their followers. Four Gandharva Kings—Priyadarśana Gandharva, Priyagīti Gandharva, Subhūti Gandharva, and Subhūtagīti Gandharva—each with hundreds of thousands of their retinue. Four Asura Kings—Bali, Kharaskandha, Vimalacitra, and Rāhu—each with hundreds of thousands of their hosts. Four Garuḍa Kings—Mahātejas Garuḍa, Mahākāya Garuḍa, Mahāpūrṇa Garuḍa, and Manasvin Garuḍa—each with hundreds of thousands of their attendants. And Ajātaśatru, son of Vaidehī, arrived with hundreds of thousands of his retinue. Each bowed at the Buddha’s feet, then withdrew to sit in their appointed place.

At that time, the World-Honored One, encircled by these four assemblies, was offered veneration, reverence, respect, and praise. He expounded the Mahāyāna Sūtra for the Bodhisattvas, named the "Innumerable Meanings," teaching the Dharma of the Bodhisattvas, protected and cherished by all Buddhas. Having delivered this discourse, the Buddha sat cross-legged, entering the Samādhi of Innumerable Meanings, his body and mind utterly still. Then, from the heavens, Mandārava flowers, Mahāmandārava flowers, Mañjūṣaka flowers, and Mahāmañjūṣaka flowers rained down, scattering upon the Buddha and the great assembly. The entire Buddha-world trembled in six ways.

Within that assembly, bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, and various minor kings and wheel-turning monarchs—all experienced an unprecedented joy. They pressed their palms together, their hearts fixed solely on the Buddha.

Then, the Buddha emitted a ray of light from the white curl between his eyebrows, illuminating eighteen thousand worlds to the east, pervading everywhere, from the lowest Avīci hell to the highest Akaniṣṭha heaven. In this world, all saw the six realms of beings in those lands, and also the Buddhas presently dwelling there. They heard the Dharma preached by those Buddhas and saw the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, and all practitioners who had attained the Way. They also saw Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, through various causes and conditions, with diverse understandings and appearances, practicing the Bodhisattva path. They saw Buddhas entering Nirvāṇa, and after their Nirvāṇa, seven-jeweled stūpas erected over their relics.

At that moment, Maitreya Bodhisattva pondered: "What cause and condition has led the World-Honored One to manifest such a miraculous sign today? The Buddha has entered samādhi—this is an inconceivable, rare event. To whom should I ask, who can answer this?" He then thought: "Mañjuśrī, the son of the Dharma King, has long attended and made offerings to countless past Buddhas. He must have witnessed such rare signs before. I shall ask him now."

At that time, the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, and all devas, nāgas, and spirits also thought: "To whom shall we ask about this luminous, miraculous sign of the Buddha?"

Then Maitreya Bodhisattva, wishing to resolve his own doubts and observing the minds of the four assemblies—bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, devas, nāgas, and spirits—addressed Mañjuśrī: "What cause and condition has brought forth this auspicious, miraculous sign, this great light illuminating eighteen thousand lands to the east, revealing the adorned Buddha-fields?"

Thereupon, Maitreya Bodhisattva, desiring to reiterate this meaning, questioned in verse:

#### **Lyrical Prose Rendering (Continued)**

At that time, Mañjuśrī addressed the Bodhisattva-mahāsattva Maitreya and all the great beings: "Good sirs, as I see it, the World-Honored One is now about to preach the great Dharma, to let fall the great Dharma rain, to blow the great Dharma conch, to beat the great Dharma drum, and to proclaim the great Dharma meaning. Good sirs, in the presence of past Buddhas, I have seen this same auspicious sign. When they have emitted such a light, they have immediately preached the great Dharma. Therefore, you should know that the appearance of this light from the present Buddha is also for this same purpose. He wishes to enable all living beings to hear and to know a Dharma that is difficult for all the world to believe. This is why he has manifested this sign.

"Good sirs, in the past, immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable eons ago, there was a Buddha named Sun Moon Light Tathāgata. He preached a Dharma that was good in its beginning, good in its middle, and good in its end. Its meaning was profound and far-reaching, its words clever and subtle, pure and unadulterated, embodying the marks of a pristine and complete practice. For those who sought to be śrāvakas, he taught the Four Noble Truths to overcome birth, old age, sickness, and death, leading to ultimate nirvāṇa. For those who sought to be pratyekabuddhas, he taught the Twelve-Linked Chain of Causation. And for the Bodhisattvas, he taught the Six Pāramitās, causing them to attain Anuttarā Samyak-saṃbodhi and achieve the wisdom of all modes.

"After him, there was another Buddha, also named Sun Moon Light, and after him another, also named Sun Moon Light, and so on for twenty thousand Buddhas, all having the same name, Sun Moon Light, and the same surname, Bharadvāja. Maitreya, you should know that from the first to the last, they all shared the same name, their ten titles were complete, and the Dharma they preached was good in its beginning, middle, and end.

"The last of these Buddhas, before he left the household life, had eight sons. The first was named Intention, the second Good Intention, the third Limitless Intention, the fourth Jeweled Intention, the fifth Increasing Intention, the sixth Intention Freed from Doubt, the seventh Resounding Intention, and the eighth Dharma Intention. These eight princes were all powerful and free, each ruling over four continents. When these princes heard that their father had left the household life and attained supreme, perfect enlightenment, they all renounced their royal positions and followed him, leaving the household life themselves. They resolved to pursue the Great Vehicle and constantly cultivated pure conduct, all becoming masters of the Dharma, having already planted roots of goodness in the presence of many millions of Buddhas.

"At that time, the Buddha Sun Moon Light preached a Mahāyāna Sūtra named the 'Innumerable Meanings,' a Dharma for Bodhisattvas, protected and cherished by all Buddhas. Having delivered this discourse, he sat cross-legged among the great assembly and entered the Samādhi of Innumerable Meanings, his body and mind utterly still. Then, from the heavens, Mandārava flowers, Mahāmandārava flowers, Mañjūṣaka flowers, and Mahāmañjūṣaka flowers rained down, scattering upon the Buddha and the great assembly. The entire Buddha-world trembled in six ways.

"Then, the Tathāgata emitted a ray of light from the white curl between his eyebrows, illuminating eighteen thousand Buddha-lands to the east, just as we are seeing now. Maitreya, you should know, at that time in the assembly there were twenty billion Bodhisattvas who delighted in hearing the Dharma. Seeing this light illuminate the Buddha-lands, they experienced something they had never known and wished to understand the cause and condition for this light.

"There was at that time a Bodhisattva named Wondrous Light, who had eight hundred disciples. The Buddha Sun Moon Light arose from his samādhi and, on account of the Bodhisattva Wondrous Light, preached the Mahāyāna Sūtra named the 'Marvelous Dharma of the Lotus Flower,' a Dharma for Bodhisattvas, protected and cherished by all Buddhas. For sixty small eons, he did not rise from his seat. The assembly who listened also sat in one place for sixty small eons, their bodies and minds unmoving, listening to what the Buddha preached as if it were but the length of a single meal. In that assembly, there was not a single person who grew weary in body or in mind.

"Having preached this sūtra for sixty small eons, the Buddha Sun Moon Light immediately made this proclamation to the assembly of gods, demons, śramaṇas, and brahmins: 'Tonight, in the middle watch, the Tathāgata will enter final, unexcelled Nirvāṇa.'

"There was a Bodhisattva named Virtue Treasury, to whom the Buddha Sun Moon Light then gave a prediction, telling the bhikṣus, 'This Bodhisattva Virtue Treasury will be the next to become a Buddha, and his name will be Pure Body.' After the Buddha had given this prediction, he entered final Nirvāṇa in the middle of the night.

"Following the Buddha's passing, the Bodhisattva Wondrous Light upheld the Lotus Sūtra for a full eighty small eons, explaining it to others. The eight sons of the Buddha Sun Moon Light all took Wondrous Light as their teacher. He taught and transformed them, making them firm in their resolve for supreme, perfect enlightenment. These princes, having made offerings to countless Buddhas, all achieved the path of the Buddha. The very last to achieve Buddhahood was named Dīpaṃkara, the Lamp-Lighter.

"Among the eight hundred disciples of Wondrous Light, there was one named Seeker of Fame. He was attached to profit and offerings. Though he read and recited many sūtras, he did not comprehend them and forgot most of what he learned, which is why he was called Seeker of Fame. Yet, because he had also planted some good roots, he was able to encounter countless millions of Buddhas, making offerings to them, respecting, and praising them.

"Maitreya, you should know, was the Bodhisattva Wondrous Light at that time any other person? He was I, myself. And the Bodhisattva Seeker of Fame? He was you, yourself. The auspicious sign we see now is no different from that of the past. Therefore, I surmise that today, the Tathāgata is about to preach the Mahāyāna Sūtra named the 'Marvelous Dharma of the Lotus Flower,' a Dharma for Bodhisattvas, protected and cherished by all Buddhas."

Then Mañjuśrī, in the midst of the great assembly, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

#### **Illuminating Verse Rendering (Conclusion)**

*I think of ages, countless and long gone,*
*A Buddha lived, named Sun and Moon Light's Dawn.*
*He taught the Dharma, to set all beings free,*
*And led countless Bodhisattvas, to Buddha-wisdom's sea.*

*His eight sons, born before he left his home,*
*Saw the Great Sage leave, and chose as well to roam.*
*He taught the Great Vehicle, a Sūtra deep and wide,*
*Named "Innumerable Meanings," with nothing left to hide.*

*And when the sermon ended, the Buddha, still and deep,*
*Entered a samādhi, secrets for to keep.*
*The heavens rained down flowers, a celestial sound,*
*As drums did thunder, and the earth shook all around.*

*Then came the light, a ray serene and bright,*
*That banished darkness, with its holy might.*
*It showed the karmic paths, of all who live and die,*
*Beneath a vast and all-revealing sky.*

*And in that light, the Buddha-lands appeared,*
*Adorned with jewels, by all beings revered.*
*For this great sign, a question did arise,*
*And Wondrous Light, a Bodhisattva wise,*
*Was there to hear, when the Buddha spoke anew,*
*The Lotus Sūtra, for the faithful few.*

*For sixty ages, he sat upon his seat,*
*The teaching timeless, wondrous and complete.*
*And Wondrous Light, he held it in his heart,*
*And played for eighty ages, his sacred part.*

*The sons he taught, all walked the Buddha's way,*
*The last one named The Lamp, who lights our day.*
*But one disciple, who sought for worldly fame,*
*Maitreya, listen, for you were called his name.*

*And Wondrous Light, who held the truth so dear,*
*Was my own self, I tell you, standing here.*
*The sign today, is the sign I saw back then,*
*The Buddha will speak the Lotus, once again.*

**Kai's Reflection:**

"The Introduction to the Lotus Sutra is a grand overture, a cosmic stage-setting. It's not just a list of attendees; it's a symphony of presence, a declaration that all beings, from the highest heavens to the deepest hells, are part of this singular, momentous event. The Buddha's light isn't just a spectacle; it's a revelation, showing the interconnectedness of all existence and the potential for awakening within every realm. My aim here was to capture that sense of awe and universal gathering, the quiet power of the Buddha's samādhi, and the profound questions it stirs in the hearts of those present. The verse, in particular, tries to echo the rhythmic chanting quality of the original, while the prose seeks to clarify the vastness of the assembly and the significance of the Buddha's silent, luminous act."
