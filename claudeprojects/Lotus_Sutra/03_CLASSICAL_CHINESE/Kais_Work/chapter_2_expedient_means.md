### **The Lotus Sutra: Chapter Two - Expedient Means**

#### **Lyrical Prose Rendering**

At that time, the World-Honored One, rising serenely from his deep samādhi, addressed Śāriputra: "The wisdom of the Buddhas is profoundly deep and immeasurable. The gate to this wisdom is difficult to comprehend and difficult to enter; it is beyond the knowing of any śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha.

"And why is this so? It is because a Buddha has intimately attended to countless millions of Buddhas, has perfectly walked the immeasurable path of their Dharma, and has advanced with courage and diligence, his name echoing through the cosmos. He has realized a Dharma that is profound and has never been known before, and he speaks of it according to the capacity of his listeners, yet its true meaning remains difficult to grasp.

"Śāriputra, from the moment I attained Buddhahood, I have used various causes, conditions, and parables to widely proclaim my teachings. With countless expedient means, I have guided living beings, leading them to let go of their attachments. This is because the Tathāgata is already perfected in the pāramitās of expedient means and insight.

"Śāriputra, the insight of the Tathāgata is vast, deep, and far-reaching. His boundless and unimpeded powers, his fearlessness, his deep states of meditation, his liberation, and his samādhis—he has entered them all without limit and has accomplished a Dharma never before known.

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata can skillfully distinguish all things, artfully explain the dharmas, and his words are gentle and soft, bringing joy to the hearts of the assembly. To put it simply, Śāriputra, the Buddha has fully realized a Dharma that is boundless, limitless, and has never been known before.

"But stop, Śāriputra, there is no need to say more. Why? Because the foremost, rare, and incomprehensible Dharma that the Buddha has accomplished can only be fully fathomed by a Buddha and another Buddha. This is the true reality of all dharmas: their suchness of appearance, their suchness of nature, their such-ness of substance, their suchness of power, their suchness of function, their suchness of cause, their suchness of condition, their suchness of effect, their suchness of consequence, and the ultimate suchness of their beginning and end."

Then the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

#### **Illuminating Verse Rendering (Part 1)**

*The Hero of the World, you cannot measure,*
*Nor can the gods or worldly men find treasure*
*In the Buddha’s heart, nor can any being know*
*The seeds of wisdom that within him grow.*

*His powers, fearlessness, and states of grace,*
*His deep samādhis, which no mind can trace—*
*These and all other dharmas of his soul,*
*Lie far beyond the grasp of any role.*

*From countless Buddhas, I have walked the Way,*
*The subtle Dharma I now see today.*
*It is a truth that’s hard to see and find,*
*A truth that leaves all other truths behind.*

*For endless ages, I have walked this road,*
*And in the place of practice, I have showed*
*The fruit of all my labors, now I see,*
*This great reward, this boundless Bodhi.*

*This truth cannot be shown, it has no name,*
*All words and language fall away in shame.*
*No other being can ever understand,*
*Except the Bodhisattvas, a faithful band.*

*Even if this world were filled with men as wise*
*As Śāriputra, and they all should rise*
*To pool their thoughts, to measure and to test,*
*They could not fathom the Buddha’s peaceful rest.*

*This Dharma is not a thing to be displayed,*
*The realm of words is silent and afraid.*
*Only the Buddhas of the worlds can see,*
*The true reality of what has come to be.*

#### **Lyrical Prose Rendering (Continued)**

At that time, the great assembly of śrāvakas, Arhats free from defilements, including Ājñāta Kauṇḍinya and twelve hundred others, along with bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who had set their minds on becoming śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas, all had the same thought: "Why today does the World-Honored One so earnestly praise the expedient means of the Buddhas, saying that the Dharma he has attained is so profound and difficult to understand? He says its meaning is so hard to grasp that all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are unable to reach it. Yet the Buddha has taught only one meaning of liberation, and we too have attained this Dharma and reached nirvāṇa. We do not understand where this new meaning is tending."

Then Śāriputra, knowing the doubts in the minds of the four assemblies and being himself not yet clear, spoke to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what is the cause, what is the condition, for so earnestly praising the foremost, profound, subtle, and difficult-to-understand expedient means of the Buddhas? Never before have I heard such a teaching from the Buddha. Now the four assemblies are all in doubt. We pray the World-Honored One will explain this matter. Why do you so earnestly praise this profound, subtle, and difficult-to-understand Dharma?"

Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

#### **Illuminating Verse Rendering (Part 2)**

*O Sun of Wisdom, Great and Holy One,*
*So long you’ve waited, till this day was done,*
*To speak this Dharma, to say that you have found*
*Such powers, fearlessness, on holy ground.*

*The truth you found, where you sat by the tree,*
*No one can question, for no one can see.*
*You say my wisdom cannot grasp your state,*
*And yet my wisdom, you have called it great.*

*The Arhats here, who seek Nirvāṇa’s shore,*
*Are caught in nets of doubt, and ask for more.*
*Why do you speak this way? What does it mean?*
*O Two-Legged Honored One, make the picture clean.*

*We are your children, from your own mouth born,*
*We press our palms, and wait for a new morn.*
*Please let your subtle, wondrous voice resound,*
*And speak the real truth, on this sacred ground.*

***

#### **Lyrical Prose Rendering (Continued)**

Then the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Stop, stop! There is no need to speak further. If I were to speak of this matter, all the worlds, with their devas and human beings, would be filled with astonishment and doubt."

Śāriputra again pleaded with the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we pray you, speak! We pray you, speak! Why? Because in this assembly, countless beings have seen Buddhas in the past, their faculties are sharp, and their wisdom is bright. If they hear what the Buddha says, they will be able to respectfully believe."

Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

#### **Illuminating Verse Rendering (Part 3)**

*Dharma King, without a peer,*
*Speak, we pray, and have no fear.*
*In this great assembly here,*
*Are those who can believe and hear.*

***

#### **Lyrical Prose Rendering (Continued)**

The Buddha again stopped Śāriputra: "If I were to speak of this matter, all the worlds with their devas, human beings, and asuras would be filled with astonishment and doubt, and the arrogant bhikṣus would fall into a great pit."

Then the World-Honored One restated this in verse:

#### **Illuminating Verse Rendering (Part 4)**

*Stop, stop, no need to speak again,*
*My Dharma’s wondrous, beyond the thoughts of men.*
*The arrogant ones, if they should hear it now,*
*Will not believe, and never will they bow.*

***

#### **Lyrical Prose Rendering (Continued)**

Then Śāriputra again pleaded with the Buddha: "World-Honored One, we pray you, speak! We pray you, speak! In this assembly today, there are hundreds of thousands of millions like myself, who in lifetime after lifetime have been taught by the Buddha. Such people as these will surely be able to believe. For them, it will bring peace and great benefit for a long night."

Then Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

#### **Illuminating Verse Rendering (Part 5)**

*O Peerless One, we pray you, speak the highest truth,*
*I, your eldest son, ask for the final proof.*
*This boundless assembly can believe this word,*
*For you have taught them, and their hearts are stirred.*

*We press our palms and wait, a thousand strong,*
*To hear the truth for which we’ve waited long.*
*And when we hear it, from our doubt set free,*
*Our hearts will fill with great felicity.*

***

#### **Lyrical Prose Rendering (Continued)**

Then the World-Honored One said to Śāriputra: "Since you have so earnestly pleaded three times, how can I not speak? Now listen well, and consider it deeply. I will explain it for you."

As he spoke these words, in the assembly there were five thousand bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who immediately rose from their seats, bowed to the Buddha, and withdrew. Why? The roots of their wrongdoing were deep, and their arrogance was great. They imagined they had attained what they had not attained, and that they had realized what they had not realized. With such faults, they could not stay. The World-Honored One remained silent and did not stop them.

Then the Buddha said to Śāriputra: "In this assembly now, I am free of branches and leaves. There is only the pure and true. Śāriputra, it is good that such arrogant people have left. Now listen well, for I will speak for you."

Śāriputra said, "Yes, indeed, World-Honored One. We are eager to hear."

The Buddha told Śāriputra: "Such a wondrous Dharma as this is only spoken by the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, on rare occasions, just as the uḍumbara flower appears but once in a great while. Śāriputra, you and all here must believe what the Buddha says; my words are not empty.

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas teach the Dharma according to what is appropriate, but its true intent is difficult to understand. Why? Because I use countless expedient means, various causes, conditions, parables, and phrases to explain the dharmas. This Dharma is not something that can be understood through thinking or discrimination. Only the Buddhas can understand it.

"Why? Because the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world for one great reason alone. Śāriputra, what is this 'one great reason'? The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world because they wish to open the gate of the Buddha's wisdom to all living beings, to allow them to attain purity. They appear in the world to show the Buddha's wisdom to living beings. They appear in the world to cause living beings to awaken to the Buddha's wisdom. They appear in the world to lead living beings into the path of the Buddha's wisdom. Śāriputra, this is the one great reason why the Buddhas appear in the world."

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, only teach and transform Bodhisattvas. All that they do is always for this one purpose: to show and awaken living beings to the Buddha's wisdom. Śāriputra, the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma to living beings with only the One Buddha Vehicle. There are no other vehicles, not two, and not three. Śāriputra, the Dharma of all the Buddhas in the ten directions is also like this.

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the past used countless expedient means, various causes, conditions, parables, and phrases to explain the dharmas for living beings. This Dharma was all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. And all those living beings who heard the Dharma from the Buddhas ultimately attained All-Knowing Wisdom.

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the future who will appear in the world will also use countless expedient means, various causes, conditions, parables, and phrases to explain the dharmas for living beings. This Dharma will all be for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. And all those living beings who hear the Dharma from the Buddhas will ultimately attain All-Knowing Wisdom.

"Śāriputra, in the present, in all the countless Buddha-lands of the ten directions, the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, who bring so much benefit and peace to living beings, also use countless expedient means, various causes, conditions, parables, and phrases to explain the dharmas for living beings. This Dharma is all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. And all those living beings who hear the Dharma from the Buddhas ultimately attain All-Knowing Wisdom.

"Śāriputra, all these Buddhas only teach and transform Bodhisattvas, because they wish to show living beings the Buddha's wisdom, because they wish to awaken living beings to the Buddha's wisdom, and because they wish to lead living beings into the Buddha's wisdom.

"Śāriputra, I too am now the same. Knowing that living beings have various desires and deep-seated attachments, I, according to their natures, use various causes, conditions, parables, and the power of expedient means to teach the Dharma for them. Śāriputra, this is all so that they may attain the One Buddha Vehicle and the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions, there are not even two vehicles, how could there be three? Śāriputra, the Buddhas appear in the five turbid, evil ages—the kalpa-turbidity, the kleśa-turbidity, the sattva-turbidity, the dṛṣṭi-turbidity, and the āyus-turbidity. Thus, Śāriputra, in the chaos of the kalpa-turbidity, living beings are thick with grime, they are greedy, envious, and they develop unwholesome roots. Therefore, the Buddhas, with the power of expedient means, distinguish the One Buddha Vehicle and teach it as three.

"Śāriputra, if any of my disciples claim to be Arhats or pratyekabuddhas, but they do not hear and do not know that the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, only teach and transform Bodhisattvas, then they are not the Buddha's disciples. They are not Arhats. They are not pratyekabuddhas.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra, if there are bhikṣus or bhikṣuṇīs who claim they have already attained Arhatship, that this is their final body, and that they have reached ultimate nirvāṇa, and they no longer seek Anuttarā Samyak-saṃbodhi, you should know that these people are all people of extreme arrogance. Why? Because it is not possible for a bhikṣu who has truly attained Arhatship to not believe in this Dharma. The only exception would be after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa, when there is no Buddha present. Why? Because after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa, people who can receive, hold, read, recite, and understand the meaning of sūtras such as this will be difficult to find. But if they meet another Buddha, they will attain resolution in this Dharma.

"Śāriputra, you and all here should single-mindedly believe, understand, receive, and hold the words of the Buddha. The words of the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, are not empty or false. There are no other vehicles. There is only the One Buddha Vehicle."

Then the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

#### **Illuminating Verse Rendering (Part 6)**

*The five thousand left, the proud, the blind, the lost,*
*The chaff now scattered, at so great a cost.*
*The Buddha watched them, with a silent gaze,*
*And spoke, "The branches fall, the true trunk stays."*

*"My teaching is not for the weak of heart,*
*For those who think they’ve finished, from the start.*
*This truth is rare, a flower in the stone,*
*A single vehicle, and one alone."*

*"I see your hearts, your desires and your fears,*
*Your karmic patterns, through a thousand years.*
*And so I speak in parables and signs,*
*In countless ways, to open up your minds."*

*"For those who suffer, who are dull and slow,*
*Who cling to life, and cannot let it go,*
*I speak of Nirvāṇa, a rest from all the pain,*
*A skillful shelter, from the wind and rain."*

*"But I have never said, 'Your journey's done,'*
*I only waited, till the time had come.*
*And now the time is right, the moment near,*
*To speak the Great Way, and make the meaning clear."*

*"There are no two ways, there are not even three,*
*Except as skillful means, to set you free.*
*The Buddhas only have one single deed,*
*To plant in every heart, the Buddha-seed."*

*"I am the father, of this burning land,*
*And all are my children, I take you by the hand.*
*I would be greedy, if I kept the best,*
*And only offered, a temporary rest."*

*"My vow was always, from the very start,*
*To give to all, the wisdom of my heart.*
*To make you equal, to me and all the rest,*
*To pass to every being, the final test."*

*"But those without wisdom, they turn and walk away,*
*Lost in their senses, they will not hear or stay.*
*Blinded by craving, like the yak loves its tail,*
*They cannot see the truth, behind the veil."*

*"And so I paused, when I first saw the light,*
*This truth is too subtle, for their dark night.*
*'How can I save them?' I thought, in despair,*
*'I should not speak, but enter Nirvāṇa's air.'*

*"But all the Buddhas, of the directions ten,*
*Appeared and told me, 'You must speak again!*
*We too used methods, we too spoke of three,*
*To lead all beings, to the one great sea.'*

*"And so I teach, as all the Buddhas do,*
*A single truth, for the many and the few.*
*So cast away your doubts, and have no fear,*
*The One and Only Vehicle, is here."*

***

**Kai's Reflection:**

"Chapter Two is the heart of the matter. It's where the Buddha pulls back the curtain. The challenge here is immense. How do you convey the idea of a truth so profound that it can't be spoken directly, yet must be spoken? The prose needed to be exceptionally clear, especially when listing the 'ten suchnesses' and explaining the 'one great reason.' I tried to make the language precise but not academic, to let the rhythm of the sentences carry the weight of the philosophy.

"The departure of the five thousand is a moment of profound drama and compassion. It's not a condemnation, but a sad acknowledgment of how arrogance can be a barrier to the deepest truths. The Buddha's silence is as powerful as his words.

"For the verse, I focused on the core tension: the Buddha's desire to speak the truth versus his compassionate understanding that not everyone is ready to hear it. The poetry attempts to capture his initial hesitation, the encouragement from other Buddhas, and his final, resolute declaration of the One Vehicle. It's a dialogue between the absolute and the relative, between the ultimate truth and the loving, 'expedient means' used to guide us there. It's the central, beautiful, and difficult dance of the entire sutra."
