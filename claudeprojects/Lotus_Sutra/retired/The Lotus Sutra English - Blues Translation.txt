PREFACE TO THE SPREADING OF THE TEACHING

By Daoxuan of Zhongnan Mountain, Tang Dynasty


Now listen here, this Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra—this here's the original reason why all the Buddhas come down to this world of sorrows. It was wrapped up tight over there in India for more than a thousand years. Then it came on east to China, been here three hundred years and more. Back in the Western Jin Dynasty, when Emperor Hui was ruling during the Yongkang years, there was this Bodhisattva named Dharmarakṣa from Dunhuang, living outside the Blue Gate of Chang'an—he was the first one to translate this teaching, called it the Sutra of the Right Dharma Lotus Flower. Then later on, during the Eastern Jin when Emperor An was on the throne, in the Longan years of the Later Qin, during the Hongshi period, there came a monk from Kucha named Kumārajīva—he translated it next, called it the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra. Later still, during the Renshou period under the Sui Dynasty, at the Great Xingshan Temple, came monks from North India—Jñānagupta and the rest—they translated it too, kept the same name: Wonderful Dharma. So we got three translations, one laid over the other, each one expressing the teaching a little different. But folks mostly honor and spread that Qin translation. There been other partial chapters and separate verses floating around too—they all listed in the records, so I won't go into all that here.

Now see, when the sacred mountain brought forth its spirit, weren't nobody but the Great Sage could open up that teaching. When that transforming power reached out, weren't nothing but the old karmic connections could guide folks' hearts. That's why when the teaching was proclaimed in the Deer Park, people got divided up into small and great capacities. When the Buddha gave his final instructions by the golden river, the paths got distinguished between the partial and the complete teachings. Ain't it so that when the teaching meets the time, there ain't no need to argue about what gathering's higher? That's how come we know five thousand people got up and left the assembly—they was the arrogant ones who needed to advance. Five hundred got their predictions—they was all part of the secret transformation. That's why the Buddha let loose that light and showed them wonders—opened up the source for folks to ask questions. He came out of meditation and praised virtue—let the broad strategy of Buddha wisdom flow on out. That burnt-down house showed the track into the Great Vehicle. That phantom city kept the old connections from falling away. The jewel sewn in the robe showed how the true nature's always right there. The water in the well revealed how awakening comes in all kinds of ways. The words and meanings stand clear as day, but the parables reach way on out there. If it weren't for that great compassion reaching across everything, how could it pull folks up out of the sinking currents where they stuck and drowning? Only that ultimate tender heart could save those lost in confusion, cut off from their true nature.

From the Han Dynasty clear on through to the Tang—six hundred years and more—going through all them scriptures, four thousand scrolls and more, the one that's been most received and kept? Ain't none greater than this sutra right here. Could it be that teaching and capacity knock together like this on account of that dust left behind by Mahābhijñā-jñānābhibhū Buddha? And hearing it with deep respect comes from the lingering merit of King Subhavyūha? So I'm putting this preface right here at the beginning of the sutra, hoping folks might soon purify them six sense organs and look up to that joyful assembly of the Compassionate One. Hoping they might quickly accomplish them four virtues and head toward the mysterious way of the Land of Bliss. Can't never finish praising it—I leave this here for all them generations coming after us.

Chapter One: INTRODUCTION


Now this is what I heard, let me tell you true:

One time, the Buddha was staying at the city of Rājagṛha, up on Vulture Peak Mountain, with a great assembly of monks—twelve thousand of them gathered there. Every last one was an arhat, somebody who'd poured out all them defilements, wasn't troubled no more, done got what they came for, exhausted all the bonds of existence, their minds free as a bird. These were their names: Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya, Mahākāśyapa, Uruvilvā-Kāśyapa, Gayā-Kāśyapa, Nadī-Kāśyapa, Śāriputra, Mahāmaudgalyāyana, Mahākātyāyana, Aniruddha, Kapphiṇa, Gavāmpati, Revata, Pilindavatsa, Bakkula, Mahākauṣṭhila, Nanda, Sundarananda, Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra, Subhūti, Ānanda, and Rāhula—all these well-known great arhats and more.

Then there was another two thousand, some still learning and some done with learning. There was the nun Mahāprajāpatī with six thousand sisters. There was Yaśodharā, mother of Rāhula, with her whole company. Plus eighty thousand great Bodhisattvas—every one of them never turning back from that supreme perfect enlightenment, every one done attained them dhāraṇīs. They had that eloquence that comes with joy in speaking Dharma, they turned that wheel of no-return. They'd made offerings to countless hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, planted roots of virtue before all them Buddhas, always getting praised by the Buddhas. They cultivated themselves with compassion, entered deep into Buddha wisdom, penetrated that great knowledge, reached the other shore. Their names was heard throughout countless worlds, could save countless hundreds of thousands of beings. Their names was: Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva, Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, Mahāsthāmaprāpta Bodhisattva, Nityodyukta Bodhisattva, Aniksiptadhura Bodhisattva, Ratnapāṇi Bodhisattva, Bhaiṣajyarāja Bodhisattva, Pradānaśūra Bodhisattva, Ratnacandra Bodhisattva, Candraprabha Bodhisattva, Pūrṇacandra Bodhisattva, Mahāvikramin Bodhisattva, Anantavikramin Bodhisattva, Trailokyavikrama Bodhisattva, Bhadrapāla Bodhisattva, Maitreya Bodhisattva, Ratnākara Bodhisattva, and Susārthavāha Bodhisattva—eighty thousand great Bodhisattvas like these all gathered together.

Now at that time Indra, lord of the gods, was there with twenty thousand divine sons. Then there was Candradevap​utra, Sāgaragharādevap​utra, Ratnaprabha​devap​utra, the Four Great Kings with their entourage of ten thousand divine sons. Īśvara and Maheśvara with their entourage of thirty thousand divine sons. The lord of this Sahā world, the Brahmā King Śikhin, and Great Brahmā Bright Light with their entourage of twelve thousand divine sons. There was eight Dragon Kings: Nanda Dragon King, Upananda Dragon King, Sāgara Dragon King, Vāsukin Dragon King, Takṣaka Dragon King, Anavatapta Dragon King, Manasvin Dragon King, and Utpalaka Dragon King—each one with hundreds of thousands in their entourage. There was four Kinnara Kings: Dharma Kinnara King, Sudharma Kinnara King, Mahādharma Kinnara King, and Dhāraṇadharma Kinnara King—each with hundreds of thousands in their company. There was four Gandharva Kings: Manojna Gandharva King, Manojñasva​ra Gandharva King, Madhura Gandharva King, and Madhu​rasva​ra Gandharva King—each with their entourage of hundreds of thousands. There was four Asura Kings: Balin Asura King, Kharaskandha Asura King, Vemacitrin Asura King, and Rāhu Asura King—each with hundreds of thousands attending. There was four Garuḍa Kings: Mahātejas Garuḍa King, Mahākāya Garuḍa King, Mahāpūrṇa Garuḍa King, and Yathākāmacārin Garuḍa King—each with their entourage of hundreds of thousands. Plus King Ajātaśatru, son of Vaidehī, with hundreds of thousands in his company. Each one bowed at the Buddha's feet, then sat down off to the side.

Now at that time the World-Honored One was surrounded by the fourfold assembly—they was making offerings, showing reverence, respect, and praise. The Buddha was preaching that Mahāyāna sutra called the Immeasurable Meanings, a teaching for Bodhisattvas, something the Buddha keeps close and protects. When the Buddha finished speaking this sutra, he sat down cross-legged, entered into the samādhi of the station of immeasurable meanings—his body and mind completely still. Right then it started raining down divine māndārava flowers, great māndārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, great mañjūṣaka flowers, scattering down on the Buddha and all the great assembly. The whole Buddha world shook in six different ways.

Now at that time in the assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, dragons, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans, plus all them petty kings and wheel-turning sage kings—all this great assembly, they experienced something they never experienced before. They was filled with joy, put their palms together, and gazed at the Buddha with one mind.

Right then the Buddha let loose a light from the white tuft between his eyebrows, lighting up eighteen thousand worlds to the east, wasn't nothing not completely illuminated, down to the Avīci hell below and up to the Akaniṣṭha heaven above. From this world here, you could see the beings in all six paths of rebirth in them lands. You could also see all the Buddhas present in them lands, hear all the sutras them Buddhas was preaching, see all the monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen, all the ones practicing and attaining the Way. You could see all them great Bodhisattvas with their various causes and conditions, various levels of faith and understanding, various appearances, practicing the Bodhisattva path. You could see the Buddhas entering parinirvāṇa. You could see how after them Buddhas entered parinirvāṇa, folks built seven-jeweled stupas with the Buddha's relics.

Right then Maitreya Bodhisattva thought to himself: "Now the World-Honored One's showing this spiritual transformation—what's the cause and condition for such an auspicious sign? Right now the Buddha's entered into samādhi. This inconceivable, rare manifestation—who should I ask about it? Who could answer?" Then he thought again: "This Mañjuśrī, the Dharma Prince, he's already personally served and made offerings to countless Buddhas of the past. He must have seen this rare sign before. I better ask him."

Right then all them monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, plus all the gods, dragons, ghosts, and spirits—they all thinking the same thing: "Who should we ask about this Buddha light, this spiritual transformation?"

Right then Maitreya Bodhisattva, wanting to resolve his own doubts, and also observing the minds of the fourfold assembly—the monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, plus all the gods, dragons, ghosts and spirits, the whole assembly's heart—he asked Mañjuśrī, saying: "What's the cause and condition for this auspicious sign, this spiritual transformation, letting loose this great light, illuminating eighteen thousand lands to the east, revealing all them Buddha countries in their splendor?"

Then Maitreya Bodhisattva, wanting to restate his meaning, spoke in verse:


Mañjuśrī, won't you tell us now—
Why's our Teacher sitting there so still,
That white light shining from his brow,
Lighting up everything, giving everybody chills?

Raining down them māndārava flowers, them mañjūṣaka blooms,
Sandalwood wind blowing sweet, making everybody's heart feel right at home,
On account of this the ground's all purified,
And this whole world shaking six different ways—can't hide!

All four groups filled with joy,
Bodies and minds feeling something they ain't never felt,
That light between his eyebrows like heaven's own envoy,
Shining east across eighteen thousand worlds, every card dealt.

From Avīci hell way down below,
Clear on up to the highest heaven's door,
In all them worlds we can see the show—
The six paths of beings, can't ask for more.

Life and death and where folks go,
Good karma, bad karma—how they gonna fare,
How they look when they reap what they sow,
Right here and now we see it all laid bare.

We see them Buddhas too, them holy lion kings,
Teaching sutras so subtle and so fine,
With voices pure and clear as mountain springs,
Teaching countless millions, every word divine.

That profound Brahma voice, makes you wanna stay and hear,
In each world they're speaking truth,
With countless parables making the Dharma clear,
Lighting up Buddha wisdom for the old and the youth.

If somebody's suffering, worn down by age and pain,
Sick of death and dying, can't break free,
They teach nirvāṇa—end of sorrow's chain,
Show how suffering can cease to be.

If somebody's blessed, done made offerings before,
Seeking victory's Dharma, a higher kind of learning,
They teach about pratyekabuddhas—open that door,
Keep that solitary wisdom fire burning.

If there's a Buddha's child walking the path so wide,
Seeking the supreme wisdom, that understanding pure,
They teach the clean way, be their guide,
Lead them to enlightenment for sure.

Mañjuśrī, where I'm sitting right here,
I done seen and heard thousands of billions of things,
So many wonders, let me make it clear—
Just gonna tell a little of what this vision brings.

I see in them lands, Bodhisattvas like Ganges sand,
With all kinds of causes, seeking Buddha's Way,
Some giving alms with a generous hand—
Gold, silver, coral, what they give away.

Pearls and māṇi jewels so bright,
Mother-of-pearl, agate, diamonds and such,
Servants, carriages, precious things in the light,
Jeweled palanquins—giving away so much!

Turning it all toward Buddha's Way,
Hoping to get that supreme vehicle,
The greatest in the triple world, they say,
All the Buddhas praising it—that's the miracle.

Some Bodhisattvas giving treasure-carriages pulled by four fine horses,
With railings and canopies, all decorated fine,
Others I see giving their bodies without remorse—
Their flesh, hands, feet, wives, and children on the line.

Other Bodhisattvas giving their heads, their eyes, their bodies whole,
Happy to give it all, seeking Buddha's knowledge,
Mañjuśrī, I see kings who done sold their soul—
Come to Buddha asking about the supreme Way, leaving their privilege.

Abandoning their pleasant lands, their palaces and consorts dear,
Shaving their heads and beards, putting on them Dharma robes,
Some Bodhisattvas becoming monks right here,
Dwelling alone in quiet, studying sutras like wise old folks.

Others I see with courage, filled with vigor, can't be stopped,
Entering deep in them mountains, contemplating Buddha's Way,
Others who done left desire, never gonna be co-opted,
Dwelling in empty places, deep in meditation day after day.

Got five spiritual powers on account of that—
Bodhisattvas sitting peaceful with palms together tight,
With thousands and millions of verses, imagine that!
Praising them Dharma Kings with all their might.

I see Bodhisattvas with wisdom deep and will so strong,
Able to question Buddhas, receiving and holding all they hear,
Others with concentration and wisdom, walking right along,
Using countless parables teaching the assembly without fear.

Happy to teach the Dharma, converting other Bodhisattvas too,
Breaking up demon armies, beating that Dharma drum—
Bodhisattvas sitting silent, serene and true,
Even when gods and dragons honor them, don't let it make them numb.

Others dwelling in forests, radiating light,
Saving hell-beings from torment, leading them to Buddha's gate,
Buddha's children who ain't never sleeping at night,
Walking through forests, seeking Buddha-Way early and late.

Others perfect in precepts, their conduct got no flaw,
Pure as a jewel, seeking Buddha's path,
Others dwelling in patience—it's like natural law—
Even when arrogant folks curse and beat, they don't feel wrath.

Bodhisattvas leaving behind jokes and foolish kin,
Getting close to wise folks, leaving confusion in the dust,
Single-mindedly casting out distraction, gathering themselves in,
In mountain forests for billions of years—in the Way they trust.

Some Bodhisattvas giving fine food and drink,
Hundred kinds of medicines and teas,
Fine clothes worth more than you'd think,
Or priceless robes—given with ease.

Billions of kinds of sandalwood treasure halls they're building,
All kinds of wonderful beds and cushions fine,
Clean gardens with flowers and fruit, so willing,
Flowing springs and bathing pools—it's all by design.

Giving like this—all kind of wonderful forms,
Doing it with joy and never getting tired,
Seeking that supreme Way that transforms—
That's the path to which they're inspired.

Some Bodhisattvas teaching about nirvāṇa, that still and silent state,
Teaching countless beings in all kind of ways,
Others observing the nature of dharmas, ain't no duplicate—
No dual characteristics, empty as space, they say.

Buddha's children with minds attached to nothing at all,
Using this wonderful wisdom, seeking the supreme Way,
Mañjuśrī, other Bodhisattvas I recall,
After Buddha's extinction, making offerings to relics day by day.

Building countless stupas, numerous as Ganges sand,
Adorning whole countries with them towers so tall,
Jeweled stupas high and wondrous across the land—
Five thousand yojanas high, that ain't small!

Two thousand yojanas wide and straight every way,
Each stupa got thousands of banners streaming,
Jeweled bells tinkling, swaying in the bay,
Latticed canopies and banners gleaming.

Gods, dragons, humans and non-humans in attendance,
With incense, flowers, and music, always making offerings there,
Mañjuśrī, Buddha's children with such reverence,
Making offerings to relics, adorning stupas with care.

Whole countries naturally wonderful and special, can you believe?
Like them heavenly king trees when they're in bloom,
Buddha letting loose one light that won't deceive—
Me and this assembly seeing these countries, dispelling gloom.

Buddha's spiritual powers and wisdom so rare,
Letting loose one pure light illuminating countless lands,
We seeing all this, ain't never seen nothing to compare—
Buddha's son Mañjuśrī, we waiting on your words, all these bands.

This fourfold assembly looking up at you and me both,
Wanting to know—why's the World-Honored One letting loose this light?
Buddha's son, now's the time, don't be loath—
Answer and remove our doubts, make everything right.

What benefit's gonna come from this radiance we see?
The Dharma Buddha attained sitting at the place of enlightenment—
Is he about to teach it, set the truth free?
Or is he giving predictions, making some announcement?

Showing us these Buddha lands with their jeweled purity,
Plus seeing all these Buddhas—this ain't no small affair,
Mañjuśrī, you gotta know the answer with security—
Four groups, dragons and gods all gazing at you with care.

What you gonna tell us? What's about to go down?


Right then Mañjuśrī spoke to Maitreya Bodhisattva Mahāsattva and all them great beings, and them good sons, saying: "The way I figure it, the World-Honored One's about to preach that great Dharma, rain down that great Dharma rain, blow that great Dharma conch, beat that great Dharma drum, proclaim that great Dharma meaning. Good sons, I've seen this auspicious sign before with past Buddhas. After they let loose this light, they preached the great Dharma. Therefore you should know that when the Buddha's showing this light now, it's the same way—he wants to let all beings hear and know about that Dharma that's hard to believe in all the worlds, so he's showing this auspicious sign.

"Good sons, way back in the past, countless, limitless, inconceivable, immeasurable kalpas ago—can't even count that far back—there was a Buddha called Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-sambuddha, One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. He proclaimed the right Dharma—good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end. The meaning was profound, the language skillful, pure and unmixed, complete and perfect, revealing the characteristics of pure conduct. For those seeking to be śrāvakas, he taught in accordance with the Four Noble Truths—crossing over birth, old age, sickness and death, ultimately reaching nirvāṇa. For those seeking to be pratyekabuddhas, he taught in accordance with the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. For the Bodhisattvas, he taught in accordance with the Six Pāramitās, enabling them to attain supreme perfect enlightenment, accomplishing the knowledge of all modes.

"Next there was another Buddha, also named Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness. Then another Buddha, also named Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness. Like this there was twenty thousand Buddhas, all with the same name—Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness—and all with the same family name: Bharadvāja. Maitreya, you should know, from the first Buddha to the last Buddha, they all had the same name: Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness, perfect in the ten epithets. The Dharma they taught was good in the beginning, middle, and end. That very last Buddha, before he left home, had eight princes: the first named Possessing Meaning, second named Good Meaning, third named Immeasurable Meaning, fourth named Treasure Meaning, fifth named Increasing Meaning, sixth named Meaning that Removes Doubt, seventh named Meaning Facing Forward, eighth named Dharma Meaning. These eight princes had awesome virtue and freedom—each one ruled over four continents. When these princes heard their father had left home and attained supreme perfect enlightenment, they all abandoned their royal positions and followed him into homelessness. They generated the Mahāyāna intention, constantly cultivated pure conduct, all became Dharma teachers, and had already planted roots of goodness before thousands of myriads of Buddhas."

"Now at that time, Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness Buddha preached that Mahāyāna sutra called Immeasurable Meanings—a teaching for Bodhisattvas, something the Buddha keeps close and protects. After he finished preaching this sutra, right there in the great assembly he sat down cross-legged and entered into the samādhi of the station of immeasurable meanings, his body and mind completely still. Right then it started raining down divine māndārava flowers, great māndārava flowers, mañjūṣaka flowers, great mañjūṣaka flowers, scattering on the Buddha and all the great assembly. The whole Buddha world shook in six different ways. Now at that time in the assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, dragons, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans and non-humans, plus all them petty kings and wheel-turning sage kings—all this great assembly experienced something they never experienced before, filled with joy, put their palms together and gazed at the Buddha with one mind.

"Right then the Tathāgata let loose a light from the white tuft between his eyebrows, lighting up eighteen thousand Buddha lands to the east, completely illuminated, just like what we seeing now in these Buddha lands. Maitreya, you should know that at that time in the assembly there was two billion Bodhisattvas who loved to hear the Dharma. These Bodhisattvas saw this light universally illuminating the Buddha lands, experienced what they'd never experienced before, and wanted to know the cause and condition for this light. At that time there was a Bodhisattva named Wonderful Light who had eight hundred disciples. Right then Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness Buddha came up out of samādhi and, on account of Wonderful Light Bodhisattva, preached that Mahāyāna sutra called the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower—a teaching for Bodhisattvas, something the Buddha keeps close and protects. For sixty small kalpas he didn't get up from that seat. And the folks listening in the assembly, they also sat in one place for sixty small kalpas, their bodies and minds not moving, listening to what the Buddha preached, and it seemed like just a meal's time. At that time in the assembly, there wasn't a single person whose body or mind became weary.

"After Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness Buddha preached this sutra for sixty small kalpas, right there among the Brahmās, māras, śramaṇas, brahmins, gods, humans, and asuras, he proclaimed these words: 'The Tathāgata at midnight tonight will enter complete nirvāṇa.' At that time there was a Bodhisattva named Virtue Store, and Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness Buddha gave him a prediction. He told all the monks: 'This Virtue Store Bodhisattva will be the next to become a Buddha, with the title Pure Body Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-Sambuddha.' After the Buddha gave this prediction, at midnight he entered complete nirvāṇa. After the Buddha's extinction, Wonderful Light Bodhisattva upheld the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra and preached it to folks for a full eighty small kalpas. The eight sons of Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness Buddha all took Wonderful Light as their teacher. Wonderful Light taught and transformed them, making them firm in supreme perfect enlightenment. These princes made offerings to countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas and then all attained Buddhahood. The last one to become a Buddha was named Dīpaṃkara. Among the eight hundred disciples, there was one person named Seeker of Fame—he was greedy for profit and offerings. Though he recited many sutras, he didn't understand them properly and forgot most of what he learned, so he was called Seeker of Fame. But this person, on account of having planted various good roots, was able to meet countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas and made offerings to them with reverence, respect, and praise.

"Maitreya, you should know—that Wonderful Light Bodhisattva back then, you think he was somebody else? He was me! And that Seeker of Fame Bodhisattva was you! Now seeing this auspicious sign ain't no different from back then, so I'm figuring that today the Tathāgata's about to preach that Mahāyāna sutra called the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower—a teaching for Bodhisattvas, something the Buddha keeps close and protects."

Right then Mañjuśrī, wanting to restate his meaning in the great assembly, spoke in verse:


I remember way back in ages past,
Countless, immeasurable kalpas ago,
There was a Buddha—greatest of men at last—
Named Sun-Moon-Lamp Brightness, don't you know.

The World-Honored One proclaimed the Dharma then,
Saved countless beings, can you believe?
Countless billions of Bodhisattvas, women and men,
Helped them Buddha wisdom to receive.

Before the Buddha left the palace and home,
He had eight princes, each one so fine,
Seeing the Great Sage leave that royal dome,
They followed him in practicing the pure divine.

Then the Buddha preached that Mahāyāna way,
The sutra called Immeasurable Meanings,
Among the great assembly, hear what I say,
He distinguished it all in his teachings.

After the Buddha finished preaching that law,
Right there on the Dharma seat where he'd been,
He sat cross-legged in samādhi—that's what I saw—
Called the Station of Immeasurable Meanings, amen.

Heaven rained down māndārava flowers sweet,
Heavenly drums sounding all on their own,
All them gods, dragons, ghosts and spirits meet,
Making offerings to the one on that throne.

All the Buddha lands right then,
Shook with a mighty trembling all around,
Buddha let loose that light between his brow, and when
It shone, rare things could be found.

This light illuminated to the east,
Eighteen thousand Buddha lands bright,
Showing all beings—from greatest to least—
The places where life, death, and karma unite.

Some saw Buddha lands there,
Adorned with all kinds of jewels so pretty,
Lapis and crystal colors everywhere—
All on account of Buddha's light lighting up the city.

Saw gods and humans too,
Dragons, spirits, yakṣas in that crowd,
Gandharvas and kinnaras—the whole crew—
Each one making offerings, heads bowed.

Saw all them Tathāgatas as well,
Naturally accomplishing the Buddha Way,
Bodies colored like golden mountains, I tell,
Dignified and wonderful beyond what words can say.

Like pure lapis lazuli stone
With real gold statues shining inside,
The World-Honored One on his throne,
Expounding deep Dharma meanings far and wide.

In every single Buddha land,
Countless śrāvakas gathered there,
On account of Buddha's light so grand,
We could see each assembly everywhere.

Some monks dwelling in mountain forests deep,
Vigorously upholding pure precepts tight,
Guarding them like jewels they keep—
That's what we saw in that light.

Saw Bodhisattvas too, you see,
Practicing giving, patience and more,
Numerous as Ganges sand, free—
All on account of Buddha's light we saw.

Other Bodhisattvas entering deep,
Into all kinds of meditation,
Bodies and minds still as sleep,
Seeking supreme enlightenment, no hesitation.

Other Bodhisattvas who done understood
The characteristics of dharmas—still and extinct,
In their own lands doing what they should,
Teaching Dharma, seeking Buddha Way distinct.

Right then the fourfold assembly there,
Seeing Sun-Moon-Lamp Buddha's great spiritual might,
Their hearts filled with joy beyond compare,
Asking each other about what they'd seen that night.

"What's the cause and condition for this thing?"
The one honored by gods and humans just then,
Came up out of samādhi like a king,
Praised Wonderful Light Bodhisattva again:

"You the eye of the world, it's true,
Trusted and honored by everyone here,
You can uphold the Dharma treasure through and through,
The Dharma I've preached, only you can make it clear."

The World-Honored One, after praising him like that,
Made Wonderful Light rejoice and feel blessed,
Then preached the Lotus Sutra where he sat,
For sixty small kalpas without no rest.

All that wonderful supreme Dharma taught,
This Wonderful Light Dharma Teacher could uphold,
After Buddha preached the Lotus, having wrought
Joy in the assembly, the story's told—

Right away that very day,
He told the assembly of gods and humans:
"The real characteristics of dharmas, I did say—
The meaning's been explained in these sermons.

At midnight tonight, don't you cry,
I'm about to enter nirvāṇa's door,
So you single-mindedly strive, don't be shy,
Stay away from laziness forevermore.

Buddhas are mighty hard to meet,
Once in billions of kalpas, maybe one appears."
The World-Honored One's children, hearing that bittersweet
News about nirvāṇa, was filled with fears.

They each was carrying grief and pain:
"How come Buddha's extinction's coming so fast?"
The Holy Lord, the Dharma King, tried to explain,
Comforting countless folks amassed:

"When I enter final rest, don't fret,
This Virtue Store Bodhisattva here,
He's penetrated the real characteristics, you bet,
He'll be the next Buddha—have no fear.

His title gonna be Pure Body, that's his name,
He'll save countless beings too."
That night the Buddha's extinction came,
Like firewood burning through and through.

His relics got distributed all around,
Countless stupas got raised up high,
Monks and nuns in numbers that astound,
Like Ganges sand, redoubled their efforts to try.

Seeking that supreme Way with all their might,
This Wonderful Light Dharma Teacher remained,
Upholding the Buddha's Dharma treasure tight,
For eighty small kalpas the Lotus he explained.

Them eight princes, every one,
Was taught and opened up by Wonderful Light,
Made firm on the supreme Way—wasn't done—
Gonna see countless Buddhas, that's right.

After making offerings to Buddhas galore,
Following and practicing the Great Way,
One after another they became Buddhas for sure,
Each one getting predictions in their day.

The last one, that Heaven of Heavens,
Was named Dīpaṃkara Buddha, don't you see,
Guide of sages through the eleven heavens,
Saving countless beings to set them free.

Now this Wonderful Light Dharma Teacher,
Had himself a disciple back then,
Whose heart was lazy—not a devoted preacher—
Greedy for fame and gain again and again.

Seeking fame and profit without end,
Hanging around rich folks' homes all day,
Abandoning what he'd studied, my friend,
Forgetting it all, letting it slip away.

On account of this, they gave him a name:
"Seeker of Fame"—that's what they'd say,
But he also practiced good works just the same,
Got to see countless Buddhas along the way.

Made offerings to all them Buddhas bright,
Following and practicing the Great Way,
Perfected them six pāramitās right,
Now sees Śākyamuni today.

Later on he gonna become a Buddha too,
Named Maitreya—that's his title then,
Gonna save countless beings, it's true,
Numbers beyond measure, again and again.

That lazy one after Buddha passed—
That's you, Maitreya, understand?
And that Wonderful Light Dharma Teacher from the past—
Right now that's me where I stand.

I saw Lamp Brightness Buddha's light back when,
The original auspicious sign was like this here,
So I know our Buddha now, once again,
Is about to preach the Lotus—it's clear!

This sign's like the original one we saw,
It's the Buddhas' expedient means at play,
Now the Buddha's letting loose light to restore
And help reveal the real characteristics today.

Y'all should know right now,
Put your palms together, wait with one mind,
Buddha gonna rain down Dharma—and how!—
Satisfying all them Dharma-seekers he can find.

If folks seeking the three vehicles got doubts,
Any regrets or hesitation in their hearts,
Buddha gonna cut through them all, no bouts—
Gonna eliminate every last bit, every part.

Chapter Two: EXPEDIENT MEANS


Right then, the World-Honored One came up peaceful and composed out of that samādhi, and told Śāriputra: "The wisdom of the Buddhas—it's deep beyond measure, and that wisdom door's hard to understand, hard to enter into. Ain't no śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas can know it. Why's that? Well, the Buddha's personally attended on hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of countless Buddhas, completely practiced all them Buddhas' immeasurable path-methods, vigorously and courageously advanced—his name heard everywhere. He's accomplished the profoundly deep, unprecedented Dharma. What he says according to the situation, the meaning's hard to grasp. Śāriputra, ever since I became a Buddha, I've used all kinds of causes and conditions, all kinds of parables, broadly proclaimed my teaching,  used countless expedient means to guide beings, getting them to leave behind all them attachments. Why's that? Because the Tathāgata's expedient means, knowledge, vision, and pāramitās are all completely fulfilled. Śāriputra, the Tathāgata's knowledge and vision is vast, great, deep, and far-reaching—immeasurable, unobstructed. The powers, fearlessnesses, dhyānas, liberations, samādhis—they penetrate deep without limit, accomplishing all unprecedented dharmas. Śāriputra, the Tathāgata can make all kinds of distinctions, skillfully explain all dharmas. His words are gentle and soft, gladdening everybody's hearts. Śāriputra, to put it simply: the Buddha has completely accomplished immeasurable, limitless, unprecedented dharmas."

"Stop, Śāriputra, no need to say more. Why? Because what the Buddha's accomplished—that foremost rare and hard-to-understand Dharma—only a Buddha together with a Buddha can fully fathom the real characteristics of all dharmas. That is to say: the characteristics of dharmas are thus, their nature is thus, their substance is thus, their power is thus, their function is thus, their causes are thus, their conditions are thus, their effects are thus, their retributions are thus, and their beginning and end are ultimately thus."

Right then the World-Honored One, wanting to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:


The World Hero can't be measured, friend,
All the gods and worldly folk,
Every kind of being from start to end—
Can't nobody know the Buddha, ain't no joke.

Buddha's powers and fearlessnesses too,
Liberation and all them samādhis,
Plus all them other Buddha-dharmas true—
Can't nobody measure these.

Originally from countless Buddhas learning,
Completely practiced all them paths and ways,
That profound, subtle, wonderful Dharma burning—
Hard to see, hard to understand through all your days.

For immeasurable billions of kalpas gone by,
Practicing all these paths till done,
At the place of enlightenment, reaching high,
I know it all—yes every one.

This great fruition and reward so vast,
All kinds of characteristics and natures within,
Me and the Buddhas in ten directions, we grasp
What only Buddhas can truly begin.

This Dharma can't be shown, you see,
Words and characteristics are extinguished still,
All other kinds of beings, they can't be free—
Nobody can understand it at their will.

Except the Bodhisattva crowd,
Whose faith and power stand firm and strong,
The Buddha's disciples who bowed
To countless Buddhas all along,

Who poured out all their outflows complete,
Dwelling in this final body here—
Even these folks, I repeat,
Their power ain't sufficient, let's be clear.

Even if the whole world was filled,
Every one like Śāriputra wise,
Thinking together, hearts stilled—
Couldn't measure Buddha wisdom, no surprise.

Even if filling all ten directions,
Every one like Śāriputra there,
Plus all his disciples in them sections,
Also filling ten direction worlds everywhere,

Thinking together, trying to measure—
Still couldn't know it, that's a fact.
Pratyekabuddhas with sharp intelligence treasure,
In their final flawless body intact,

Filling up all ten direction spheres,
Numerous as bamboo in a grove,
Together in one mind through billions of years,
Wanting to think about Buddha's true wisdom drove—

Couldn't know even a little part.
Newly resolved Bodhisattvas bright,
Who made offerings to countless Buddhas from the start,
Understand all meanings right,

And can skillfully explain the Dharma way,
Like rice, hemp, bamboo and reeds,
Filling up the ten directions, I say,
With one mind and wonderful wisdom that leads,

For Ganges sand kalpas they all calculate,
Still couldn't know the Buddha's wisdom straight.

Non-retreating Bodhisattvas pure,
Numerous as Ganges sand,
Thinking together, seeking to be sure—
Still couldn't know or understand.

I'm telling you again, Śāriputra, here it is:
The flawless, inconceivable way,
That profound, subtle, wonderful Dharma, yes—
I've completely attained it today.

Only I know these characteristics true,
And all the Buddhas in ten directions too.
Śāriputra, you should know,
The Buddha's words don't vary, high or low.

Regarding the Dharma the Buddha's explained,
You should generate great power of faith.
After the World-Honored One's Dharma long remained,
He'll certainly speak the truth at last—that's his way.

Telling all them śrāvaka folks,
And those seeking the pratyekabuddha vehicle,
I freed them from suffering's yokes,
And they reached nirvāṇa—ain't that a miracle?

The Buddha with expedient power's touch,
Shows them the teaching of three vehicles,
'Cause beings get attached so much—
Leads them out through these principles.


Now at that time in that great assembly, there was them śrāvakas whose outflows was exhausted, arhats like Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya and them others—twelve hundred folks—plus them who'd generated the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha mind, monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. They each thought to themselves: "Why's the World-Honored One so earnestly praising expedient means, saying things like: 'The Dharma the Buddha's attained is profoundly deep and hard to understand. What he says, the meaning's hard to know. All them śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas can't reach it.' The Buddha explained the one meaning of liberation, and we also attained this Dharma, reaching nirvāṇa, but now we don't know where this meaning's heading."

Right then Śāriputra, knowing the four assemblies' minds was filled with doubt, and he himself wasn't clear either, so he addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, what's the cause and condition? Why you so earnestly praising the Buddhas' foremost expedient means, this profoundly deep, subtle, wonderful, hard-to-understand Dharma? From way back, I've never heard the Buddha speak like this. Now the four assemblies all got doubts. We earnestly hope the World-Honored One will explain this matter. World-Honored One, why you so earnestly praising this profoundly deep, subtle, wonderful, hard-to-understand Dharma?"

Right then Śāriputra, wanting to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:


Sun of Wisdom, Great Holy Honored One,
After so long you finally preach this Dharma now,
Saying you've attained powers, fearlessness—every one—
Samādhis, meditations, liberations—taking a bow.

Inconceivable dharmas from the place of enlightenment,
Nobody can even ask about what you found there,
My intention's hard to measure, that's the predicament—
Nobody can ask—ain't nobody dare.

Without being asked, you speaking on your own,
Praising the path you walked, the Way you took,
Wisdom so subtle and wonderful, fully grown—
What all them Buddhas got—just take a look.

All them flawless arhats here,
And folks seeking nirvāṇa too,
Now they all fallen in doubt's snare—
Buddha, why you saying what you do?

Those seeking pratyekabuddha's way,
Monks and nuns in this place,
Gods, dragons, ghosts and spirits, I say,
Plus gandharvas and the rest of that race,

Looking at each other, hearts full of doubt,
Gazing up at the Two-Footed Honored One—
What's this all about?
Please, Buddha, explain what you've begun.

Among all them śrāvakas here,
The Buddha said I'm number one,
But now regarding my own wisdom, I fear,
I'm confused and can't get it done.

Is this the ultimate Dharma we seek?
Or is this the path we're supposed to tread?
We're Buddha's sons, born from his mouth when he speak,
Palms together, gazing up, waiting to be fed.

Hope you'll let loose that subtle, wonderful sound,
Tell us truly in this very hour.
Gods, dragons, spirits—Ganges sand all around—
Bodhisattvas seeking Buddha in great power,

Eighty thousand strong and more,
Plus wheel-turning sage kings here,
From myriads of billions of lands they pour,
Palms together with reverent minds sincere,

Wanting to hear the complete path explained.


Right then the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Stop, stop! No need to say more. If I explained this matter, all the gods and people in all the worlds would be startled and doubtful." Śāriputra again addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, please, we hope you'll explain it! We hope you'll explain it! Why? In this assembly there's countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of innumerable beings who've seen Buddhas before. Their faculties are sharp and keen, their wisdom clear and bright. Hearing what the Buddha says, they'll be able to reverently believe."

Right then Śāriputra, wanting to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:


Dharma King, Unsurpassed Honored One,
Please speak it, don't you worry none.
In this assembly, countless folk,
They can reverently believe what you spoke.


The Buddha again stopped Śāriputra: "If I explain this matter, all the gods, humans, and asuras in all the worlds will be startled and doubtful. Arrogant monks will fall into the great pit."

Right then the World-Honored One restated this in verse:


Stop, stop! No need to say,
My Dharma's wonderful and hard to conceive,
All them arrogant folks, I say,
Hearing it, they surely won't believe.


Right then Śāriputra again addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, please, we hope you'll explain it! We hope you'll explain it! Right now in this assembly, folks like us—hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions—in life after life they've already received your transforming teaching. People like these will definitely be able to reverently believe, gaining peace and security through the long night, receiving many benefits."

Right then Śāriputra, wanting to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:


Unsurpassed Two-Footed Honored One,
Please preach the foremost Dharma, don't be late,
I'm the Buddha's eldest son,
Please condescend to explain and elaborate.

This assembly's got countless folks,
They can reverently believe this Dharma here,
Buddha's already, life after life when he spoke,
Taught and transformed people like these, that's clear.

All with one mind, palms together bound,
Wanting to listen and receive the Buddha's word.
We twelve hundred here, plus others around,
Seeking to be Buddhas—let our prayer be heard.

Please, for this assembly's sake, we implore,
Please condescend to explain it more.
Hearing this Dharma, they'll rejoice,
Their hearts leaping, hearing that voice.


Right then the World-Honored One told Śāriputra: "You've earnestly requested three times—how can I not explain? Now listen carefully and think well on it. I'm about to distinguish and explain it for you." When he spoke these words, in the assembly there was monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—five thousand people—who immediately got up from their seats, bowed to the Buddha, and left. Why? Because these folks' roots of transgression was deep and heavy, plus they had arrogance, thinking they'd attained what they hadn't attained, thinking they'd realized what they hadn't realized. Having faults like this, that's why they didn't stay. The World-Honored One remained silent and didn't stop them.

Right then the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Now in this assembly of mine, there ain't no more branches and leaves, only the solid and true. Śāriputra, it's just as well that arrogant people like that left. Now listen well, I'm gonna explain it for you." Śāriputra said: "Yes, World-Honored One, I joyfully desire to hear."

The Buddha told Śāriputra:

"A wonderful Dharma like this—the Tathāgatas only preach it from time to time, just like the udumbara flower that blooms once in a great while. Śāriputra, you should all believe what the Buddha says—his words ain't empty or false. Śāriputra, when the Buddhas preach Dharma according to what's appropriate, the meaning's hard to understand. Why? Because I use countless expedient means—all kinds of causes and conditions, parables and words—to proclaim the Dharma. This Dharma ain't something that thinking and discriminating can understand. Only the Buddhas can know it. Why? Because the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world for one great matter, one great cause and condition. Śāriputra, what do we mean when we say the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world for one great matter, one great cause and condition? The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world because they want to cause beings to open up to the Buddha's knowledge and vision, to help them attain purity—that's why they appear in the world. They appear in the world because they want to show beings the Buddha's knowledge and vision. They appear in the world because they want to cause beings to awaken to the Buddha's knowledge and vision. They appear in the world because they want to cause beings to enter the path of the Buddha's knowledge and vision. Śāriputra, this is why the Buddhas appear in the world for this one great matter, this one great cause and condition."

The Buddha told Śāriputra: "The Tathāgatas only teach and transform Bodhisattvas. Everything they do, it's always for this one matter—just to show and awaken beings with the Buddha's knowledge and vision. Śāriputra, the Tathāgata only preaches Dharma to beings for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. There ain't no other vehicles—no second, no third. Śāriputra, the Dharma of all the Buddhas in the ten directions is also like this.

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the past used immeasurable, countless expedient means—all kinds of causes and conditions, parables and words—to proclaim the Dharma for beings. This Dharma was all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All these beings, hearing the Dharma from the Buddhas, ultimately all attained the knowledge of all modes. Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the future, when they appear in the world, will also use immeasurable, countless expedient means—all kinds of causes and conditions, parables and words—to proclaim the Dharma for beings. This Dharma will all be for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. These beings, hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, will ultimately all attain the knowledge of all modes. Śāriputra, the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, in the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddha lands in the present ten directions—they greatly benefit and bring peace and joy to beings. These Buddhas also use immeasurable, countless expedient means—all kinds of causes and conditions, parables and words—to proclaim the Dharma for beings. This Dharma is all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. These beings, hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, will ultimately all attain the knowledge of all modes. Śāriputra, these Buddhas only teach and transform Bodhisattvas. They want to show beings the Buddha's knowledge and vision. They want to awaken beings to the Buddha's knowledge and vision. They want to cause beings to enter the Buddha's knowledge and vision. Śāriputra, I'm also just like this right now. I know that beings have all kinds of desires, things they're deeply attached to in their hearts. According to their fundamental natures, I use all kinds of causes and conditions, parables, words, and the power of expedient means to preach the Dharma for them. Śāriputra, all of this is so they can attain the One Buddha Vehicle, the knowledge of all modes.

"Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions, there ain't even two vehicles—how much less three! Śāriputra, the Buddhas appear in the evil world of five turbidities—what we call the turbidity of the kalpa, the turbidity of afflictions, the turbidity of beings, the turbidity of views, and the turbidity of lifespan. Like this, Śāriputra, when the kalpa's turbid and in chaos, when beings are heavily defiled, stingy, greedy, and jealous, accomplishing all kinds of unwholesome roots—that's when the Buddhas use the power of expedient means to distinguish and explain three vehicles within the One Buddha Vehicle. Śāriputra, if any of my disciples call themselves arhats or pratyekabuddhas but don't hear about and don't know that the Tathāgatas only teach and transform Bodhisattvas—they ain't Buddha's disciples, they ain't arhats, they ain't pratyekabuddhas.

"Moreover, Śāriputra, these monks and nuns who say they've already attained arhatship, that this is their final body, ultimate nirvāṇa, and then don't aspire to seek supreme perfect enlightenment—you should know these folks are all arrogant people. Why? If there's a monk who's truly attained arhatship, if he don't believe in this Dharma, that's impossible—unless it's after the Buddha's extinction when there's no Buddha present. Why? Because after the Buddha's extinction, folks who receive, uphold, read, recite, and understand the meaning of sutras like this are hard to find. But if they meet another Buddha, then regarding this Dharma they'll immediately gain clear understanding. Śāriputra, you should all single-mindedly believe, understand, receive, and uphold the Buddha's words. The words of the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, ain't empty or false. There ain't no other vehicle—only the One Buddha Vehicle."

Right then the World-Honored One, wanting to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:


Monks and nuns with arrogance in their hearts,
Laymen full of pride, ain't playing their parts,
Laywomen who just don't believe—
About five thousand souls, if you can conceive,

These four kinds of folks all together,
Don't see their own faults, can't get no better,
Their precepts got gaps and holes showing through,
Protecting and cherishing their flaws—ain't nothing new.

These folks with small wisdom done walked out that door,
The chaff in the assembly—ain't here no more,
On account of Buddha's awesome virtue they had to go,
These folks got scarce merit—couldn't handle this show.

This assembly now ain't got no branches and leaves,
Only solid and true folks—that's what this achieves.
Śāriputra, listen well to what I'm about to say,
The Dharma all them Buddhas attained, hear me today.

With immeasurable expedient power and skill,
They preach it to beings, bending to their will,
What beings' hearts are thinking on,
The various paths they're walking down,

All their different desires and their nature too,
Their past lives' good and bad karma coming due—
Buddha knows all this, every single thing,
Using causes, parables, words, and the skill that they bring,

Making everybody happy, that's the aim.
Sometimes preaching sūtras, ain't no game,
Gāthās, legends, stories from way back when,
Jātakas, unprecedented tales again and again.

Preaching about causes and conditions too,
Parables, geyas, and upadeśas—it's true.
Folks with dull roots who love the small way,
Greedily attached to birth and death every day,

Before countless Buddhas they ain't walked that profound, wonderful road,
Troubled and confused by all kinds of suffering—that's their load.
So for them I preach nirvāṇa, setting them free,
I set up this expedient means, you see,

To let them enter into Buddha wisdom in the end,
But I never told y'all, my friend,
That you gonna attain Buddhahood someday—
The reason I never said it? The time wasn't right that way.

But now's the right time, ain't no doubt,
I'm definitely preaching the Mahāyāna—got to shout it out!
These nine divisions of my Dharma here,
I preached according to beings—let me make it clear,

To lead into the Mahāyāna was always the foundation,
That's why I'm preaching this sutra—it's a revelation.
There's Buddha's children with pure hearts,
Gentle, supple, with sharp faculties from the start,

Before immeasurable Buddhas they walked,
That profound, wonderful path where they talked.
For these Buddha's children I preach this Mahāyāna scripture now,
I predict that people like this will become Buddhas—take a bow.

On account of their deep-hearted念Buddha meditation,
And cultivating and upholding pure precepts—that's their foundation.
When these folks hear they gonna attain Buddhahood someday,
Great joy fills their whole body—can't keep it at bay.

Buddha knows their hearts and how they act,
So for them he preaches the Mahāyāna—that's a fact.
Whether śrāvakas or Bodhisattvas who hear,
Even just one verse of the Dharma I preach here,

They all gonna become Buddhas without no doubt.
In Buddha lands throughout the ten directions, hear me shout,
There's only the Dharma of One Vehicle, understand—
No two, no three—that's how it stands.

Except when Buddhas use expedient means to explain,
Just using provisional names to guide beings—ain't in vain—
Speaking about Buddha wisdom, that's the aim.
When Buddhas appear in the world, it's all the same,

Only this one matter's real, I declare,
The other two ain't true—they just ain't there.
The Buddha would never use the Small Vehicle way,
To save and liberate beings—no way, no day!

The Buddha himself dwells in the Mahāyāna grand,
The Dharma he attained, you understand,
Adorned with the power of concentration and wisdom bright,
Using this to save beings—that's right.

Having realized the unsurpassed Way himself,
The Mahāyāna Dharma that's equal for everyone's wealth,
If I was to transform even one person using the Small Vehicle here,
I'd be falling into stinginess and greed—that ain't clear.

If someone has faith and takes refuge in Buddha true,
The Tathāgata don't deceive—that's nothing new,
Also got no greedy or jealous intention at all,
Cut off evil among all dharmas—standing tall.

Therefore among all the Buddhas in ten directions wide,
Buddha alone is fearless—got nothing to hide.
I adorn my body with marks so fine,
My light illuminating the world—let it shine!

Honored by immeasurable multitudes everywhere,
I preach the seal of real characteristics—beware!
Śāriputra, you should know what I'm about to say,
Originally I established vows back in the day,

Wanting to cause all beings to be equal to me,
Just like me, every one—completely free.
The vow I made way back when,
Now it's been fulfilled, again and again.

Transforming all beings, every one,
Causing them to enter the Buddha Way—it's done!
If I met beings along the road,
I'd teach them all the Buddha Way—lighten that load.

But folks without wisdom get all confused,
Deluded, they won't receive the teaching—they refuse.
I know these beings ain't never cultivated good roots before,
Firmly attached to the five desires—can't ask for more,

Through foolishness and craving they generate distress,
On account of desire's causes, no less,
They fall down into the three evil paths below,
Revolving through the six destinies—what a show!

Experiencing all kinds of suffering and pain,
The tiny form received at conception again and again,
Constantly increasing through life after life—
People with little virtue, little fortune, full of strife,

Oppressed by multitudes of sufferings everywhere,
Entering the dense forest of wrong views—beware!
Views about existence, non-existence, and all that,
Depending on these views—imagine that!

Altogether sixty-two kinds of views they got,
Deeply attached to empty, false dharmas—tied in a knot,
Firmly holding on, can't let them go,
Full of arrogance and self-importance—putting on a show,

Flattering and crooked, hearts ain't true,
Through thousands of myriads of billions of kalpas—whew!—
Never hearing the Buddha's name at all,
Never hearing the right Dharma—heading for a fall.

People like this are hard to save, I say,
Therefore, Śāriputra, this is the way:
I set up expedient means to make it work,
Preaching about the paths that end suffering—don't shirk!

Showing them nirvāṇa, that's what I do,
But though I preach nirvāṇa, let me tell you true,
This also ain't real extinction, understand—
From the beginning, all dharmas have always been still—that's how they stand.

When Buddha's children finish walking the path they chose,
In a future life they gonna become Buddhas—that's how it goes.
I got the power of expedient means, you see,
Revealing and teaching the three vehicle Dharma—setting folks free.

All the World-Honored Ones, every one,
All preach the One Vehicle Way—it's done.
Now this whole great assembly here today,
Should eliminate all doubts right away.

The Buddhas' words don't differ, high or low,
Only One Vehicle, no two—I want you to know.
In the past, countless kalpas have gone by,
Immeasurable Buddhas entered extinction—won't lie,

Hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of kinds,
Numbers beyond measure—can't count in your minds.
All these World-Honored Ones back in them days,
Used all kinds of causes, parables, and phrase by phrase,

Countless expedient powers and skill,
Proclaimed the characteristics of dharmas—it was their will.
All these World-Honored Ones, every one,
Preached the One Vehicle Dharma when it was done,

Transforming immeasurable beings with care,
Causing them to enter the Buddha Way—getting them there.
Plus all them Great Holy Lords too,
Knowing all the worlds—what they gonna do—

Gods and humans, all kinds of beings in creation,
What their deep hearts desire—that's their foundation.
They use yet another expedient means to explain,
Helping to reveal the supreme meaning—ain't in vain.

If there's beings who met Buddhas in the past,
Hearing Dharma, giving alms—holding fast,
Or keeping precepts, practicing patience, understand,
Vigor, meditation, wisdom—walking hand in hand,

Cultivating blessings and wisdom in all kinds of ways—
People like these, hear what I say,
They all already became Buddhas—it's true!
After Buddhas entered extinction, ain't nothing new,

If folks had good, gentle hearts inside,
All these beings, on this ride,
They all already attained Buddhahood, every one,
After Buddhas' extinction, when all was said and done.

Those who made offerings to relics with care,
Building myriads of billions of kinds of stupas everywhere,
Made of gold and silver and crystal glass,
Mother-of-pearl and agate—first class!

Rose quartz and lapis pearls so bright,
Pure and broadly adorned—what a sight!
Decorating all them stupas, ain't that grand?
Or building stone temples across the land,

Sandalwood and aloes wood too,
Hovenia, plus other materials—quite a crew—
Brick, tile, mud, and dirt as well.
If in the wilderness—I'm here to tell—

Someone piled up dirt to make a Buddha shrine,
Even kids playing games, building in their time,
Piling up sand to make Buddha stupas there—
People like all these, I declare,

They all already attained Buddhahood, it's true!
If folks for the Buddha's sake—and this includes you—
Built all kinds of images to represent,
Carved and sculpted with intent,

They all already became Buddhas—that's right!
Made with seven treasures shining bright,
Brass, stone, red and white copper found,
White pewter, lead, and tin around,

Iron, wood, and clay too,
Or using glue, lacquer, and cloth—the whole crew—
Adorning and making Buddha images this way,
People like all these, I say,

They all already attained Buddhahood!
Painting Buddha images looking good,
With the hundred blessing marks adorning him fine,
Whether you do it yourself or hire someone—the design—

You all already became Buddhas, yes indeed!
Even kids playing around, taking the lead,
Using grass, wood, or brushes to create,
Or even with fingernails or toenails—can't wait!—

Drawing and making Buddha images with care,
People like all these everywhere,
Gradually accumulating merit bit by bit,
Fulfilling the great compassionate heart—that's it!

They all already became Buddhas—it's done!
Just transforming Bodhisattvas, every one,
Saving and liberating immeasurable crowds.
If folks at stupas, temples—bowing, heads bowed,

Jeweled images and painted images too,
With flowers, incense, banners, and canopies—it's true—
Making offerings with reverent hearts and minds,
Or having people make music of all kinds,

Beating drums, blowing horns and conch shells loud,
Flutes, pan-pipes, zithers, harps—wow!
Lutes, cymbals, and gongs that sound,
All these wonderful musical notes going round,

Using them all to make offerings—that's great!
Or with joyful hearts, let me state,
Singing and chanting, praising Buddha's virtue and grace,
Even just one small sound in that place—

They all already attained Buddhahood!
If folks with scattered minds—understood—
Even offering just one flower there,
To a painted image, I declare,

They'll gradually see countless Buddhas appear.
Or someone bowing down in reverence here,
Or maybe just putting palms together tight,
Even raising just one hand in the light,

Or even slightly lowering their head a bit—
Making offerings to images this way,
They'll gradually see countless Buddhas, I say.

They'll accomplish the unsurpassed Way themselves,
Saving countless multitudes—spreading the wealth,
Entering complete nirvāṇa when it's done,
Like firewood burning out, fire's gone.

If folks with scattered minds one day,
Enter into a stupa or temple where they pray,
Even calling out "Homage to the Buddha!" just once—
They all already became Buddhas, no need to be a dunce.

Regarding Buddhas of the past,
Whether during their lifetime or after they passed,
If anybody heard this Dharma teaching,
They all already became Buddhas—ain't I preaching?

The World-Honored Ones of the future time,
Their numbers beyond measure—can't count in rhyme,
All these Tathāgatas, understand,
Will also preach with expedient means so grand.

All the Tathāgatas, every one,
With immeasurable expedient means when it's done,
Save and liberate all beings everywhere,
Entering Buddha's flawless wisdom with care.

If anyone hears the Dharma, not a one
Won't become a Buddha—it's already done.
The Buddhas' original vows, the path they trod,
"The Buddha Way I practice"—hear me, nod—

"I universally want to cause all beings
To also attain this path"—these are the teachings.
Future world Buddhas, though they might explain
Hundreds of thousands of billions of Dharma doors—ain't in vain,

In reality it's all for the One Vehicle way.
The Buddhas, the Two-Footed Honored Ones, I say,
Know dharmas are always without fixed nature, you see,
Buddha-seeds arise from conditions—that's the key.

Therefore they preach the One Vehicle teaching.
This Dharma abides in the Dharma-position—ain't just preaching,
Worldly characteristics permanently abide,
At the place of enlightenment, knowing this inside,

The Guide uses expedient means to explain it all.
Buddhas in the present ten directions stand tall,
Honored and served by gods and humans too,
Numerous as Ganges sand—ain't nothing new,

Appearing in the world for this very thing—
To bring peace to beings, hear me sing,
They also preach this Dharma the same way.
They know the foremost stillness, hear what I say,

With the power of expedient means at their command,
Though showing various paths across the land,
It's actually all for the Buddha Vehicle, you see.
They know beings' various practices—set them free,

What their deep hearts are pondering on,
The karma they practiced in past lives gone,
Their desires, nature, vigor, and power too,
Whether their faculties are sharp or dull through and through.

Using all kinds of causes and conditions to preach,
Parables and words, within everyone's reach,
According to what's fitting, using expedient means to speak.
Right now I'm also like this, ain't I unique?

To bring peace to beings, that's my aim,
Using all kinds of Dharma doors to proclaim
And reveal the Buddha Way, making it shine.
With the power of wisdom, this path divine,

I know beings' natures and desires true,
Expediently preaching all dharmas too,
Causing everyone to attain joy, you bet.
Śāriputra, you should know this—don't forget!

With the Buddha eye I observe and see,
Beings in the six paths, ain't living free,
Poor, without blessings or wisdom to spare,
Entering birth-and-death's dangerous road of despair.

Their suffering continues on without end,
Deeply attached to the five desires, my friend,
Like a yak loving his tail—holding on tight,
Using craving and love to harm themselves—ain't right.

Blinded by ignorance, can't see a thing,
Not seeking the Buddha of Great Power, the King,
Nor the Dharma that cuts off suffering and pain,
Deeply entering wrong views again and again,

Trying to use suffering to abandon suffering—what a shame!
For beings like these, all the same,
I generate the great compassionate heart inside.
When I first sat at the place of enlightenment wide,

Contemplating the tree, walking around in meditation,
For three times seven days—that's my narration—
I thought about matters like these, let me say:
"The wisdom I attained is wonderful, the foremost way.

But beings' faculties are dull, I see,
Attached to pleasure, blinded by stupidity,
Folks like these, this whole crew—
How could they possibly be saved? What can I do?"

Right then all them Brahmā Kings appeared,
Plus Indra, lord of gods—ain't to be feared,
The Four Kings who protect the world came by,
Plus Great Īśvara reaching up high,

Along with all them other heavenly hosts,
Entourages numbering hundreds of thousands—quite the boasts!
Respectfully with palms together, bowing down,
Requesting me to turn the Dharma wheel in town.

Right then I thought to myself inside:
"If I just praised the Buddha Vehicle with pride,
Beings sunk in suffering through and through,
Wouldn't be able to believe this Dharma true.

Breaking the Dharma through not believing, you see,
They'd fall into the three evil paths—ain't free.
I'd rather not preach the Dharma at all,
Quickly enter nirvāṇa—heed the call."

Then I thought about past Buddhas on their journey,
The expedient power they practiced—learning,
The Way I've now attained today,
I should also preach three vehicles—that's the way.

While I was thinking this very thought,
Buddhas from the ten directions—what they brought!—
All appeared with Brahma voices to console:
"Excellent, Śākyamuni, that's your role!

Foremost Guide, you done received
This unsurpassed Dharma—now we believe.
Following all the Buddhas, every one,
You also use expedient power till it's done.

We also all attained, I declare,
The most wonderful, foremost Dharma everywhere.
For all kinds of beings in this creation,
We distinguish and preach three vehicles—that's our foundation.

Folks with little wisdom love the small way,
Don't believe in themselves becoming Buddhas someday,
So we use expedient means to make it work,
Distinguishing and preaching the various fruits—don't shirk.

Though we preach three vehicles, it's true,
It's only to teach Bodhisattvas through and through."
Śāriputra, you should know what I'm about to say,
I heard that holy lion roar one day,

That deep, pure, subtle, wonderful sound—
Joyfully calling "Homage to Buddha!" all around.
Then I thought like this to myself:
"I came out in the turbid evil world—no wealth,

But just as all them Buddhas explained it to me,
I'll also follow and practice accordingly."
After thinking about this matter, reflecting inside,
I immediately went to Vārāṇasī with pride.

The characteristics of dharmas—still and extinct—
Can't be proclaimed in words, distinct.
But with the power of expedient means, you see,
I preached it for five monks—setting them free.

This is called turning the Dharma wheel, understand,
And then there was the sound of nirvāṇa across the land,
Plus "arhat," "Dharma," and "Saṃgha"—names that distinguish,
Teaching folks how to truly flourish.

From kalpas long past, way back when,
I've been praising this nirvāṇa Dharma again and again,
The suffering of birth and death forever ends—
I've always explained it this way to my friends.

Śāriputra, you should know it's true,
I see Buddha's children—and that means you—
Aspiring to seek the Buddha Way with care,
Countless thousands of myriads of billions everywhere.

All with reverent hearts and minds, they came,
Coming to where the Buddha is—ain't a game,
Having previously heard from Buddhas in the past,
The Dharma preached with expedient means—holding fast.

Right then I thought like this inside:
"The reason Tathāgatas appear"—can't hide—
"Is to preach the Buddha wisdom, that's why,
Now's exactly the right time"—I don't lie.

Śāriputra, you should know what I mean,
Folks with dull roots and small wisdom, I've seen,
Attached to characteristics, full of arrogant pride—
They can't believe this Dharma I provide.

Now I'm joyful and fearless, ain't got no doubt,
Among all them Bodhisattvas, I shout out,
Straightforwardly casting aside expedient means, you see,
Just preaching the unsurpassed Way—that's the key!

When Bodhisattvas hear this Dharma explained,
Their net of doubts is all removed—ain't constrained,
Twelve hundred arhats, every one,
Will also all become Buddhas when it's done.

Just like Buddhas of the three time periods taught,
The ceremony and style of preaching Dharma they brought,
Right now I'm also just like this today,
Preaching the undifferentiated Dharma—hear what I say.

When Buddhas arise and appear in the world,
It's rare and hard to encounter—let truth be unfurled,
Even when they do appear among us here,
Preaching this Dharma is also rare, let's be clear.

Through immeasurable, countless kalpas gone by,
Hearing this Dharma is also rare—won't lie,
And folks who can listen to this Dharma teaching,
Such people are also rare—ain't just preaching.

Just like the udumbara flower, you know,
Everybody loves it, puts on a show,
Rare among gods and humans—ain't common to see,
Only appearing once in a great while—sporadically.

Hearing the Dharma with joy and praise,
Even uttering just one word in all your days,
Then you've already made offerings, I declare,
To all the Buddhas of the three time periods everywhere.

Such a person is extremely rare indeed,
Rarer than the udumbara flower's seed.
Y'all shouldn't have no doubts at all,
I'm the King of Dharmas—standing tall,

Universally announcing to this great assembly here:
I'm only using the One Vehicle Way, crystal clear,
To teach and transform Bodhisattvas, understand—
There ain't no śrāvaka disciples in this land.

All you folks, Śāriputra, and the rest,
The śrāvakas and Bodhisattvas—all are blessed,
You should know this wonderful Dharma true,
The secret essential of all Buddhas—yes, you!

In the evil world of five turbidities, you see,
Beings just love being attached, ain't free,
Delighting in desires—that's how they are,
Beings like these will never seek Buddha Way—too far.

In the future, evil people gonna appear,
Hearing Buddha preach the One Vehicle here,
They'll be confused, won't believe or receive,
Breaking the Dharma, falling into evil paths—I don't deceive.

But those with shame and purity inside,
Who aspire to seek the Buddha Way with pride,
For people like these, I should proclaim
And broadly praise the One Vehicle Way—that's my aim.

Śāriputra, you should know it's true,
The Dharma of all Buddhas is like this too,
With myriads of billions of expedient means at hand,
They preach according to what's fitting across the land.

Folks who ain't studied and learned this way,
Can't understand it clearly, I must say.
But since y'all already know, every one,
That Buddhas are Teachers of the World—it's done,

About expedient means according to the situation,
You ain't got no more doubts or hesitation,
Your hearts generate great joy inside,
Knowing you'll become Buddhas—ain't got to hide!

Chapter Three: PARABLES


Right then Śāriputra was leaping for joy, filled with gladness. He immediately stood up, put his palms together, gazed up at the Honored One's face, and addressed the Buddha, saying: "Now, hearing this Dharma sound from the World-Honored One, my heart's leaping with joy—I've experienced something I never experienced before. Why? In the past, hearing Dharma like this from the Buddha, I saw all them Bodhisattvas receiving predictions of Buddhahood, but we wasn't included in that. I felt deeply sad and hurt, like I'd missed out on the Tathāgata's immeasurable knowledge and vision. World-Honored One, I was always dwelling alone in mountain forests under trees, whether sitting or walking, and I kept thinking: 'We all entered into the Dharma nature the same way—how come the Tathāgata's saving and liberating me with the Small Vehicle Dharma?' This was our own fault, not the World-Honored One's. Why? If we'd waited for him to explain the causes and accomplishing supreme perfect enlightenment, we'd definitely have been saved and liberated by the Mahāyāna. But we didn't understand the expedient means taught according to what's appropriate. When we first heard the Buddha's Dharma, we immediately believed, received, contemplated, and grasped the realization. World-Honored One, from way back, all day and all night, I kept blaming myself. But now from the Buddha I've heard what I never heard before, an unprecedented Dharma. All my doubts and regrets are cut off. My body and mind are at peace and ease—I've quickly attained security. Today I finally know I'm truly a Buddha's child, born from the Buddha's mouth, born from the transformation of the Dharma, receiving a share of the Buddha Dharma."

Right then Śāriputra, wanting to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:


Hearing this Dharma sound today,
I got what I never got before, I say,
My heart holds great joy inside,
All them nets of doubt done slipped aside.

From way back receiving Buddha's teaching true,
Never lost that Mahāyāna through and through,
Buddha's voice is so rare, you see,
Can get rid of beings' troubles—set them free.

I already poured out all my outflows complete,
Hearing this also removes worry—ain't that sweet?
When I was dwelling in them mountain valleys wide,
Or underneath them trees on the mountainside,

Whether sitting down or walking around the bend,
I was constantly thinking about this, my friend,
Crying out deep inside with blame:
"How come I been deceiving my own self—ain't that a shame?

We also Buddha's children, just the same,
Entered the flawless Dharma—ain't no game,
But can't in the future proclaim,
The unsurpassed Way—what a crying shame!

The golden color, thirty-two marks divine,
Ten powers, all the liberations so fine,
Together in one Dharma, but I got to confess,
I didn't get these things—what a mess!

Eighty kinds of wonderful characteristics bright,
Eighteen Dharmas the Buddha don't share—that's right,
All these kinds of merit and virtue too,
And I done lost them all—boo hoo!

When I was walking alone, by myself,
Seeing Buddha in the great assembly—no wealth,
His name heard throughout the ten directions wide,
Broadly benefiting beings far and wide.

I thought I lost this benefit—what a cost!
Was I deceiving and lying to myself—am I lost?
I was constantly, day and night,
Thinking about this matter—is it wrong or right?

Wanting to ask the World-Honored One to explain:
Did I lose it or not—what's the gain?
I constantly saw the World-Honored One there,
Praising all them Bodhisattvas with care.

So day and night I was pondering on,
Calculating about this matter from dusk till dawn.
Now hearing the Buddha's voice and sound,
Preaching Dharma according to what's fitting all around,

That flawless, inconceivable Way so bright,
Leading folks to the place of enlightenment—that's right!
I originally was attached to wrong views back when,
Was a teacher for them Brahmins again and again.

The World-Honored One knew my heart inside,
Pulled out the wrong views, preached nirvāṇa—my guide.
I completely removed all wrong views, you see,
Regarding empty dharmas I attained realization—set me free.

At that time my heart said to itself inside:
'I've reached extinction'—filled with pride.
But now I finally awaken, understand—
That wasn't real extinction where I stand.

When I attain Buddhahood someday,
Complete with thirty-two marks in every way,
Gods, humans, yakṣa crowds will be there,
Dragons, spirits and all showing respectful care.

At that time I can truly say,
'Permanently exhausted and extinguished with nothing left'—hooray!
The Buddha in the great assembly told everyone around,
That I'm gonna become a Buddha—what a sound!

Hearing Dharma sounds like these,
All my doubts and regrets are at ease.
When I first heard what the Buddha said,
My heart was greatly startled with dread:

'Is this a demon who became a Buddha to confound,
Troubling and confusing my heart'—that's what I found.
But Buddha with all kinds of causes explained,
Parables and skillful words—my heart was trained.

His heart peaceful as the sea so wide,
Hearing him, my net of doubts got untied.
Buddha spoke about the past, way back when,
Immeasurable Buddhas who entered extinction again and again,

Dwelling in expedient means, everyone,
Also all preached this Dharma when done.
Present and future Buddhas too,
Their numbers beyond measure—it's true,

Also with all kinds of expedient means at hand,
Proclaim this Dharma across the land.
Like today's World-Honored One here,
From his birth and leaving home—let me make it clear,

Attaining the Way, turning the Dharma wheel around,
Also preaching with expedient means profound.
The World-Honored One speaks the real path—it's divine,
Māra ain't got this—it's a genuine sign.

So I definitely know without no doubt,
This ain't no demon acting Buddha out.
Because I fell into that net of doubt before,
I thought it was the demon's work—nothing more.

But hearing the Buddha's gentle, soft sound,
Deep, far-reaching, subtle and profound,
Proclaiming and spreading the pure Dharma with care,
My heart's filled with great joy everywhere.

All my doubts and regrets forever done,
Dwelling secure in real wisdom—I won!
I'm definitely gonna become a Buddha someday,
Honored by gods and humans—hip hip hooray!

I'll turn the unsurpassed Dharma wheel with skill,
Teaching and transforming Bodhisattvas—that's my will.


Right then the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Now in this great assembly of gods, humans, śramaṇas, brahmins and more, I'm gonna tell you: In the past, at the place of two hundred billions of Buddhas, for the sake of the unsurpassed Way I constantly taught and transformed you. You also through the long night followed me, receiving my teaching. Because I guided you with expedient means, you were born into my Dharma. Śāriputra, in the past I taught you to aspire to the Buddha Way, but you've completely forgotten all that now, and you think you've already attained extinction. Now I want to make you remember your original vow and the path you practiced. So for all them śrāvakas I'm preaching this Mahāyāna sutra called the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower—a teaching for Bodhisattvas, something the Buddha keeps close and protects."

"Śāriputra, in a future age, after passing through immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable kalpas, after making offerings to many thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas, upholding the right Dharma, and fulfilling the path that Bodhisattvas practice, you will become a Buddha with the title Flower Glow Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-sambuddha, One Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One. The country will be named Free from Defilement. That land will be level and straight, pure and adorned, peaceful, prosperous, and pleasant. Gods and humans will flourish there. The ground will be lapis lazuli with eight intersecting roads, bordered with golden ropes marking the sides. Alongside them will be rows of seven-jeweled trees constantly bearing flowers and fruit. Flower Glow Tathāgata will also use the three vehicles to teach and transform beings."

"Śāriputra, when that Buddha appears, though it won't be an evil age, on account of his original vow he'll preach the Dharma of three vehicles. The kalpa will be named Great Jewel Adornment. Why's it called Great Jewel Adornment? Because in that country Bodhisattvas will be considered the great jewels. These Bodhisattvas will be immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable—can't be reached by calculation or analogy. Nobody can know except with the Buddha's wisdom power. When they want to walk, jeweled flowers will support their feet. These Bodhisattvas won't be newly resolved—they'll have long planted roots of virtue, purely cultivated pure conduct before immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddhas, constantly praised by all the Buddhas. They'll always cultivate Buddha wisdom, possess great spiritual powers, thoroughly know all the doors of the Dharmas, be straightforward and genuine without falsehood, with firm and solid will and mindfulness. Bodhisattvas like these will fill up that country."

"Śāriputra, Flower Glow Buddha's lifespan will be twelve small kalpas, not counting the time when he was a prince before becoming a Buddha. The people of that country will live for eight small kalpas. After twelve small kalpas, Flower Glow Tathāgata will give Firm Fullness Bodhisattva the prediction of supreme perfect enlightenment. He'll tell all the monks: 'This Firm Fullness Bodhisattva will be the next to become a Buddha, with the title Flower Feet Peaceful Walking Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-sambuddha. His Buddha land will also be like this.' Śāriputra, after Flower Glow Buddha enters extinction, the right Dharma will abide in the world for thirty-two small kalpas, and the Dharma semblance will also abide for thirty-two small kalpas."

Right then the World-Honored One, wanting to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:


Śāriputra, in a future age,
You'll become a Buddha—turn that page,
Universal Wisdom Honored One by name,
Called Flower Glow—spread your fame,

You gonna save immeasurable crowds.
Making offerings to countless Buddhas—talking loud,
Fulfilling Bodhisattva practices, every one,
Ten powers and other merits till it's done,

Realizing the unsurpassed Way divine.
After immeasurable kalpas pass in time,
The kalpa named Great Jewel Adornment will come,
The world named Free from Defilement—and then some!

Pure, without flaws or stain,
With lapis lazuli for the ground—ain't that plain?
Golden ropes marking out each road,
Seven-jeweled variegated trees—quite the load,

Constantly bearing flowers and fruit galore.
The Bodhisattvas of that country, furthermore,
Their will and mindfulness always firm and strong,
With spiritual powers and pāramitās all along,

They'll all have completely fulfilled every one.
Before countless Buddhas, learning ain't done,
Practicing the Bodhisattva Way with care—
Great beings like these everywhere,

All transformed by Flower Glow Buddha there.
When the Buddha was a prince—I declare—
He abandoned his kingdom, gave up worldly glory's call,
In his very final body, last of all,

He left home and accomplished the Buddha Way.
Flower Glow Buddha dwelling in the world, I say,
His lifespan twelve small kalpas long,
The people of that country—a mighty throng—

Their lifespans eight small kalpas strong.
After the Buddha enters extinction—all along,
The right Dharma abides in the world, you see,
For thirty-two small kalpas—completely free,

Broadly saving all beings everywhere.
After the right Dharma's completely gone from there,
The Dharma semblance for thirty-two more,
His relics widely distributed—that's for sure,

Gods and humans universally making offerings true.
What Flower Glow Buddha's gonna do,
All these matters will be just like this, you bet—
That Two-Footed Holy Honored One—don't forget!

Most excellent, without equal or peer.
And that Buddha—let me make it clear—
That's gonna be your very own self!
You should rejoice with all your wealth!


Right then the fourfold assembly—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, plus gods, dragons, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas and the rest of that great assembly—seeing Śāriputra receive the prediction of supreme perfect enlightenment before the Buddha, their hearts was filled with great joy, leaping without measure. Each one took off the fine upper garment they was wearing and made offerings to the Buddha. Indra, the Brahmā King and them, along with countless divine sons, also made offerings to the Buddha with divine wonderful garments, divine māndārava flowers, great māndārava flowers and more. The divine garments they scattered remained in empty space, turning around by themselves. All kinds of divine music—hundreds of thousands of myriads of types—was played all at once in empty space, raining down multitudes of divine flowers. And they said: "The Buddha long ago at Vārāṇasī first turned the Dharma wheel, and now he's turning the unsurpassed, greatest Dharma wheel again."

Right then the divine sons, wanting to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:


Long ago at Vārāṇasī, way back when,
You turned the Four Noble Truths' wheel again and again,
Distinguishing and explaining all the dharmas true,
The birth and death of the five aggregates—yes, you!

Now you turning the most wonderful wheel,
The unsurpassed great Dharma wheel—it's real,
This Dharma's profoundly deep and mysterious, I say,
Not many can believe it—sad to say.

We, from way back till today,
Have often heard the World-Honored One say,
But never heard like this before,
Such deep, wonderful, supreme Dharma—nothing more.

When the World-Honored One preaches this Dharma here,
We all rejoice with hearts sincere.
Great Wise Śāriputra now,
Has received the honored prediction—take a bow!

We also just like this, it's true,
Will definitely become Buddhas too,
In all the worlds, every one,
Most honored, with none above—second to none!

The Buddha Way's inconceivable, ain't that right?
Using expedient means, preaching according to what's fitting and bright.
All the blessed karma that we got,
In this world and past worlds—the whole lot,

Plus seeing the Buddha's merit and virtue divine,
We turn it all toward the Buddha Way—every line!


Right then Śāriputra addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, now I ain't got no more doubts or regrets. Right before the Buddha I've personally received the prediction of supreme perfect enlightenment. But these twelve hundred folks whose hearts are free—in the past they dwelled on the level of learning. The Buddha constantly taught and transformed them, saying: 'My Dharma can free you from birth, old age, sickness and death, ultimately reaching nirvāṇa.' These folks, whether still learning or done with learning, they also each thought they'd left behind the view of self, views of existence and non-existence and all that, thinking they'd attained nirvāṇa. But now before the World-Honored One, hearing what they never heard before, they've all fallen into doubt and confusion. Excellent, World-Honored One! Please, for the fourfold assembly, explain the causes and conditions, helping them leave behind their doubts and regrets."

Right then the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Didn't I already say that all the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, use all kinds of causes and conditions, parables and words, and expedient means to preach the Dharma—it's all for supreme perfect enlightenment? Everything that's explained is all for the sake of transforming Bodhisattvas. But Śāriputra, now I'm gonna use another parable to further clarify this meaning. Wise folks can understand through parables."

"Śāriputra, suppose in a country, town, or village there's a great elder. He's getting old now, immensely wealthy, with many fields, houses, servants, and workers. His home is vast and great, but it's only got one door. A whole lot of people are living there—one hundred, two hundred, even up to five hundred folks dwelling inside. The halls and pavilions are old and decayed, the walls are crumbling and falling down, the pillar bases are rotten and ruined, the beams and ridgepoles are leaning dangerous. All around, all at once, fires suddenly break out, burning up the house. The elder's got sons—maybe ten, twenty, or even thirty—inside this house. The elder, seeing this great fire rising up from all four sides, is greatly alarmed and afraid, and he thinks: 'Though I can safely escape through this burning door, my sons are in that burning house, delighting in their games and play. They don't notice, don't know, ain't alarmed, ain't afraid. The fire's pressing close, suffering and pain are cutting into them, but their hearts ain't troubled by it—they got no intention of getting out.'"

"Śāriputra, this elder thinks to himself: 'I'm physically strong. I should use my robe or a low table to carry them out of the house.' Then he thinks again: 'This house only got one door, and it's narrow and small besides. My sons are young and immature, they don't understand nothing. They're attached to their place of play. They might fall down and get burned by the fire. I should tell them about this frightening situation: This house is already burning! You need to get out quick, or you'll get burned up by the fire!' After thinking like this, according to what he thought, he tells all his sons: 'Y'all need to get out quick!' Though the father's compassionate and kind, using good words to coax and persuade them, the sons are delighting in their play. They won't believe or receive what he's saying, ain't alarmed, ain't afraid, and got absolutely no intention of leaving. They don't even know what 'fire' is, what 'house' is, what 'losing everything' means. They just run around east and west playing, glancing at their father, that's all."

(Chapter 3 continues...)
