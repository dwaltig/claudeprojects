CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO: ENTRUSTMENT

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha arose from his Dharma seat and manifested great supernatural power. With his right hand, he rubbed the heads of the immeasurable bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and spoke these words: "Throughout immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, I have cultivated and practiced this Dharma of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, which is difficult to attain. Now I entrust it to you all. You should single-mindedly propagate this Dharma and cause it to increase extensively."

In this manner, three times he rubbed the heads of the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and spoke these words: "Throughout immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya kalpas, I have cultivated and practiced this Dharma of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, which is difficult to attain. Now I entrust it to you all. You should receive, uphold, recite, and extensively proclaim this Dharma, causing all sentient beings universally to hear and know it. Why is this so? The Tathāgata possesses great compassion. He is without stinginess or parsimony and is also without fear. He is able to bestow upon sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom, the Tathāgata's wisdom, and the self-arising wisdom. The Tathāgata is the great benefactor of all sentient beings. You also should follow and study the Tathāgata's Dharma and not give rise to stinginess. In future ages, if there are good men or good women who have faith in the Tathāgata's wisdom, you should expound this Lotus Sutra for them, enabling them to hear and know it, so as to cause such persons to attain the Buddha's wisdom. If there are sentient beings who do not believe and accept it, then among the Tathāgata's other profound Dharmas you should instruct, benefit, and gladden them. If you are able to do this, then you will have already repaid the kindness of all buddhas."

At that time, when the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas heard what the Buddha had said, they were all filled with great joy throughout their bodies. With ever-increasing reverence, they bent their bodies, lowered their heads, joined their palms toward the Buddha, and with one voice proclaimed: "We shall carry out all that the World-Honored One has commanded. Yes, World-Honored One, may you have no concern." The assembly of bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in this manner three times with one voice proclaimed: "We shall carry out all that the World-Honored One has commanded. Yes, World-Honored One, may you have no concern."

Then Śākyamuni Buddha caused the buddhas who were his emanations and had come from the ten directions each to return to their original lands, saying: "May each buddha proceed according to his ease. The stūpa of Many Jewels Buddha may also return to its former state." When he spoke these words, the immeasurable emanation buddhas from the ten directions who were seated upon lion thrones beneath jeweled trees, as well as Many Jewels Buddha, and the boundless and asaṃkhyeya great assembly of bodhisattvas such as Superior Conduct, as well as Śāriputra and others of the śrāvaka assembly and the fourfold congregation, together with all the worlds—the gods, humans, asuras, and others—hearing what the Buddha had said, all rejoiced greatly.
