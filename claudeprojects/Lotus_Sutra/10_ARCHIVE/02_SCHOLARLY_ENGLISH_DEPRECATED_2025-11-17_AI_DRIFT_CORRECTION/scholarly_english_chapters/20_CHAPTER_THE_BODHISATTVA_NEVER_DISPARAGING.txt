CHAPTER TWENTY: THE BODHISATTVA NEVER DISPARAGING


At that time the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta, saying: "You should now understand that if any bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī, upāsaka, or upāsikā who upholds the Lotus Sutra should be subject to evil speech, reviling, or slander, they will incur great karmic retribution as previously explained. Yet the merit they obtain shall be as has been described—the purity of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, in the ancient past, immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable, incalculable kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Humans and Gods, Buddha, World-Honored One. The kalpa was named離衰 (离衰, Free from Decline), and the land was named Great Achievement. That Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja, in that world, expounded the Dharma for humans, gods, and asuras. For those seeking to be śrāvakas, he taught the Four Noble Truths to transcend birth, old age, sickness, and death, and to attain final nirvāṇa. For those seeking to be pratyekabuddhas, he taught the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. For bodhisattvas seeking anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, he taught the Six Pāramitās to perfect the Buddha's wisdom.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, the lifespan of that Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja was forty myriads of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges' sands of kalpas. The True Dharma abided in the world for a number of kalpas equal to the dust motes of one Jambudvīpa. The Semblance Dharma abided in the world for a number of kalpas equal to the dust motes of the four continents. After that Buddha had brought benefit to sentient beings, he then entered parinirvāṇa. After both the True Dharma and the Semblance Dharma had become extinct, in that land another Buddha appeared, also named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak-saṃbuddha, Possessed of Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Humans and Gods, Buddha, World-Honored One. In this succession there were two myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, all bearing the same name."

"After the first Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja Tathāgata had entered parinirvāṇa, and after the True Dharma had become extinct, during the age of the Semblance Dharma, there were bhikṣus of overweening pride who wielded great influence. At that time there was a bodhisattva-bhikṣu named Sadāparibhūta (Never Disparaging). Mahāsthāmaprāpta, for what reason was he named Never Disparaging? This bhikṣu, whenever he encountered anyone—whether bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī, upāsaka, or upāsikā—would bow in reverence and offer praise, saying: 'I deeply respect you all and dare not treat you with contempt. Why is this so? Because you are all practicing the bodhisattva path and shall attain Buddhahood.'

"This bhikṣu did not devote himself to the recitation of sutras, but only practiced making obeisance. Even when he saw the four assemblies from afar, he would deliberately approach them to bow and offer praise, saying: 'I dare not disparage you, for you shall all become Buddhas.' Among the four assemblies, those who harbored anger and impure minds would revile him with harsh words, saying: 'This ignorant bhikṣu—whence has he come? He claims not to despise us and confers upon us the prediction that we shall attain Buddhahood. We have no use for such false predictions!' Year after year he endured such revilement without giving rise to anger, always proclaiming: 'You shall become Buddhas.' When he spoke thus, some would beat him with sticks, tiles, and stones. Yet even as he fled to a distance, he would still call out in a loud voice: 'I dare not disparage you, for you shall all become Buddhas.' Because he always spoke in this manner, the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās of overweening pride called him Sadāparibhūta (Never Disparaging)."

"When this bhikṣu was approaching death, he heard in the space above him all twenty thousand myriads of koṭis of verses of the Lotus Sutra that had been expounded by the Buddha Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja. He was able to receive and uphold them all, and immediately attained purity of the eye faculty as described above, as well as purity of the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind faculties. Having obtained the purity of these six faculties, his lifespan was extended by two hundred myriads of koṭis of nayutas of years, and he extensively expounded this Lotus Sutra for the people.

"At that time, those of the four assemblies of overweening pride—the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who had treated this person with contempt and given him the name Never Disparaging—saw that he had obtained great supernatural powers, the power of eloquent discourse, and the power of great meditative equipoise. When they heard what he taught, they all came to believe, submit, and follow him. This bodhisattva also converted thousands of myriads of koṭis of beings, causing them to dwell in anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"After his life ended, he encountered two thousand koṭis of Buddhas, all named Sun-Moon-Lamp Radiance. Under their Dharma he expounded this Lotus Sutra. Through this causal connection, he again encountered two thousand koṭis of Buddhas, all named Cloud-Freedom-Lamp King. Under the Dharma of these Buddhas he received, upheld, recited, and expounded this sutra for the four assemblies. Thus he obtained this constant purity of the eye, and purity of the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind faculties. Among the four assemblies he taught the Dharma without fear."

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, this Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Sadāparibhūta made offerings to such numbers of Buddhas, revering, honoring, and praising them, planting roots of virtue. Afterward he encountered thousands of myriads of koṭis of Buddhas, and under the Dharma of all these Buddhas he expounded this sutra. His merit perfected, he was destined to attain Buddhahood.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, what do you think? Could that Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta of that time have been another person? He was none other than myself. If in past lives I had not received, upheld, recited, and expounded this sutra for others, I would not have been able to speedily attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. Because at the places of former Buddhas I received, upheld, recited, and expounded this sutra for others, I speedily attained anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, at that time the four assemblies—the bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās—who with angry minds treated me with contempt, did not encounter any Buddha for two hundred koṭis of kalpas. They heard no Dharma and saw no Saṅgha. For one thousand kalpas they suffered great anguish in the Avīci Hell. After their offenses were expiated, they again met the Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta, who taught them toward anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, what do you think? Could those four assemblies who constantly disparaged that bodhisattva have been other persons? They are none other than the five hundred bodhisattvas including Bhadrapāla, the five hundred bhikṣus including Lion-Moon, and the five hundred upāsakas including Thoughtful-of-Buddha now in this assembly—all of whom shall never regress from anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, you should understand that this Lotus Sutra greatly benefits all bodhisattva-mahāsattvas and enables them to reach anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. Therefore, after the Tathāgata's parinirvāṇa, all bodhisattva-mahāsattvas should always receive, uphold, recite, expound, and transcribe this sutra."


At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse:

"In the past there was a Buddha
Named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja,
Of measureless spiritual wisdom,
Guiding and leading all beings,

Gods, humans, dragons, and spirits
Together made offerings to him.
After that Buddha's parinirvāṇa,
When the Dharma was about to end,

There was one bodhisattva
Named Never Disparaging.
At that time the four assemblies
Were attached to the Dharma.

The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging
Would approach their presence
And speak these words to them:
'I do not despise you,

For you all practice the Path
And shall all become Buddhas.'
When the people heard this,
They belittled and reviled him.

The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging
Was able to endure this patiently.
When his offenses were exhausted,
At the time of his approaching death,

He heard this sutra
And his six faculties became pure.
Through his supernatural powers
His lifespan was increased,

And again for the people
He widely expounded this sutra.
All those attached to the Dharma
Received the bodhisattva's

Instruction and perfection,
Causing them to dwell in the Buddha Path.
When Never Disparaging's life ended,
He encountered countless Buddhas.

Because he expounded this sutra
He obtained immeasurable merit,
Gradually perfecting merit and virtue,
Speedily achieving the Buddha Path.

That Never Disparaging of former times
Was none other than myself.
The four assemblies at that time—
Those attached to the Dharma—

Who heard Never Disparaging's words,
'You shall all become Buddhas,'
Through this causal condition
Encountered countless Buddhas.

The five hundred bodhisattvas
In this assembly,
Together with the four groups
Of pure believing laymen and laywomen,

Now before me
Listening to the Dharma—these are they.
In past lives I
Exhorted all these people

To hear and receive this sutra,
The foremost of all Dharmas.
I revealed and taught people,
Causing them to dwell in nirvāṇa,

Life after life upholding
Sutras such as this.
Only after koṭis upon koṭis of kalpas,
Inconceivably many,

Does one get to hear
This Lotus Sutra.
Only after koṭis upon koṭis of kalpas,
Inconceivably many,

Do the Buddhas, World-Honored Ones,
Preach this sutra.
Therefore, practitioners,
After the Buddha's parinirvāṇa,

Upon hearing such a sutra,
Should harbor no doubt.
With single-minded devotion
They should widely expound this sutra,

Life after life encountering Buddhas,
Speedily achieving the Buddha Path."
