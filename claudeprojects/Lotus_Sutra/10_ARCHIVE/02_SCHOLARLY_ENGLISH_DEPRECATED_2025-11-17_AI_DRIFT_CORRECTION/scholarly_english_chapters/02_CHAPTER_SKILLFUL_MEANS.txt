CHAPTER TWO: SKILLFUL MEANS

At that time, the World-Honored One arose from samādhi with tranquil composure and addressed Śāriputra: "The wisdom of the Buddhas is extremely profound and immeasurable. The gateway to this wisdom is difficult to comprehend and difficult to enter. It cannot be known by any śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha. Wherefore is this so? The Buddhas have personally drawn near to hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of innumerable Buddhas, and have exhaustively practiced the immeasurable Dharma-ways of all Buddhas, advancing vigorously and courageously, until their names were universally heard. They have perfected the extremely profound and unprecedented Dharma, and whatever they teach in accordance with circumstances has a meaning difficult to comprehend.

"Śāriputra, since attaining Buddhahood, through various causes and conditions, various parables, I have extensively proclaimed teachings with words, and through immeasurable skillful means have guided living beings, causing them to separate from all attachments. Wherefore is this so? The Tathāgata's skillful means and the pāramitā of insight and vision are both completely perfected.

"Śāriputra, the insight and vision of the Tathāgata are vast, profound, and far-reaching—immeasurable, unobstructed. [He possesses] powers, fearlessnesses, dhyāna concentrations, liberations, and samādhis, having penetrated deeply without limit, and has perfected all unprecedented Dharmas.

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata is able to make various distinctions and skillfully expound all dharmas. His words are gentle and soft, delighting the hearts of all.

"Śāriputra, to speak concisely: the Buddha has completely perfected the immeasurable, limitless, unprecedented Dharma.

"Cease, Śāriputra! There is no need to speak further. Wherefore is this so? Because what the Buddha has perfected is the foremost, rare, and difficult-to-understand Dharma. Only a Buddha together with a Buddha can fathom the true mark of all dharmas—that is to say: the suchness of their marks, the suchness of their nature, the suchness of their embodiment, the suchness of their power, the suchness of their function, the suchness of their causes, the suchness of their conditions, the suchness of their effects, the suchness of their retributions, and the suchness of their ultimate equality from beginning to end."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"The Hero of the World is immeasurable—
All devas and worldly people,
All categories of living beings,
None can know the Buddha.

"The Buddha's powers and fearlessnesses,
His liberations and samādhis,
And all the Buddha's other dharmas—
None can measure them.

"Originally, from innumerable Buddhas,
Having completely practiced all Ways,
The profound and wondrous Dharma,
Difficult to see and difficult to comprehend—

"Throughout immeasurable billions of kalpas,
Having practiced all these Ways,
At the place of enlightenment he attained the fruit.
I have completely known and seen it all.

"Such great fruition and retribution,
The meaning of various natures and marks—
I, together with the Buddhas of the ten directions,
Alone can know this matter.

"This Dharma cannot be demonstrated;
The mark of words is extinguished.
Of all other categories of living beings,
None are able to comprehend it,

"Except for the multitude of Bodhisattvas
Whose power of faith is firm and solid.
The multitude of Buddha-disciples
Who have made offerings to all Buddhas,

"Who have exhausted all outflows
And dwell in this final body—
Even such people as these
Cannot bear this burden.

"Even if the world were filled
Entirely with ones like Śāriputra,
Who exhausted their thinking to measure it together,
They could not fathom the Buddha's wisdom.

"Even if the ten directions were filled
Entirely with ones like Śāriputra,
And the rest of the disciples
Also filled the lands of the ten directions,

"And exhausted their thinking to measure it together,
Still they could not know it.
Pratyekabuddhas of keen wisdom,
Without outflows, in their final bodies,

"Also filling the ten directions' realms,
Their number like bamboo forests—
If these all with one mind,
Throughout billions of immeasurable kalpas,

"Wished to contemplate the Buddha's true wisdom,
They could not know even a small portion.
Newly-resolved Bodhisattvas
Who have made offerings to innumerable Buddhas,

"Who thoroughly understand all meanings
And are moreover able to expound Dharma well—
Like rice, hemp, bamboo, and reeds
Filling the lands of the ten directions—

"With one mind, through wondrous wisdom,
Throughout kalpas numerous as Ganges' sands,
All together contemplating and measuring,
They could not know the Buddha's wisdom.

"Irreversible Bodhisattvas,
Their number like Ganges' sands—
With one mind seeking together,
Still they could not know it.

"Again I tell Śāriputra:
The inconceivable, without outflows,
Extremely profound and wondrous Dharma—
I have now completely attained it.

"Only I know this mark;
The Buddhas of the ten directions are likewise thus.
Śāriputra, you should know:
The words of all Buddhas do not differ.

"Toward the Dharma the Buddha has expounded,
You should generate great power of faith.
After the World-Honored One's Dharma has long endured,
He must in the end proclaim the truth.

"I tell the multitude of śrāvakas
And those seeking the pratyekabuddha vehicle:
'I enable you to escape the bonds of suffering
And attain nirvāṇa.'

"Through the power of skillful means,
The Buddha manifests the teaching of the Three Vehicles.
Living beings are attached in various places;
He draws them forth and enables them to emerge.

At that time in the great assembly, there were śrāvakas—Arhats whose outflows were exhausted, such as Ājñātakauṇḍinya and twelve hundred others, as well as bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās who had generated the resolve for the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha vehicles. Each had this thought: "For what reason does the World-Honored One now so earnestly extol skillful means and make this statement: 'The Dharma the Buddha has attained is extremely profound and difficult to comprehend. Whatever he says has a meaning difficult to know, which all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas cannot reach. The Buddha has expounded the single meaning of liberation, yet we also have attained this Dharma and arrived at nirvāṇa. But now we do not know toward what this meaning tends.'"

At that time Śāriputra, perceiving the doubts in the minds of the fourfold assembly and being himself not yet comprehending, addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, by what cause and condition do you now so earnestly extol the foremost skillful means of all Buddhas—the extremely profound, wondrous, and difficult-to-comprehend Dharma? From times past until now, I have never heard such an exposition from the Buddha. Now the fourfold assembly all harbor doubts. We only pray that the World-Honored One will expound this matter. World-Honored One, for what reason do you so earnestly extol this extremely profound, wondrous, and difficult-to-comprehend Dharma?"

At that time Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Sun of Wisdom, Great Sage and Honored One,
After so long you now expound this Dharma.
You yourself proclaim having attained such
Powers, fearlessnesses, and samādhis,

"Dhyāna concentrations, liberations, and such—
Inconceivable dharmas.
The Dharma attained at the place of enlightenment—
None can raise questions about it.

"My intention is difficult to fathom;
There is also none who can question it.
Without being questioned, you speak of your own accord,
Extolling the Way you have practiced:

"'The wisdom is extremely wondrous—
What all Buddhas have attained.'
The outflow-free Arhats
And those seeking nirvāṇa

"Have now all fallen into a net of doubts:
'Why does the Buddha speak of this?'
Those seeking the pratyekabuddha vehicle,
Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs,

"Devas, dragons, ghosts, and spirits,
Gandharvas and such,
Gaze at one another harboring hesitation,
Looking up to the Honored One of Two Feet:

"'What is the meaning of this matter?'
We pray the Buddha will explain.
Among the multitude of śrāvakas,
The Buddha has said I am foremost.

"Yet now regarding my own wisdom,
I am doubtful and cannot comprehend:
Is this the ultimate Dharma?
Or is this the path to be practiced?

"Sons born from the Buddha's mouth,
With palms joined, gaze upward and wait,
Praying you will emit wondrous sound
And timely expound the truth.

"Devas, dragons, spirits, and such,
Their number like Ganges' sands,
Bodhisattvas seeking Buddhahood,
Eighty thousand in great number,

"And from myriads of billions of lands,
Wheel-turning sage kings have arrived,
With palms joined and reverent minds,
Wishing to hear the complete Way."

At that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: "Cease, cease! There is no need to speak further. If I were to speak of this matter, all the devas and humans in all worlds would be shocked and doubtful."

Śāriputra again addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we only pray you will speak of it, we only pray you will speak of it. Wherefore is this so? In this assembly are immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of asaṃkhya living beings who have seen all Buddhas, whose faculties are keen and sharp, whose wisdom is clear and luminous. If they hear what the Buddha expounds, they will be able to believe it with reverence."

At that time Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Dharma King, Supreme and Honored One,
Only speak—pray have no concern!
In this assembly of immeasurable multitudes,
There are those able to believe with reverence."

The Buddha again stopped Śāriputra: "If I were to speak of this matter, all the devas, humans, and asuras in all the world would be shocked and doubtful, and the bhikṣus of overweening pride would fall into a great pit."

At that time the World-Honored One repeated this in verse, saying:

"Cease, cease—there is no need to speak!
My Dharma is wondrous and difficult to contemplate.
Those of overweening pride,
Hearing it, will certainly not believe with reverence."

At that time Śāriputra again addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One, we only pray you will speak of it, we only pray you will speak of it! In this present assembly, hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions such as we have, world after world, already received transformation from the Buddha. People such as these will surely be able to believe with reverence, attaining peace and security for the long night, receiving much benefit."

At that time Śāriputra, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Supreme Honored One of Two Feet,
Pray expound the foremost Dharma!
I am the Buddha's eldest son—
I only pray you will explain with discrimination.

"The immeasurable multitude in this assembly
Can believe this Dharma with reverence.
The Buddha has already, world after world,
Taught and transformed ones such as these.

"All with one mind and palms joined,
They wish to hear and receive the Buddha's words.
We twelve hundred,
And others seeking Buddhahood,

"Pray for the sake of this multitude
That you will explain with discrimination.
When these hear this Dharma,
They will experience great joy."

At that time the World-Honored One told Śāriputra: "Since you have now earnestly requested three times, how can I not speak? You should now listen attentively and think well upon this. I shall explain and analyze it for you." As he spoke these words, in the assembly there were bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās—five thousand persons who immediately rose from their seats, bowed to the Buddha, and withdrew. Wherefore was this so? The roots of transgression of this group were deep and grave, and [they harbored] overweening pride. Thinking they had attained what they had not attained, thinking they had realized what they had not realized, having such faults as these, therefore they did not remain. The World-Honored One remained silent and did not restrain them.

At that time the Buddha told Śāriputra: "My present assembly is now free of branches and leaves and is purely composed of the true and substantial. Śāriputra, it is well that such people of overweening pride have withdrawn. You should now listen well; I shall expound for you." Śāriputra said: "So be it, World-Honored One! I joyfully wish to hear."

The Buddha told Śāriputra:

"Such wondrous Dharma as this is expounded by the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, only occasionally, like the uḍumbara flower which appears but once in a great while. Śāriputra, you should all believe what the Buddha says; his words are not false or vain.

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas expound the Dharma in accordance with what is appropriate, and its meaning is difficult to comprehend. Wherefore is this so? Through immeasurable skillful means, through various causes and conditions, through parables and expressions, I expound all dharmas. This Dharma is not something that thought and discrimination can comprehend; only the Buddhas can know it. Wherefore is this so? The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world for the sake of one great cause and condition alone.

"Śāriputra, what is meant by 'the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world for the sake of one great cause and condition alone'? The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world because they wish to cause living beings to open the Buddha's insight and vision, enabling them to attain purity. They appear in the world because they wish to demonstrate to living beings the Buddha's insight and vision. They appear in the world because they wish to cause living beings to awaken to the Buddha's insight and vision. They appear in the world because they wish to cause living beings to enter the path of the Buddha's insight and vision. Śāriputra, this is the one great cause and condition for which all Buddhas appear in the world."

The Buddha told Śāriputra: "The Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, merely teach and transform Bodhisattvas. All their actions are always for one matter alone: solely to demonstrate and awaken living beings to the Buddha's insight and vision.

"Śāriputra, the Tathāgata expounds the Dharma for living beings solely through the One Buddha Vehicle. There are no other vehicles, whether two or three.

"Śāriputra, the Dharma of all the Buddhas of the ten directions is likewise thus.

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas of the past expounded dharmas for living beings through immeasurable, innumerable skillful means, through various causes and conditions, through parables and expressions. All these dharmas were for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All these living beings, hearing the Dharma from the Buddhas, ultimately attain the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, when the Buddhas of the future appear in the world, they too will expound dharmas for living beings through immeasurable, innumerable skillful means, through various causes and conditions, through parables and expressions. All these dharmas will be for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All these living beings, hearing the Dharma from the Buddhas, will ultimately attain the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, presently in the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of Buddha-lands throughout the ten directions, who bring much benefit and peace to living beings—these Buddhas too expound dharmas for living beings through immeasurable, innumerable skillful means, through various causes and conditions, through parables and expressions. All these dharmas are for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle. All these living beings, hearing the Dharma from the Buddhas, ultimately attain the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, these Buddhas merely teach and transform Bodhisattvas. They wish to demonstrate to living beings the Buddha's insight and vision. They wish to cause living beings to awaken to the Buddha's insight and vision. They wish to cause living beings to enter the Buddha's insight and vision.

"Śāriputra, I too am now likewise thus. Knowing that living beings have various desires and that the attachments in the depths of their minds differ, in accordance with their fundamental natures, through various causes and conditions, parables, and expressions, through the power of skillful means, I expound the Dharma for them.

"Śāriputra, all of this is for the purpose of enabling them to attain the One Buddha Vehicle and the wisdom of all modes.

"Śāriputra, in the worlds of the ten directions there are not even two vehicles, how much less three!

"Śāriputra, the Buddhas appear in the five turbidities of an evil world—namely, the turbidity of the kalpa, the turbidity of afflictions, the turbidity of living beings, the turbidity of views, and the turbidity of lifespan. It is thus, Śāriputra: when the kalpa is turbid and chaotic, living beings are heavily defiled, avaricious, jealous, and envious, thereby perfecting various unwholesome roots. Therefore the Buddhas, through the power of skillful means, within the One Buddha Vehicle, make distinctions and expound three.

"Śāriputra, if any of my disciples claim to be Arhats or pratyekabuddhas but do not hear or know that the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, merely teach and transform Bodhisattvas—such are not disciples of the Buddha, not Arhats, and not pratyekabuddhas.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra, if these bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs claim to have already attained Arhatship, to be in their final body, to have reached final nirvāṇa, and consequently do not further aspire to seek anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, you should know that all such people harbor overweening pride. Wherefore is this so? It is impossible for a bhikṣu who has truly attained Arhatship not to believe this Dharma—except after the Buddha's final nirvāṇa when there is no Buddha present. Wherefore is this so? After the Buddha's final nirvāṇa, those who can receive, uphold, read, recite, and comprehend the meaning of sutras such as these will be difficult to find. If they encounter other Buddhas, they will then attain decisive understanding regarding this Dharma.

"Śāriputra, you should all single-mindedly believe, comprehend, receive, and uphold the Buddha's words. The words of the Buddhas, the Tathāgatas, are not false or vain. There is no other vehicle; there is only the One Buddha Vehicle."

At that time the World-Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke in verse, saying:

"Bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs
Harboring overweening pride,
Upāsakas with self-conceit,
And upāsikās lacking faith—

"These four groups and such,
Five thousand in number,
Do not perceive their own faults;
Their precepts have deficiencies and flaws,

"Yet they guard and treasure their imperfections.
These people of small wisdom have departed—
The chaff amidst the multitude.
By the Buddha's awesome virtue they left.

"These people have scant merit and virtue
And cannot receive this Dharma.
This assembly is now free of branches and leaves,
Remaining only the purely true and substantial.

"Śāriputra, listen well!
The Dharma attained by all Buddhas,
Through the power of immeasurable skillful means,
Is expounded for living beings.

"What living beings think in their minds,
The various paths they practice,
Their manifold natures and desires,
And the good and evil karma of past lives—

"The Buddha completely knows all this,
And through various conditions and parables,
Through expressions and the power of skillful means,
He causes all to rejoice.

"Whether expounding sūtras,
Gāthās, or accounts of previous events,
Of past births and unprecedented matters,
Or also expounding causality,

"Parables together with geyas,
And upadeśa sūtras—
Those of dull faculties who delight in lesser dharmas,
Greedily attached to birth and death,

"Who, despite innumerable Buddhas,
Do not practice the profound and wondrous Way,
Who are harassed and confused by manifold sufferings—
For these I expound nirvāṇa.

"I established these skillful means
To cause them to enter into Buddha-wisdom.
I have never yet told you
That you shall attain the Buddha-Way.

"The reason I have never yet spoken
Is because the time to speak had not yet arrived.
Now precisely is that time
To decisively expound the Great Vehicle.

"These nine divisions of my Dharma,
Expounded in accordance with living beings,
Have as their foundation entry into the Great Vehicle—
Therefore I expound this sutra.

"There are Buddha-sons whose minds are pure,
Who are gentle and also of keen faculties,
Who in the presence of immeasurable Buddhas
Have practiced the profound and wondrous Way.

"For these Buddha-sons
I expound this Great Vehicle sutra.
I predict that such people
In future lives shall attain the Buddha-Way,

"Because with profound minds they are mindful of the Buddha
And uphold the pure precepts.
When these hear they shall become Buddhas,
Great joy fills their bodies.

"The Buddha, knowing their mental conduct,
Therefore expounds the Great Vehicle for them.
When śrāvakas or Bodhisattvas
Hear the Dharma I expound,

"Even a single verse,
All without doubt shall become Buddhas.
In the Buddha-lands of the ten directions,
There is only the Dharma of One Vehicle—

"There is no second and no third,
Except the Buddha's expedient teaching,
Where he merely uses provisional names
To guide living beings,

"Expounding the Buddha's wisdom.
The Buddhas appear in the world
Solely for this one true matter;
The other two are not true.

"They will never use a Lesser Vehicle
To ferry living beings across.
The Buddha himself dwells in the Great Vehicle,
And according to the Dharma he has attained—

"Adorned with the power of concentration and wisdom—
With this he ferries living beings across.
Having himself realized the supreme Way,
The Great Vehicle's equal Dharma,

"If he were to transform even one person
By means of the Lesser Vehicle,
I would be guilty of stinginess and greed—
Such a thing is impossible.

"If a person has faith in and takes refuge with the Buddha,
The Tathāgata does not deceive or delude,
Nor has he thoughts of avarice or envy;
He has severed evil in all dharmas.

"Therefore, throughout the ten directions,
The Buddha alone is without fear.
I adorn my body with the marks,
My light illuminates the world.

"Honored by immeasurable multitudes,
I expound the seal of true characteristics.
Śāriputra, you should know
That I originally made a vow,

"Wishing to cause all the multitude
To be equal to me without difference.
As was my vow in times past,
Now it has been completely fulfilled—

"I transform all living beings,
Causing them all to enter the Buddha-Way.
If when I encounter living beings,
I were to teach them all the Buddha-Way,

"Those without wisdom would become confused,
Deluded and unable to receive the teaching.
I know these living beings
Have never cultivated wholesome roots,

"Are firmly attached to the five desires,
And through delusion and craving generate afflictions.
Through the causes and conditions of various desires,
They fall into the three evil paths,

"Revolving through the six destinies,
Thoroughly experiencing all sufferings and poisons.
Receiving the minute form in the womb,
World after world it constantly increases.

"People of scant virtue and little merit,
Oppressed by manifold sufferings,
Enter the dense forest of wrong views—
Existence, non-existence, and the like.

"Relying upon all these views,
Fully possessed of sixty-two,
Deeply attached to false and empty dharmas,
Firmly clinging and unable to release them,

"They are arrogant and self-exalting,
Flattering and crooked, their minds insincere.
Throughout thousands of myriads of billions of kalpas,
They hear not the Buddha's name,

"Nor do they hear the correct Dharma—
Such people are difficult to ferry across.
Therefore, Śāriputra,
I establish skillful means,

"Expounding the path that exhausts all suffering,
Demonstrating nirvāṇa to them.
Though I speak of nirvāṇa,
This too is not true extinction.

"All dharmas from the origin
Have always borne the mark of tranquil extinction.
When Buddha-sons have practiced the Way,
In a future age they shall become Buddhas.

"I possess the power of skillful means
And demonstrate the teaching of the Three Vehicles.
All the World-Honored Ones
Expound the path of One Vehicle.

"Now this great assembly
Should all eliminate doubts and perplexities.
The words of all Buddhas do not differ—
There is only One, not Two Vehicles.

"Throughout past immeasurable kalpas,
Innumerable Buddhas who have entered extinction—
Hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of kinds,
Their number beyond measure—

"Such World-Honored Ones as these,
Through various conditions and parables,
Through the power of innumerable skillful means,
Have expounded the characteristics of all dharmas.

"These World-Honored Ones
All expound the Dharma of One Vehicle,
Transforming immeasurable multitudes,
Causing them to enter the Buddha-Way.

"Moreover, these Great Sage Lords,
Knowing all the world—
Devas, humans, and all categories of beings—
The deep desires of their minds,

"Further employ different skillful means
To help illuminate the foremost meaning.
If there are categories of living beings
Who encountered Buddhas of the past—

"Whether they heard Dharma, practiced giving,
Or upheld precepts, practiced patience,
Vigor, dhyāna, wisdom, and such,
Cultivating merit and wisdom in various ways—

"All such people as these
Have already attained the Buddha-Way.
After the Buddhas' final nirvāṇa,
If people have gentle and pliant minds,

"All such living beings as these
Have already attained the Buddha-Way.
After the Buddhas' final nirvāṇa,
Those who make offerings to śarīra,

"Erecting myriads of billions of kinds of stūpas—
Of gold, silver, and crystal,
Giant clam shell and agate,
Rose quartz and lapis lazuli jewels,

"Pure, vast, and well adorned,
Decorating all the stūpas—
Or some who erect stone temples,
Of sandalwood and aloe wood,

"Hovenia and other timbers,
Brick, tile, clay, and earth—
Or in a deserted wilderness
Pile earth to form a Buddha-shrine—

"Or even children at play
Heap sand to make a Buddha-stūpa—
All such people as these
Have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"If people, for the Buddha's sake,
Establish various images,
Carved and sculpted in manifold forms,
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"Whether made of seven jewels,
Copper—red or white,
Pewter, lead, or tin,
Iron, wood, or also clay,

"Or fashioned with lacquer-coated cloth
To adorn and create Buddha-images—
All such people as these
Have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"Those who painted Buddha-images
With the hundred merits adorning their marks—
Whether doing so themselves or employing others—
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"Or even children at play,
With grass, wood, or brush,
Or using fingernails
To draw and create Buddha-images—

"All such people as these,
Gradually accumulating merit and virtue,
Perfecting a heart of great compassion,
Have already attained the Buddha-Way,

"Merely transforming Bodhisattvas
And ferrying across immeasurable multitudes.
If people, before stūpas and shrines,
Or precious images and painted images,

"With flowers, incense, banners, and canopies,
Make offerings with reverent minds—
Or if they employ others to make music,
Beating drums, blowing horns and conches,

"Flutes, pipes, lutes, and harps,
Lutes, cymbals, and gongs—
Such manifold wondrous sounds
All continuously offered,

"Or with joyful minds
Singing songs praising the Buddha's virtue—
Even with but one small sound—
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.

"If a person with scattered mind,
Even with but a single flower,
Makes offerings to a painted image,
They shall gradually see innumerable Buddhas.

"Or if people make prostrations,
Or merely join their palms,
Or even raise a single hand,
Or slightly bow their heads,

"Making offerings to images with these—
They shall gradually see immeasurable Buddhas,
Themselves attaining the supreme Way,
Extensively ferrying across innumerable multitudes,

"Entering nirvāṇa without residue,
Like firewood exhausted and fire extinguished.
If people with scattered minds
Enter stūpas or shrines

"And recite but once 'Namo Buddha,'
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.
Regarding all Buddhas of the past,
Whether while living or after extinction,

"If there were those who heard this Dharma,
All have already attained the Buddha-Way.
The World-Honored Ones of the future,
Whose number is without measure—

"These Tathāgatas
Shall also expound the Dharma through skillful means.
All the Tathāgatas,
Through immeasurable skillful means,

"Ferry across all living beings,
Causing them to enter the Buddha's outflow-free wisdom.
Of those who hear the Dharma,
Not one fails to become a Buddha.

"The original vow of all Buddhas:
'The Buddha-Way that I practice—
I universally wish to cause living beings
Also to attain this same Way.'

"The Buddhas of future ages,
Though they expound hundreds of thousands of billions,
Innumerable Dharma-gates,
In truth these are for the One Vehicle.

"All Buddhas, Honored Ones of Two Feet,
Know the Dharma is always without nature;
The Buddha-seed arises from conditions—
Therefore they expound the One Vehicle.

"This Dharma dwells in the Dharma-position;
The marks of the world constantly abide.
Having known this at the place of enlightenment,
The guiding teacher expounds through skillful means.

"The presently existing Buddhas of the ten directions,
Honored and offered by devas and humans,
Their number like Ganges' sands,
Appearing in the world

"To bring peace to living beings,
Also expound this Dharma thus,
Knowing the foremost tranquil extinction,
Through the power of skillful means.

"Though they manifest various paths,
In truth these are for the Buddha Vehicle.
Knowing living beings' various practices,
The thoughts deep within their minds,

"The karma they practiced in the past,
Their desires, natures, and vigor-power,
And the keenness or dullness of their faculties—
Through various causes and conditions,

"Parables and also expressions,
In accordance with what is suitable, they expound through skillful means.
I too am now likewise thus,
To bring peace to living beings,

"Through various Dharma-gates
I proclaim and demonstrate the Buddha-Way.
Through the power of my wisdom,
Knowing living beings' natures and desires,

"I expound all dharmas through skillful means,
Causing all to attain joy.
Śāriputra, you should know
That with the Buddha-eye I observe

"And see living beings of the six paths,
Impoverished, without merit and wisdom,
Entering the dangerous path of birth and death,
Suffering continuing uninterrupted,

"Deeply attached to the five desires
Like a yak loving its tail—
Through greed and craving they cover themselves,
Blind and unseeing, they see nothing.

"Not seeking the Buddha of great power
Or the Dharma that severs suffering,
They deeply enter wrong views,
Wishing through suffering to cast off suffering.

"For the sake of these living beings
I generate a heart of great compassion.
When I first sat at the place of enlightenment,
Contemplating the tree and also walking,

"Throughout three times seven days,
I contemplated matters such as these:
'The wisdom I have attained
Is wondrous and most supreme.

"'But living beings' faculties are dull;
Attached to pleasures, blinded by delusion—
How can categories such as these
Possibly be ferried across?'

"At that time all the Brahma Kings
And the Śakra Devānām Indras,
The Four Heavenly Kings who protect the world,
And the Great Īśvara Deva,

"Together with other hosts of devas,
With retinues of hundreds of thousands of myriads,
Reverently joining palms and making obeisances,
Requested that I turn the Dharma-wheel.

"I then thought to myself:
'If I merely praise the Buddha Vehicle,
Living beings sunk in suffering
Will be unable to believe this Dharma.

"'Through breaking the Dharma and not believing,
They would fall into the three evil paths.
I would rather not expound the Dharma
And swiftly enter into nirvāṇa.'

"Then recalling the Buddhas of the past,
The power of skillful means they practiced,
'The Way I have now attained
Should also be expounded as the Three Vehicles.'

"While making such contemplation,
The Buddhas of the ten directions all appeared,
With Brahma voices comforting and exhorting me:
'Excellent, Śākyamuni!

"'Foremost guiding teacher,
Having attained this supreme Dharma,
Following all the Buddhas,
You employ the power of skillful means.

"'We too have all attained
The most wondrous, foremost Dharma,
And for all categories of living beings
Make distinctions expounding the Three Vehicles.

"'Those of little wisdom who delight in lesser dharmas,
Not believing themselves capable of becoming Buddhas—
Therefore through skillful means
We make distinctions expounding various fruits.

"'Though we furthermore expound the Three Vehicles,
It is solely to teach Bodhisattvas.'
Śāriputra, you should know:
I heard the Sacred Lion's

"Profound, pure, and wondrous voice,
Joyfully proclaiming 'Namo Buddha!'
I furthermore made this contemplation:
'I have emerged into a turbid and evil world.

"'As all the Buddhas have expounded,
I too shall follow and practice accordingly.'
Having contemplated this matter,
I immediately proceeded to Vārāṇasī.

"The mark of tranquil extinction of all dharmas
Cannot be conveyed in words.
Through the power of skillful means,
I expounded it for the five bhikṣus.

"This is called turning the Dharma-wheel;
There arose then the sound of 'nirvāṇa,'
As well as 'Arhat,'
And the distinct names 'Dharma' and 'Saṅgha.'

"From distant kalpas until now,
I have praised this nirvāṇa Dharma:
'The suffering of birth and death is eternally exhausted'—
I constantly expound thus.

"Śāriputra, you should know:
I see Buddha-sons
Aspiring to seek the Buddha-Way,
Immeasurable thousands of myriads of billions—

"All with reverent minds
Coming to where the Buddha is.
They have heard from all Buddhas
The Dharma expounded through skillful means.

"I then made this contemplation:
'The reason the Tathāgata appears
Is to expound the Buddha-wisdom—
Now precisely is the time.'

"Śāriputra, you should know:
People of dull faculties and small wisdom,
Attached to marks and arrogant—
These cannot believe this Dharma.

"Now I joyfully and without fear,
Among the Bodhisattvas,
Frankly casting aside skillful means,
Expound solely the supreme Way.

"When Bodhisattvas hear this Dharma,
All their nets of doubt are removed.
The twelve hundred Arhats
Shall likewise all become Buddhas.

"Like the Buddhas of the three periods of time,
In their manner of expounding the Dharma,
I too am now likewise thus,
Expounding the undifferentiated Dharma.

"The Buddhas' emergence in the world
Is remote and difficult to encounter.
Even when they appear in the world,
To expound this Dharma is also difficult.

"Throughout immeasurable, innumerable kalpas,
To hear this Dharma is also difficult.
Those able to listen to this Dharma—
Such people are also rare.

"Like the uḍumbara flower,
Which all love and delight in,
Rare for devas and humans—
It appears only occasionally.

"Those who hear the Dharma and joyfully praise it,
Even uttering but a single word,
Have thereby already made offerings
To all Buddhas of the three periods of time.

"Such people are extremely rare,
Surpassing even the uḍumbara flower.
You should harbor no doubts—
I am the King of all Dharmas,

"Proclaiming to the entire great assembly:
'Solely through the path of One Vehicle
I teach and transform Bodhisattvas;
There are no śrāvaka disciples.'

"You, Śāriputra,
Śrāvakas and Bodhisattvas,
Should know this wondrous Dharma
Is the secret essential of all Buddhas.

"In this evil world of five turbidities,
Where beings merely delight in attachment to desires,
Living beings such as these
Will never seek the Buddha-Way.

"The evil people of future ages,
Hearing the Buddha expound the One Vehicle,
Shall be deluded, unable to believe and receive it,
And through breaking the Dharma shall fall into evil paths.

"There are those with humility and purity
Who aspire to seek the Buddha-Way—
For ones such as these
I should extensively praise the path of One Vehicle.

"Śāriputra, you should know
The Dharma of all Buddhas is thus:
Through myriads of billions of skillful means,
They expound the Dharma in accordance with what is suitable.

"Those who are not practiced and learned in this
Cannot comprehend it thoroughly.
Since you have already come to know
That all Buddhas, teachers of the world,

"Employ skillful means in accordance with what is suitable,
You should have no further doubts or perplexities.
Let your minds give rise to great joy,
Knowing you shall become Buddhas."
