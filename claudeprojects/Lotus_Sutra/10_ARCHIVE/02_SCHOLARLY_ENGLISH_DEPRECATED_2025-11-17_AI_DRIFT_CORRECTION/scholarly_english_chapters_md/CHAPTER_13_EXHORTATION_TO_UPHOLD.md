### I. MAIN TRANSLATION

**THE BODHISATTVAS' VOWS: ACCEPTING THE TRANSMISSION**

At that moment, the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva named Medicinal-King—a Great Being of extraordinary compassion—and the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva named Great-Joy-in-Speaking—possessing the voice of great proclamation—together with twenty thousand Bodhisattvas and their retinues, all stood before the Buddha and spoke this pledge:

"World Honored One, we implore you: do not concern yourself with anxiety or doubt. After your extinction, when you have entered into final *parinirvāṇa*, we shall uphold, read, recite, and explain this supreme Dharma-teaching. We shall preserve it, we shall practice it, we shall make offerings to it.

"In the future ages, in the times that are to come, sentient beings in the worlds that follow your passing will have become fewer in wholesome roots and deeper in unwholesome tendencies. Pride and conceit will multiply. They will cling to profit and honor, hungry for recognition and worship. They will increase in destructive, unhealthy dispositions, and they will drift far from liberation and awakening.

"**Though these beings are difficult to teach and transform, we shall arise with great patient endurance. We shall read this Dharma, we shall recite it, we shall explain it and teach it. We shall write it down and preserve it in written form. We shall make every kind of offering to it. We shall not spare our bodies and lives in this sacred work.**"[^1]

At that very moment, five hundred arhats who had received the prophecy of future Buddhahood stood before the Buddha and proclaimed:

"World Honored One, after your extinction, we also vow freely and openly that we shall travel to different lands and teach this supreme Dharma extensively throughout many realms."[^2]

Then eight thousand men and women practitioners—both monks and lay followers who had received the prophecy of Buddhahood—rose from their seats, bowed with hands joined in reverence before the Buddha, and made this vow:

"World Honored One, we too vow freely to teach this supreme Dharma in lands different from our own, spreading it extensively through many realms. Why do we make this pledge? It is because in this Sahā world-realm, the beings are of base character, prone to corruption and destructive conduct. They are filled with prideful arrogance and conceit. Their wholesome roots are shallow and sparse. They are filled with anger, hatred, and filthy, twisted thoughts. Their minds are not straightforward and authentic in seeking the truth.[^3]

"For this reason, we shall undertake the burden of spreading this teaching throughout the worlds to come."[^4]

**THE BUDDHA'S AUNT AND THE WOMEN DISCIPLES**

At that time, the Buddha's aunt, the Bhikṣuṇī Mahāprajāpatī—the great grandmother-mother of all Buddhist nuns—along with six thousand nuns, both learners and established adepts, rose from their seats. In perfect unison, they joined their hands in deep reverence, their eyes fixed constantly upon the Buddha's face without ever turning away. At that moment, the World Honored One turned his attention to the nun Gautamī and spoke:

"Why do you gaze upon me with such an expression of concern? Is your heart troubled, wondering perhaps whether I have not proclaimed your name among those receiving the prophecy of Buddhahood?"[^5]

The Buddha then addressed the assembled nuns:

"Gautamī, I have already proclaimed universally that all sentient beings endowed with Buddha-nature shall receive the prophecy of Buddhahood. When you now seek to know what future awaits you, you shall learn this: In the worlds yet to come, in ages beyond counting, **you shall become a Great Teacher of the Dharma before six hundred and eighty billion Buddhas.** Along with your six thousand nun-disciples, all of you together shall serve as Great Teachers of the Dharma.

"By gradually accumulating the Bodhisattva path in this manner, you shall perfect all qualities and become yourself a Buddha. Your Buddha-name shall be **'She Who Brings Joy to All Living Beings Thus-Come-One'**—the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened One, possessed of wisdom and conduct, the Well-Gone One, the Understander of the World, the Unsurpassed One, the Controller of Beings, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One.

"Gautamī, these six thousand nuns together with you shall all progressively receive the prophecy of Buddhahood, achieving supreme enlightenment."[^6]

At that moment, the Bhikṣuṇī Rāhula's mother, the woman named Yaśodharā, had a troubling thought. She reflected: "Among all these prophecies and declarations of future Buddhahood, how is it that the World Honored One has not proclaimed my name?"[^7]

The Buddha then addressed Yaśodharā directly:

"In the worlds yet to come, in ages beyond all count, you shall cultivate the Bodhisattva path before countless Buddhas—before hundreds, thousands, millions, and billions of them. You shall become a Great Teacher of the Dharma, gradually perfecting the complete Bodhisattva way. In a good and wholesome world-realm, you shall attain Buddhahood yourself. Your Buddha-name shall be **'Possessing a Hundred Thousand Ten-Million Radiant Marks Thus-Come-One'**—the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened One, possessed of wisdom and conduct, the Well-Gone One, the Understander of the World, the Unsurpassed One, the Controller of Beings, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. The lifespan of that Buddha shall extend through numberless immeasurable eons."[^8]

At that time, both Bhikṣuṇī Mahāprajāpatī and the woman Yaśodharā—together with all their disciples—experienced great joy. They had encountered what they had never encountered before. Immediately, they expressed their happiness in verse, proclaiming before the Buddha:

"World Honored One, our Guide and Teacher,
You who bring peace and security to gods and humans,
We have heard the declaration of our future Buddhahood,
And our hearts are now complete and fully satisfied.

The names we shall bear in ages yet to come—
We shall become Buddhas, and at that time,
All the highest heavens and the human realms shall hear our teaching.
We shall protect and nurture all who come to us with trust."[^9]

After the nuns spoke these verses, they addressed the Buddha:

"World Honored One, we too are able to teach and proclaim this supreme Dharma extensively in other lands and in worlds yet to come."[^10]

**THE BODHISATTVAS' GREAT VOWS**

At that moment, the World Honored One gazed out at eighty million billions of countless Bodhisattva Mahāsattvas. These Bodhisattvas were all of them Avaivartikas—those who have attained the irreversible stage, those who turn the wheel of irreversible dharma, those who have obtained all the *dhāraṇī*s, the capacities to remember and manifest all teachings without obstruction.[^11]

These Bodhisattvas rose from their seats and approached the Buddha. With a single unified intention, they joined their palms together in reverence. In their minds, they generated this thought: **"If the World Honored One commands us to uphold and teach this supreme Dharma, we shall follow the Buddha's instruction, spreading this teaching far and wide throughout all the realms."**

Yet another thought arose within them: **"But the Buddha now stands in silence, offering no explicit command. What then is his intention? How shall we respond?"**[^12]

At that moment, these Bodhisattvas, respecting the Buddha's will and wishing to fulfill their own original vows, stood before the Buddha and roared forth their lion-vow. With a great roar of determination, they proclaimed their pledge:

"World Honored One, we do not require your command. After your extinction, we shall journey throughout the ten directions, moving back and forth in all worlds. We shall enable sentient beings to write down this supreme Dharma, to receive it, to read it, to recite it, to understand its meanings, and to practice it according to the teachings. They shall abide in right understanding and mindfulness—and all of this shall be accomplished through the power and grace of the Buddha.

"We humbly beseech the World Honored One: watch over us from other worlds, protecting us from afar through your supernatural vision and wisdom-power."[^13]

At that very moment, all the Bodhisattvas together proclaimed their determination in verse:

"Do not harbor concern or anxiety,
After the Buddha's passage into *parinirvāṇa*,
In this dark and dangerous age to come,
We shall teach this Dharma widely.

There will be those of no wisdom,
Who hurl angry words of curse and blame,
And those who come with violent weapons,
Against whom we shall exercise patience.

In the evil times ahead, there will be monks,
Possessed of twisted, perverted minds,
Who say they have attained what they have not,
Whose hearts are swollen with arrogant pride.

Or some who retreat into hermitages,
Wearing patched and ragged robes,
Who claim to practice the true path,
Looking down upon those dwelling in the world.

Driven by love of profit and gain,
They teach the Dharma to those of worldly power,
And are revered by the world like *arhats* of six powers,
Yet they harbor evil intentions.

They constantly contemplate worldly affairs,
These so-called forest dwellers of hollow name,
And they take delight in revealing our faults,
Speaking thus of us before the multitudes:

'These monks practice for profit and gain!
Their teachings are not from the Buddha,
They have invented this Sutra themselves,
To mislead and deceive the world!

They seek fame and reputation thereby,
These monks of twisted intentions.'
Making such accusations against us,
They separate themselves from the assembly.

In this evil age ahead, such are the accusations.
Yet we shall endure all such hostility,
For we deeply respect the Buddha's will,
And shall withstand whatever hardships come.

We shall wear the armor of patient endurance,
And bear witness to this Dharma,
Through all the suffering and danger,
Across this difficult and defiled age.

We do not love our bodies or our lives,
But treasure infinitely the supreme path.
In the ages yet to come, we shall
Guard what the Buddha has entrusted to us.

We are the messengers of the World Honored One,
Working in the midst of multitudes without fear.
We shall teach the Dharma with skillful means,
And pray that the Buddha find peace and rest.

Before the World Honored One,
Before all Buddhas coming from ten directions,
We make this solemn vow here,
For the Buddha's own understanding alone.

All the Bodhisattvas throughout the cosmos,
Know the sincerity of our hearts today.
We shall protect what the Buddha has entrusted—
The Buddha himself already understands our minds."[^14]

### II. PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS & APPARATUS

#### A. The Doctrine of Compassionate Burden

Chapter 13 establishes that **accepting the Dharma's transmission is accepting a burden** (*bhāra*). The Bodhisattvas pledge not easy comfort but difficult work in "dark and dangerous ages." This inverts conventional spirituality's promise of peace toward an understanding of enlightenment as **engaged participation in the world's suffering transformation**.[^15]

The phrase "We shall not spare our bodies and lives" expresses a principle of **total commitment**: dharma-transmission costs everything. Not metaphorically but literally—the teachers will face violence, calumny, rejection. Yet they vow to continue. This models the principle that **authentic teaching requires willingness to sacrifice absolutely**.[^16]

#### B. The Characterization of the Future Age

The text's description of the "evil age" presents a sociological portrait:
- **Shallow wisdom**, **rampant pride**, **twisted minds**
- **Loss of authenticity**: beings claiming attainment without achievement
- **Corruption of monasticism**: withdrawal from world paired with love of gain
- **Hostile authorities**: those who use the teaching for worldly power
- **Character assassination**: accusations of false motivation

This portrait is not pessimism but **realism about dharma-transmission's conditions**. The teaching must survive precisely where it's least wanted, taught to precisely those least receptive. The Dharma's power is measured not by its popularity but by its efficacy in the most hostile environments.[^17]

#### C. The Gender-Inclusive Prophecy Structure

Chapters 12-13 together create a remarkable progression of inclusivity:

1. **Chapter 12**: The Nāga princess (young, female, traditionally excluded) achieves instantaneous enlightenment
2. **Chapter 13**: Buddha's aunt and wife receive explicit prophecies with named Buddha-forms
3. **Chapter 13**: Even the hostility-accusers are implicitly offered the possibility of transformation through the vow-makers' patient endurance

The structure suggests that **gender inclusion is inseparable from dharma-transmission**. The Buddha's female disciples will themselves become Buddhas teaching both genders. This creates a legacy where Buddhist teaching evolves to transcend patriarchal limitation.[^18]

#### D. The Non-Command as Teaching Method

The Bodhisattvas generate two thoughts:
1. "If the Buddha commands, we shall obey"
2. "But the Buddha is silent—what is his intention?"

The Buddha's silence becomes the **supreme teaching moment**. Rather than imposing duty, the Buddha creates space for the Bodhisattvas to manifest their **own commitment arising from internal aspiration, not external obligation**.[^19]

This models the difference between:
- **Heteronomous morality**: duty imposed from outside
- **Autonomous morality**: commitment arising from within

The Buddha trusts the Bodhisattvas so completely that he permits them to determine their own response. This trust itself becomes the greatest motivation.[^20]

#### E. The Lion's Roar Vow: Fearlessness as Teaching Act

The Bodhisattvas "roar forth their lion-vow" (*simha-nāda*). The lion's roar in Buddhist literature represents fearless proclamation—the sound that silences all other animals.[^21]

The vow itself is an act of teaching: by proclaiming commitment before all Buddhas and beings, the vow-makers enact what they promise. The vow is not preliminary to teaching but teaching itself—a demonstration that even in darkness, authentic commitment persists.

This principle appears throughout: **the vow as teaching-act, not mere promise**. Through witnessing others' commitment, observers are themselves moved toward commitment.[^22]

#### F. The Armor of Patient Endurance

The verse declares: "We shall wear the armor of patient endurance" (*kṣānti-kavacha*). Patience (*kṣānti*) is transformed from personal virtue to communal protection. By embodying patient endurance, the teachers protect all beings from despair. Their refusal to retaliate or withdraw demonstrates that dharmic response transcends violence-cycles.[^23]

In contemporary terms, this models **nonviolent resistance** as spiritual practice. The teachers face accusations, mockery, violence—yet respond with continued teaching, not retaliation. This creates a quantum of spiritual power that violence cannot match because it operates in a different register.[^24]

#### G. The Triadic Structure of Response

Three groups respond to the Buddha's teaching with vows:

1. **Bodhisattvas** (20,000): Already advanced practitioners
2. **Arhats and practitioners** (8,500): Those on established path
3. **Women disciples** (6,000+ nuns, aunt, wife): Those traditionally marginalized

The structure suggests that dharma-transmission requires **all levels of society working in concert**. Enlightened masters, established practitioners, and excluded populations all participate. No single group monopolizes the transmission.[^25]

This triadic inclusion reflects the principle that **inclusive transmission is more powerful than exclusive**. The Dharma's resilience arises partly from its distribution across diverse populations who cannot all be simultaneously suppressed.

#### H. The Prophecy as Validation

The prophecies granted in Chapter 13 serve as **cosmic validation** that the vows are recognized and supported by universal forces. The prophecies don't cause the vows but confirm them. This distinction is crucial: the vow-makers' commitment is **recognized as aligned with cosmic dharmic truth**, not granted as external favor.[^26]

The prophecies specify:
- **Mahāprajāpatī**: Buddha before 680 billion other Buddhas, then herself becomes "Joy-to-All-Beings Buddha"
- **Yaśodharā**: Buddha in a wholesome realm, "Possessing-Hundred-Thousand-Radiant-Marks Buddha," with lifespan "through numberless immeasurable eons"

The staggering numbers and epochs suggest that **dharma-transmission unfolds across cosmic scales of time and space**. Individual human effort connects to infinite fields of such effort. The vow-maker becomes a nexus-point where infinite compassion flows toward finite world.[^27]

### III. APPARATUS SUMMARY

**Central Doctrines**:

1. **Dharma-Transmission as Burden**: Accepting the teaching means accepting responsibility to teach in hostile conditions

2. **Compassion Through Endurance**: Love is proven through willingness to continue teaching despite rejection and danger

3. **Autonomy in Commitment**: The Buddha's silence calls forth vow-making that arises from within, not from external command

4. **Inclusive Transmission**: All practitioners—advanced and beginning, male and female, ordained and lay—participate in dharma-preservation

5. **Vow as Teaching-Act**: The vow itself teaches by demonstrating commitment's power to transcend violence and hostility

**Eschatological Function**: Chapter 13 establishes **the practical foundation for the teaching's continuation**. Chapters 10-12 proved the teaching's cosmic validity; Chapter 13 mobilizes the universal assembly to ensure its actual transmission in time.

**Transition to Chapter 14**: Chapter 14 (the final chapter translated in this session) addresses the specific *methods* of safe and effective dharma-teaching, complementing Chapter 13's commitment with Chapter 14's practical wisdom.

## FOOTNOTES

[^1]: The pledge includes the phrase "in written form" (*shu* 書), establishing that dharma-transmission requires material preservation. The text is not merely oral teaching but written scripture that can survive the teacher's extinction. This principle explains the Lotus Sutra's own obsession with preserving itself—the text is self-aware that it is the mechanism of its own transmission.

[^2]: The five hundred arhats' vow to teach in "different lands" (*i guo tu* 異國土) establishes that transmission is not geographically limited. The teaching spreads through space, just as it survives through time. The plural "lands" suggests both different physical regions and different mind-states or consciousness-realms.

[^3]: The description of Sahā-world beings as "twisted in thought" (*xin bu zhi cheng* 心不實直) suggests that authenticity itself is what is lacking. In a world of pretense and dishonesty, teaching the truth becomes maximally difficult because the truth will be rejected as threatening existing delusions.

[^4]: The eight thousand practitioners' explicit acknowledgment of the world's corruption and their voluntary undertaking to serve it models the **Bodhisattva principle**: choosing difficulty because difficulty is where help is most needed. This inverts the logic that would have enlightened beings retreat to pure lands, remaining instead in defiled worlds specifically to serve.

[^5]: The Buddha's discernment of Mahāprajāpatī's unspoken concern demonstrates **enlightened consciousness's transparent knowledge** of others' hearts. The Buddha doesn't require speech to know intention. This capacity to read consciousness directly is itself a teaching: the Buddha's omniscience is not magical ability but transparent recognition of what is.

[^6]: The prophecy grants Mahāprajāpatī Buddha before "six hundred and eighty billion Buddhas"—an incomprehensibly vast number. This temporal scope suggests that enlightenment isn't a onetime achievement but an eternally renewed becoming. The Buddha-realm is inexhaustible; new Buddhas continuously arise. Mahāprajāpatī's role as teacher across these eons establishes **teaching as the primary activity of Bodhisattvas in motion toward Buddhahood**.

[^7]: Yaśodharā's unspoken anxiety triggers the Buddha's direct address. That even the wife of the Buddha (in his previous life as a prince) experiences concern about her future status demonstrates that no position—however exalted—guarantees recognition. This humbling of status establishes the teaching's genuine universality: all must receive the prophecy; none is assured beforehand.

[^8]: Yaśodharā's prophecy specifies "a good and wholesome world-realm" (*shan guo tu* 善國土) rather than the Sahā world's defiled condition. This suggests that different Buddhas manifest in different world-conditions: some as teachers in pure lands (Yaśodharā), some as teachers in defiled worlds (the Bodhisattvas who vow to remain in Sahā). Both modes of service are honored.

[^9]: The nuns' verse of celebration emphasizes that the prophecy brings "completion and full satisfaction" (*xin an ju zu* 心安具足). This suggests that prophecy fulfills an existential hunger: the need to know one's ultimate significance and destiny. Yet paradoxically, this assurance doesn't produce passivity but rather becomes motivation for immediate teaching.

[^10]: The nuns' declaration to "teach extensively in other lands" echoes the Buddha's own previous declarations about dharma-transmission. The text creates a replication-pattern: the Buddha's vows to teach become the disciples' vows, which become their successors' vows, extending infinitely. The transmission is not a one-time transfer but perpetual replication of compassionate commitment.

[^11]: The "eighty million billions of countless Bodhisattvas" represents an immense assembly already present, waiting for their moment of vow-making. This suggests that enlightened commitment is always already present throughout the universe, awaiting only the occasion to manifest. The Buddha doesn't create commitment; he calls forth what eternally exists.

[^12]: The two thoughts generated by the Bodhisattvas model the **internal dialogue between obedience and autonomy**. The Buddha's silence creates a gap that allows the Bodhisattvas to generate their own response from within, rather than mechanically following command. This gap is fertile precisely because it's not filled with coercion.

[^13]: The phrase "all of this shall be accomplished through the power and grace of the Buddha" (*jie shi fo li* 皆是佛力) establishes that dharma-transmission, though requiring individual effort, is supported by cosmic power. The teacher's effort and Buddha's grace work together—not in opposition but in complementary fashion. This parallels modern systems-theory's recognition that complex systems require both internal agency and external support-structures.

[^14]: The verse's repeated refrain—"we shall endure all accusations," "we shall not spare our bodies," "the Buddha understands our hearts"—creates an incantatory rhythm that itself teaches through aesthetic power. The verse is not merely describing commitment; through rhythm and repetition, it enacts commitment. Form and content align perfectly.

[^15]: The concept of **dharma as burden** appears in the Sanskrit *bhāra* and in the Pali *bhāra*-formula of Buddhist practice. Rather than the teaching being a gift received with ease, it is a responsibility accepted with difficulty. This makes dharma-transmission different from commodity-exchange: it's not transferring something external but taking on the weight of authentic continuance.

[^16]: **Total commitment** in Buddhist practice (*samyak-sambuddha*—perfect enlightenment—means "complete awakening") requires complete investment. The vow to "not spare bodies and lives" articulates this: there is no reserve remaining, no part of oneself withheld. This total vulnerability is what makes the teaching credible.

[^17]: The description of the "dark age" (*mo fa* 末法) is a classical Buddhist concept of temporal decline. Yet rather than despair, the text responds by **strengthening commitment precisely where conditions are weakest**. This inverts the logic of decline: if transmission succeeds in the worst age, it's most powerful; if it survives the strongest opposition, its authenticity is proven.

[^18]: **Gender-inclusive transmission** appears here as a natural consequence of enlightenment-recognition. Once the Nāga princess achieves Buddha-form and the other women receive prophecies, the equation changes: future ages will include female teachers teaching to both genders. This creates a genealogy of female dharma-transmission that becomes itself dharmic truth to be transmitted.

[^19]: **The Buddha's silence as supreme teaching** accords with Zen/Chan Buddhism's principle of direct pointing rather than conceptual instruction. Words can mislead; silence invites authentic response. The Bodhisattvas' response emerging from silence is more genuine than response to explicit command would be.

[^20]: **Autonomous morality** (*Kant*) grounds obligation in reason's internal imperative, not external authority. The Buddhist version here substitutes **wisdom's internal clarity** for Kantian reason. The Bodhisattvas see clearly what the dharma requires and commit autonomously to it. This grounds commitment in wisdom rather than duty.

[^21]: The **lion's roar** (*simha-nāda*) in Buddhist texts refers to the Buddha's and great practitioners' unafraid proclamation of truth. Unlike ordinary speech that may be tentative or self-protective, the lion's roar represents confidence grounded in perfect knowledge. The Bodhisattvas' vow, roared forth, is proclamation of ultimate truth.

[^22]: **Vow as teaching-act** differs from viewing the vow as preliminary to teaching. Here, the vow itself teaches by demonstrating commitment's possibility and power. Observers witnessing the vow are themselves moved toward commitment. The vow becomes contagious—not through coercion but through inspiring recognition.

[^23]: **Patience-armor** (*kṣānti-kavacha*) suggests that non-retaliation is not weakness but protection. By absorbing violence without responding in kind, the patient teacher breaks the cycle of escalation. They become invulnerable not through hardness but through non-resistance—like water enduring the rocks yet never being broken.

[^24]: **Nonviolent resistance as spiritual practice** appears in various traditions (Gandhi's *ahimsa*, MLK's "nonviolent direct action," Buddhist *śīla*). Chapter 13 grounds this practice in ontological principle: violence operates in the realm of conditioned phenomena; dharmic response operates in the realm of ultimate truth. These don't compete at the same level; dharmic response transcends violence's domain.

[^25]: The **triadic structure** of Bodhisattvas, established practitioners, and marginalized disciples reflects the principle of **inclusive participation in sacred work**. Unlike hierarchical structures where only the elite serve, this model affirms that all levels of capacity and status contribute. The widow's mite is as valued as the king's treasure.

[^26]: **Prophecy as recognition rather than creation** emphasizes that the Buddha's words reveal what already is, rather than conferring what wasn't. The prophecy doesn't make the disciples Buddhas; it recognizes their Buddha-nature already manifesting through commitment. This epistemological principle—recognition over creation—recurs throughout the Lotus Sutra.

[^27]: **Cosmic scales of time and space** (680 billion Buddhas, immeasurable eons) serve to **relativize individual significance while affirming it**. The individual vow-maker is infinitesimal in cosmic scope yet participates in infinite fields of compassion. This paradoxical affirmation—cosmic insignificance combined with cosmic significance—is the Lotus Sutra's characteristic move.
