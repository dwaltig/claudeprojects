## Translation

### Prose Section: The Final Assignment of Dharma-Continuity

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha rose from his dharma-seat, revealed great supernatural powers, and with his right hand touched the heads of innumerable bodhisattvas, speaking these words: "Through countless, incalculable eons, I have cultivated and perfected the supreme dharma of unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment. Now I entrust this dharma to all of you. You should all unite in mind and widely proclaim this dharma, causing it to increase and flourish¹."

Thus did the Buddha touch the heads of the bodhisattva assembly three times, each time declaring: "Through countless, incalculable eons, I have cultivated and perfected the supreme dharma of unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment. Now I entrust this dharma to all of you. You should receive and maintain it, widely proclaim it in all realms, allowing all beings to hear it completely. Why? Because I possess great compassion, complete absence of stinginess or miserliness, and no fear whatsoever. I am able to bestow upon all sentient beings the Buddha's wisdom, the Tathāgata's wisdom, and the spontaneously arising wisdom². All the Tathāgatas are great benefactors to all sentient beings. You too should follow the example of the Tathāgata, abandoning all stinginess. In the future age, when virtuous men and women who possess faith in the Tathāgata's wisdom approach you, you should widely expound this Lotus Sutra to them so that they may hear it fully. For what reason? In order that they might attain Buddha-wisdom³.

"Should any sentient beings not believe, not receive, and not maintain this sutra, then you should guide them through the remaining profound dharmas taught by the Tathāgata, demonstrating benefits to them through skillful teachings, giving joy and delight so that they gradually attain the bodhisattva path. All of you should thereby repay the graciousness of all the Tathāgatas⁴."

At that moment, hearing the Buddha's instructions, all the bodhisattva assembly experienced profound joy that pervaded their entire being. Even greater reverence and respect arose within them. Bowing low with bent bodies, lowering their heads, and bringing their palms together, they collectively declared: "Just as the World-Honored One has instructed, we shall certainly fulfill this teaching completely. Please have no concern or anxiety, World-Honored One. We shall certainly receive and maintain, read and recite, widely proclaim, and explain this dharma in all lands, enabling all beings to hear it. We shall widely teach it, fulfilling the World-Honored One's instructions⁵."

The bodhisattva assembly made this declaration three times: "Just as the World-Honored One has instructed, we shall certainly fulfill this teaching completely. Please have no concern, World-Honored One. We shall certainly comply with the World-Honored One's instructions, receiving, maintaining, reading, and reciting this dharma in all lands."

At that moment, Śākyamuni Buddha caused all the emanation-Buddhas from the ten directions—Buddhas seated beneath precious trees throughout the universe—to return to their respective lands. The Buddha then declared: "Each of you Buddhas should rest content. The multi-jeweled stupa of the eternally present Buddha (Prabhūtaratna), may it return to its original condition." Hearing this instruction, all these things occurred as the Buddha proclaimed⁶.

At that time, Prabhūtaratna Buddha, together with Śākyamuni Buddha and all the emanation-Buddhas, the boundless company of bodhisattvas numbering like dust-particles, the leaders of the bodhisattva assembly (the Viśiṣṭa group), the śrāvaka assemblies of the four categories (monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen), and all beings throughout the world—gods, humans, asuras, and all—heard the Buddha's proclamation and all experienced great delight. Bowing respectfully with their heads to the Buddha's feet, they accepted his instruction as an eternal law⁷.

### Verse Section: The Eternal Transmission

*At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

All the Buddhas, saviors of the world,
Dwelling in great supernatural power,
For the sake of the bodhisattva path,
Now entrust this dharma to you all.

My Buddha-dharma, accumulated across eons,
Through the cultivation of difficult practices,
Now I place within your hands—
Guard it and cause it to flourish⁸.

In all future worlds,
You should widely proclaim this teaching,
Never allowing it to be exhausted or lost,
So all beings may hear of it⁹.

Buddhas throughout the ten directions,
Both those present now and those of past and future,
Have all proclaimed through the gateway of skillful means,
But this sutra is supreme among all dharmas¹⁰.

Whoever receives and maintains this sutra,
Receives and maintains all the buddhas' dharmas;
Whoever reads and recites this sutra,
Reads and recites all the dharma spoken by all buddhas¹¹.

Therefore practice with single-minded devotion,
Treat the sutra as the Buddha himself,
Just as you honor me with supreme respect,
So too honor this sutra without distinction.

In all places where this sutra dwells,
Whether in monasteries or in forests,
In gardens beneath trees or in dwellings,
Or in lecture-halls or any building—
In all such places should stupas be erected,
And all should make reverent offerings,
Gathering in masses like clouds,
Honoring this place as the Buddha's sacred site.

The Buddha, having attained enlightenment here,
Turns the dharma-wheel here,
Enters final nirvāṇa here—
All the Buddha-functions occur where the dharma dwells¹².

After I enter the final extinction,
You should spread this sutra,
Causing all the world-systems
To hear of its teachings.

By this, you shall all repay
The kindness of the Tathāgata,
And quickly attain
Perfect enlightenment¹³.

### Philosophical Implications

Chapter 22 completes the Lotus Sutra's structure with an act of formal transmission. The Buddha, about to enter final nirvāṇa, entrusts the sutra-dharma to the assembled bodhisattvas and beings. This creates a legal and spiritual bond: the assembly vows to continue transmission; the Buddha authorizes this continuation.

The threefold touching of the bodhisattvas' heads carries profound significance. This is a gesture of blessing and authorization, appearing in multiple Buddhist contexts. More specifically, it echoes the Buddha's original awakening at the bodhi-tree, where he touched the earth to witness his enlightenment. Here, the Buddha touches the bodhisattvas' heads to witness and authorize their dharma-transmission capacity.

The language of the assignment itself deserves careful attention. The Buddha does not give merely a teaching or instruction but assigns "the dharma of unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment" itself. This is not a verbal transfer but a trans-temporal event. The Buddha places within the bodhisattvas' "hands" (metaphorically) the actual enlightenment-dharma that took him countless eons to perfect. This suggests a radical Buddhist principle: that enlightenment is not a personal achievement but a cosmic dharma that passes from Buddha to bodhisattva to future-Buddha across eons.

The emphasis on "refusing none and fearing none" deserves attention. The Buddha declares that he possesses "complete absence of stinginess" and "no fear whatsoever." In Buddhism, stinginess (mātcharya) is listed as a fundamental obstacle to generosity and enlightenment. The Buddha's complete absence of stinginess means unlimited generosity—specifically, the unreserved gift of enlightenment-dharma to all beings. His fearlessness means that this gift is offered regardless of whether beings believe or reject it.

The principle that Buddhas possess three wisdoms—the Buddha's wisdom, the Tathāgata's wisdom, and spontaneously-arising wisdom—represents a sophisticated Buddhist epistemology. The first wisdom involves knowing all dharmas; the second involves knowing all beings' capacities and inclinations; the third involves spontaneous, effortless knowing that requires no deliberation. The bodhisattvas are authorized to transmit these wisdoms.

The provision for those who "do not believe, do not receive, do not maintain" the sutra deserves careful attention. The Buddha does not declare such beings forever lost. Rather, he instructs the bodhisattvas to guide them through "remaining profound dharmas" and "skillful teachings" appropriate to their capacity. This reflects the principle of upaya (skillful means): dharma-teachers adjust their teaching to each being's capacity, recognizing that the Lotus Sutra represents one of infinite dharma-gates through which all beings eventually approach enlightenment.

The response of the assembly—their declaration made three times—mirrors the Buddha's threefold transmission. This creates a symmetrical structure: the Buddha speaks three times assigning the dharma; the assembly responds three times vowing to maintain it. This parallelism suggests perfect understanding and alignment.

The geographical distribution of the emanation-Buddhas returning to their respective lands symbolizes that dharma-transmission is not spatially limited. Buddhas in all directions return to their realms, yet remain connected through the unified dharma-transmission of the Lotus Sutra. Distance becomes irrelevant; through the sutra, all Buddha-realms maintain continuous connection.

The reincorporation of Prabhūtaratna Buddha's stupa—returning to its "original condition"—suggests that the stupa's manifestation served a specific function (verifying the sutra through its presence) that is now completed. The stupa dematerializes or returns to its eternal form, suggesting that temporal manifestations serve temporary purposes while eternal dharma persists.

The final declaration that all beings—"gods, humans, asuras, and all"—accept the instruction "as an eternal law" is crucial. The transmission is not merely to bodhisattvas or humans but to all categories of beings. Moreover, they accept it "as eternal law," suggesting that dharma-transmission acquires cosmic legal status. It becomes not merely spiritual practice but ontological necessity, woven into the structure of existence itself.

### Apparatus Summary

**Context**: Chapter 22 concludes the Lotus Sutra's main teaching. It formalizes through ceremonial assignment what has been taught throughout the preceding chapters.

**Central Teaching**: The Buddha formally entrusts the dharma of unsurpassed enlightenment to all assembled beings, establishing their responsibility and capacity for continuing dharma-transmission after his passing. This transmission is not limited to a single era or location but extends eternally and universally.

**Structural Function**: Chapter 22 completes the sutra's movement from revelation (Chapters 1-2, where the Buddha announces the three vehicles will be unified), through demonstrations of universal Buddha-nature (Chapters 3-14), through the theological apex establishing eternal Buddha-presence (Chapters 15-16), through practical consequences (Chapters 17-20), through cosmic verification (Chapter 21), to final assignment (Chapter 22). The sutra's logical arc is complete.

**Key Doctrinal Claims**:
- "The Buddha entrusts to all beings the dharma of unsurpassed enlightenment"—establishes universal responsibility for dharma-transmission
- "Those who maintain the sutra maintain the Buddha himself"—identifies text with sacred presence
- "Wherever the sutra dwells, the Buddha's functions occur"—elevates the text to ongoing Buddha-manifestation
- "All beings, regardless of belief, receive skillful teaching"—reaffirms universal inclusivity
- "Dharma-transmission becomes eternal law"—establishes transmission as cosmic necessity

**Philosophical Connections**:
- **Three vehicles unified** (Chapter 2): The assignment to "all beings" completes the unification—all are now assigned the role of dharma-transmitter
- **Buddha-nature** (Chapters 8-9): All beings possess capacity to receive and transmit the dharma
- **Eternal Buddha** (Chapters 15-16): The Buddha remains eternally present through the sutra's transmission
- **Dharma-body** (implicit throughout): The sutra is Buddha's body; maintaining it is maintaining Buddha-presence

**Footnotes**:

¹ **Touching the heads**: This gesture appears throughout Buddhist rituals as a sign of blessing, authorization, and transmission. The threefold touching emphasizes the completeness and perfection of the transmission.

² **Three wisdoms**: Buddha's wisdom (knowing all dharmas), Tathāgata's wisdom (knowing all beings' capacities), and spontaneously-arising wisdom (effortless, non-deliberative knowing) represent the three aspects of enlightened consciousness.

³ **The sole purpose: Buddha-wisdom**: The final clause "in order that they might attain Buddha-wisdom" reveals that every teaching, every transmission, every skilful means has a single ultimate purpose—the attainment of complete enlightenment.

⁴ **Guidance through remaining dharmas**: The principle that bodhisattvas guide non-believers through "remaining profound dharmas" reflects Buddhist understanding that the Lotus Sutra, while supreme, is not the only valid dharmic teaching. Different beings approach enlightenment through different gates.

⁵ **Three-fold vow**: The assembly's response, made three times, emphasizes the absolute commitment. This triple declaration creates a binding commitment, mirroring monastic vows that are typically taken three times.

⁶ **Return of emanation-Buddhas**: The emanation-Buddhas who gathered to verify the sutra now return to their respective lands, suggesting that the verification-function is complete and they resume their own Buddha-activity in their own realms.

⁷ **Eternal law status**: The phrase "accepted as eternal law" (śāśvata-niyama) suggests that dharma-transmission acquires cosmic legal status, not merely ethical status. It becomes part of the fundamental structure of reality.

⁸ **Eons of cultivation**: The verse emphasizes that enlightenment-dharma represents the fruition of countless eons of Buddha-cultivation. It is not arbitrarily given but represents the accumulated realization of Buddha-practice.

⁹ **Never exhausted or lost**: The vow that the dharma will "never be exhausted or lost" suggests eternal transmission. Unlike material goods that can be depleted, dharma-transmission is self-perpetuating.

¹⁰ **Skillful means as preparation**: The verse acknowledges that all buddhas of past and future teach through skillful means, but identifies the Lotus Sutra as "supreme among all dharmas." This establishes a hierarchy while acknowledging the legitimacy of other teachings.

¹¹ **Identity of maintainer and recipient**: The principle that maintaining the sutra is equivalent to receiving all buddhas' dharma suggests a non-dual understanding where the maintainer and the dharma become inseparable.

¹² **Three Buddha-functions at sutra-locations**: The enumeration—enlightenment, dharma-transmission, final nirvāṇa—represents the complete Buddha-life. Wherever the sutra dwells, all three Buddha-functions are eternally accessible.

¹³ **Quick attainment**: The final promise that bodhisattvas "quickly attain perfect enlightenment" through their commitment to dharma-transmission reflects the Lotus Sutra's most fundamental principle: engagement with this dharma swiftly leads to enlightenment.
