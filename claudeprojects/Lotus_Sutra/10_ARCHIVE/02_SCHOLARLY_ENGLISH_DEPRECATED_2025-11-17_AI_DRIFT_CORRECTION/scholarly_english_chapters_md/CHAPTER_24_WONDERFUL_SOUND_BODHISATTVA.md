*妙音菩薩品第二十四*

## Translation

### Prose Section: The Interdimensional Visitor

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha emitted the light-marks of universal brilliance from between his eyebrows, illuminating to the east one hundred eight hundred million nayuta realms. Beyond that number of worlds, there existed a realm named Pure-Light-Adorned. In that realm dwelt a Buddha named Pure-Lotus-Celestial-Wisdom-Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, the One Perfectly Accomplished in Knowledge and Conduct, the Sugata, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassable Guide, the Tamer of the Untamed, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. He was surrounded and honored by innumerable and incalculable assemblies of great bodhisattvas as he expounded the dharma¹.

At that time, the light from the Buddha's eyebrow-mark illuminated the Pure-Light-Adorned realm, causing that Buddha and his assembly to perceive Śākyamuni Buddha's dharma-transmission. Within that realm dwelt a bodhisattva named Wonderful-Sound, one who had long cultivated roots of virtue, paid reverence to countless billions of Buddhas, and achieved profound wisdom. This bodhisattva had perfected eighteen kinds of dharma-gates (meditative absorptions and capacities), including the Marvelous-Banner Samādhi, the Dharma-Blossom Samādhi, the Pure-Virtue Samādhi, the Celestial-Play Samādhi, the Boundless Samādhi, the Wisdom-Seal Samādhi, the Gate of Understanding-All-Beings'-Language, the Samādhi of Gathering All Merits, the Pure Samādhi, the Divine-Play-Through-Powers Samādhi, the Wisdom-Torch Samādhi, the Sovereign-Adornment Samādhi, the Pure-Illumination Samādhi, the Treasury-of-Purity Samādhi, the Unshared Samādhi, the Solar-Revolution Samādhi, and countless billions of other dharma-gates².

When the Buddha's light illuminated this bodhisattva's body, Wonderful-Sound immediately addressed his Buddha, Pure-Lotus-Celestial-Wisdom: "World-Honored One, I perceive that the light from Śākyamuni Buddha's form reaches here. I wish to journey to the Sahā world-realm, to pay reverence to, to draw near to, to offer worship to Śākyamuni Buddha, and to see Mañjuśrī the Dharma-Prince and other bodhisattvas, including Medicine King and Courageous-Giver. I also wish to hear the Dharma-Blossom Sutra³."

His Buddha, Pure-Lotus-Celestial-Wisdom, replied: "My child, do not regard the Sahā realm with disdain or contempt. Why? Because the Sahā world is rocky and uneven, filled with dirt and soil. The body of Śākyamuni Buddha is diminutive, and the bodhisattvas too are small in stature. Yet your body measures forty-two thousand yojanas, while my body measures six hundred eighty thousand yojanas. Your form is supremely beautiful, adorned with hundreds of thousands of blessings and resplendent light, incomparably magnificent. When you travel there, do not regard that realm or its Buddha and bodhisattvas with contempt⁴."

Wonderful-Sound replied to his Buddha: "World-Honored One, my journey to the Sahā world is entirely the power of the Tathāgata. It is the Tathāgata's miraculous display, the Tathāgata's virtue and wisdom adorning all things⁵."

Having said this, Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva did not rise from his seat, his body remained unmoved, yet through the power of samādhi, he manifested in the Sahā realm at Vulture Peak Mountain. Before the Buddha's dharma-seat, he created eighty-four thousand jeweled lotus flowers: their stems were made of refined gold, their leaves of white silver, their pistils of vajra-stone, their calyxes of precious carnelian-ruby stone⁶.

At that time, Mañjuśrī the Dharma-Prince, observing these lotus flowers, addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what is the cause and significance of this miraculous manifestation? What auspicious sign do these countless thousands of lotus flowers, with stems of refined gold, leaves of silver, pistils of vajra, and calyxes of precious stones, portend⁷?"

Śākyamuni Buddha replied to Mañjuśrī: "The Great Bodhisattva Wonderful-Sound desires to come from the Pure-Light realm, together with eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas, to visit this Sahā world-realm, to pay reverence, to draw near, to offer worship to me, and to hear the Dharma-Blossom Sutra⁸."

Mañjuśrī asked: "World-Honored One, what virtuous roots has this bodhisattva cultivated? What dharma has this bodhisattva practiced? What samādhi does this bodhisattva dwell in? I wish to understand the name of this samādhi, that we too might cultivate and practice it. If one cultivates this samādhi, one may behold this bodhisattva's magnificent form, the marks of his bearing and deportment. I pray that the World-Honored One will display his miraculous power so that this bodhisattva comes, and allow us all to perceive him⁹."

The Buddha told Mañjuśrī: "The eternally-present Buddha Prabhūtaratna shall display his form and reveal this bodhisattva's appearance¹⁰."

At that moment, Prabhūtaratna Buddha addressed Wonderful-Sound from the jeweled stupa: "Come, virtuous man. The Dharma-Prince Mañjuśrī wishes to perceive your form⁸."

Then Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva disappeared from the Pure-Light realm and, together with eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas, journeyed to the Sahā world. Wherever they passed, the six kinds of earth-trembling occurred, and the sky rained precious lotus flowers. Celestial music played spontaneously without being played. The Great Bodhisattva's eyes resembled vast blue lotus flowers. His face was exceedingly beautiful and dignified, surpassing the magnificence created by the merger of a hundred thousand billion moons. His body shone with the radiance of refined gold, adorned with hundreds of thousands of merits and virtues. His magnificence blazed with resplendent light; his marks and signs were all complete, as if embodying the steadfast nature of the mighty Nārāyaṇa¹¹.

He ascended the jeweled platform, rose seven palm-trees high in the void, and approached Vulture Peak Mountain together with his bodhisattva-assembly. Upon arrival, he descended from the jeweled platform and, holding an ornament of pearls worth hundreds of thousands, approached Śākyamuni Buddha, bowed with his head to the Buddha's feet, and presented the ornament, speaking:

"World-Honored One, the Buddha Pure-Lotus-Celestial-Wisdom sends his regards. He inquires: Does the World-Honored One experience few ailments, few sufferings, and does he dwell in ease? Do the four elements remain in harmony? Is the world bearable? Are the people easy to teach? Do they experience little greed, anger, delusion, jealousy, and stinginess? Do they show respect to parents, honor monks, avoid perverse views and unwholesome thoughts, and guard their five senses well? Are the people able to overcome demonic armies? Has the eternally-present Buddha Prabhūtaratna, who entered final extinction ages ago, come to listen to the dharma? And how is the eternally-present Buddha—is he peaceful, few-suffering, and able to remain permanently? World-Honored One, I wish to behold the eternally-present Buddha. Please reveal him so that I may see¹²."

Śākyamuni Buddha said to Prabhūtaratna: "This Great Bodhisattva Wonderful-Sound wishes to meet you."

Prabhūtaratna replied to Wonderful-Sound: "Excellent, excellent, virtuous man! You have come to this realm to honor Śākyamuni Buddha, to hear the Dharma-Blossom Sutra, and to see Mañjuśrī and others. You have accomplished this well¹³."

At that time, the Bodhisattva Dharma-Virtue asked the Buddha: "World-Honored One, what virtuous roots has this Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva cultivated? What dharmas does he practice to possess such miraculous power?"

The Buddha replied to Dharma-Virtue: "In ages past, there was a Buddha named Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Sovereign—the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One. In the dharma of that Buddha, Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva cultivated celestial music as offering for twelve thousand years, presenting to that Buddha one hundred thousand varieties of musical instruments. Additionally, he offered eighty-four thousand seven-jeweled bowls. Through this karma, he was born in the Pure-Light-Adorned realm and acquired this miraculous power¹⁴.

"Dharma-Virtue, do you now see Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva sitting here before you? Though his body appears to dwell in this place, he simultaneously manifests in countless forms throughout the ten directions, teaching the Dharma-Blossom Sutra to all sentient beings. Sometimes he appears as a Brahma-king, sometimes as Śakra, sometimes as a self-mastering deity, sometimes as a great self-mastering deity, sometimes as a celestial general, sometimes as King Vaiśravaṇa, sometimes as a Cakravartin-king, sometimes as a smaller king, sometimes as a clan-leader, sometimes as a householder, sometimes as an official, sometimes as a Brahmin, sometimes as a monk or nun, sometimes as a male or female lay follower, sometimes as a wife of a householder or official, sometimes as a Brahmin woman, sometimes as a boy or girl, or even as a divine dragon, nāga, yakṣa, gandharva, asura, garuda, kinnara, mahoraga, human or non-human being. He manifests in these forms to teach the dharma. And he saves even those in the hell-realms, hungry ghost realms, animal realms, and the difficult-to-escape realms. He even appears in royal palaces as a female form to teach the dharma¹⁵."

The Buddha continued: "Dharma-Virtue, Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva performs such miraculous transformations and through wisdom illuminates the Sahā world, enabling all sentient beings to understand according to their capacities. Likewise, in the ten-directional worlds numbering like the sands of the Ganges River, he manifests in similar ways. Depending on whom he encounters: if a being requires the form of a śrāvaka to be taught, he manifests that form; if a solitary-buddha, he manifests that form; if a bodhisattva, he manifests that form; if a Buddha, he manifests the Buddha-form; if a being requires extinction to reach liberation, he demonstrates that extinction¹⁶."

Dharma-Virtue Bodhisattva asked: "World-Honored One, this bodhisattva has cultivated such profound virtue. In what samādhi does he dwell such that he can manifest these transformations and benefit countless beings?"

The Buddha replied: "This samādhi is called 'Manifesting All Forms.' Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva dwells in this samādhi and thereby benefits countless sentient beings¹⁷."

When the Dharma-Blossom Sutra regarding the Coming and Going of Wonderful-Sound was taught, the eighty-four thousand beings who had journeyed with Wonderful-Sound all obtained the Samādhi of Manifesting All Forms. Moreover, countless bodhisattvas throughout the Sahā world and the ten directions obtained this samādhi and dharma-gate⁸.

After paying reverence and offering to Śākyamuni Buddha and the stupa of the eternally-present Buddha, Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva returned to his own realm together with the eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas. As they traveled through all the lands they passed, six-fold trembling occurred, precious lotus flowers rained, and hundreds of millions of kinds of celestial music played.

Having returned to his realm, Wonderful-Sound approached the Buddha Pure-Lotus-Celestial-Wisdom together with the eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas and addressed him: "World-Honored One, I have journeyed to the Sahā world and derived great benefit for all sentient beings. I have seen Śākyamuni Buddha, perceived the stupa of the eternally-present Buddha Prabhūtaratna, and met Mañjuśrī the Dharma-Prince and other bodhisattvas including Medicine King and Courageous-Giver. I have also enabled these eighty-four thousand bodhisattvas to obtain the Samādhi of Manifesting All Forms. Moreover, through teaching this teaching of the Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva's Coming-and-Going, forty-two thousand celestial deities have obtained the recognition of the non-arising of dharmas, and the Bodhisattva Dharma-Virtue has obtained the Dharma-Blossom Samādhi¹⁹."

### Verse Section: The Transformation-Manifestation

*At that time, the Buddha wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

From the eastern realm, beyond reckoning,
From the Pure-Light-Adorned World,
There came a bodhisattva named Wonderful-Sound,
Together with eighty-four thousand beings²⁰.

He cultivated virtue in the ancient past,
And made celestial-music offerings
To the Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Sovereign,
For twelve thousand years continuously.

Through this offering, he attained realization,
And was born in that pure realm,
Where he dwells perfected in all merits,
In the light-adorned paradise.

He manifests infinite forms,
In all the worlds of the ten directions,
Teaching the dharma in countless ways,
Transforming according to each being's need²¹.

If one requires a Buddha-form for teaching,
He manifests as Buddha;
If one requires a bodhisattva-form,
He manifests accordingly.

If one requires extinction to reach peace,
He demonstrates that nirvāṇa;
In such boundless manifestations,
He performs his sacred work.

Upon hearing Śākyamuni Buddha's name,
And learning of the Dharma-Blossom Sutra,
He journeyed across incalculable worlds,
With eighty-four thousand attending companions.

Eighty-four thousand precious lotus flowers,
With golden stems and silver leaves,
Adorned with diamond pistils,
And ruby calyxes in profusion²².

The earth trembled with six-fold motion,
While precious flowers fell like rain,
And celestial music played spontaneously,
As the great assembly perceived his coming.

This bodhisattva's body measures vastly,
Forty-two thousand yojanas in extent,
Adorned with hundreds of thousands of marks,
Resplendent with wisdom and merit²³.

The Buddha's eyebrow-light revealed him,
And all beheld the great being's form,
And heard the dharma he expounded,
The path of manifesting all forms.

All those who traveled with him,
Gained the samādhi of manifestation,
And forty-two thousand celestial deities,
Obtained the dharma-eye of recognition.

After paying reverence to the eternal Buddha,
And to the stupa of Prabhūtaratna,
The Wonderful-Sound Bodhisattva returned,
To his own Pure-Light realm.

### Philosophical Implications

Chapter 24 demonstrates a revolutionary principle: that bodhisattvas can exist in multiple Buddha-realms simultaneously and maintain autonomous agency even while being expressions of another being's miraculous power. The paradox is emphasized repeatedly: Wonderful-Sound "did not rise from his seat, his body remained unmoved, yet through the power of samādhi" he manifested elsewhere.

This suggests a Buddhist understanding of consciousness that is radically non-local. The bodhisattva's consciousness is not confined to a single body but can inhabit multiple manifestations without fragmentation. This is not reincarnation (sequential birth in different forms) but simultaneous manifestation (existing in multiple forms at once).

The enumeration of transformation-forms represents the principle of upaya (skillful means) taken to its ultimate expression. The bodhisattva does not teach a single doctrine to all beings but adapts manifestation to each being's condition and capacity. Moreover, the forms themselves are doctrine: by appearing as a Buddha when Buddha-teaching is needed, or as a helper when help is needed, the bodhisattva's very presence teaches.

The interdimensional travel raises questions about the relationship between Buddha-realms. The chapter suggests that Buddha-realms, though distant, remain connected through the miraculous activity of realized beings. The light-ray that alerts Wonderful-Sound of Śākyamuni Buddha's teaching and his journey across dimensions suggest that the cosmos is unified by dharma-transmission even across seemingly separate worlds.

The relationship between the two Buddhas (Pure-Lotus-Celestial-Wisdom and Śākyamuni) is significant. The first Buddha does not hinder Wonderful-Sound's journey; indeed, both celebrate his coming. This suggests that Buddhas are not competitive sovereigns but collaborative participants in a unified dharma-transmission spanning all realms.

### Apparatus Summary

**Context**: Chapter 24 continues the exemplar-narrative sequence begun in Chapter 23. While Chapter 23 focused on extreme bodily offering, Chapter 24 emphasizes unlimited manifestation-capacity.

**Central Teaching**: A bodhisattva who cultivates can manifest in all forms needed to teach all beings. This manifestation is not limited to a single realm or body but operates across infinite dimensions and simultaneous forms.

**Structural Function**: Chapter 24 establishes that Buddhahood (or advanced bodhisattvahood) includes the capacity for unlimited manifestation. This prepares for Chapter 25's focus on a specific manifestation form (Avalokiteśvara's compassionate responses).

**Key Doctrinal Claims**:
- "Bodhisattvas manifest through the power of samādhi while remaining in original location"—establishes non-local consciousness
- "Manifestation-forms adjust to each being's requirement"—applies upaya principle to embodiment itself
- "All Buddha-realms remain connected through dharma-transmission"—asserts cosmic unity
- "The samādhi of manifesting all forms is the key to universal teaching"—identifies specific meditation as prerequisite

**Footnotes**:

¹ **Light-mark revelation**: The Buddha's eyebrow-mark light illuminates to the east, suggesting that dimensional boundaries are permeable to enlightened activity.

² **Eighteen samādhis**: The text enumerates eighteen dharma-gates representing different aspects of perfected consciousness: manifestation-capacity, dharma-mastery, purity, play, boundlessness, wisdom-seal, language-understanding, merit-gathering, purity, power-play, wisdom-illumination, sovereign-adornment, illumination, purity-treasury, unshared-nature, solar-revolution, and presumably others not enumerated.

³ **Cross-realm communication**: Wonderful-Sound immediately recognizes the distant Buddha's light and desires to visit, suggesting telepathic communication across dimensional boundaries.

⁴ **The warning against contempt**: The warning against despising the Sahā realm or its Buddha and bodhisattvas is significant—it reflects Buddhist understanding that all realms possess dignity regardless of their physical characteristics. Superiority of realm (beauty, size) does not correlate with spiritual importance.

⁵ **Attribution to Buddha-power**: Wonderful-Sound's statement that his coming is entirely the Buddha's power rather than his own effort suggests radical non-agency. Even the bodhisattva's manifestations are attributed to the Buddha's miraculous activity.

⁶ **Materiality as samādhi-manifestation**: The lotus flowers do not pre-exist but are created "through the power of samādhi." This suggests that material forms are emanations of consciousness-states.

⁷ **Mañjuśrī's role**: Mañjuśrī, the Dharma-Prince representing wisdom, consistently asks about teachings and their significance, functioning as the assembly's intellectual representative.

⁸ **Repeated emphasis on sutra-hearing**: Multiple characters desire to "hear the Dharma-Blossom Sutra," suggesting that sutra-hearing is the central purpose of all dharma-transmission across all realms.

⁹ **Samādhi as prerequisite**: Mañjuśrī's request to learn the samādhi-name suggests that understanding the meditation-practice is prerequisite to perceiving the bodhisattva's form. Perception and meditation are linked.

¹⁰ **Prabhūtaratna as revealer**: The eternally-present Buddha is invoked to reveal Wonderful-Sound's appearance, suggesting that Prabhūtaratna's eternal presence enables inter-dimensional revelation.

¹¹ **Nārāyaṇa reference**: The comparison to Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu) suggests that Wonderful-Sound's manifestation is so powerfully embodied that Hindu divine imagery is invoked.

¹² **Elaborate courtesy and inquiry**: The formal greeting from Pure-Lotus includes elaborate inquiries about the Buddha's health, the condition of beings, and the state of the realm. This reflects Buddhist courtesy-protocol showing respect for a Buddha's authority.

¹³ **Prabhūtaratna's approval**: The eternally-present Buddha's acknowledgment of Wonderful-Sound's accomplishment shows that cross-realm actions receive cosmic authentication.

¹⁴ **Karmic causation**: The bodhisattva's gift of musical instruments in a past Buddha-realm directly produces the capacity for manifesting in the present. Gift-causation is explicitly stated as producing specific fruits.

¹⁵ **Manifestation-principle enumerated**: The detailed list of manifestation-forms establishes that upaya (skillful means) extends to form-manifestation itself. The bodhisattva's physical appearance is itself teaching-method.

¹⁶ **Extinction as teaching**: The principle that some beings require "extinction" (nirvāṇa-entry) to be liberated suggests that even final cessation can be a form of compassionate teaching.

¹⁷ **Samādhi-naming**: The samādhi is explicitly named "Manifesting-All-Forms," suggesting that Buddhist meditation has specific purposes and produces specific results.

¹⁸ **Collective enlightenment**: The eighty-four thousand companions all obtain the samādhi through proximity to Wonderful-Sound, suggesting that enlightenment can be transmitted through association.

¹⁹ **Multiple blessing-results**: The chapter concludes by enumerating multiple positive results: eighty-four thousand obtain samādhi, forty-two thousand heavenly deities obtain dharma-eye, Dharma-Virtue obtains the dharma-blossom samādhi.

²⁰ **Interdimensional travel poetry**: The verse celebrates the journey across incalculable worlds, treating dimensional-crossing as ordinary dharma-activity.

²¹ **Manifestation-variety**: The verse emphasizes that manifestation adapts to beings' needs—Buddha-form for some, bodhisattva-form for others, cessation for still others.

²² **Poetic materiality**: The detailed description of the lotus flowers (golden stems, silver leaves, diamond pistils, ruby calyxes) emphasizes that samādhi-manifestations possess material beauty.

²³ **Vastness and perfection**: The description of the bodhisattva's form emphasizes both vast scale (42,000 yojanas) and perfect adornment (hundreds of thousands of marks).
