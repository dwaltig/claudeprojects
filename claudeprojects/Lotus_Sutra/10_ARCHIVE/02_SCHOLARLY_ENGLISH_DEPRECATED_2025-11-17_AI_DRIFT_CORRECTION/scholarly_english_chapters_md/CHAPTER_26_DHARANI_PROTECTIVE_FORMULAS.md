# Chapter 26: The Dharani of Protective Formulas
*陀羅尼品第二十六*

## Translation

### Prose Section: The Protective Commitments

At that time, the Bodhisattva Medicine King rose from his seat, bowed respectfully, and addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, if virtuous men and women receive and maintain this Dharma-Blossom Sutra, whether they read it, recite it, understand it, or write it out, how much merit would they obtain?"

The Buddha replied to Medicine King: "If a virtuous man or woman were to make offerings to eight hundred million billion nayuta Ganges-river-sand-number of Buddhas, what do you think? Would they accumulate immeasurable merit?"

Medicine King responded: "Immeasurable indeed, World-Honored One."

The Buddha declared: "If a virtuous man or woman receives and maintains this sutra—even simply receiving one four-line verse, reading it aloud, understanding its meaning, and practicing according to it—the merit accumulated would be equally immeasurable¹."

Then Medicine King Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I now offer to all dharma-teachers the protective mantra-formula (dharani), so that those who recite it will be protected and guarded."

Then Medicine King spoke the protective mantra:

*"anale manale maṇī maṇī manṭhī jaliṭe śarī śarītavai vāntī devi muktī mutali āvai savalī alalī avai arkali ala utkaniṭi sāntdevī śarali tāraṇī ālugṛbhavānavai nilavittā ālabhāvantī iṭṭchayā ālaṭalidevī nirittha niritāvahī iṭṭī kheme āloga bhavāsabhathai damarpaḷi samugamahasrahī buddhavai vibhisani nībatthī ālabhuddhapalitrī damarābaliśudade gamarābaliśudade sambhavai nilambaṭai dhamarabaliśudade"*

Medicine King declared: "World-Honored One, this mantra-formula of protection has been spoken by sixty-two billion Ganges-river-sand-number of Buddhas. Any who harm this dharma-teacher through this protection would thereby harm all those Buddhas²."

At that time, the Buddha praised Medicine King: "Excellent! Excellent, Medicine King! Through compassion for the dharma-teachers, you have spoken this protective formula. This brings immeasurable benefit to all sentient beings."

Then Courageous-Giver Bodhisattva rose from his seat and addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I too wish to offer protection to those who receive, read, recite, understand, and practice this Dharma-Blossom Sutra, by proclaiming a protective formula. If any yakṣa, rākṣasa, hungry ghost, or other malevolent being attempts to harm such a dharma-teacher, this protection will ensure they cannot succeed."

Then Courageous-Giver spoke his mantra:

*"carite mahācārite utkṭī muktṭī āletṭi ālaḍāvai niletṭi nilavedāvai iṭṭi kheme ālatī ālabodḍhiduvatei iṭṭi khemedāvai"*

Then the Heavenly King Vaiśravaṇa, guardian of the north direction, surrounded by a thousand billion celestial beings, approached the Buddha and declared: "World-Honored One, I too wish to protect those who maintain this sutra through proclaiming my protective formula."

Vaiśravaṇa spoke:

*"ali nali ālunabhe ālunacche maṭaṇgī chantaḷī jhaṭaḷī mudgarī chalaṇ sulabhe paliśudade"*

Vaiśravaṇa declared: "World-Honored One, through this protection, I shall myself guard the dharma-teachers within a hundred yojanas, ensuring they are free from all afflictions and disturbances³."

Then the Heavenly King Dhṛtarāṣṭra, guardian of the east direction, surrounded by countless celestial attendants, approached the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I also wish to protect the dharma-teachers through proclaiming my protective formula."

Dhṛtarāṣṭra spoke:

*"aganī ganī gaṇatī jhaṭaḷī kulaṇḍi sudhari chalani sulavedī ādī"*

Dhṛtarāṣṭra declared: "World-Honored One, this protection, spoken by forty-two billion Buddhas, ensures that if one seeks to harm the dharma-teacher, one thereby harms all those Buddhas⁴."

Then the ten Rakṣasī (female protective demons) approached the Buddha, together with the Yakṣa Mother and her children and retinue. The ten Rakṣasīs were named: (1) Lāmbā, (2) Vilāmbā, (3) Crooked-Tooth, (4) Flower-Tooth, (5) Black-Tooth, (6) Many-Haired, (7) Never-Satisfied, (8) Wearing-Garlands, (9) Gośṭi, and (10) One-Who-Seizes-All-Beings'-Life-Force.

These ten Rakṣasīs, together with the Yakṣa Mother, her children, and retinue, approached the Buddha and declared: "World-Honored One, we too wish to protect those who read, recite, receive, and maintain this Dharma-Blossom Sutra, relieving them of afflictions. If any seeks to harm the dharma-teacher, we shall ensure they cannot succeed."

Then the ten Rakṣasīs spoke their protection:

*"iti pīmi iti pṛman iti pṛmi neti pṛmi neti pṛmi neti pṛmi neti pṛmi lūhī lūhī lūhī lūhī tūhī tūhī tūhī tūhī duhi [unclear syllables]"*

The Rakṣasīs then declared: "Those who fail to obey our protection and harm the dharma-teacher: may their heads split into seven pieces like the branches of the Arjuna tree; may they experience the karma of those who kill their parents; may they experience the suffering of those who crush oil; may they experience the karma of those who deceive with false weights; may they experience the karma of Devadatta who split the sangha. This is the retribution for harming the dharma-teacher⁵."

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Rakṣasīs: "Excellent, excellent! If you simply protect those who maintain the sutra's name, the merit is immeasurable. How much greater is the merit when you protect those who fully receive and maintain the complete sutra, offering flowers, fragrances, garlands, powdered incenses, anointing oils, burning incenses, banners, jeweled coverings, silk tapestries, various kinds of musical instruments, and oil-lamps of every description⁶!"

### Verse Section: The Assembled Protections

*At that time, the Buddha wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

When the dharma-teachers maintain this sutra,
All the bodhisattvas offer their protection,
Medicine King proclaims his mantra,
Courageous-Giver adds his power.

The four Heavenly Kings—
Guardians of the four directions,
Vaiśravaṇa of the north,
Dhṛtarāṣṭra of the east,
And their companions—
All pledge their protection.

The ten Rakṣasīs, female protective demons,
Together with the Yakṣa Mother and her retinue,
Vow to guard all dharma-teachers,
Ensuring no harm can befall them.

Whoever harms these dharma-teachers
Will incur terrible retribution:
Their head will split into seven pieces,
They will experience the karma of parent-killers,
The suffering of oil-pressing,
The deception of false weights,
The breaking of the sangha's unity.

Thus protected by bodhisattvas and celestial beings,
The dharma-teachers dwell in safety,
Proclaiming the Dharma-Blossom Sutra
Throughout the world, without fear⁷.

### Philosophical Implications

Chapter 26 represents the sutra's integration of protective practice with doctrinal teaching. The mantras themselves—rendered in transliterated form that resists literal translation—possess power not through semantic meaning but through sonic resonance. This suggests a Buddhist understanding that language operates on multiple levels: semantic (conveying meaning), magical (activating power), and spiritual (creating consciousness-states).

The enumeration of protectors is significant. Rather than presenting a single ultimate guardian, Chapter 26 shows an entire assembly of beings committed to protection: bodhisattvas (Medicine King, Courageous-Giver), heavenly kings (the four directional guardians), female demons (the ten Rakṣasīs), the Yakṣa Mother. This suggests that protection operates through multiple channels and that cosmic beings of all types participate in dharma-defense.

The principle that harming a dharma-teacher equates to harming all Buddhas establishes the dharma-teacher as sacred. To injure the teacher is not merely a personal wrong but a cosmic crime against the entire Buddha-family. This consecrates the dharma-teacher's status.

The threats enumerated—yakṣas, demons, hungry ghosts, malevolent beings—reflect popular Buddhist cosmology where evil forces threaten practitioners. Yet the sutra's response is not to condemn these beings as permanently evil but to recruit them as protectors. The Rakṣasīs (female demons) and Yakṣa Mother represent transformation of potentially hostile powers into protective allies. This reflects a sophisticated Buddhist understanding that even demonic forces can be converted to dharma-service through proper cultivation.

The mantras' lack of literal meaning directs attention to their sonic-magical dimension. In tantric Buddhism, mantras are understood as embodying the actual presence of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. To recite the mantra is not merely to speak words but to invoke and manifest those beings. The mantra is not a request for protection but an actualization of protective presence.

### Apparatus Summary

**Context**: Chapter 26 addresses a practical concern: How does the sutra ensure the dharma-teacher's safety in a world hostile to spirituality? The answer involves celestial protection through mantric formulas.

**Central Teaching**: The dharma-teacher who maintains the Lotus Sutra receives protection from multiple celestial and divine beings through mantric formulas. To harm such a teacher is to harm all Buddhas and incur terrible karma.

**Structural Function**: Chapter 26 provides practical protective mechanisms ensuring the sutra's survival and transmission. It bridges the cosmic-revelation chapters (21-22) and the exemplar-narratives (23-25) with institutional/protective mechanisms.

**Key Doctrinal Claims**:
- "Bodhisattvas and celestial beings protect dharma-teachers through mantric formulas"—establishes cosmic support-system
- "Harming a dharma-teacher equals harming all Buddhas"—elevates teacher-protection to cosmic significance
- "Even demonic beings can be converted to dharma-defense"—demonstrates universal dharma-capacity
- "Mantric formulas embody protective presence"—establishes sonic-magical dimension of dharma

**Philosophical Connections**:
- **Mantra as presence**: Mantric formulas are understood not as requests but as actualizations
- **Dharma-teacher sacredness**: The teacher becomes a sacred presence worthy of protection
- **Cosmic alliance**: All beings, even demons, participate in dharma-protection
- **Multiple channels of power**: Protection operates through various celestial beings and powers simultaneously

**Footnotes**:

¹ **Merit from partial engagement**: The principle is repeated: even single-verse maintenance produces immeasurable merit. This emphasizes accessibility over requirement for complete practice.

² **Buddha-array authentication**: The statement that the mantra was spoken by sixty-two billion Buddhas authenticates it through cosmic consensus. All Buddhas agree on this protection's validity.

³ **Guardian commitment**: Vaiśravaṇa's commitment to guard "within a hundred yojanas" suggests that protective presence has geographical extent but remains substantial.

⁴ **Karma retribution principle**: The statement that harming a dharma-teacher produces the same karma as harming all Buddhas creates a protective mechanism through karmic consequence.

⁵ **Enumerated rebirths**: The forms of retribution (head-splitting, parent-killer karma, oil-pressing karma, false-weight karma, sangha-splitting karma) represent different kinds of suffering across multiple rebirths.

⁶ **Comprehensive offering enumeration**: The list of offerings (flowers, fragrances, garlands, powdered incenses, anointing oils, burning incenses, banners, coverings, tapestries, instruments, lamps) represents complete material support.

⁷ **Fearless proclamation**: The conclusion emphasizes that protected dharma-teachers can proclaim the sutra "without fear," suggesting that removing fear is essential to effective dharma-transmission.
