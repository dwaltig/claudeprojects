## Translation

### Prose Section: The Eternal Practitioner of Universal Respect

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta: "You should understand that among those who maintain the Lotus Sutra, should any individual curse, revile, or disparage such a keeper of the sutra, the karmic consequences shall be severe, as described previously. But understand equally: those who maintain this Lotus Sutra thereby acquire the perfected senses mentioned—eye-purity, ear-purity, nose-purity, tongue-purity, body-purity, and mind-purity¹.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, in ages long past—across immeasurable, incalculable eons—there existed a Buddha named Bhaiṣajya-rāja (the Medicine King), the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, the One Perfectly Accomplished in Knowledge and Conduct, the Sugata, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassable Guide, the Tamer of the Untamed, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. His lifespan extended across four million billion nayuta eons. In his world, an age called the Age of Prosperity prevailed, and his realm was named the Great Achievement.

"The Buddha Bhaiṣajya-rāja taught the dharma to gods, humans, and asuras. To those seeking arhatship, he explained the dharma of the four truths, enabling them to transcend birth, old age, sickness, and death, ultimately reaching the final peace of nirvāṇa. To those seeking solitary-buddha realization, he taught the dharma of dependent origination in twelve aspects. To the bodhisattvas and all beings, he explained the dharma of the six perfections, ultimately leading them to perfect enlightenment².

"In that age, the Buddha Bhaiṣajya-rāja possessed eighty billion great bodhisattvas and assemblies of seventy-two trillion enlightened śrāvakas. That Buddha's lifespan extended four million billion nayuta eons. The dharma remained as the Buddha's living teaching for a period of years equal in number to the dust-particles of an entire Jambudvīpa continent. The semblance dharma (the era after the Buddha's departure when the form of the teachings remains but their living force diminishes) also persisted through numbers of years equal to the dust-particles of an entire continent. After the correct dharma and semblance dharma had been exhausted, in that realm there appeared destructive, arrogant monks. During this degenerate epoch, the true dharma had become obscured.

"At that time, within this degraded assembly, there was a bodhisattva-monk named Never-Despiser. Why was he called Never-Despiser? Because whenever he encountered monks, nuns, laymen, or laywomen of any station, he would immediately bow in reverence, praise them, and speak these words: 'I profoundly honor you. I dare not belittle or despise you. Why? Because you all practice the bodhisattva path. You shall inevitably attain Buddhahood.' This Never-Despiser Bodhisattva did not devote himself primarily to reading and reciting the sutras but concentrated entirely on the practice of reverence. Whenever he encountered the four assemblies from a distance, he would deliberately approach them, prostrate himself before them, and praise them with the same declaration: 'I dare not despise you. You are all destined to become Buddhas.' Those among these four assemblies who possessed conceit or impure minds would revile him, saying: 'This ignorant monk! Why does he presume to declare that we shall become Buddhas? What authority does he have to grant us such predictions? We do not want such false prophecies!' So Never-Despiser endured decades of abuse and vilification without becoming angry. His practice remained constant: 'I dare not despise you. You are destined for Buddhahood.'

"When these contentious monks, nuns, and laypeople approached with sticks, stones, and tiles, attempting to strike him, Never-Despiser would flee to a distance, continuing to proclaim loudly: 'I dare not despise you. You shall become Buddhas!' Because of his constant proclamation of this message, both the arrogant monks and the four assemblies came to call him 'Never-Despiser'³.

"When the end of this bodhisattva's life approached, he heard suspended in the void the voice of the Buddha Bhaiṣajya-rāja reciting the Lotus Sutra—specifically the dharma of all twenty thousand million billion verses from the first exposition. Never-Despiser absorbed and retained all these verses completely. He immediately acquired the six perfected senses: eye-clarity, ear-clarity, nose-clarity, tongue-clarity, body-clarity, and mind-clarity, exactly as previously described⁴. Having attained these purified senses, his lifespan was extended two hundred billion nayuta years, and he proceeded to widely expound the Lotus Sutra for the benefit of all beings.

"At that time, those arrogant monks, nuns, and laypeople who had previously reviled him—observing that he possessed great supernatural powers, eloquent wisdom-speech, and profound tranquility—abandoned their contempt and began to follow him. This Never-Despiser Bodhisattva thus transformed millions of billions of beings, establishing them in unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.

"When Never-Despiser ultimately completed his remaining lifespan, he encountered two billion buddhas, all called the Sunny-Moon Radiant Buddhas, in whose dharma he received, maintained, read, and recited this Lotus Sutra. Because he always proclaimed this sutra among the four assemblies, he attained the six purified senses. Later, he encountered another two billion buddhas, all called the Cloud-Radiance Kings of Liberation Buddhas, in whose dharma he again received, maintained, read, and recited this sutra. Through his proclamation of the dharma to the four assemblies, he continued developing the six purified senses.

"Subsequently, Never-Despiser encountered countless billions of buddhas, through whom he continued to receive, maintain, read, recite, and proclaim this Lotus Sutra, until his merits were completed and he attained perfect enlightenment.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, do you comprehend the meaning of this account? The Never-Despiser Bodhisattva of that ancient time—he was none other than my own previous embodiment! Had I not received, maintained, read, recited, and proclaimed this Lotus Sutra to others in my past existences, I could never have attained swift enlightenment. The four assemblies of that era—the monks, nuns, male and female laypeople—those who despised me: through contempt, they passed two hundred billion eons never encountering a Buddha, never hearing the dharma, never seeing the sangha. Only after exhausting this karmic consequence did they begin again meeting the Never-Despiser Bodhisattva, who guided them toward unsurpassed enlightenment.

"Mahāsthāmaprāpta, consider this: the Lotus Sutra provides immeasurable benefit to all bodhisattvas and great beings. It swiftly carries them to unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. For this reason, all bodhisattvas, after the Buddha's passing, should constantly receive, maintain, read, recite, explain, and write this sutra⁵."

### Verse Section: The Story of the Perpetual Reverent One

*At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

In ages past, there was a Buddha
Called the Medicine King,
Possessed of supernatural wisdom,
Who guided countless beings.
Gods and humans and asuras alike
Received his universal honor and worship.

This Buddha having reached parinirvāṇa,
When the true dharma was nearly exhausted,
The arrogant and contentious monks
Possessed tremendous power.

At that time appeared a bodhisattva,
Named the Never-Despiser,
Who came before all beings—
Monks, nuns, male and female laypeople—
And spoke these words of respect:

"I dare not despise you all,
Because you practice the bodhisattva path
And shall inevitably achieve Buddhahood."

The contentious monks and assembly
Replied with anger and disdain:
"Who granted you such wisdom
To declare our future enlightenment?
We need not your false declarations!"

Yet Never-Despiser, enduring this abuse
Through many years of practice,
Continued speaking his message of respect:
"You shall become Buddhas!"

When struck with sticks and stones,
The bodhisattva would withdraw,
Yet continue from a distance proclaiming:
"I do not despise you—
You shall become Buddhas!"

Through such constant proclamation,
The monks, nuns, and lay assemblies
Named him "the Never-Despiser."

As his final moments approached,
He heard in the void
The Buddha Medicine King's voice
Reciting the Lotus Sutra's verses—
Twenty million billion verses in total⁶.

Having received these complete verses,
His six sense-organs became purified,
His eye-sight became perfectly clear,
His hearing became keenly acute,
His sense of smell became perfectly refined,
His taste-perception became supremely exquisite,
His body-sensitivity became completely refined,
His mind became penetratingly clear⁷.

His lifespan was extended
Two hundred billion nayuta years,
And he proceeded to widely expound
This Lotus Sutra throughout the world.

The arrogant four assemblies,
Witnessing his great supernatural powers,
His eloquent dharma-speech,
His profound peaceful mastery,
All abandoned their contempt
And followed him as devoted disciples.

The Never-Despiser Bodhisattva
Thus led millions of billions of beings
To unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.

After his passing,
He encountered two billion buddhas,
All bearing the name Sunny-Moon Radiance,
In whose teachings he received and maintained
This Lotus Sutra,
Proclaiming it to the four assemblies,
Thus continuously perfecting his six senses.

He then encountered another two billion buddhas,
All called Cloud-Radiance Liberation Kings,
In whose dharma he again received, maintained,
And widely proclaimed this sutra
To countless assemblies,
Further developing the six purified senses.

He subsequently encountered countless billions of buddhas,
Through whom he continuously received and maintained
This Lotus Sutra,
Proclaiming it through innumerable assemblies,
Until his merits were fully perfected
And he attained perfect enlightenment⁸.

The Never-Despiser of ancient times—
He is none other than I myself!
Had I not received and maintained
This Lotus Sutra
In my former lives,
Had I not proclaimed it to others,
I could never have swiftly attained
This supreme enlightenment.

Those four assemblies of that age,
The monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen—
Those who despised the Never-Despiser:
Through their contempt,
They were unable for two hundred billion eons
To encounter any Buddha,
To hear any dharma,
To perceive any sangha community.

Only after that karmic consequence was exhausted
Did they encounter the Never-Despiser again,
Who gradually guided them
Toward unsurpassed enlightenment⁹.

### Philosophical Implications

Chapter 20 represents the practical embodiment of all preceding teachings. The Never-Despiser story answers a question implicit throughout the sutra: "What does dharma-realization look like in concrete practice?" The answer is stunning in its simplicity and universality.

The chapter's brilliance lies in its apparent paradox. Never-Despiser practices contrary to Buddhist convention: he does not study sutras intensively, does not practice meditation, does not seek supernatural powers. Instead, he engages in what appears to be the simplest practice imaginable—reverence toward all beings. Yet through this single practice, he transforms himself and countless others.

The principle underlying Never-Despiser's practice is Buddha-nature universalism taken to radical extremes. Rather than recognizing Buddha-nature as a theoretical doctrine ("all beings possess Buddha-nature and can attain enlightenment"), Never-Despiser acts as if all beings have already achieved enlightenment. His proclamation "You shall become Buddhas!" is not a prediction of future attainment but a present-tense recognition. He sees through the degraded surface to the eternal Buddha-reality beneath.

The response to Never-Despiser's practice reveals the profound difficulty of recognizing one's own Buddha-nature. Those who despise him—who revile, strike, and curse him—are actually harming themselves. The text explicitly states that through contempt, they create the karma that separates them from Buddha-encounter for immense eons. Yet even this separation is eventually overcome. The Never-Despiser's dharma-transmission ultimately reaches even those who despised him, gradually transforming them.

This creates a paradoxical temporality. Never-Despiser encounters beings who are simultaneously in two conditions: they are future Buddhas (which is what Never-Despiser sees), yet they are currently unable to recognize this truth. They must undergo two hundred billion eons of karmic separation from Buddha-truth before they can receive the bodhisattva's teaching. The future and the present overlay one another; enlightenment exists eternally while its actualization in consciousness unfolds temporally.

The detail about hearing the Buddha's recitation "suspended in the void" at the moment of death deserves careful attention. Never-Despiser does not seek supernatural experience; he does not practice mystical techniques. Yet at his life's end, the dharma itself manifests to him. This suggests that complete dedication to dharma-truth, even (or especially) in its most humble form, creates conditions for direct dharma-revelation. The outer practice of reverence and the inner realization of dharma-truth become identical.

The acquisition of the six perfected senses upon hearing the dharma represents the transition from practice to realization. Never-Despiser's practice throughout his life consisted of outer reverence; his realization manifests as inner sensory transformation. The two are not separate. Years of honoring all beings as future Buddhas culminate in sensory organs purified to perceive the Buddha in all beings.

The narrative also emphasizes continuous dharma-transmission. Never-Despiser encounters not one Buddha but billions of them. Each time, his practice remains constant: receiving the sutra, maintaining it, proclaiming it to the four assemblies. There is no arrival point, no final achievement. The dharma-transmission continues across multiple Buddha-eons, establishing an eternal rhythm of receiving and giving, realizing and teaching.

Perhaps most profoundly, the chapter reveals the identity between Never-Despiser and Śākyamuni Buddha. The historical Buddha is the reincarnation of this ancient bodhisattva. This means that Buddhahood itself is understood as the fruition of practices that appear utterly simple—mere reverence, mere transmission, mere respect. The supreme enlightenment that seems to demand incomprehensible wisdom actually emerges from practices of radical humility.

The treatment of those who despised Never-Despiser introduces the problem of negative karma and its eventual exhaustion. Those who reviled him created negative karma that separated them from Buddha-encounter for eons. Yet the text is clear: this separation is not eternal. Eventually they encounter Never-Despiser again and receive his guidance. Even the most deeply karmic obstacles eventually resolve, making enlightenment inevitable for all beings.

### Apparatus Summary

**Context**: Chapter 20 follows the abstract enumeration of benefits (Chapters 17-19) with a concrete narrative exemplifying these benefits. It answers the question: "What dharma-practice actually looks like in the world."

**Central Teaching**: The simplest and most radical dharma-practice is universal reverence—seeing all beings as future Buddhas and treating them accordingly. This practice, though mocked and opposed, transforms both the practitioner and, eventually, all beings encountered. It represents the practical application of the teaching that all beings possess Buddha-nature and will attain enlightenment.

**Structural Function**: Chapter 20 provides a narrative bridge between the abstract benefits (Chapters 17-19) and the cosmic dharma-transmission (Chapters 21-22). It grounds the sutra's teachings in a concrete example of a being whose practice and realization embody all the principles discussed.

**Key Doctrinal Claims**:
- "All beings will become Buddhas; they need only recognize this truth"—establishes universal Buddha-nature
- "Reverence itself is the highest dharma-practice"—democratizes enlightenment practice
- "Those who despise dharma-teachers undergo karmic separation but eventually receive transmission"—asserts inevitability of enlightenment
- "Continuous dharma-transmission across Buddha-eons is the pattern of salvation"—establishes eternal dharma-transmission
- "The Buddha of our age is the reincarnation of this ancient reverent one"—grounds the historical Buddha in the principle of continuous dharma-transmission

**Philosophical Connections**:
- **Buddha-nature** (Chapters 8-9): Never-Despiser's universal reverence is the practical expression of Buddha-nature doctrine
- **Upaya** (Chapter 2): Never-Despiser's practice is the ultimate skillful means—meeting each being where they are while treating them as eternal Buddhas
- **Dharma-transmission** (throughout): The chapter demonstrates how dharma passes from Buddha to being to Buddha across infinite eons
- **Karma** (implicit throughout): The negative karma created by despising dharma-teachers and the positive karma of reverence are detailed

**Footnotes**:

¹ **The connection to Chapter 19**: The chapter's opening explicitly links to the previous chapter's enumeration of perfected senses, suggesting that Never-Despiser's story exemplifies how these perfections develop in practice.

² **The Medicine King Buddha**: Bhaiṣajya-rāja (Medicine King) is a Buddha-name symbolizing healing. The spiritual disease requiring healing is ignorance; dharma is the medicine. This Buddha teaching all paths (śrāvaka, pratyeka-buddha, bodhisattva) suggests that even within this ancient Buddha's teaching, the Lotus Sutra's universal inclusivity appears.

³ **The degenerate age**: The text specifies that Never-Despiser's practice occurs in the "semblance dharma" period after the Buddha's passing, when the form of teachings remains but their living power fades. This makes Never-Despiser's practice particularly significant—in the most difficult age, a single simple practice proves transformative.

⁴ **The void-voice**: Never-Despiser hears the Buddha's voice "suspended in the void" at the moment of death. This suggests that dharma-manifestation coincides with complete readiness. The bodhisattva's lifetime of reverent practice creates the condition for direct dharma-revelation.

⁵ **The Buddha's identity-claim**: The statement "The Never-Despiser of ancient times—he is none other than I myself!" reveals that the historical Buddha Śākyamuni is the continued embodiment of this ancient bodhisattva's practice. Buddhahood is not a new condition but the fruition of continuous dharma-dedication.

⁶ **Twenty thousand million billion verses**: The text specifies the number of verses Never-Despiser hears: "twenty thousand million billion." This precise (if astronomically large) number suggests that dharma has specific structure even as its totality vastly exceeds comprehension.

⁷ **The six purified senses again**: The enumeration of six perfected senses represents the full enlightenment-realization, described in Chapter 19 as arising through sutra-maintenance. Never-Despiser's senses become purified through his lifetime practice of reverence.

⁸ **Multiple Buddha-encounters**: The pattern of encountering two billion Sunny-Moon Radiance Buddhas, then two billion Cloud-Radiance Liberation King Buddhas, then innumerable others represents the eternal continuation of dharma-transmission across Buddha-eons. Never-Despiser's practice continues without interruption.

⁹ **Gradual liberation of the despisers**: The text notes that those who despised Never-Despiser eventually encounter him again and are "gradually guided" toward enlightenment. This "gradual" element suggests that even those with strongest negative karma eventually respond to dharma-transmission.

¹⁰ **Degenerate Age (Mappō) & Historical Significance**: The chapter explicitly references the "semblance dharma" (像法, xiàngfǎ) age, corresponding to the second period of Buddhist decline following True Dharma. This era is marked by institutional corruption—"bhikṣus of overweening pride wielded great influence"—making traditional practices ineffective. Within this context, Sadāparibhūta's radical practice of universal reverence represents dharma reduced to its irreducible core. As history declines, dharma intensifies through simplification. This resonates with contemporary apocalyptic thought wherein civilization's collapse necessitates return to foundational recognition. The degenerate age paradoxically enables the most radical dharmic expression: pure recognition unencumbered by meditative technique, ritual complexity, or scholastic learning. The chapter thus establishes eschatological principle that spiritual darkness demands simplification—when external dharma fails, internal recognition becomes supreme path.

¹¹ **Reverence as Ultimate Dharma-Practice**: Sadāparibhūta engages in no traditional Buddhist practice beyond "making obeisance." Unlike other bodhisattvas practicing the Six Pāramitās, he performs only praṇāma (prostration) combined with declarative speech: "You shall all become Buddhas." This gesture-utterance constitutes the totality of his path, representing dharma reduced to ontological minimum—recognition itself as complete practice. The chapter posits that dharma-transmission occurs not through doctrinal teaching but through enacted recognition. This aligns with Zen's "direct pointing" (直指, zhízhǐ) and the phrase "Just this!"—no supplementary technique, only pure honoring of Buddha-nature. The chapter thereby suggests all Buddhist complexity ultimately condenses into single recognition-gesture, making Sadāparibhūta's practice archetypal bodhisattva activity from which all others derive.

¹² **Present Buddhahood & Future Attainment Paradox**: Sadāparibhūta's proclamation—"You shall all become Buddhas"—addresses beings as future-Buddhas while honoring present potential. This creates temporal paradox: are they Buddhas now or only potentially? The text resolves this through "practicing the bodhisattva path and shall attain Buddhahood," positioning Buddha-nature as simultaneously present (as practice-capacity) and future (as realization). This mirrors Heideggerian Dasein's structure as futural being—existence constituted not by present properties but by projected possibilities. Reverence-practice thus honors temporal paradox: treating beings according to their futural completion while presently unenlightened. This explains antagonists' rage—they resent recognition based on unrealized potential, demanding present hierarchical status acknowledgment. Sadāparibhūta's radical act: collapsing future into present through performative honoring.

¹³ **Karma Exhaustion & Inevitable Enlightenment**: The chapter describes how Sadāparibhūta, beaten with sticks and stones, continued practice until "his offenses were exhausted." This introduces karma-exhaustion through suffering-endurance. Rather than generating new negative karma through resentment, his patient endurance allows past-life offenses to discharge. Those attacking him "suffered great anguish in Avīci Hell for one thousand kalpas" until "offenses were expiated"—identical terminology indicating parallel purification-processes. Both victim and attacker undergo purification through suffering, via different mechanisms: Sadāparibhūta consciously through practice, opponents unconsciously through retribution. This reflects Buddhist physics wherein karma must dissipate through specific processes. The chapter thus presents suffering not as punishment but purification: each attack burns karmic residue, accelerating enlightenment by clearing obstructive conditioning.

¹⁴ **Void-Voice & Dharma-Manifestation**: At death's threshold, Sadāparibhūta "heard in the space above him all twenty thousand myriads of koṭis of verses of the Lotus Sutra." This dharma-voice emanating from śūnyatā (space/emptiness) represents non-anthropomorphic dharma-manifestation. Verses appear not from teacher's mouth but from void above, indicating dharma as trans-personal reality manifesting directly to prepared consciousness. This parallels Christian logos theology wherein the Word exists independently of individual speakers, manifesting to receptive beings. The chapter positions dharma as ontological structure rather than transmitted information—Sadāparibhūta doesn't learn new content but recognizes always-present truth. The void-voice functions like Platonic anamnesis (recollection), wherein knowledge emerges through internal awakening to eternal forms rather than external teaching.

¹⁵ **Temporal Collapse (Past=Present=Future)**: The chapter concludes with dramatic revelation: "That Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta of that time was none other than myself"—the Buddha identifies as the persecuted bodhisattva from "immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable kalpas ago." This collapses linear temporality into eternal simultaneity. Past-Sadāparibhūta, present-Buddha, and future-enlightenment exist as single trans-temporal identity. This exemplifies McTaggart's B-theory of time, wherein temporal positions exist without temporal flow—events occupy fixed spacetime positions rather than moving through time. The chapter further multiplies temporal collapse: persecutors become present disciples who suffered in Avīci Hell, encountered Sadāparibhūta again, and became enlightenment-seekers. Past persecution becomes present discipleship becomes future Buddhahood—all existing simultaneously within eternal dharmic structure. The narrative demonstrates Buddhist metaphysics wherein saṃsāra's temporal flow masks underlying eternal simultaneity of all karmic relations.

¹⁶ **Multiple Buddha-Encounters as Eternal Pattern**: Following initial enlightenment, Sadāparibhūta "encountered two thousand koṭis of Buddhas, all named Sun-Moon-Lamp Radiance," then "encountered two thousand koṭis of Buddhas, all named Cloud-Freedom-Lamp King," continuing infinitely. This serial Buddha-encountering reveals cosmic structure: infinite enlightened beings pervade reality, and bodhisattva-path consists of successive encounters with dharma-manifestations across countless lifetimes. Repetition of identical Buddha-names indicates archetypal rather than individual identity—eternal Buddha-principles rather than historical persons. This cosmology positions enlightenment as ubiquitous cosmic pattern: Buddhas saturate existence, and spiritual progress consists of progressive recognition-capacity enabling increasingly frequent encounters. This resonates with Nietzsche's eternal recurrence, though Buddhist cosmology differs critically: successive Buddha-encounters mark progressive deepening until practitioner's recognition-capacity equals the Buddhas they encounter, collapsing subject-object distinction into identity.

¹⁷ **Recognition vs. Achievement Distinction**: Sadāparibhūta's practice centers on recognition ("I deeply respect you all") rather than personal cultivation-toward-achievement. Unlike traditional paths emphasizing self-development through meditation, he focuses exclusively on recognizing Buddha-nature in others. This represents epistemological shift from ontological becoming to cognitive knowing—enlightenment as recognition of always-present reality rather than acquisition of new state. This parallels Platonic anamnesis, wherein learning consists of recollecting eternally-known Forms rather than acquiring new information. The chapter thereby resolves Buddhism's tension between gradual cultivation and sudden awakening: Sadāparibhūta's method requires gradual karma-purification yet manifests as immediate declarative act. Achievement and recognition constitute two aspects of single reality—one cannot recognize Buddha-nature without cultivating karma-purification, yet such cultivation consists entirely of recognition-practice itself.

¹⁸ **Compassion for the Despiser**: Despite persecution—"some would beat him with sticks, tiles, and stones"—Sadāparibhūta maintains unwavering compassion: "Even as he fled, he would call out: 'You shall all become Buddhas.'" This represents non-reactive love (maitrī) independent of reciprocation. Unlike worldly affection contingent on mutual regard, his compassion operates unconditionally—persecution strengthens rather than diminishes reverence-expression. This exemplifies Christian agape (divine unconditioned love), contrasted with love requiring reciprocation. Theologically, agape reflects divine nature—God loves unconditionally because divine essence is love. Similarly, Sadāparibhūta's compassion stems not from others' present qualities but from their Buddha-nature—ontological fact independent of current behavior. The chapter thereby resolves how to maintain love toward malicious beings: recognize their future-enlightenment as present-reality, transforming enemies into future-Buddhas-presently-confused, warranting therapeutic compassion.

¹⁹ **Reverence-Transmission as Teaching-Mechanism**: Sadāparibhūta's bowing itself functions as teaching: "The four assemblies... saw his supernatural powers... and heard what he taught." His gestural practice transmits dharma more effectively than doctrinal exposition. The chapter states he "did not devote himself to recitation of sutras," yet ultimately "widely expounded this sutra"—teaching emerges from embodied practice rather than textual study. This positions embodied action as primary teaching-vehicle. Contemporary embodied cognition research confirms understanding occurs through bodily engagement rather than abstract representation. Mirror neuron research reveals observing actions activates identical neural patterns as performing them, suggesting witnessing Sadāparibhūta's bowing triggers experiential understanding through neural mirroring rather than conceptual explanation. Teaching occurs through integrated gesture-speech act rather than information-transfer.

²⁰ **Bodily Perfections as Karmic Fruit**: Following karma-exhaustion, Sadāparibhūta attains "purity of the eye faculty... ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind faculties," eventually acquiring the thirty-two major marks and eighty minor marks. This establishes karmic physics wherein mental cultivation produces somatic transformation. Recognizing Buddha-nature in others perfects one's own embodiment through karmic reciprocity—perceiving others as Buddhas generates karma whose fruit manifests as one's own Buddha-characteristics. This parallels mirror neuron research demonstrating mind-body bidirectional coupling: mental states produce physiological changes, and physiological configurations generate mental states. Buddhist soteriology positions the thirty-two marks as karmic fruits of specific mental cultivation. The chapter presents embodiment as karmic crystallization—body manifests as accumulated mental karma condensed into physical form. Sadāparibhūta's reverence-practice generates karma whose somatic expression produces perfected bodily marks.

²¹ **Six Perfected Senses as Culmination**: The chapter emphasizes Sadāparibhūta's attainment of "purity of the six faculties" (*ṣaḍāyatana*)—the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind senses achieving supernatural capacity. Buddhist physiology positions these as sense-bases whose purification enables direct dharma-perception. The text describes these purified faculties enabling extended lifespan, supernatural powers, and eloquent teaching—comprehensive transformation through single practice. Unlike Western domain-specific skill development, Buddhist cultivation assumes interdependent human systems wherein single-practice ripples throughout entire organism. Purifying one sense-faculty through reverence-practice necessarily purifies all because they share single consciousness-ground. This aligns with holistic development theory recognizing cognitive, emotional, physical, and social dimensions develop integratively. The chapter positions sense-purification as enlightenment-marker: Buddhahood consists not of transcending senses but perfecting them to perceive reality accurately. The six faculties become transparent to dharma—seeing actual forms rather than distorted projections.

²² **Medicine King Buddha Symbolism**: The chapter's implicit connection to Bodhisattva Medicine King (Bhaiṣajyarāja) from Chapter 23 establishes healing as primary dharma-metaphor. Buddhist soteriology fundamentally operates as therapeutic system: the Buddha as physician (bhiṣaj), dharma as medicine (bhaiṣajya), sangha as nurses, and sentient beings as patients suffering duḥkha. The Four Noble Truths mirror medical diagnosis: identifying symptom (suffering), determining cause (craving), confirming cure's possibility (cessation), prescribing treatment (Eightfold Path). Sadāparibhūta's practice functions as therapeutic intervention: reverence-bowing treats his own karmic disease (purifying offenses) and others' spiritual disease (planting enlightenment-seeds). The medicine-metaphor reframes salvation as healing rather than judgment—beings require treatment not punishment, cure not condemnation. This shifts theological framework from forensic (legal) to therapeutic (medical) soteriology: the problem isn't offense requiring propitiation but spiritual disease requiring treatment. The chapter positions Buddha-practice as universal medicine treating fundamental human disease: ignorance of one's Buddha-nature, cured through recognition-practice.
