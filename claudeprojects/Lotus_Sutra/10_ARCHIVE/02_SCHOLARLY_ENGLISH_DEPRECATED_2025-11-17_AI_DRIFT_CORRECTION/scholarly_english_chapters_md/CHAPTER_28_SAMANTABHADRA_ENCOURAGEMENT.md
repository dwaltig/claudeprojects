# Chapter 28: The Encouragement of the Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva
*普賢菩薩勸發品第二十八*

## Translation

### Prose Section: The Final Exhortation

At that time, the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra (the Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva) approached the Buddha with his innumerable, boundless, incalculable bodhisattva-retinue from the east, manifesting his transcendent power and magnificence, renowned throughout the ten directions. Wherever he passed, the ground trembled with six kinds of motion, precious lotus flowers rained down, and hundreds of millions of kinds of celestial music played spontaneously.

Samantabhadra arrived at Vulture Peak Mountain, bowed with his head to the feet of Śākyamuni Buddha, circumambulated him seven times, and addressed him: "World-Honored One, in my realm called Precious-Glory, I heard, from far away, that this Sahā world-realm teaches the Dharma-Blossom Sutra. Together with innumerable bodhisattvas, I have journeyed here to listen. I earnestly request that you teach this dharma. If there are virtuous men or women who will receive, maintain, read, recite, remember, learn, and practice this Dharma-Blossom Sutra after the Tathāgata's passage, how will they accomplish this? How will they protect themselves¹?"

The Buddha replied to Samantabhadra: "If virtuous men and women are to receive this dharma after the Tathāgata's passing, they must accomplish four conditions. First, they must be protected by all the Buddhas. Second, they must plant the roots of virtue. Third, they must enter the assembly of the determined. Fourth, they must awaken the mind to rescue all sentient beings. Those virtuous men and women who accomplish these four conditions will definitely obtain this Dharma-Blossom Sutra after the Tathāgata's passage².

### Prose Section: Samantabhadra's Vow

"Samantabhadra, in the degenerate age five hundred years after the Tathāgata's passage, among those who maintain this sutra, I shall guard and protect them, relieving them of all afflictions. I will ensure that no spirits, demons, demon-children, demon-women, demon-followers, demon-possessed individuals, yakṣas, rākṣasas, kumbhāṇḍas, piśācas, yakṣa-spirits, rich-demons, vetālas, and other harmful beings find any opportunity to molest them. Whether the person walks, stands, reads, recites, or contemplates this sutra, I shall ride my six-tusked white elephant, together with my great bodhisattva-assembly, travel to their location, appear before them, and supply them with all forms of comfort and safety, additionally supporting their dharma-practice³.

"When one sits in contemplation of this sutra, and one forgets or loses even a single phrase or verse, I shall appear on the white elephant, ride down, and personally teach you, helping you restore what was forgotten and recover full fluency⁴.

"When practitioners of the Dharma-Blossom Sutra practice intensely for three seven-day cycles—meaning twenty-one days of single-minded dedication—they should perceive my form. I shall then ride my white elephant, together with countless bodhisattvas, surround them, manifest myself in whatever form the practitioner needs to see, teach the dharma, supply whatever support is required, and grant protective formulas⁵.

"In the degenerate age of five hundred years, if monks, nuns, male lay followers, or female lay followers desire to maintain this sutra and practice its dharma through continuous effort, I shall personally protect them with the power of all the other bodhisattvas. Not a single non-human being will be able to cause harm, nor will any woman suffer confusion or seduction through unwanted attractions. I shall provide a protective mantra-formula:

*atandī tandavī tandotandavī tandavallī tandavalline tandavallinīte tandavallati tandavalli tandavallote tandavallaggati tandavala tandavale tandavalle tandavallantu tandavallampūraṇe tandavallasūdye tandavallotpāda tandavallasandhi tandavallosandhyate tandavallantye tandavalladhi tandavallasthi tandavalloti tandavallote*

"The benefits of this dharani are such that whoever hears it shall escape demon-influence, avoid seduction by unwanted attractions, and be protected with unbreakable security⁶.

"World-Honored One, in ages past when there were Buddhas, I practiced this dharma in their presence. When this era's Buddha has passed and the final five hundred years of degeneration arrive, if there are earnest practitioners who practice this sutra, I shall manifest my presence before them on a white elephant, maintain and protect them throughout all time, ensuring their practice proceeds without interruption⁷."

### Prose Section: The Fruit of Practice

The Buddha then addressed Samantabhadra: "Excellent! Excellent! You possess such incomparable miraculous power and compassionate vow that all practitioners of this sutra will attain liberation. Your virtue is profound, your compassion vast, and your original intention of enlightenment is deep and ancient. You accomplish these protective vows for the benefit of countless beings⁸."

The Buddha then spoke to Samantabhadra: "Those who receive, maintain, read, and recite this Dharma-Blossom Sutra in the future—know that such persons are already perceiving me, already receiving teachings directly from my mouth, already making offerings to me. Know that these persons are already making reverent offerings to the Buddha, already honoring the stupa of the eternally-present Buddha, already dwelling with great bodhisattvas, already approaching the bodhi-seat, already turning the dharma-wheel, already striking the dharma-drum, already blowing the dharma-conch, already raining down the dharma-rain⁹.

"Such practitioners need not construct stupas or establish monastic dwellings and support the sangha. Why? Because such persons are already constructing the greatest stupas, establishing the greatest monastic dwellings, supporting the greatest sangha. Those who write this sutra achieve such merits as this¹⁰.

"If such a person writes out this sutra, after their lifetime is complete, they shall be born in the Tuṣita heaven where Maitreya Bodhisattva dwells, surrounded by eighty-four thousand divine maidens, experiencing every pleasure. But how much greater are the merits of those who receive and maintain, read and recite, understand and practice this sutra¹¹?

"If there are people who receive, read, recite, understand and practice this sutra, in their next lifetime they shall be reborn in the Tuṣita heaven before Maitreya Bodhisattva, who will grasp their hand with compassion. When Maitreya Bodhisattva becomes the Buddha and presides in the three assemblies of transformation, such practitioners shall be among the assembly and shall achieve unsurpassed perfect enlightenment¹².

"Samantabhadra, if those who receive, maintain, and practice this sutra encounter those who ridicule them and say, 'You are a fool! You will gain nothing by this practice!'—such practitioners should cultivate these thoughts: 'The Buddha has explained this sutra as the foremost among all teachings. Those who practice it are assured of enlightenment. Even if people criticize me, I will continue without doubt.' Through such resolve, the practitioner accomplishes the practice of the Bodhisattva Way¹³.

"Samantabhadra, know this: if one sees a practitioner of this sutra, one should rise up to greet them just as one would greet the Buddha himself. If one places flowers, fragrances, garlands, musical instruments, silk banners, burning incenses, oil-lamps, and all other precious offerings before such practitioners, considering them equivalent to the Buddha, one will acquire immeasurable merits¹⁴.

"Samantabhadra, in the ages after the Tathāgata's passing, if one encounters a practitioner of this sutra and hears them speak even a single verse of this dharma, one should understand: this person has not long before entering the bodhi-seat, defeating all demonic forces, turning the dharma-wheel, striking the dharma-drum, blowing the dharma-conch, raining the dharma-rain, seated upon a lion-throne in the midst of the celestial and human assembly¹⁵."

### Prose Section: The Final Benediction

"Samantabhadra, if one encounters someone lightly reviling a practitioner, commenting on their faults (whether true or false), this person shall in the present lifetime develop pale-white leprosy. If one encounters such a practitioner and fails to honor them, or criticizes them, or shows contempt, one shall experience these consequences: eyelessness, blindness, deafness, severe stammering, cleft lip, a malformed face, a shortened form, offensive odor, tumorous growths, putrid sores, water-swollen belly, shortness of breath, and numerous serious illnesses¹⁶.

"Therefore, Samantabhadra, you should recognize that all those who receive, read, recite, understand, and practice this Dharma-Blossom Sutra are themselves performing the practices of the Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva. Such practitioners will not cling to material pleasures, will not seek external doctrines, will not cultivate frivolous associations, will not pursue false attachments, will not be tormented by greed, anger, or delusion, nor by jealousy, pride, arrogance, or superiority. Such practitioners will develop few desires, knowing contentment, able to practice the Universally-Worthy Way¹⁷."

The Buddha then spoke to Samantabhadra: "I shall also guard and protect, through supernatural power, all those who invoke the name of the Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva¹⁸."

### Verse Section: The Final Vision

*At that time, the Tathāgata wished to restate this meaning through verse:*

The Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva,
Pure-hearted and compassionate,
Has arrived from his distant realm,
Leading countless bodhisattvas in his retinue.

To protect those who maintain this sutra,
He rides upon a white elephant with six tusks,
With his assembly of great bodhisattvas,
Traveling to support the practitioners.

When a sutra-practitioner walks or stands,
When they read, recite, or contemplate,
Samantabhadra appears before them,
Offering comfort and protection always¹⁹.

If one writes this supreme dharma-teaching,
After completing their lifetime,
They shall be reborn in Tuṣita heaven,
In the presence of Maitreya Bodhisattva,
Surrounded by celestial maidens dancing,
Experiencing all heavenly delights.

When Maitreya descends and becomes Buddha,
And gathers the three assemblies,
Such practitioners shall be present,
Achieving supreme enlightenment together²⁰.

Those who maintain and practice this sutra,
Should be honored as buddhas themselves,
Receiving offerings of flowers and incense,
Revered in the midst of all assemblies.

Those who criticize such practitioners,
Shall suffer terrible consequences:
Paleness, blindness, deafness,
Severe deformity and disease²¹.

But those who honor the practitioners,
And make offerings and reverential bows,
Shall attain boundless merits,
Dwelling in the eternal dharma-way.

Samantabhadra's protective vow,
Extends across all future ages,
Ensuring that none can harm,
Those devoted to this supreme teaching²².

All those who practice with sincere heart,
Will gradually progress toward enlightenment,
Will not long delay before becoming Buddhas,
Achieving the wisdom of all-knowing Buddha-nature.

The Dharma-Blossom Sutra is supreme,
The sovereign of all teachings,
Those who practice it shall attain,
The highest wisdom, the Buddha's enlightenment²³.

### Philosophical Implications

Chapter 28, the sutra's conclusion, represents a final recapitulation of all key themes while projecting the teaching into the future. Samantabhadra (Universally-Worthy), the bodhisattva of perfect practice, arrives not to introduce new doctrine but to ensure the sutra's preservation and the practitioners' protection.

The enumeration of four conditions for post-Buddha-era practitioners (Buddha-protection, virtue-planting, entry into determined assembly, awakening of rescuing-mind) summarizes the entire sutra's teaching. Protection by all Buddhas represents cosmic support; virtue-planting represents individual practice; determined-assembly-entry represents committed community; rescuing-mind represents universal compassion—together these represent complete dharma-engagement.

The figure of Samantabhadra on a white elephant embodies the principle that enlightened protection is both transcendent (manifestation on supernatural mount) and immanent (appearing before practitioners, teaching forgotten passages, offering comfort). The white elephant represents both dignity and accessibility—powerful yet gentle.

The contrast between writer-rebirth in Tuṣita and practitioner-ultimate-attainment suggests a hierarchy: writing the text produces merit sufficient for heavenly rebirth, but actual practice of the teaching produces ultimate enlightenment. This establishes practice as more valuable than mere documentation.

The karmic consequences enumerated for those who criticize practitioners (leprosy, blindness, deafness, deformity, disease) operate according to a "natural law" principle. The consequences are not punishments inflicted by gods but natural results of disrespecting dharma. To reject the sutra-practitioner is to place oneself outside dharma's field of protection.

The phrase "already perceiving me, already receiving teachings directly from my mouth" collapses the distinction between historical Buddha and eternal Buddha. Those who practice the sutra are understood as directly encountering the Tathāgata across time. The text transcends temporal limitation, making present practice equivalent to historical presence.

The final emphasis on the sutra as "sovereign of all teachings" and the vision of practitioners achieving enlightenment through practice represents the sutra's ultimate claim: this text is not merely one teaching among many but the supreme dharma that all other teachings point toward and serve.

### Apparatus Summary

**Context**: Chapter 28 concludes the entire Lotus Sutra, providing final protection-vows, karmic consequences for disrespect, and ultimate encouragement to practitioners across all future ages.

**Central Teaching**: The Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva vows eternal protection of Dharma-Blossom practitioners, ensuring their liberation and ultimate enlightenment through both supernatural aid and karmic consequences for those who reject the dharma.

**Structural Function**: Chapter 28 serves as the sutra's conclusion, synthesizing all preceding teachings while projecting the sutra's influence into all future ages. It transforms the historical Buddha-teaching into eternal dharma-transmission.

**Key Doctrinal Claims**:
- "Four conditions enable dharma-reception in degenerate ages"—establishes criteria for future practice
- "Samantabhadra's protection ensures practitioner-security eternally"—establishes cosmic support-system permanence
- "Criticism of practitioners produces karmic disease; honor produces immeasurable merit"—establishes natural law of consequences
- "Sutra-practitioners are Buddha-equivalent in present time"—elevates practice to ultimate status

**Philosophical Connections**:
- **Eternal dharma-transmission**: The sutra's teaching extends to all future ages through Samantabhadra's vow
- **Practice-completion principle**: Actual practice of the sutra-teaching produces enlightenment, transcending historical limitation
- **Karma as natural law**: Consequences follow from action through natural law, not divine judgment
- **Teacher-as-Buddha**: Sutra-practitioners become Buddha-equivalent presences worthy of ultimate reverence

**Footnotes**:

¹ **Samantabhadra's arrival**: The Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva arrives from the east, associated with beginnings and dawnings, suggesting that his appearance marks the future-oriented dimension of the teaching.

² **Four conditions for future practitioners**: These four conditions synthesize the entire sutra: Buddha-protection (cosmic support), virtue-planting (individual practice), determined-assembly-entry (community belonging), rescuing-mind (universal compassion).

³ **Protective presence details**: Samantabhadra's protection is specified as both active (appearing before practitioners) and preventive (keeping harmful beings away), suggesting comprehensive care.

⁴ **Memory-recovery**: The specific mention that Samantabhadra will teach forgotten passages suggests that the sutra's power includes restoration of lost understanding, indicating the dharma itself works to preserve knowledge.

⁵ **Twenty-one-day practice period**: The specification of twenty-one days for perception suggests that intensive practice produces direct experience. The number twenty-one (three weeks) represents a complete contemplative cycle.

⁶ **Protective mantra**: The mantra's complex syllables resist translation, suggesting power through sonic resonance rather than semantic meaning. The mantra embodies protective presence itself.

⁷ **Eternal vow**: Samantabhadra's declaration that he has maintained this dharma in past Buddha-epochs and will continue eternally establishes a trans-historical pattern of bodhisattva-protection.

⁸ **Buddha's affirmation**: The Buddha's praise of Samantabhadra emphasizes the bodhisattva's "profound virtue," "vast compassion," and "deep ancient intention," suggesting that such protection comes from advanced spiritual realization.

⁹ **Present-tense Buddha-encounter**: The repeated phrase "already" (used in present tense for future practitioners) collapses temporal distinction. Those practicing the sutra "already" encounter the Buddha, suggesting that practice transcends time.

¹⁰ **Stupa-equivalence**: The teaching that practitioners "already construct the greatest stupas" by practicing the sutra (not through physical construction) represents the sutra's principle that dharma-maintenance is equivalent to the greatest physical honor.

¹¹ **Writer-practitioner hierarchy**: Writing produces merit; practicing produces enlightenment. This establishes a hierarchy where actual engagement exceeds documentary creation.

¹² **Maitreya connection**: The mention that practitioners will be with Maitreya when he becomes Buddha connects the current Lotus-era teaching to the future Buddha-age, suggesting continuity of dharma across temporal dispensations.

¹³ **Bodhisattva-practice definition**: The description of developing resolve despite criticism as "practicing the Bodhisattva Way" identifies unwavering commitment as the core of bodhisattva-practice.

¹⁴ **Practitioner-as-Buddha recognition**: The instruction to greet practitioners "just as one would greet the Buddha" elevates the practitioner to Buddha-status. This represents the sutra's radical egalitarianism.

¹⁵ **Imminent enlightenment**: The statement that practitioners "have not long before entering the bodhi-seat" suggests that sutra-practice produces swift enlightenment attainment.

¹⁶ **Disease consequences**: The enumeration of karmic diseases (leprosy, blindness, deafness, stuttering, cleft-lip, deformity, odor, tumors, sores, bloating, shortness of breath, serious illness) represents comprehensive bodily consequences for dharma-rejection.

¹⁷ **Universally-Worthy practice definition**: The description of practitioners as "performing the practices of the Universally-Worthy Bodhisattva" and their freedom from attachment, false doctrines, and the three poisons identifies the sutra's practitioners as themselves advanced bodhisattvas.

¹⁸ **Final Buddha-protection**: The Buddha's final statement that he protects all who invoke Samantabhadra's name extends protection to all beings who turn toward the dharma.

¹⁹ **Constant protection metaphor**: Samantabhadra's riding white elephant and constant appearance establishes protection as permanent and ever-accessible, never absent or limited.

²⁰ **Future enlightenment guarantee**: The assurance that practitioners with Maitreya will "achieve supreme enlightenment together" promises liberation within foreseeable future, making enlightenment temporally concrete.

²¹ **Consequences as natural law**: The karmic consequences presented as inevitable natural results (not punishments) suggest that rejecting dharma automatically excludes one from dharma's protective field.

²² **Eternal vow-keeping**: The statement that Samantabhadra's vow "extends across all future ages" ensures protection transcends temporal limitation, making the sutra eternally effective.

²³ **Supremacy reaffirmed**: The final verses reaffirm the Dharma-Blossom Sutra's status as "supreme" and "sovereign," completing the sutra's central claim that this text represents ultimate dharma.
