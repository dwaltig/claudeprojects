### Prose Section: The Transformation of a Skeptical Ruler

At that time, the Buddha addressed the assembled great audience: "In ages long past—spanning incalculable eons beyond measurement—there existed a Buddha named Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Celestial-Wisdom, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Awakened One, the One Perfectly Accomplished in Knowledge and Conduct, the Sugata, the Knower of the World, the Unsurpassable Guide, the Tamer of the Untamed, the Teacher of Gods and Humans, the Buddha, the World-Honored One. His realm was named Radiance-Flourishing, and the age was called Joyful-Perception¹.

"In that realm, there was a king named Wonderful-Adornment. His queen was named Pure-Virtue. The king had two sons: one was named Pure-Treasury, the other Pure-Vision. Both sons possessed great supernatural powers, deep karmic-roots, long-cultivated merit, and profound wisdom. They had perfected the six perfections (generosity, discipline, patience, effort, meditation, wisdom), bodhisattva-methods of skillful means, and compassion-love. They had also mastered countless samādhis and absorbed the thirty-seven aids-to-enlightenment².

"At that time, Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Celestial-Wisdom wished to transform the Wonderful-Adornment King and to liberate all beings in his realm, so he expounded the Dharma-Blossom Sutra. The two princes approached their mother and said: 'Dear Mother, we wish to go to the Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Celestial-Wisdom to pay reverence, draw near, make offerings, and receive the teachings. We earnestly desire to hear the Dharma-Blossom Sutra³.'

"Their mother replied: 'Your father, the king, is deeply attached to the teachings of external religions and cannot easily accept the dharma. You must first convince your father to go with us.'

"The two princes responded respectfully: 'Mother, we understand that our father has incorrect views. We shall show him miracles so that his heart becomes pure and clear. Then he will listen to us and agree to go to the Buddha.'

"Thereupon, the two pure sons, desiring to transform their father, soared into the void. They rose seven palm-trees high and demonstrated miraculous powers. Standing in the air, they walked, stood, sat, and reclined. From their upper bodies, they manifested fire; from their lower bodies, they manifested water. From their lower bodies, they manifested fire; from their upper bodies, they manifested water. They caused their bodies to appear large, filling the sky, then small again. They appeared and disappeared in the void, demonstrating miraculous transformations that enabled the king's heart to become pure and faithful⁴.

"When the king witnessed such supernatural powers, he experienced great joy and, speaking to his sons, said: 'Who is your teacher? To whom do you offer reverence?'

"The two sons replied: 'Great King, the Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Celestial-Wisdom dwells beneath the seven-jeweled Bodhi tree, seated on a dharma-throne, teaching the Dharma-Blossom Sutra to all the gods and humans. We are his disciples⁵.'

"The king then addressed his sons: 'I too wish to see your teacher. Shall we go together?'

"At that moment, the two sons descended from the void and approached their mother, saying: 'Dear Mother, Father's mind is now pure and ready for enlightenment. We have accomplished our bodhisattva-work for him. We now request permission to leave the household and renounce worldly life to practice under that Buddha'⁶.

"The two sons then spoke this verse to their mother:

*'We ask your blessing, beloved mother,*
*To leave this world and become monks,*
*For Buddhas are so rarely encountered,*
*Like the lotus flower that blooms once in eons.*

*To find one's way to a Buddha,*
*Is harder than finding a one-eyed turtle,*
*Floating in a vast ocean,*
*Encountering a wooden yoke with a single hole.*

*Our karmic roots are deep and mature,*
*We have been born in this Buddha's age,*
*This is why, dear parents,*
*We ask permission to renounce⁷.'*

"The mother replied: 'Go forth, my sons. The Buddha is so rarely encountered that your desire to leave the household is indeed justified.'

"Thereupon, the two sons addressed their parents: 'Dear Father and Mother, we earnestly invite you to go to the Buddha's presence with us, to make offerings and receive teachings. The Buddha is so rare to encounter—like the lotus that blooms once in countless eons. Meeting a Buddha is rarer still, like a one-eyed turtle encountering a wooden yoke with a single hole floating in the vast ocean. Our karmic roots are deep, and we have been born in the Buddha's age. Therefore, you must permit us to leave the household and practice⁸.'

"At that time, the Wonderful-Adornment King, together with his officials and retinue, the Pure-Virtue Queen with all her attendants, and the two sons with their four thousand two hundred followers, all journeyed together to the Buddha's presence. Upon arrival, they bowed with their heads to the Buddha's feet, circumambulated him three times, and stood reverently to the side.

"The Buddha then expounded the dharma to the Wonderful-Adornment King, revealing its significance and teaching its benefits. The king received great joy from this teaching. At that moment, the King and Queen removed from their necks pearl and jeweled ornaments worth hundreds of thousands and scattered them before the Buddha as offerings. In the void, these scattered jewels were transformed into four jeweled platforms, each bearing a jeweled throne as wide as a hand's span. Upon each throne sat a Buddha, shining with radiant light⁹.

"The Wonderful-Adornment King then perceived the miraculous transformation and reflected: 'The Buddha's body is rare and extraordinary, possessing supreme beauty and perfection, adorned with the marks of a supreme being¹⁰.'

"At that time, Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound-Celestial-Wisdom addressed the assembly: 'Do you see the Wonderful-Adornment King standing here in reverence? This king will become a monk and diligently cultivate the dharma, assisting the Buddha's way. This king will become a Buddha named Wonderful-Adornment-Tree-King (Śāla-rāja Buddha). His realm will be named Great-Light, and the age will be called Great-Exalted-Kings. The Buddha Wonderful-Adornment-Tree-King will have innumerable bodhisattvas and incalculable śrāvakas. His realm will be perfectly even, adorned with extraordinary merits¹¹.'

"Immediately upon hearing this prophecy, the Wonderful-Adornment King, relinquishing his kingdom to his younger brother, together with his queen, two sons, and all retinue, entered the monastic order.

"The king diligently practiced for eighty-four thousand years, eventually achieving the samādhi of Complete Purification and Merit-Adornment. Rising into the void to a height of seven palm-trees, he addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, these two sons of mine have already accomplished bodhisattva-work for me through their miraculous powers and transformations. They converted my incorrect views, enabling me to dwell purely in the Buddha-dharma and to see you, the World-Honored One. These two sons are my virtuous teachers. They were born in my family to awaken my original karmic-roots from past eons, and to benefit me greatly, showing me the path to awakening¹².

'All who wish to attain enlightenment should know: virtuous teachers (kalyāṇa-mitras) are the great cause and circumstance for transformation. Through virtuous teachers' guidance, liberation is accomplished. Virtuous teachers teach us the dharma, show us benefits, bring us joy, and establish us in unsurpassed enlightenment¹³. Great King, you have seen these two sons. They have served as transformative virtuous teachers to you, converting you and all your retinue toward enlightenment. They cultivated this dharma-teaching in past Buddha-realms¹⁴.'

"The king then descended from the void, bowed respectfully, and addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, the Tathāgata is exceedingly rare! The Tathāgata's dharma is complete and unsurpassable, perfected through wisdom and virtue. Your body radiates with divine marks of perfection. Your eyes are vast and beautiful, azure-blue in color. Your eyebrow-marks gleam white as the moon. Your teeth are bright and perfectly aligned, always emitting light. Your lips are beautifully colored, resembling ripe pomegranate fruit.'

"Having offered such praise, the Wonderful-Adornment King addressed the Buddha once more: 'World-Honored One, the dharma is most extraordinary! I have never encountered teachings so wondrous and complete. From this day forward, I shall no longer follow my heart's incorrect inclinations, nor shall I harbor arrogance, anger, or malice. I shall purely dwell in the Buddha-dharma, forever forsaking all false views¹⁵.'

"With these words, the king bowed reverentially and departed."

### Narrative Conclusion

"The Buddha then addressed the assembly: 'Do you comprehend this account? The Wonderful-Adornment King of that ancient time was none other than the Bodhisattva Dharma-Excellence (華德菩薩) who sits before you now. That Pure-Virtue Queen was the Bodhisattva Light-Illumination-Excellence-Adornment, who was reborn in that realm through compassion for the Wonderful-Adornment King and his retinue. Those two sons, Pure-Treasury and Pure-Vision, are the bodhisattvas Medicine King and Medicine-Excellence (藥上菩薩). These two great bodhisattvas, through their accumulated spiritual practice and extraordinary virtues, have perfected such profound capacities. They have already made offerings to innumerable Buddhas, cultivated roots of virtue in countless realms, and accomplished inconceivable virtuous deeds. If any being simply knows these two bodhisattvas' names, the entire celestial and human assembly should offer them reverence¹⁶.'

"The Buddha concluded: 'Understand this: the Dharma-Blossom Sutra provides inconceivable benefit to all bodhisattva-practitioners. It swiftly brings them to unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. Therefore, all bodhisattva-practitioners should, after the Tathāgata's passing, constantly receive, maintain, read, recite, explain, and write out this sutra¹⁷.'

"When the Buddha expounded this Wonderful-Adornment King chapter, eighty-four thousand beings immediately abandoned dusty defilements and attained the pure dharma-eye. Transcending the realm of discrimination, they obtained pure dharma-vision regarding all phenomena."

### Philosophical Implications

Chapter 27 exemplifies the principle that bodhisattva-transformation operates through compassionate adaptation to each being's condition. The two sons do not preach directly to their father; instead, they perceive his psychological nature and respond with precisely the method most effective for him: miraculous demonstration.

The narrative reveals a sophisticated understanding of teaching methodology. The father, attached to external religions, cannot be convinced by argument. Rather, perception of miraculous power—manifestation of opposite elements (fire and water simultaneously), expansion and contraction of form, disappearance and reappearance—shocks the mind into recognition that reality transcends ordinary comprehension. This recognition becomes the opening through which faith enters.

The identification of ancient figures with present bodhisattvas (Wonderful-Adornment King as Dharma-Excellence, Pure-Virtue Queen as Light-Illumination-Excellence-Adornment, Pure-Treasury as Medicine King, Pure-Vision as Medicine-Excellence) collapses temporal boundaries. The past bodhisattva and the present bodhisattva are identical. This suggests that the bodhisattva-lineage represents eternal recurrence of the same individuals manifesting across infinite Buddha-epochs in service to liberation.

The emphasis on "virtuous teachers" (kalyāṇa-mitras) as "great cause and circumstance" elevates the teacher's role to primacy. According to this text, enlightenment does not arise from one's own effort but from encounter with virtuous teachers who transform one's understanding. The teacher is not merely conveyorof information but agent of fundamental consciousness-transformation.

The father's transformation from skeptical king to dharma-practitioner represents the sutra's promise: no being is too deeply attached to external views to be transformed. The teaching that all beings can attain enlightenment is demonstrated through this narrative where a king attached to false religion becomes not merely a believer but an aspirant for Buddhahood.

### Apparatus Summary

**Context**: Chapter 27 returns to narrative exemplification after the protective formulas of Chapter 26. It demonstrates how bodhisattvas teach those trapped in false doctrines.

**Central Teaching**: Bodhisattvas serve as transformative teachers (virtuous teachers/kalyāṇa-mitras) who convert beings from false views through compassionate adaptation to each being's nature and capacity.

**Structural Function**: Chapter 27 provides a narrative model for how dharma-transmission occurs in hostile conditions (when the target is attached to false teachings). It establishes that no being is unreachable.

**Key Doctrinal Claims**:
- "Virtuous teachers are the great cause of enlightenment"—elevates teacher-role to primary cause
- "Bodhisattvas manifest as transformative teachers in family relationships"—locates bodhisattva-function in intimate relations
- "Miraculous demonstration converts intellectual attachment to false views"—establishes non-rational transformation
- "Ancient bodhisattva is identical with present bodhisattva"—demonstrates eternal dharma-transmission pattern

**Philosophical Connections**:
- **Teaching methodology**: Demonstrates that compassionate adaptation is prerequisite for effective teaching
- **Consciousness transformation**: Miraculous demonstration functions as method for consciousness-shock
- **Karma and dharma-encounter**: The past relationship (teacher-student) determines present encounter
- **Family as dharmic field**: Intimate relationships become primary locus of bodhisattva-activity

**Footnotes**:

¹ **Ancient Buddha-realm setting**: The narrative's placement in inconceivably distant past establishes that bodhisattva-transformation is eternal pattern, not historical exception.

² **Enumerated perfections and practices**: The listing of perfections, skillful means, compassion, samādhis, and aids-to-enlightenment establishes comprehensive spiritual cultivation.

³ **Mother as dharmic barrier**: The fact that the father's false views are presented as obstacle requiring the sons' intervention suggests that one cannot simply argue someone out of false attachment.

⁴ **Miraculous display methodology**: The specific miracles (opposite-element manifestation, size-transformation, spatial manifestations) are designed to demonstrate that reality operates according to principles beyond ordinary comprehension.

⁵ **Direct lineage identification**: The sons immediately identify Cloud-Thunder-Sound as their teacher and themselves as his disciples, suggesting spiritual lineage as identity-anchor.

⁶ **Household-renunciation as aspiration**: The sons' desire to leave household life for monastic practice represents the ultimate commitment to dharma-transmission.

⁷ **Lotus and one-eyed turtle comparisons**: The metaphors emphasize Buddha-encounter rarity, suggesting that finding a Buddha is the universe's supreme good fortune.

⁸ **Parental blessing**: The mother's granting of permission for household-renunciation, following her husband's conversion, demonstrates complete family transformation.

⁹ **Jewel-to-Buddha transformation**: The scattered jewels transforming into four jeweled platforms bearing Buddhas suggests that material offerings transform into sacred manifestations.

¹⁰ **Buddha-form perception**: The king's perception of the Buddha's "rare and extraordinary" form suggests that direct perception of enlightened embodiment itself transforms consciousness.

¹¹ **Prophecy parameters**: The Buddha's prophecy specifies not only the king's future Buddhahood but the characteristics of his realm and age, suggesting that enlightenment includes capacity to create perfect worlds.

¹² **Teacher-role recognition**: The king's acknowledgment that his sons are "virtuous teachers" who awakened his karmic-roots reflects deep understanding of bodhisattva-function.

¹³ **Virtuous-teacher definition**: The text explicitly states that virtuous teachers "teach dharma, show benefits, bring joy, establish in enlightenment," providing functional definition.

¹⁴ **Karmic-continuity principle**: The statement that the sons "cultivated this dharma-teaching in past Buddha-realms" suggests that present relationships reflect eternal patterns established eons ago.

¹⁵ **Vow against false views**: The king's declaration renouncing "incorrect inclinations, arrogance, anger, malice" and commitment to "pure dwelling in Buddha-dharma" represents complete consciousness-transformation.

¹⁶ **Identity collapse across time**: The revelation that present bodhisattvas are ancient figures collapses past and present into simultaneous reality.

¹⁷ **Teacher and student dual identification**: Both Dharma-Excellence (the king) and the bodhisattvas (his sons) are identified with present figures, suggesting that teacher and student both continue eternal bodhisattva-roles.
