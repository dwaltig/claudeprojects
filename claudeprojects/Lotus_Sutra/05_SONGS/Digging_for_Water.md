## THE SONG

### Verse 1
I'm up on that high plateau, shovel in my hand,
Thirsty as a lost soul, digging through dry land.
First thing that I hit is dusty, dusty ground—
But I know there's water down there, I know it can be found.

### Chorus
Keep on digging, brother, keep on digging deep,
The water's down below you even when you can't see.
Dry soil, wet soil, then the mud gonna come,
Keep on digging, sister, you ain't far from home.

### Verse 2
Some folks, they start digging, then they walk away,
Say the ground's too hard, say they'll try another day.
But I been at this shovel since the morning sun,
And I ain't gonna quit now till this well is done.

### Chorus
Keep on digging, brother, keep on digging deep,
The water's down below you even when you can't see.
Dry soil, wet soil, then the mud gonna come,
Keep on digging, sister, you ain't far from home.

### Verse 3
Now my shovel's hitting something—dirt ain't dry no more,
Feel that dampness rising, wasn't there before.
That's when my heart settled, that's when I knew for sure:
Water's getting closer, don't stop now, endure.

### Bridge
The Buddha said it plain:
"You thirsty? Then you dig.
You see dry ground? Keep going.
You hit mud? That's your sign—
The water's almost there,
The freedom's close this time."

### Verse 4
Mud beneath my shovel now, my arms are getting tired,
But I can smell that water, man, it's what my soul desired.
One more stroke, one more push, and Lord, there it flows—
Cold, clear, living water—that's how the seeker knows.

### Final Chorus
I kept on digging, brother, I kept on digging deep,
The water was below me even when I couldn't see.
Dry soil, wet soil, then the mud—and now I'm done,
I kept on digging, sister, and I finally found the One.

### Tag (spoken or sung slow)
You searching for enlightenment?
You walking the long road?
Don't matter how dry the dirt looks—
Keep digging where you are.
The signs of progress matter.
Persistence always pays.
You can tell you're getting close
Before you arrive.

## THE TEACHING

From Lotus Sutra, Chapter 10:

> "Medicine King, it's like this—imagine there's a person who's thirsty, desperate for water. So they go up on a high plateau and start digging, searching for water.
>
> At first they just see dry soil, dusty dirt. They know the water's still far off.
>
> But they don't give up. They keep working. After a while they start seeing damp soil, wet dirt. Then gradually they hit mud.
>
> Their heart becomes certain, becomes settled. They know for sure: Water's definitely close now.
>
> It's the same way with bodhisattvas. If they haven't heard this Lotus Sutra, haven't understood it—they're still far from supreme perfect enlightenment.
>
> But if they hear it, understand it, practice and cultivate it—then you can be certain they're close to supreme perfect enlightenment."

**What This Teaches:**
1. **Signs of progress matter** — Dry soil → damp soil → mud → water
2. **Persistence pays off** — Don't quit when the ground is still dry
3. **You can tell you're getting close before you arrive** — The mud is the sign
4. **The teaching is the well** — The Lotus Sutra itself is where you dig
