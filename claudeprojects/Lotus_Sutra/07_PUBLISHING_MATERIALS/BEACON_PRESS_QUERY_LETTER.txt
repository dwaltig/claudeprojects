Beacon Press Editorial Team

Dear Beacon Press:

I am writing to query a complete trilogy of Mahayana Buddhist sutras that I have translated into contemporary blues vernacular—a deliberate choice to make profound teachings on universal equality and liberation accessible to communities who don't engage with academic Buddhist language.

THE PROJECT

Three foundational Buddhist texts (Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma (190,000 words, 28 chapters), and Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra) translated into accessible American spiritual language while maintaining complete fidelity to the original Classical Chinese and Buddhist doctrine. The translation uses blues and gospel vernacular—American spiritual traditions born from struggle and resilience.

WHY THIS MATTERS

The Lotus Sutra's central teaching is radical: all beings, regardless of status, capacity, or circumstance, possess Buddha-nature and the capacity for enlightenment. This is Buddhist liberation theology—a message of universal equality and human dignity that speaks directly to Beacon's mission.

The blues tradition is itself a spiritual language of liberation. Rendering this text in that vernacular isn't appropriation; it's translation into an authentic American language of justice and freedom.

The trilogy already resonates with 2,500+ listeners across streaming platforms. I have lived this practice for over a decade.

QUESTION FOR YOUR TEAM

Does Beacon currently acquire translated Buddhist texts with innovative vernacular approaches designed for accessibility and liberation? If so, I would welcome the opportunity to submit the complete manuscript, sample chapters, and author materials.

Respectfully,

William Altig

WORD COUNT CHECK
================================================================================

The letter above is approximately 240 words (well within the 250-word limit).

If you need to shorten, remove any of these sections:
- "QUESTION FOR YOUR TEAM" paragraph (reduce to 1 sentence)
- "The trilogy already resonates..." sentence
- Any detail about streaming platforms/listener numbers

But the core positioning should stay:
✓ Translation (not fiction, not poetry)
✓ Social justice angle (universal equality, liberation theology)
✓ Accessibility as a value
✓ Blues as legitimate spiritual tradition
✓ Question asking if they acquire this type of work

================================================================================
WHAT TO EXPECT
================================================================================

Response Timeline: 3 weeks (if they're interested)
- If interested: "Thank you for your query. Please submit [list of materials]"
- If not interested: No response (per their policy)

If They Say Yes:
→ They'll ask for full manuscript, sample chapters, author bio
→ Create BEACON_PRESS_SUBMISSION_PACKAGE.txt
→ Submit within 1 week

If No Response After 3 Weeks:
→ Assume it's a pass
→ Move to UC Press or Hawaii Press

================================================================================
STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE
================================================================================

✓ Beacon's social justice mission aligns PERFECTLY with your work
✓ Their audience (progressive, spirituality-interested, justice-focused) is ideal
✓ The blues vernacular approach resonates with their values
✓ Gender-inclusive approach fits their feminist spirituality publishing
✓ Universal Buddha-nature teaching = liberation theology they understand
✓ Fast response (3 weeks vs. 12+ weeks elsewhere)

This is actually a STRONG fit for Beacon. Better than Shambhala, possibly.
