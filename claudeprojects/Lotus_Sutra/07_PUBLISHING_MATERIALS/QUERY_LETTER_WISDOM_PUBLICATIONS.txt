Dear Mr. Kittelstrom:

THE BLUES AND THE DHARMA COME FROM THE SAME PLACE

They both emerge from a deep, honest look at the truth of suffering and offer a
rugged path to get free. For the past decade, I have been translating the
foundational texts of Mahayana Buddhism into the language that understands this
journey best: the blues.

I am writing to introduce a complete trilogy of Buddhist sacred texts in
contemporary blues vernacular—all three volumes professionally polished and ready
for publication:

* Volume 1: The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra (prologue and foundational teaching)
* Volume 2: The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma (the central teaching, 28
  chapters, 190,000 words)
* Volume 3: Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra (commitment and practice guidance)

This is not merely a translation. This is a re-voicing—bringing the revolutionary
message of universal Buddha-nature into the vernacular of struggle, redemption,
and human dignity. The work emerges from over twenty years of Buddhist study and
practice, combined with my background as a musician and spiritual artist. I have
already shared this translation with over 2,500 active listeners across streaming
platforms, primarily through musical adaptations of these texts as a "Buddhist
Blues Opera."

These three volumes form a complete contemplative practice cycle that I have
personally lived for years: reading one chapter of the Lotus Sutra for 28
consecutive days, then alternating between the other two sutras during the
remaining days of the month. This creates a proven, time-tested spiritual practice
structure that practitioners can adopt immediately.

WHY WISDOM PUBLICATIONS?

Wisdom Publications has always understood what I am attempting: making profound
Buddhist teachings accessible to contemporary seekers without compromising doctrinal
depth or spiritual authenticity. This trilogy represents exactly the kind of work
that Wisdom exists to publish—Buddhism that is rigorous, accessible, and alive.

Moreover, this is not a one-book project. I am building a comprehensive Buddhist
spiritual practice platform. The published texts are the foundation. Audio versions
featuring Maya Angelou's voice are in production (scheduled for January 2026).
Illustrated children's books adapting these teachings are planned for 2026. A
contemplative practice app is in development for 2026. This represents a complete
ecosystem for contemporary spiritual practice—exactly the kind of long-term vision
that a publisher like Wisdom can champion and grow.

MY COMMITMENT TO THIS WORK

I have spent the past decade devoted to this project. I have cultivated an
audience of 2,500+ active listeners who already know and appreciate this work
through music and teaching. I am available for readings, workshops, and
performances at academic institutions, spiritual centers, and community venues. I
am prepared to be an active partner in bringing this work to the audiences who
need it most.

WHAT I AM ENCLOSING

I have attached:

1. The Buddhist Blues Spiritual Platform - Complete Vision (my comprehensive
   overview of all three volumes and the larger platform I am building)

2. The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma - Burning House Parable (Chapters 2-3,
   approximately 25 pages, representing the translation quality and approach)

3. Table of Contents with Chapter Descriptions (showing the scope and organization
   of all three volumes)

4. Complete Author Biography (with credentials, platform metrics, and contact
   information)

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this project with you and to answer any
questions you may have. I believe this is the kind of work that Wisdom
Publications exists to publish, and I am excited about the possibility of
partnering with you to bring it to the world.

The manuscript is complete, polished, and ready for immediate consideration. All
three volumes are equally publication-ready, and I am prepared to move quickly
should Wisdom be interested in acquiring the trilogy.

Thank you for considering this work. I look forward to hearing from you.

Respectfully,

William Altig
