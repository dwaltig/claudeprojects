```

**Field 2: Genre/Category**
```
Buddhist Studies / Spirituality / Sacred Texts / Translation
```

**Field 3: How did you hear about Wisdom Publications?**
```
Wisdom Publications has consistently published the kind of work I'm creating:

maintaining doctrinal depth and spiritual authenticity. Your mission aligned
perfectly with my vision for this trilogy.
```

**Field 4: Brief Project Description (500-2,000 words)**
```
[Copy from "The Buddhist Blues Spiritual Platform - Complete Vision.txt"]
Opening with the elevator pitch from the file:

"The blues and the Dharma come from the same place: a deep, honest look at
the truth of suffering and a rugged path to get free.

I'm a musician, and I've spent the last ten years putting those two truths
together. I've translated the complete Mahayana canon—the core trilogy—into
the language that understands this journey best: the blues.

This isn't just a translation; it's a re-voicing. It's the sound of struggle,
redemption, and human dignity. All three volumes are polished and ready for
publication:

* Volume 1: The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra (The Prologue)
* Volume 2: The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma (The Core Teaching, 190,000 words)
* Volume 3: Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra (The Practice)

[Continue with platform vision, audio versions, children's books, app, etc.]"
```

**Field 5: Author Platform & Reach**
```

```

**Field 6: Previous Publications**
```
Self-published work on Amazon (8 titles) that allowed me to build an engaged
readership and develop my craft as a writer. The Lotus Sutra trilogy represents
my first submission to traditional publishing—my landmark work that deserves
the resources and reach a traditional publisher provides.
```

**Field 7: Manuscript Status**
```
Complete and publication-ready. All three volumes of the trilogy are fully
polished and ready for immediate publication:
- Volume 1: The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra (complete)
- Volume 2: The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma (complete, 190,000 words, 28 chapters)
- Volume 3: Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra (complete)

All three volumes follow the traditional Mahayana Buddhist reading order and
create a complete monthly contemplative practice cycle.
```

**Field 8: Additional Notes**
```
This trilogy is the literary foundation of a comprehensive Buddhist spiritual
practice platform I am building. Beyond the published texts, the vision includes:

- Audio versions featuring Maya Angelou's voice (scheduled January 2026)
- Illustrated children's books adapting these teachings (2026)
- Contemplative practice mobile app (2026)
- Future translation projects (Dhammapada from original Pali)

My personal contemplative practice follows the traditional three-sutra cycle:
reading one chapter of the Lotus Sutra for 28 consecutive days, then alternating
between the Immeasurable Meanings Sutra and Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra
during the remaining days of the month. This translation project emerged from and
serves to deepen this lifelong spiritual practice.

I am not seeking a one-book deal, but a publishing partnership to build a
comprehensive spiritual home where practitioners can access, hear, learn from,
and daily engage with these teachings through multiple media.

## EMAIL SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

**To:** submissions@wisdompubs.org

**Subject Line:** Query: Blues Translation of Lotus Sutra Trilogy

**Email Body:**

```
Dear Mr. Kittelstrom and the Wisdom Publications Team,

I am submitting a query for a complete trilogy of Mahayana Buddhist sacred
texts translated into contemporary blues vernacular. All three volumes are
professionally polished and ready for publication.

THE BLUES AND THE DHARMA COME FROM THE SAME PLACE

They both emerge from a deep, honest look at the truth of suffering and offer
a rugged path to get free. For the past decade, I have been translating the
foundational texts of Mahayana Buddhism into the language that understands
this journey best: the blues.

All three volumes are complete and ready for immediate publication:

* Volume 1: The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra (The Prologue)
* Volume 2: The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma (The Core Teaching, 190,000 words, 28 chapters)
* Volume 3: Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra (The Practice)

This represents a complete trilogy that forms a monthly contemplative practice
cycle, supported by an emerging multimedia platform including audio versions
(featuring Maya Angelou's voice), illustrated children's books, and a
contemplative practice app.

I believe this project aligns perfectly with Wisdom Publications' mission to
make profound Buddhist teachings accessible to contemporary seekers while
maintaining doctrinal depth and spiritual authenticity.

Please find attached:
1. Complete project synopsis (Word document)
2. Sample manuscript - Chapters 2-3: The Burning House Parable (Word document)
3. Complete author biography
4. Table of contents with chapter descriptions

I look forward to discussing this work with you and answering any questions.

Respectfully,
William Altig
