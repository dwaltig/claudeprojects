# The Dharma Reborn Series
## Ancient Buddhist Wisdom in American Blues Voice

---

For over two thousand years, the great sutras and commentaries of Buddhism have offered liberation to those who would listen. Now, translator William Altig brings these sacred teachings to life through the rhythms, raw honesty, and spiritual depth of the American Blues tradition.

The Dharma Reborn Series is not a simplification—it's a resurrection. Each volume renders classical Buddhist scripture and masterworks into the language of suffering, transformation, and freedom that the Blues has always known. From the cosmic visions of the Lotus Sutra to the defiant vows of Nichiren, from the practical ethics of the Dhammapada to the Heart Sutra's liberation in a single page—these interpretations honor both scholarly precision and the lived experience of the human spirit crying out for truth.

The Blues and the Buddha walk the same road. Both begin with suffering. Both refuse to look away. And both discover that freedom is found not by escaping pain, but by seeing through it.
