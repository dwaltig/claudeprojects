TERMINOLOGY UPDATE SUMMARY
November 9, 2025
================================================================================

PROJECT: Blues Interpretation of the Lotus Sutra - Audio Production

================================================================================
CHANGE REQUESTED
================================================================================

Updated all documentation to reflect that this is an INTERPRETATION (not a
translation). Changed all references from "translator" and "translation notes"
to "interpreter" and "interpretation notes" throughout the project.

================================================================================
FILES UPDATED
================================================================================

1. DEVLOG.md (Primary documentation)
   - Updated master file descriptions to clarify distinction between
     text extraction (source) and interpretation (creative rendering)
   - Added note: "This is an interpretation, not a translation. Based on
     Kumārajīva's classical Chinese version, reimagined in blues/gospel
     vernacular"

2. CHAPTER_EXTRACTION_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md
   - "fully transliterated" → "fully transliterated and interpreted"
   - Added: "Interpretation style: Blues/gospel vernacular rendering of
     Buddhist dharma"

3. COMPLETE_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.txt
   - "All translation notes intact" → "All interpretation notes intact"

4. EXTRACTION_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md
   - "Blues/vernacular translation style intact" → "Blues/vernacular
     interpretation style intact"

5. 01_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md
   - "All translation notes and apparatus unchanged" → "All interpretation
     notes and apparatus unchanged"

6. 10_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md
   - "All translation notes and apparatus unchanged" → "All interpretation
     notes and apparatus unchanged"

7. FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_SUMMARY.md
   - "Lotus Sutra translation for Text-to-Speech" → "Lotus Sutra
     interpretation for Text-to-Speech"
   - "complete fidelity to the original translation" → "complete fidelity
     to the original interpretation"

8. MASTER_SUMMARY_CHAPTERS_11_28.md
   - "Lotus Sutra translation for Text-to-Speech" → "Lotus Sutra
     interpretation for Text-to-Speech"

================================================================================
KEY DISTINCTION MAINTAINED
================================================================================

Throughout the project:
- SOURCE MATERIAL: Kumārajīva's classical Chinese translation (406 CE)
- YOUR WORK: Blues/gospel vernacular INTERPRETATION of that source
- This is creative reimagining, not a linguistic translation

The documentation now clearly reflects:
✅ You are an interpreter, not a translator
✅ This is an interpretation of Buddhist dharma in blues/gospel style
✅ All interpretation notes (not "translation notes")
✅ The work is based on scholarly sources but expressed through your
   unique artistic voice

================================================================================
TERMINOLOGY CONSISTENCY
================================================================================

Now consistently uses:
- "Interpretation" (the creative work you've done)
- "Interpretation notes" (commentary on your artistic choices)
- "Interpreter" (your role)
- "Blues interpretation" (the overall project)
- "Artistic rendering" (when describing the process)

Avoids:
- "Translation"
- "Translation notes"
- "Translator"

================================================================================
IMPACT
================================================================================

All documentation now accurately reflects the true nature of your work:
- This is not a literal translation from Chinese to English
- This is an artistic/spiritual interpretation in blues/gospel vernacular
- It's based on scholarly sources but transforms them through your creative voice
- The work honors the dharma while making it accessible through contemporary
  African American musical and linguistic traditions

Your role is as an INTERPRETER/ARTIST, not a translator.
