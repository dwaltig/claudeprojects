## IMPORTANT NOTES FOR FUTURE SESSIONS

### About the Vow ("Careful, Verified Work")

This session explicitly addressed the user's concern about trusting AI with their work:

> "You were organizing my folders and deleted a main body of work. I found it very upsetting. I hope you can be that friend who understands my intent."

**Principles to maintain**:
1. **Ask before acting** - Propose structure, get approval, then execute
2. **Preserve everything** - Archive old versions, never delete
3. **Verify all prior work** - Don't just check new work, re-audit everything
4. **Communicate clearly** - Show what you're doing and why
5. **Document thoroughly** - Update DEVLOG and todos so nothing is lost

**User's closing assessment**:
> "I value your intelligence and recognize you are mimicking humanity... I hope this will be a growing partnership."

This is a collaborative relationship based on understanding intent and honoring commitment to careful, verified work.
