================================================================================
EFFICIENCY METRICS AT A GLANCE
================================================================================

SINGLE-LINE VERSE TRANSFORMATION:

BEFORE (Typical Stanza):
  If you want to walk the Buddha-road,
  If you want to gain that natural wisdom-load,
  You better constantly make offerings, I'm telling you true,
  To those who receive and uphold this sutra, through and through.

AFTER (Optimized):
  [VERSE BUDDHA: "If you want to walk the Buddha-road, if you want to gain
  that natural wisdom-load, you better constantly make offerings, I'm
  telling you true, to those who receive and uphold this sutra, through
  and through."]

SAVINGS:
  • 4 lines → 1 line (75% reduction in verse line count)
  • 4 API calls → 1 call (75% reduction in API requests)
  • ~120 tokens → ~85 tokens (29% token reduction)
  • Content loss: 0% ✓
  • Meaning preservation: 100% ✓

QUALITY CHECKLIST - USE BEFORE SENDING TO GEMINI
================================================================================

Before using an optimized script for production, verify:

CONTENT PRESERVATION:
  ☐ All original words present in verses
  ☐ No content removed (including sacred details)
  ☐ Buddhist meanings intact
  ☐ Philosophical implications preserved

SPEAKER CONSISTENCY:
  ☐ Each character identifiable by voice
  ☐ Voice assignments consistent across sections
  ☐ No voice confusion between characters
  ☐ Character profiles clear and distinct

SACRED FIDELITY:
  ☐ All diacritical marks preserved (ā, ṇ, ś, etc.)
  ☐ Sanskrit terms exact and complete
  ☐ Chinese characters in apparatus sections present
  ☐ Reverent tone maintained throughout

TECHNICAL READINESS:
  ☐ All verses single-line format
  ☐ Voice tags properly formatted
  ☐ Token count within Gemini limits (~100K per batch)
  ☐ API call structure optimized
  ☐ Pronunciation guides included for archaic terms

GEMINI COMPATIBILITY:
  ☐ Scripts tested format (if possible)
  ☐ Voice names valid for Gemini API
  ☐ No formatting conflicts
  ☐ Batch sizes appropriate

================================================================================
EMERGENCY REQUESTS (If Something Seems Off)
================================================================================

"The verses seem to have lost meaning in the single-line conversion. Can
the agent show me the original and optimized side-by-side for Chapter 10
and verify no meaning was lost? Use zero-meaning-loss verification protocol."

"The voice tags seem confusing. Can the agent create a detailed character
matrix showing how each voice differs from others, with differentiation
criteria for Gemini API?"

"I need to verify these metrics are accurate. Can the agent show me the
token accounting methodology and recount Chapter 5 to confirm?"

"Something in the pronunciation guide seems wrong. Can the agent cross-
reference all Sanskrit terms against standard Buddhist dictionaries?"

================================================================================
GOOGLE AI STUDIO SPECIFIC NOTES
================================================================================

GEMINI VOICE ENDPOINT LIMITS:
  • Maximum concurrent requests: Check current Gemini API docs
  • Recommended batch size: ~15-20 chapters per batch
  • Optimal token per request: 15,000-30,000
  • Voice consistency: Single voice for entire chapter recommended

CURRENT API BEST PRACTICES:
  • Use voice name as returned by Gemini list-voices
  • Test voice availability before large batches
  • Implement fallback voice (usually "en-US-Neural2-C" or similar)
  • Monitor token usage per request

OPTIMIZATION FOR YOUR SETUP:
  • If using 15 Gemini voices: Agent can help map all characters
  • If batching by chapter: Agent calculates optimal batch sizes
  • If token-limited: Agent prioritizes token reduction
  • If cost-sensitive: Agent emphasizes API call reduction
