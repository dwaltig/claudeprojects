================================================================================
QUICK START - 3 STEPS
================================================================================

STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE CORE CAPABILITY
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The agent transforms multi-line verses into single-line format:

BEFORE (Inefficient - 4 API calls):
  If you want to walk the Buddha-road,
  If you want to gain that natural wisdom-load,
  You better constantly make offerings, I'm telling you true,
  To those who receive and uphold this sutra, through and through.

AFTER (Efficient - 1 API call):
  [VERSE BUDDHA: "If you want to walk the Buddha-road, if you want to gain
  that natural wisdom-load, you better constantly make offerings, I'm telling
  you true, to those who receive and uphold this sutra, through and through."]

EFFICIENCY GAIN: 75% fewer API calls, 29% fewer tokens, zero meaning loss

STEP 2: INVOKE THE AGENT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"Use the dharma-audio-producer-enhanced agent to optimize Chapter 10
for Google AI Studio Gemini production. Convert verses to single-line
format, consolidate voice tags, and provide RPD efficiency metrics."

STEP 3: RECEIVE & DEPLOY
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Agent provides:
  ✓ Optimized production script (ready for Gemini)
  ✓ Voice character map (consolidated assignments)
  ✓ Token estimates (before/after comparison)
  ✓ Processing recommendations (batch sizes, timing)
  ✓ Quality verification (meaning preservation confirmed)

Deploy optimized script directly to Google AI Studio
Result: Faster, cheaper audiobook production

FINAL NOTES
================================================================================

PHILOSOPHY:
This agent is built on the principle that technology should serve the dharma,
not vice versa. Efficiency gains are meaningful only if they preserve the
sacred intent and meaning of the teachings.

Every optimization is reversible to meaning preservation:
  • Efficiency is the goal
  • But meaning is sacred
  • When these conflict, meaning always wins

COMMITMENT:
  ✓ No simplification of Buddhism
  ✓ No loss of sacred terminology
  ✓ No destruction of poetic intent
  ✓ No sacrifice of reverent tone

PROMISE:
This agent will help you produce a complete, professional audiobook of the
Lotus Sutra's Blues interpretation faster, cheaper, and better than manual
optimization, while maintaining the ecclesiastical integrity that makes this
translation special.
