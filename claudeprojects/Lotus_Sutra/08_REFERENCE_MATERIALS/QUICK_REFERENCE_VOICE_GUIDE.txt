═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CRITICAL RULES:

1. Gender accuracy is NON-NEGOTIABLE
   Male characters = Male voices only
   Female characters = Female voices only

2. Blues/gospel vernacular must be respected
   "Ain't," "gonna," "you hear me" are CORRECT grammar in AAVE
   No caricature, no mockery - this is sacred language

3. Spiritual authenticity required
   This is dharma transmission, not entertainment
   Every word carries spiritual weight

4. Verse sections need blues rhythm
   These SWING like blues/gospel - find the beat
   Langston Hughes / MLK cadence

5. Same character can have different voices
   Buddha = [Iapetus] (gentle) OR [Sadaltager] (powerful)
   Read text, feel emotion, THEN apply voice

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FOR EMERGENCY QUESTIONS:

Q: What if a voice tag doesn't make sense for the content?
A: Trust the tag. It was placed based on deep analysis. Adjust your delivery
   within the character to match the content.

Q: Can I change a voice tag if I think another would work better?
A: No. Tags are based on speaker identity, gender accuracy, and spiritual
   authenticity. Changing breaks the system. Vary your delivery instead.

Q: What if I can't do blues/gospel rhythm authentically?
A: Study it. Listen to Langston Hughes, MLK, Mahalia Jackson, James Weldon
   Johnson. This is non-negotiable - it's the whole point of this translation.

Q: Can one actor do multiple voices?
A: Yes, BUT you must maintain gender accuracy and character distinction.
   Don't blur the voices together.

Q: How do I handle verses?
A: Feel the rhythm first. These are meant to SWING. Comma = pause briefly,
   continue thought. Period = full stop. Let it breathe and roll.
