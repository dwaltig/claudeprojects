WHAT THIS WILL DO FOR YOU
================================================================================

By reading these articles, you'll:

✓ Understand the rhetorical conventions of academic writing
✓ See how real scholars balance intellectual rigor with lived experience
✓ Notice that good scholarship CAN have voice and passion
✓ Understand what "dry" vs. "powerful-but-formal" actually means
✓ Get ideas for specific examples or structures you could use
✓ Return to your own article with fresh perspective
✓ Know whether your article needs fundamental revision or just polishing

MOST IMPORTANTLY:

You'll realize your article is NOT dry. It's just speaking in a different register
than your Blues translation. And that register is exactly appropriate for academic
publishing.

================================================================================
AFTER YOU FINISH THIS READING
================================================================================

Come back to your Article 4 draft with these questions:

1. How is my article similar in structure to what I read?
2. Where is my voice/passion? (It's there—find it)
3. What examples could I add that are as specific as these published scholars use?
4. Is my tone appropriate for the journal I'm targeting?
5. What am I trying to prove that these articles don't cover?

You'll be amazed at how differently you see your own work.

================================================================================
REMEMBER
================================================================================

Academic writing is not dry. It's precise, careful, and restrained—but that's
not the same as dry.

Your article has IDEAS. It has ARGUMENTS. It connects PHILOSOPHY to LIVED
EXPERIENCE. That's exactly what successful scholarship does.

After you read these articles, you'll see that more clearly.

Start with angel Kyodo williams. Her work will speak directly to yours, and you'll
see immediately how to pitch your own voice while maintaining scholarly rigor.
