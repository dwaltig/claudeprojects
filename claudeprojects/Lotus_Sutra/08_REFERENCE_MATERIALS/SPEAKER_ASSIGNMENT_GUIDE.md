## Important Notes for Voice Narration Production

### Gender Alignment
- All male characters use male voices
- All female characters use female voices
- This is non-negotiable for professional narration

### Speaker Consistency
- Once a speaker is assigned, they continue until a tag change
- No speaker tag on every paragraph - only at actual transitions
- This reduces listener confusion and creates natural flow

### Performance Guidance
- [Charon] creates gravitas and epicness
- [Rasalgethi] creates warmth and accessibility
- [Gacrux] creates heroic nobility
- [Iapetus] creates wisdom and depth
- [Leda] creates maternal strength
- [Schedar] creates powerful transformation
- [Sulafat] creates spiritual transcendence

### For Voice Actors/Narrators
When recording, note:
- Each speaker tag indicates a voice change
- Maintain the speaker's voice consistently within sections
- Use the voice descriptions from "Gemini Speaker Voices.txt" as guidance
- The tone should match the voice characteristics exactly
- Transitions between speakers should be clear but smooth
