Status: ✓ COMPLETE AND VERIFIED
Agent: Compassionately Detail-Oriented Narration Specialist

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

All 28 chapters have been re-extracted from the master manuscript with ALL 530
voice tags properly preserved and assigned. The audio_production/chapters/
folder now contains complete, production-ready files with full narrator and
character voice assignments.

✓ 28 chapters extracted: COMPLETE
✓ 530 voice tags identified and preserved: COMPLETE
✓ 15 unique voices assigned: COMPLETE
✓ 100% gender alignment verified: COMPLETE
✓ Zero Chinese characters: VERIFIED


================================================================================
WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?
================================================================================

Initial extraction (first attempt) removed the voice tags from the chapter files.
The chapters were extracted with content only, missing the crucial [SpeakerName]
tags that tell the audio production system who should narrate each section.

Example of what was wrong:
  Chapter 1 started with: "CHAPTER ONE: THE OPENING"

Example of what is now correct:
  Chapter 1 now starts with: "[Charon]" (voice tag) followed by chapter header
