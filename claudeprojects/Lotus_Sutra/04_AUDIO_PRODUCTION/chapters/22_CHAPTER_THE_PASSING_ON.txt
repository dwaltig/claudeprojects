CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO: THE PASSING ON
(Entrustment - 囑累品第二十二)

A Blues/Gospel Interpretation from the Classical Chinese

THE LAYING ON OF HANDS

Now you got to see this right—
The Buddha, Śākyamuni himself,
He rise up from that teaching seat,
And he show forth great spiritual power.

He reach out with his right hand,
And he touch the heads
Of them countless Bodhisattvas,
Every blessed one,
And when his hand come down on them,
He speak these words:

"I been working at this
For more ages than you can count—
Hundred thousand million billion
Uncountable ages—
Working and struggling
To get this hard-to-get thing,
This supreme perfect enlightenment.

Now I'm putting it in your hands.
I'm entrusting it to you.
You got to take this teaching,
Spread it out with one mind,
Make it grow far and wide."

THE SECOND TIME

And he do it again—
Three times he touch them heads,
Three times he lay his hand down,
Three times he speak the word:

"I been working at this
For more ages than you can count—
Hundred thousand million billion
Uncountable ages—
Working and struggling
To get this hard-to-get thing,
This supreme perfect enlightenment.

Now I'm putting it in your hands.
I'm entrusting it to you.

You got to receive it,
Hold it,
Read it,
Recite it,
Spread it abroad,
Make sure all living beings
Everywhere hear it and know it.

Why I'm telling you this?
Because the Tathāgata got great compassion—
He ain't stingy,
He ain't holding back,
He ain't afraid.

He give to living beings
The Buddha's wisdom,
The Tathāgata's wisdom,
The natural wisdom that come by itself.

The Tathāgata—
He the great gift-giver
To all living beings.

YOUR CALLING

Now you got to follow his example,
Learn the Tathāgata's way,
Don't be holding back,
Don't be stingy with what you got.

In the world that's coming,
If there be good men and good women
Who believe in the Tathāgata's wisdom,
You got to preach this Lotus Teaching to them,
Make sure they hear it and know it,
So they can get the Buddha's wisdom.

But if there be living beings
Who don't believe it,
Who can't receive it—
Then you show them some other deep teaching
That the Tathāgata left,
Teach them,
Guide them,
Benefit them,
Make them glad.

You do this,
You be repaying
What all the Buddhas done for you.
You be answering grace with grace."

THE TRIPLE AFFIRMATION

Now when them Bodhisattvas
Heard the Buddha say all this,
Great joy fill them up,
Joy running all through their bodies.

They bow down even deeper,
They bend low,
They drop their heads,
They put their palms together,
And they lift up their voice as one:

"As the World-Honored One command,
We will do it all—
Every bit of it.
Yes, World-Honored One!
Don't you worry none."

And them Bodhisattvas,
That great assembly,
They do it three times—
Three times they lift up their voice as one:

"As the World-Honored One command,
We will do it all—
Every bit of it.
Yes, World-Honored One!
Don't you worry none."

THE SENDING HOME

Then Śākyamuni Buddha,
He tell all them Buddhas
Who come from the ten directions,
All them manifestation bodies:

"Go on back now,
Go to your own lands,
Go where you belong.

And the Stupa of Many Treasures—
Let it be as it was before."

And when he speak these words,
All them countless Buddhas
From the ten directions,
Sitting under them jewel trees
On them lion seats—

And the Many Treasures Buddha,

And Superior Conduct
And all them countless Bodhisattvas,

And Śāriputra
And all them voice-hearers,
The fourfold assembly—

And all the worlds,
The heavens,
The humans,
The asuras,
All them beings—

They hear what the Buddha said,
And great joy fill them up,
Every blessed one.
