THE INSTANT SALVATION

Now listen here—when the Buddha finished telling them about his eternal life, about how he been living forever and ain't never gonna die, when he laid that truth down in Chapter 16, something happened right then and there in that assembly. I mean something HAPPENED.

The World-Honored One turned to Maitreya Bodhisattva and said:

"Ajita, let me tell you what went down while I was speaking. Let me count it up for you, let me measure out the grace that fell on this congregation:

Six hundred and eighty million billion times the sands of the Ganges River—that many beings got themselves the patience that don't arise. You hear me? They reached that place where they ain't scared of nothing no more, where the truth of how things really are don't make them flinch. They got that no-fear state, that calm-in-the-storm mind.

And a thousand times that many Bodhisattvas—a THOUSAND times more—they received the dhāraṇī of perfect hearing. They can hear the Dharma once and hold it forever, won't never forget it.

And as many Bodhisattvas as there are dust particles in one whole world system—that many got themselves the gift of unobstructed eloquence. They can talk about the truth and the words just flow like water, like honey, like joy pouring out.

And as many Bodhisattvas as there are dust particles in one whole world—that many received billions and billions of dhāraṇīs, memory powers beyond counting, holding the teachings like treasure in their minds.

And as many Bodhisattvas as there are dust particles in three thousand great thousand world systems—that vast number can now turn the wheel that don't retreat. They set to rolling and ain't nothing gonna stop them, they ain't never going backward.

And as many Bodhisattvas as there are dust particles in two middle-sized world systems—that many can turn the pure Dharma wheel.

And as many Bodhisattvas as there are dust particles in one small world system—that many gonna reach supreme enlightenment within eight lifetimes. Eight births and they're home free!

And as many Bodhisattvas as there are dust particles in four continents—that many gonna make it in four lifetimes.

Three continents' worth of dust—that many in three lifetimes.

Two continents' worth—that many in two lifetimes.

One continent's worth of dust particles—that many gonna reach enlightenment in just ONE more life. One more turn and they're done!

And as many beings as there are dust particles in eight whole worlds—that vast multitude of souls set their hearts on supreme enlightenment right then and there. They made the vow, they signed up, they committed."

HEAVEN ITSELF REJOICED

Now when the Buddha finished telling about all these beings who got blessed, who received the benefit, who caught the grace—

Heaven couldn't hold it in no more.

From the empty sky came falling down mandarava flowers and great mandarava flowers, scattering over all the countless jeweled trees where Buddhas were sitting on lion thrones, scattering over the seven-jeweled stupa where Śākyamuni Buddha and long-extinct Many Treasures Tathāgata were seated together, scattering over all the great Bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly.

And then came raining down fine powdered sandalwood and sinking-in-water aloeswood, drifting through the air like snow, like mercy, like blessing made visible.

In the empty sky, the heaven drums started playing themselves—nobody beating them, they just spoke out with wonderful sound that went deep and far, echoing through the worlds.

Then came falling a thousand kinds of heavenly garments, and strings of jewels descending—pearl necklaces, mani gem necklaces, wish-fulfilling jewel necklaces—spreading out through all nine directions.

Jeweled incense burners appeared, burning priceless incense, moving by themselves through the air, offering themselves to that great assembly.

Above every single Buddha, Bodhisattvas were holding banners and canopies, raising them up higher and higher until they reached to Brahma Heaven itself.

And those Bodhisattvas sang with wonderful voices, sang countless verses of praise to all the Buddhas.

MAITREYA SPEAKS THE WONDER

Right then Maitreya Bodhisattva rose from his seat, bared his right shoulder, pressed his palms together toward the Buddha, and spoke in verse:

*The Buddha speaks a rare teaching,*
*Something we ain't never heard before.*
*The World-Honored One got great power,*
*His life can't be measured no more.*

*Countless children of the Buddha,*
*Hearing the World-Honored One explain,*
*Telling who got what benefit—*
*Joy filling them up like rain.*

*Some standing on ground that don't retreat,*
*Some got dhāraṇīs in their mind,*
*Some got unobstructed eloquent speech,*
*Millions of total-holding of every kind.*

*Some—many as the great thousand world's dust—*
*Each one of those Bodhisattvas can turn*
*The Dharma wheel that don't go backward,*
*They rolling forward, they gonna burn.*

*And many as the middle thousand world's dust,*
*Those Bodhisattvas each can turn*
*The pure and clean Dharma wheel,*
*They got the teaching, they gonna learn.*

*And many as the small thousand world's dust,*
*Those Bodhisattvas got eight births remaining,*
*Then they gonna reach the Buddha Way,*
*They already halfway through the training.*

*And then four, three, two continents' worth,*
*That many Bodhisattvas in descending number,*
*Gonna be born that many times and reach Buddhahood—*
*They coming out they spiritual slumber.*

*One continent's dust of Bodhisattvas,*
*They got just one life left to go,*
*Then they gonna reach all-wisdom,*
*Next time around they gonna know.*

*All these beings,*
*Hearing Buddha's life is long,*
*They got immeasurable, leakless,*
*Pure fruit—everything went from wrong to strong.*

*And eight worlds' worth of dust—that many beings,*
*Hearing Buddha speak about his lifespan,*
*All of them set their hearts on the supreme,*
*They joining up with the enlightenment plan.*

*The World-Honored One speaks immeasurable truths,*
*Inconceivable teachings come out his mouth,*
*Bringing vast benefit,*
*Boundless as space—north, east, west, and south.*

*Raining down heavenly mandarava flowers,*
*And the great mandaravas too,*
*Indra and Brahma—many as Ganges sands—*
*Coming from countless Buddha-lands, coming through.*

*Raining sandalwood and aloeswood,*
*Swirling and falling in wild disarray,*
*Like birds flying down from the sky,*
*Scattering offerings on the Buddhas where they stay.*

*Heaven drums in the empty air*
*Naturally letting out wonderful sound,*
*Heavenly garments by the thousands and ten thousands*
*Spinning and descending to the ground.*

*Jeweled incense burners, wonderful and fragrant,*
*Burning priceless incense true,*
*Naturally spreading everywhere,*
*Making offerings to all the World-Honored Ones come through.*

*The great assembly of Bodhisattvas,*
*Holding seven-jeweled banners and canopies,*
*Wonderful and high—millions and billions of kinds—*
*Raising them in sequence up to Brahma's boundaries.*

*Before each and every Buddha,*
*Jeweled poles hanging victory banners down,*
*And with thousands and ten thousands of verses*
*They singing the Tathāgatas' renown.*

*All these various things,*
*Never happened before like this,*
*Hearing Buddha's life is limitless,*
*Everybody filled with bliss.*

*The Buddha's name heard in the ten directions,*
*Widely benefiting all living beings,*
*Everyone equipped with good roots,*
*Helping them toward the supreme, toward what enlightenment means.*

THE SHOCKING COMPARISON

Right then the Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva:

"Ajita, listen now. If there's beings who hear about the Buddha's lifespan being long like I just explained—if they can, even for one single thought-moment, generate faith and understanding—the merit they gonna get, that merit ain't got no limit. It can't be measured.

Now suppose there's a good man or a good woman who wants supreme perfect enlightenment, and for that goal they practice the Five Perfections for eighty myriads of millions of billions of nayutas of eons—

Let me tell you what that looks like:

GIVING: For all those eons, giving gifts. Giving to Buddhas, giving to solitary realizers, giving to Bodhisattvas. Giving precious and wonderful food and drink. Giving the finest clothes and bedding. Building temples out of sandalwood. Creating parks and gardens to make them beautiful. All kinds of giving, every kind wonderful and fine, through all those countless eons, dedicating it all toward the Buddha Way.

KEEPING PRECEPTS: Pure ethical conduct, clean and without a crack or leak, seeking the supreme path, the kind of conduct all Buddhas praise.

PATIENCE: Practicing forbearance, dwelling in that gentle, flexible ground. Even when all kinds of evil people come attacking, adding insults and harm, the mind don't tilt, don't tip over, don't move. Even when people who got a little bit of the Dharma come at you with their arrogance, looking down on you and troubling you—you can bear that too.

DILIGENT EFFORT: Vigorously progressing, your intention and mindfulness always solid and firm, for immeasurable hundreds of millions of eons, single-minded, never resting, never slacking off even once.

MEDITATION: Living for countless eons in quiet, empty places, whether sitting or walking, always—except when sleeping—keeping your mind collected and controlled. And because of this, producing all the meditations and concentrations, stable and unshaken in mind for eighty hundreds of millions of eons.

Taking all this one-pointed meditative merit and using it to seek the supreme path. Getting all the wisdom, mastering all the meditation states.

For hundreds and thousands of millions and billions of eons, this person practices all these meritorious virtues just like I described.

But then—

If there's a good man or good woman who hears me speak about my lifespan and believes it for even ONE SINGLE THOUGHT-MOMENT—

The blessing they get EXCEEDS all that other merit.

It ain't even close.

Not one part in a hundred. Not one part in a thousand. Not one part in hundreds of thousands of millions of billions. Can't even calculate the comparison. Can't make the numbers work. The metaphors fail.

If a good man or good woman has this kind of merit from believing—
Impossible they gonna retreat from supreme enlightenment.
Can't happen.
No such place exists where that could occur."

THE BUDDHA SPEAKS IT IN VERSE

Then the World-Honored One, wanting to speak this meaning again, said in verse:

*If someone seeking Buddha wisdom*
*For eighty myriads of millions of billions*
*Of nayuta eons*
*Practices the Five Perfections—*

*During all those eons,*
*Giving offerings to Buddhas,*
*To solitary realizers and their disciples,*
*And to Bodhisattva assemblies—*

*Precious and wonderful food and drink,*
*Fine clothing and bedding,*
*Building sandalwood temples,*
*Decorating them with gardens and groves—*

*All this kind of giving,*
*Various and wonderful in every way,*
*Through all those eons,*
*Dedicating it to the Buddha Way—*

*If they also keep the precepts,*
*Pure and clean, without crack or leak,*
*Seeking the supreme path,*
*The kind all Buddhas praise and speak—*

*If they also practice patience,*
*Dwelling on that ground of gentle adjustment,*
*Even when crowds of evil come attacking,*
*Their mind don't incline, don't make that judgment—*

*And when those who got a little Dharma,*
*Holding on to their prideful ways,*
*Look down and trouble this patient one,*
*Still able to endure throughout their days—*

*If they also diligently progress,*
*Their will and mindfulness constantly firm and strong,*
*For immeasurable hundreds of millions of eons*
*Single-minded, never lazy for long—*

*And for countless eons more,*
*Dwelling in quiet and empty places,*
*Whether sitting or walking,*
*Except for sleep, always gathering their mental spaces—*

*And because of this,*
*Able to produce all those meditation states,*
*For eighty hundreds of millions of eons*
*Dwelling in mental stability, mind that concentrates—*

*Holding this one-pointed blessing,*
*Seeking the supreme Way in their heart,*
*Saying: 'I will get all-wisdom,*
*Exhaust all meditative arts'—*

*This person, for hundreds and thousands*
*And millions and billions of eons,*
*Practices all these meritorious virtues*
*Like I just described with all these reasons—*

*But if there's good men or women*
*Who hear me speak about my lifespan,*
*And believe it even for one thought-moment,*
*Their blessing exceeds that other plan.*

*If a person completely without*
*Any doubt or regret at all,*
*Believes with deep mind even briefly,*
*Their blessing is like this—so tall.*

*Those Bodhisattvas who,*
*For immeasurable eons, walked the Way,*
*Hearing me speak about my lifespan,*
*They can believe and accept what I say.*

*People like this*
*Receive this scripture on the crown of their head,*
*Making this vow: 'In the future,*
*May I have long life and leave none unfed.*

*Just like the World-Honored One today,*
*King among the Shakya clan,*
*Lion-roaring in the place of enlightenment,*
*Speaking Dharma fearless—that's my plan.*

*We, in the worlds to come,*
*Honored and respected by everyone there,*
*When sitting in the place of enlightenment,*
*Will speak about lifespan in the same way—with care.'*

*If there are those with deep mind,*
*Pure and straightforward and true,*
*Much learning and able to retain it,*
*Understanding Buddha's words according to their cue—*

*People like this*
*About this teaching have no doubt."

WHAT DEEP FAITH LOOKS LIKE

"Furthermore, Ajita, if someone hears about the Buddha's long lifespan and understands what it's getting at, the merit that person gets got no limit. They can arouse the Tathāgata's supreme wisdom.

How much more so if they widely hear this scripture, or teach others to hear it, or hold it themselves, or teach others to hold it, or write it themselves, or teach others to write it, or make offerings to the scripture scroll with flowers, incense, necklaces, banners, canopies, silk hangings, fragrant oils and butter lamps—that person's merit is immeasurable and boundless. It can produce the wisdom that knows all kinds.

Ajita, if a good man or good woman hears me speak about my long lifespan and believes it with deep mind and understanding—then they seeing the Buddha constantly present on Vulture Peak Mountain, surrounded by the great Bodhisattvas and the assembly of hearers, speaking the Dharma.

And more: they seeing this Saha world, how the ground is lapis lazuli, level and even and smooth. The roads marked out with Jambu-river gold in eight directions. Jeweled trees standing in rows. Towers and pavilions all made of jewels. And the assembly of Bodhisattvas dwelling right there in them.

If someone can see like this, you should know: this is the sign of deep faith and understanding.

EVEN JUST NOT REJECTING IT

Furthermore, after the Tathāgata passes into extinction, if someone hears this scripture and don't tear it down, don't speak against it, but just feels a little joy rise up in their heart—you should know: this already is the sign of deep faith and understanding.

How much more so someone who reads and recites it, who receives and holds it—that person carrying the Tathāgata on top of their head.

Ajita, this good man or good woman don't need to build stupas or temples for me, don't need to construct monks' quarters or make the fourfold offering to the monastic community.

Why not?

Because a good man or good woman who receives, holds, reads, and recites this scripture—they already raised up a stupa, already built the monks' quarters, already made offering to the community.

It means they already raised up a seven-jeweled stupa over the Buddha's relics—tall and wide, tapering smaller as it rises up to Brahma Heaven, with banners and canopies hanging from it and many jeweled bells, with flowers and incense and necklaces, with powdered incense and paste incense and burning incense, with drums and music, with flutes and pipes and harps, with all kinds of dancing and performance, with wonderful sound and voice singing praises—and they already been making this offering for immeasurable thousands and myriads and hundreds of millions of eons.

THE INVISIBLE MONASTERY

Ajita, if after I pass into extinction, someone hears this scripture and can receive and hold it, whether writing it themselves or teaching others to write it—then they have built a monastery of thirty-two halls made of red sandalwood, each hall eight tala trees tall, high and wide and beautiful, with a hundred thousand monks dwelling there, with gardens and bathing pools, with walking paths and meditation caves, with robes and food and drink, with beds and bedding and medicine, with all kinds of joyful necessities filling it up completely. Monasteries and halls like this—hundreds and thousands and myriads and hundreds of millions of them, uncountably many—appearing right in front of them, making offering to me and to the community of monks.

So that's why I say: After the Tathāgata passes into extinction, if someone can receive, hold, read, recite, and speak this scripture for others, or write it themselves or teach others to write it, or make offerings to the scripture scroll—they don't need to build stupas or temples or construct monks' quarters or make offerings to the monastic community.

How much more so if someone can hold this scripture and also practice giving, keeping precepts, patience, diligent effort, single-mindedness, and wisdom—their virtue is supreme, immeasurable, boundless.

It's like empty space—east, west, south, north, the four intermediate directions, above, below—immeasurable and boundless.

That person's merit, likewise, is immeasurable and boundless like that.

They quickly arrive at the wisdom that knows all kinds.

If someone reads, recites, receives, and holds this scripture, speaks it for others, writes it themselves or teaches others to write it, and also can build stupas and construct monks' quarters, make offerings and praises to the community of hearers, and with hundreds of thousands of myriads of hundreds of millions of praising methods praise the merit of Bodhisattvas, and for other people, according to various causes and conditions, explains this Dharma Flower Scripture following its meanings, and also can purely keep the precepts, dwelling together with gentle and flexible people, patient and without anger, with firm will and mindfulness, always valuing sitting meditation and attaining deep meditations, vigorously brave and gathering in all good dharmas, with sharp faculties and wisdom, good at answering difficult questions—

ALREADY AT THE TREE

Ajita, if after I pass into extinction, good men and good women who receive, hold, read, and recite this scripture also have these kinds of good meritorious virtues—you should know: this person already proceeding to the place of enlightenment, drawing near to supreme perfect enlightenment, sitting under the tree of the Way.

Ajita, wherever that good man or good woman sits, stands, or walks—right there a stupa should be built. All the gods and humans should make offerings to it like it's the Buddha's stupa."

THE BUDDHA SPEAKS IT IN VERSE AGAIN

Then the World-Honored One, wanting to speak this meaning again, said in verse:

*If after I pass into extinction,*
*Someone can respectfully hold this scripture,*
*That person's blessing is immeasurable,*
*Like I explained up there for sure.*

*This means they completely fulfilled*
*All the various offerings made,*
*Raising up a stupa with relics,*
*Adorned with seven jewels displayed—*

*The pole reaching high and wide,*
*Tapering smaller up to Brahma's place,*
*Jeweled bells by the thousands and myriads of hundreds of millions,*
*Wind moving them with wonderful sound and grace.*

*And for immeasurable eons*
*Making offerings to this stupa tall,*
*With flowers and incense and many necklaces,*
*Heavenly clothes and music for all,*

*Burning fragrant oil and butter lamps,*
*Constantly illuminating all around.*
*In the evil age when Dharma's ending,*
*If someone can hold this scripture found—*

*It means they already, like I said above,*
*Completely fulfilled all the offerings made.*
*If someone can hold this scripture,*
*It's like the Buddha's still here, not yet decayed.*

*With ox-head sandalwood*
*Building monks' quarters as an offering place,*
*With thirty-two halls,*
*Each one eight tala trees high, full of grace—*

*Fine food and wonderful clothing,*
*Beds and bedding all fulfilled,*
*Hundreds and thousands dwelling there,*
*Gardens and bathing pools all built,*

*Walking paths and meditation caves,*
*Everything beautiful in various ways.*
*If someone with faithful, understanding mind*
*Receives, holds, reads, recites through their days,*

*Or also teaches others to write it,*
*And makes offerings to the scripture scroll,*
*Scattering flowers, incense, powdered incense,*
*With sumanas, champaka from the soul,*

*Atimuktaka flowers and fragrant oils*
*Constantly burning them bright—*
*One who makes offerings like this*
*Gets immeasurable merit and light.*

*Boundless as empty space,*
*So is their blessing likewise.*
*How much more so holding this scripture*
*While also giving, that's twice as wise—*

*And keeping precepts, patient, loving meditation,*
*Not angry, not speaking evil or mean,*
*Respectful toward stupas and temples,*
*Humble toward all monks seen,*

*Far away from prideful mind,*
*Always contemplating wisdom's way,*
*When questioned and challenged, not getting angry,*
*Following along to explain, to say—*

*If someone can practice this practice,*
*Their merit can't be measured.*
*If you see this Dharma teacher*
*Accomplished in virtue to be treasured,*

*You should scatter heavenly flowers on them,*
*Cover their body with heavenly clothes,*
*Touch your head to the ground at their feet,*
*Think of them as the Buddha—that's how it goes.*

*You should also make this thought:*
*'Before long they'll proceed to the place of the Way,*
*Attaining leakless and unconditioned truth,*
*Widely benefiting people and gods—both night and day.'*

*The place where they dwell and stay,*
*Where they walk or sit or lie,*
*Even if they speak just one verse there,*
*In that spot a stupa should rise high,*

*Adorned and made beautiful,*
*Offered to in various ways.*
*A child of Buddha dwelling on this ground—*
*This is the Buddha's place for all his days,*

*Constantly present right there within,*
*Walking around and sitting and lying down."
