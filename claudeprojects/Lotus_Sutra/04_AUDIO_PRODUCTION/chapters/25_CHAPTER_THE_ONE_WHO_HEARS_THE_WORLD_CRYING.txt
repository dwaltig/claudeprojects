CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE: THE ONE WHO HEARS THE WORLD CRYING
Avalokiteśvara's Universal Door

A Blues Interpretation from Kumārajīva's Classical Chinese

THE QUESTION

Right then, the Bodhisattva named Inexhaustible Intention - he rose up from his seat, bared his right shoulder in that ancient way of showing respect, pressed his palms together before the Buddha, and said:

"World-Honored One, I got to ask you something. This Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara - Observer of the World's Sounds - why she called that? What's the reason, what's the cause behind that name?"

And the Buddha told Inexhaustible Intention:

"Good friend, listen now. If countless suffering beings - we talking hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of people hurting - if they hear about this Bodhisattva called Observer of Sounds, and they call her name with a whole heart, with their one true mind, she gonna HEAR them. She gonna observe the very sound of their crying. And every single one gonna find liberation, gonna get free.

THE LITANY OF DELIVERANCE

"Listen to what I'm telling you:

If someone holding onto her name falls into great fire -
The fire can't burn them.
That's her mighty spiritual power working.

If the great waters come to drown you and you call her name -
You gonna reach shallow ground.
You gonna find your footing.

If hundreds of thousands of millions of beings go out seeking treasure -
Seeking gold and silver and lapis lazuli,
Seeking agate and coral and amber and pearls,
And they sailing the great sea,
And the black wind comes howling,
And it blows their ship off course into the demon lands,
Into the country of the flesh-eating rakshasas -
If even just ONE person on that ship calls her name,
Every person there gonna be delivered.
Every soul gonna be saved from the demon danger.
THAT'S why she called Observer of Sounds.

"If someone about to be killed, about to be murdered,
And they call on Avalokiteśvara,
The knife gonna break.
The weapon gonna shatter into pieces.
They gonna walk free.

"If the whole three-thousand-great-thousand world system was FILLED with demons -
Filled with yakshas and rakshasas wanting to hurt people -
Soon as they hear someone calling her name,
Those evil spirits can't even LOOK at that person with hate in their eyes,
Let alone do them harm.

"If someone bound in chains - guilty or innocent, don't matter -
Locked in shackles, cangue and fetters binding their body,
Soon as they call on Avalokiteśvara,
Every chain gonna break.
Every lock gonna snap.
They walking out free.

"If the whole world filled with bandits and thieves,
And a merchant leader taking his people down a dangerous road,
Carrying precious goods through dangerous country,
And one person says:
'Good people, don't be afraid!
You need to call with one mind on Avalokiteśvara.
This Bodhisattva gives the gift of fearlessness to all beings.
If you call her name, you gonna be delivered from these bandits.'

"When all those merchants hear this, they cry out together:
'NAMO AVALOKITESHVARA!'
Homage to the Observer of Sounds!

"And because they called her name, they delivered right there.

FREEDOM FROM WHAT BINDS YOU

"Inexhaustible Intention, this Great Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara -
Her spiritual power is mighty, mighty like this:

If beings got too much lust pulling at them,
But they constantly remember her with reverence,
They gonna get free from desire.

If they got too much anger burning in them,
But they constantly remember her with reverence,
They gonna get free from rage.

If they got too much ignorance clouding their minds,
But they constantly remember her with reverence,
They gonna get free from delusion.

"Inexhaustible Intention, Observer of Sounds got this kind of great spiritual power.
She benefits so many beings.
That's why all beings should keep her in their hearts always.

THE PROMISE TO WOMEN

"If a woman wants a son,
And she honors and makes offerings to Avalokiteśvara,
She gonna give birth to a son full of virtue and wisdom.

If she wants a daughter,
She gonna give birth to a daughter beautiful and well-formed,
Who planted good roots in past lives,
Who everyone loves and respects.

"Inexhaustible Intention, Observer of Sounds got power like this.
If beings honor and bow to her with reverence,
Their blessings ain't wasted.
Not one bit goes for nothing.
That's why all beings should uphold the name of Avalokiteśvara.

THE COMPARISON

"Inexhaustible Intention, suppose someone upholds the names of sixty-two billion Bodhisattvas -
That's as many as the sands of sixty-two billion Ganges Rivers -
And they spend their whole life making offerings:
Food and drink, clothing, bedding, medicine.
What you think? That person's merit - is it great or not?"

Inexhaustible Intention said: "Very great, World-Honored One."

The Buddha said: "But if someone else just upholds the name of Avalokiteśvara,
Even just bows and makes offerings one single time,
These two people's blessings are EXACTLY EQUAL.
No different at all.
And that merit can't be exhausted in hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of eons.

"Inexhaustible Intention, upholding the name of Observer of Sounds -
You receive blessings and benefits immeasurable, without boundaries."

SHE COMES IN WHATEVER FORM YOU NEED

Inexhaustible Intention asked the Buddha:
"World-Honored One, how does Avalokiteśvara travel through this suffering world?
How does she teach the Dharma to beings?
How does her skillful power work?"

The Buddha told Inexhaustible Intention:

"Good brother, listen now to how she manifests:

If beings in some land need a Buddha to free them,
She appears as a Buddha and teaches.

If they need a solitary realizer to free them,
She appears as a solitary realizer and teaches.

If they need a disciple of the voice to free them,
She appears in that body and teaches.

If they need the god Brahma to free them,
She appears as Brahma and teaches.

If they need the god Indra,
She appears as Indra and teaches.

If they need a heavenly general,
She appears as a heavenly general and teaches.

If they need a guardian king,
She appears as a guardian king and teaches.

If they need an elder,
She appears as an elder and teaches.

If they need a householder,
She appears as a householder and teaches.

If they need a government official,
She appears as an official and teaches.

If they need a brahmin priest,
She appears as a priest and teaches.

If they need a monk, a nun, a layman, or a laywoman,
She appears in those bodies and teaches.

If they need the wife of an elder, householder, official, or brahmin,
She appears as a woman and teaches.

If they need a young boy or girl,
She appears as a child and teaches.

If they need a god, dragon, yaksha, gandharva, asura, garuda, kinnara, mahoraga,
Human or non-human being,
She appears in all those forms and teaches.

If they need a vajra-wielding guardian spirit,
She appears as that and teaches.

"Inexhaustible Intention, this Observer of Sounds accomplished merit like this.
She travels through all lands in various forms,
Liberating beings everywhere.

"That's why you all should wholeheartedly honor and make offerings to Avalokiteśvara.

"This Great Bodhisattva Observer of Sounds -
In times of fear and danger and emergency,
She gives the gift of fearlessness.

"That's why in this suffering world,
Everyone calls her the Giver of Fearlessness."

THE GIFT REFUSED, THE GIFT ACCEPTED

Inexhaustible Intention said to the Buddha:
"World-Honored One, I want to make an offering to Avalokiteśvara right now."

He took off the precious jeweled necklace from around his neck -
Worth hundreds of thousands of ounces of gold -
And offered it to her, saying:
"Compassionate one, receive this Dharma gift, this precious necklace."

But Observer of Sounds wouldn't take it.

So Inexhaustible Intention said again:
"Compassionate one, out of pity for us, receive this necklace."

Then the Buddha told Avalokiteśvara:
"You should have compassion for this Inexhaustible Intention,
And for the four assemblies,
And for the gods, dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas,
For humans and non-humans.
For their sake, receive this necklace."

Right then, out of compassion for all those beings,
Avalokiteśvara received the necklace.
She divided it into two parts:
One part she offered to Śākyamuni Buddha,
One part she offered to the stupa of Many Treasures Buddha.

"Inexhaustible Intention, Observer of Sounds has sovereign spiritual power like this.
This is how she travels through the suffering world."

THE HYMN - THE TESTIMONY - THE CALL AND RESPONSE

Then Inexhaustible Intention asked in verse:

THE TESTIMONY

Right then, Earth-Holding Bodhisattva stood up from his seat,
Came forward and said to the Buddha:

"World-Honored One, if beings hear this chapter about Avalokiteśvara -
About her sovereign works,
About her universal door manifesting spiritual powers -
Know that such a person's merit ain't small."

When the Buddha taught this Universal Door chapter,
Eighty-four thousand beings in the assembly
All raised the mind of supreme perfect enlightenment -
The anuttara-samyak-sambodhi heart.
