THE BUDDHA SPEAKS TO CONSTANT EXERTION

Right then, the Buddha turned to Constant-Exertion Bodhisattva and said:

"Listen here now. If there's a good man or a good woman who holds this Lotus Sutra—I mean really holds it, reads it out loud, recites it, explains it to folks, or writes it down with their own hand—

That person gonna get EIGHT HUNDRED eye-merits.

They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED ear-merits.

They gonna get EIGHT HUNDRED nose-merits.

They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED tongue-merits.

They gonna get EIGHT HUNDRED body-merits.

They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED mind-merits.

And all these merits gonna PURIFY their six senses—gonna make them clean and clear and new.

Now this good person—their eyes, just the plain eyes their mama and daddy gave them, their regular flesh-and-blood eyes—they gonna see clear through the whole three-thousand-world system:

All the mountains inside and mountains outside,
All the forests, all the rivers, all the seas,
Down to the deepest hell (that's Avīci, the pit of no-interval suffering),
Up to the highest heaven (that's the Peak of Existence, where being goes as far as being goes).

And they gonna see all the beings in between.

They gonna see the karma that brought folks here.
They gonna see the causes and the effects.
They gonna see where beings gonna be born next and why.

They gonna see EVERYTHING. Know EVERYTHING.

All with the regular eyes they was born with."

VERSE: SEEING WITH NEW EYES

Then the World-Honored One wanted to say it again in verse, so he spoke:

*If in a great assembly,*
*With a heart that ain't afraid,*
*You speak this Lotus Sutra—*
*Listen to the merit you done made.*

*That person gets eight hundred*
*Superior merits for the eye,*
*And with this decoration,*
*Their vision's purified.*

*With the eyes their parents gave them,*
*They see the whole three-thousand sphere—*
*The inner and the outer mountains,*
*Mount Sumeru standing clear,*

*The Iron Ring and all the rest,*
*The forests and the mountain wood,*
*The oceans and the flowing rivers,*
*Down to where the hell-fires burn for good,*

*Up to the Peak of Existence,*
*The highest place a being goes—*
*All creatures living in between,*
*Everything there is, they knows.*

*Though they ain't got the heavenly eye yet,*
*Their flesh-eye power's just like this—*
*Seeing clear through everything,*
*Nothing that their vision gonna miss.*

EARS THAT HEAR EVERYTHING

"Now listen, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down—

They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED ear-merits.

And with those purified ears, they gonna hear EVERY SOUND in the whole three-thousand-world system:

Down to Avīci hell, up to the Peak of Existence, inside and outside, every kind of sound and voice—

Elephant sounds, horse sounds, ox sounds, chariot sounds.

Crying sounds and grieving sounds and sighing sounds.

Conch-shell sounds, drum sounds, bell sounds, chime sounds.

Laughing sounds and talking sounds.

Male voices, female voices, boy voices, girl voices.

Dharma sounds (that's truth-speaking).
Non-dharma sounds (that's lie-speaking).

Suffering sounds, pleasure sounds.

Common folks' sounds, holy people sounds.

Joy sounds, sorrow sounds.

Heaven sounds.
Dragon sounds.
Night-demon (yakṣa) sounds.
Gandharva sounds (that's the music-spirits).
Asura sounds (that's the fighting-titans).
Garuda sounds (that's the great birds).
Kiṃnara sounds (that's the song-spirits).
Mahoraga sounds (that's the great serpents).

Fire crackling. Water rushing. Wind blowing.

Hell-screams. Animal cries. Hungry-ghost moaning.

Monks chanting. Nuns reciting.

Śrāvaka voices (that's the hearers).
Pratyekabuddha voices (that's the solitary realizers).
Bodhisattva voices.
Buddha voices.

To sum it up quick: EVERY SOUND in the three-thousand-world system—every sound inside and every sound outside—

Even though they ain't got the heavenly ear yet, just with the regular ears their mama and daddy gave them, the clean natural ears they was born with—

They hear it ALL.

They can tell one sound from another.
They understand what everything means.

And their ears don't break. Don't get damaged. Don't go deaf from all that listening.

That's what holding this sutra does."

VERSE: HEARING ALL THE VOICES

Then the World-Honored One spoke in verse:

*With the ears their parents gave them,*
*Clean and pure without no stain,*
*With these ordinary, common ears,*
*They hear the three-thousand-world domain.*

*Elephant, horse, carriage, cattle,*
*Bell and chime and conch and drum,*
*Zither, harp and lute sounds,*
*Flute and pipe—when music come,*

*Pure and lovely singing voices—*
*They listen but don't get attached.*
*Countless kinds of human speaking,*
*They hear and understand the batch.*

*And they hear the heaven-voices,*
*Subtle music, wondrous song,*
*Male and female speaking,*
*Boy and girl voices going strong.*

*In mountain canyons, dangerous valleys,*
*The kalavinka bird that sings,*
*The jīvaṃjīvaka and others—*
*They hear all these feathered things.*

*In the hells where beings suffer,*
*All the tortured, painful cries,*
*Hungry ghosts pressed by thirst and hunger,*
*Seeking food with desperate sighs,*

*The asuras and their families*
*Living by the great sea-shore,*
*When they speaking to each other,*
*Making voices loud that roar—*

*The dharma-speaker sitting here*
*Safe and settled in this place,*
*Can hear all these distant sounds*
*Without their ears losing grace.*

*In the ten-direction world systems,*
*Where birds and beasts call out their name,*
*The dharma-speaking person*
*Hears every creature all the same.*

*In the Brahma Heaven high above,*
*The Light-Sound and All-Pure sphere,*
*Up to the Peak of Existence,*
*Every word they speaking there—*

*The dharma teacher dwelling here*
*Can hear it all, can hear it true.*
*All the monks in assembly,*
*All the nuns reciting too—*

*Whether reading from the scriptures,*
*Whether teaching to the crowd—*
*The dharma teacher right here*
*Hears every word they speak out loud.*

*And all the Bodhisattvas*
*Reading sutras, studying dharma deep,*
*Teaching others, writing commentaries,*
*Explaining meanings—not one peep*

*Goes unheard by this dharma teacher.*
*The Buddhas—those Great Holy Ones—*
*Teaching beings, guiding creatures,*
*In great assemblies, every one,*

*Speaking subtle, wondrous teachings—*
*The one who holds this Lotus here*
*Hears every single dharma,*
*Every Buddha-word comes clear.*

*In the three-thousand-world system,*
*Every sound outside and in,*
*Down to Avīci suffering,*
*Up to where the heavens begin—*

*They hear every voice and sound*
*Without their hearing getting broke.*
*Their ears are sharp and sensitive,*
*Can tell apart each kind of folk.*

*The one who holds this Lotus Sutra,*
*Though they ain't got the heavenly ear,*
*Just using what they born with—*
*The merit's already right here.*

NOSE THAT SMELLS EVERYTHING

"Now again, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down—

They gonna complete EIGHT HUNDRED nose-merits.

And with that purified nose-root, they gonna smell EVERY SCENT in the three-thousand-world system—up and down, inside and outside, every kind of fragrance:

Sumana flower scent (that's jasmine).
Jāti flower scent (that's champak).
Mallikā flower scent (that's Arabian jasmine).
Campaka flower scent.
Pāṭala flower scent.

Red lotus scent. Blue lotus scent. White lotus scent.

Flowering tree scent. Fruit tree scent.

Sandalwood scent.
Agarwood scent (that's aloeswood).
Tamālapatra scent.
Tagara scent.

A thousand, ten-thousand kinds of mixed incense—
Whether powder incense, whether pellet incense, whether smearing incense—

The person holding this sutra, sitting right here in this spot, can tell them all apart.

And they can smell beings too:

Elephant scent, horse scent, ox scent, sheep scent.
Man scent, woman scent, boy scent, girl scent.

The smell of grass and trees and thickets and forests—whether near or whether far—all the scents that are, they smell them. Separate them out. Don't get it wrong.

The person holding this sutra, though they living right here, they also smell the heaven-scents:

The Pārijātaka tree scent (that's the coral tree).
The Kovidāra tree scent.
Mandārava flower scent.
Mahā-mandārava flower scent.
Mañjūṣaka flower scent.
Mahā-mañjūṣaka flower scent.
Sandalwood, agarwood, all kinds of powder incense,
All kinds of flower incense mixing together—

Heaven-incense combined in its fragrance—they know it, they don't miss nothing.

And they smell the bodies of the heaven-beings:

Indra (that's Śakra, the king of the gods) sitting in his Victory Hall, enjoying the five pleasures, playing around—they smell that.

When he in the Wonderful Dharma Hall teaching the Thirty-Three Gods—they smell that.

When he playing in the celestial gardens—they smell that.

All the other gods, male and female—they smell all their body-scents too.

And it keeps going up, turning and rising, all the way to the Brahma realm, up to the Peak of Existence—

All the heaven-beings' body-scents, they smell them all.

And they smell the incense the heaven-folk are burning too.

And they smell the śrāvakas' scent.
The pratyekabuddhas' scent.
The Bodhisattvas' scent.
The Buddhas' body-scent.

They smell it all from far away. They know exactly where each one is.

And even though they smelling all this, their nose don't get damaged. Don't get broke. Don't get confused.

If they want to tell somebody else, want to explain what they smelling—they remember it perfect. Don't get it wrong."

VERSE: SMELLING THE WHOLE WORLD

Then the World-Honored One spoke in verse:

*Whether fragrance, whether stinking,*
*Every kind of smell there is,*

*Heaven-gardens, splendid halls,*
*Fine pavilions, dharma towers standing tall,*
*Where beings sport and take their pleasure—*
*By smell they know it all.*

*When heavenly beings listening to dharma,*

*All the monks in assembly,*
*Always pressing on in dharma-work,*

*The sutra-holder, by the fragrance,*
*Knows exactly their location.*

*Bodhisattvas, firm in purpose,*
*Sitting in meditation, reading texts, or when*
*They teaching dharma to the people—*

TONGUE THAT TASTES HEAVEN

"Now again, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down—

They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED tongue-merits.

Whether it's good stuff or bad stuff, whether it's beautiful or whether it's ugly, whether it's delicious or whether it ain't—all the bitter and sour things—

When they touch that person's tongue-root, it ALL TURNS INTO SUPREME FLAVOR.

It tastes like heaven-nectar. Ain't nothing that don't taste good.

And if they use their tongue to speak in a great assembly, they gonna bring forth a DEEP AND SUBTLE VOICE that enters people's hearts. Makes everybody joyful and delighted.

And the heaven-sons and heaven-daughters—Indra, Brahmā, all the heaven-folk—when they hear this deep, subtle sound-voice speaking and teaching with its orderly words, they ALL COME TO LISTEN.

And the dragons and dragon-daughters,
The yakṣas and yakṣa-daughters,
The gandharvas and gandharva-daughters,
The asuras and asura-daughters,
The garuḍas and garuḍa-daughters,
The kiṃnaras and kiṃnara-daughters,
The mahoragas and mahoraga-daughters—

They all come near to listen to the dharma. Come close. Show respect. Make offerings.

And the monks, the nuns, the laymen, the laywomen.

Kings, princes, ministers, retinues.

Small wheel-turning kings, great wheel-turning kings, their seven treasures and thousand sons, inner and outer attendants—

They all ride up in their palace-carriages and come together to listen to the dharma.

Why? Because this Bodhisattva speaks the dharma WELL.

Brahmins, householders, people of the nation—all their life long, they stay close and make offerings.

And the śrāvakas, the pratyekabuddhas, the Bodhisattvas, the Buddhas—they always happy to see this person.

Wherever this person is, the Buddhas turn toward that direction to teach dharma.

They able to receive and hold ALL the Buddha-dharma.

And they able to bring forth the DEEP, SUBTLE DHARMA-SOUND."

VERSE: SPEAKING WITH POWER

Then the World-Honored One spoke in verse:

*This person's tongue-root purified—*
*Never tastes no evil thing.*
*Whatever food they eating,*
*It all turns sweet, everything.*

*With deep, pure, subtle voice,*
*They preach the dharma to the crowd,*
*Using causes and conditions,*
*Using parables and metaphors told loud,*

*To guide the beings' hearts along.*
*All who hear become so glad,*
*They set out the best of offerings—*
*Give the finest gifts they ever had.*

*The heaven-folk—dragons, yakṣas,*
*Asuras and all the rest—*
*All with reverent, respectful hearts,*
*Come together as the blessed guest.*

*This dharma-speaking person—*
*If they want to, with sublime sound,*
*Fill up the three-thousand-world system—*
*Soon as they wish it, it resound.*

*Great and small wheel-turning kings,*
*Their thousand sons, their retinue complete,*
*With palms pressed together, reverent hearts,*
*Always coming to receive the teaching sweet.*

*Heaven-folk and dragons, yakṣas,*
*Rākṣasas and piśācas too,*
*Also with delighted hearts,*
*Always happy to make offerings new.*

*Brahmā the king, the Māra king,*
*Freedom Lord and Great Freedom one—*
*All these heaven-multitudes*
*Always coming where this teacher's throne.*

*All the Buddhas and disciples,*
*Hearing this one's dharma-sound,*
*Always mindful, always guarding,*
*Sometimes showing their form around.*

BODY LIKE CRYSTAL MIRROR

"Now again, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down—

They gonna get EIGHT HUNDRED body-merits.

They gonna get a PURE BODY—pure like clean lapis lazuli, like crystal glass.

Beings gonna LOVE to see a body like that.

And because their body so pure, the whole three-thousand-world system gonna show up in it:

When beings are born, when beings die,
Whether they born in good places or bad places,
Whether they high-quality or low-quality—

It all appears in that body.

And the Iron Ring Mountain, the Great Iron Ring Mountain, Mount Meru, Mahā-Meru Mountain, all the various mountains, and all the beings living in them—

They all appear in that body.

Down to Avīci hell, up to the Peak of Existence, all the places and all the beings—

They all appear in that body.

When the śrāvakas, the pratyekabuddhas, the Bodhisattvas, the Buddhas are teaching dharma—

They all appear in that body, showing their form and features."

VERSE: THE MIRROR-BODY

Then the World-Honored One spoke in verse:

*If you hold the Lotus Sutra,*
*Your body becomes extremely pure—*
*Like that clean lapis lazuli—*
*Beings love to see for sure.*

*And like a bright, clean mirror*
*Reflecting every form that's there,*
*The Bodhisattva in their pure body*
*Sees everything the world can bear—*

*Only they understand it clearly,*
*Other folks can't see the same.*
*In the three-thousand-world system,*
*Every single living being's frame—*

*Heaven-folk and asuras,*
*Hell-dwellers, ghosts, and beasts that roam—*
*All these various forms and figures*
*Appear within that body-home.*

*All the heaven-palace dwellings,*
*Up to the Peak of Existence high,*
*The Iron Ring and Mount Meru,*
*Mahā-Meru reaching to the sky,*

*All the great sea-waters—*
*They all appear within that frame.*
*Buddhas and the śrāvaka-hearers,*
*Buddha-children, Bodhisattvas came—*

*Whether solitary, whether in assembly,*
*Teaching dharma—it all shows clear.*
*Though they ain't yet got the no-outflow*
*Dharma-nature wondrous body here,*

*With their pure and natural body,*
*Everything appears inside—*
*The whole creation in the mirror,*
*Nothing missing, nothing hide.*

MIND THAT UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING

"Now again, Constant-Exertion. If a good man or a good woman—after the Tathāgata's extinction—holds this sutra, reads it, recites it, explains it, writes it down—

They gonna get TWELVE HUNDRED mind-merits.

And with that purified mind-root, if they hear just ONE VERSE, just ONE SENTENCE—they gonna penetrate INFINITE, LIMITLESS meanings.

Once they understand these meanings, they able to speak on that one sentence, that one verse, for a month, for four months, even for a whole year.

And all the dharma they speak gonna accord with TRUE REALITY—ain't gonna contradict it.

If they speaking about worldly scriptures and books, about governing-the-world language, about making-a-living business matters—it's ALL gonna accord with the right dharma.

And the six-realm beings in the three-thousand-world system—whatever those beings are thinking in their minds, whatever their minds are doing, whatever their minds are playing around with—

This person KNOWS IT ALL.

Even though they ain't yet got the no-outflow wisdom, their mind-root is PURE LIKE THIS.

Whatever this person thinks about, whatever they calculate, whatever they say—

It's ALL Buddha-dharma. Ain't none of it not true.

It's also what the previous Buddhas taught in their sutras."

VERSE: THE LUMINOUS MIND

Then the World-Honored One spoke in verse:

*This person's mind is purified,*
*Bright and sharp, without no stain.*
*With this wondrous mind-faculty,*
*They know the high and low and middle plain.*

*Hearing just a single verse,*
*They penetrate unlimited meaning-doors,*
*Then teach it step by step, according to the dharma—*
*One month, four months, even a year and more.*

*Inside this world and outside,*
*Every single being here—*
*Whether heaven-folk or dragons, whether human,*
*Yakṣas, ghosts, and spirits clear—*

*Those dwelling in the six life-courses,*
*All their countless thought-varieties—*
*As reward for holding the Lotus,*
*All at once they know these with ease.*

*The countless Buddhas in ten directions,*
*Adorned with hundred blessings, every mark,*
*Teaching dharma to the beings—*
*They hear it all and hold it in their heart.*

*Contemplating countless meanings,*
*Speaking dharma also without measure,*
*From beginning to the end, not forgetting, not mistaken—*
*This comes from holding Lotus treasure.*

*They know the characteristics of all dharmas,*
*Following the meaning, understanding sequence right,*
*Reaching into names and words and language—*
*Teaching just as they know it, bringing light.*

*Whatever this person speaks*
*Is all the dharma previous Buddhas taught.*
*And because they teach this dharma,*
*Before assemblies they ain't fraught.*

*The one who holds the Lotus Sutra—*
*Their mind-root pure exactly thus.*
*Though they ain't yet got no-outflow,*
*They got these marks already with us.*

*This person holding this sutra*
*Dwells securely in a rare place, blessed—*
*By all the beings*
*They joyfully loved and caressed.*

*Able to use a thousand, ten-thousand kinds*
*Of skillful language manifold,*
*Distinguishing and teaching dharma—*
*This comes from holding Lotus, truth be told.*
