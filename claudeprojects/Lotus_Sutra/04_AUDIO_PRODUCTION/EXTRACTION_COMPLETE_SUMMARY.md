## NOTABLE FINDINGS

### Chapter 1 Voice Tag Sparsity
Chapter 1 contains only 3 voice tags (all [Puck] for Mañjuśrī dialogue). This is **correct and accurate** - Chapter 1 is primarily cosmic narrative description without extensive character dialogue.

### Buddha's Voice Distribution
The Buddha is voiced by THREE different speakers based on context:
- **[Iapetus]** (60 uses): Contemplative teaching, doctrinal explanation
- **[Rasalgethi]** (52 uses): Storytelling, narrative parables
- **[Triton]** (2 uses): Elevated poetic verses

This multi-voice approach reflects the Buddha's different teaching modes.

### Female Character Concentration
Female voices appear most prominently in:
- **Chapter 25** (15 [Sulafat] tags): Avalokiteśvara's chapter
- **Chapter 13** (4 [Leda] tags): Female Assembly participation
- **Chapter 12** (2 [Lyra] tags): Dragon Princess enlightenment scene

### Parable Chapters
Special parable narrator voices appear in:
- **Chapter 3** ([Jove]): The Elder in the Burning House
- **Chapter 7** ([Sadaltager]): The Guide in the Phantom City

## COMPARISON WITH EXPECTED 553 TAGS

The CHARACTER_VOICE_MAPPING_FINAL.txt mentions ~553 total tags. Our extraction shows 344 in chapters.

**Explanation:**

| Section | Voice Tags |
|---------|------------|
| Front matter (lines 1-261) | 5 |
| **Chapters 1-28 (lines 262-14156)** | **344** ✓ **EXTRACTED** |
| Back matter (lines 14157-15593) | 183 |
| **Total in master file** | **532** |

The 553 count may have included pronunciation guide tags like `[Shah-ree-POO-trah]` which are NOT voice assignments but phonetic guides.

Our extraction correctly captured **all 344 narrative voice tags** from the 28 chapters proper.
