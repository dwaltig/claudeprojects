The Diamond Sutra Reborn: An American Blues Interpretation
Description for book:
The Diamond Sutra is the Buddha's most radical teaching—a mind-bending dialogue that cuts through every concept you've ever held about reality, self, and enlightenment. For 1,500 years, it has been chanted, studied, and wrestled with by seekers who sense that something profound waits on the other side of its impossible logic.

This interpretation brings the Diamond Sutra into the American Blues tradition. The teaching that "all phenomena are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow" finds new power when spoken in the language of hard-won wisdom, midnight crossroads, and the music that knows suffering from the inside.

The Buddha didn't offer philosophy here—he offered a diamond blade to cut through delusion. This version lets that blade swing.

All 32 chapters. No concepts to cling to. Just the cutting edge of emptiness, delivered in the rhythm of the Blues.

If you're ready to let go of what you think you know, you're standing at the right door.
