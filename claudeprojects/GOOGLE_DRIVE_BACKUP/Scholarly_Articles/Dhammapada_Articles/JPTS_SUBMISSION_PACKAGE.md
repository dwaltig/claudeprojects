## Cover Letter

**To:** The Editors, Journal of the Pali Text Society
**From:** William Altig
**Date:** December 10, 2025
**Re:** Manuscript Submission – "The Missing Nibbānavagga: Evidence for a 28-Chapter Dhammapada"

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit the attached manuscript, "The Missing Nibbānavagga: Evidence for a 28-Chapter Dhammapada," for consideration in the Journal of the Pali Text Society.

This article presents original research proposing that the Pali Dhammapada originally contained twenty-eight chapters before two chapters—a Nibbānavagga (on liberation) and a Tathāgatavagga (on the Buddha's teaching)—were merged into adjacent chapters during oral transmission. The evidence includes:

1. **Structural anomaly:** Chapter 26 (Brāhmaṇavagga) contains 41 verses—2.5 times the average chapter length—representing a statistical outlier of 3.6 standard deviations.

2. **Thematic seams:** Verse-by-verse analysis reveals two clear breaks in the Brāhmaṇavagga where Nibbāna-focused material appears joined to brahmin-definition content.

3. **Comparative support:** The Sanskrit Udānavarga preserves both a Nirvāṇavarga and Tathāgatavarga as distinct chapters.

4. **Precedent:** The Lotus Sutra's Chapter 12 (Devadatta) was similarly embedded in Chapter 11 in earlier recensions.

The manuscript contributes to the understudied dimension of chapter formation in Buddhist textual transmission and invites reconsideration of how the Dhammapada achieved its canonical structure.

The manuscript is approximately 5,000 words and has not been submitted elsewhere. I confirm that this is original work and that all authors (myself alone) consent to submission.

I believe this article falls within the JPTS's scope of interest in "the history of Pali literature, textual transmission, manuscripts, and the Pali language" and "the relationship of Pali texts to those in other languages."

Thank you for considering this submission. I look forward to your response.

Respectfully submitted,

William Altig
