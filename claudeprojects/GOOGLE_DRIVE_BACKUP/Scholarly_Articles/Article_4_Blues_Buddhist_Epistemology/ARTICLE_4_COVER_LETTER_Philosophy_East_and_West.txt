Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit my manuscript titled "The Blues as Buddhist Epistemology: How African-American Musical Tradition and Mahayana Buddhist Philosophy Address Suffering and Liberation" for consideration in Philosophy East and West.

This article argues that African-American blues tradition and Mahayana Buddhist philosophy share a fundamental epistemological foundation—a shared way of knowing rooted in unflinching recognition of human suffering and communal liberation. While these traditions have been studied separately in the Western academy, this essay demonstrates that they represent parallel wisdom traditions addressing identical existential questions through direct experience, embodied practice, and communal engagement.

The manuscript makes three primary contributions to comparative philosophy:

First, it establishes that blues and Buddhism share not merely similar themes but an identical epistemological method: both traditions privilege direct, embodied encounter with suffering as a valid path to wisdom. Both refuse the comfort of denial and insist that joy must be earned through honesty.

Second, it provides historical precedent through analysis of blues artists including B.B. King, Billie Holiday, Robert Johnson, Etta James, Bessie Smith, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Aretha Franklin, demonstrating that blues musicians have been articulating Buddhist philosophy for over a century. This recognition enriches both traditions through dialogue and opens possibilities for Buddhist practice in the African diaspora.

Third, it argues that vernacular translation of Buddhist scripture—specifically, translating into blues language—is not a departure from authentic dharma but rather a revelation of philosophical connections that have always existed. The article includes a concrete side-by-side comparison of the Burning House Parable in both formal English and blues renderings, demonstrating how meaning is preserved while accessibility transforms.

The manuscript connects Asian Buddhist philosophy to African-American spiritual wisdom traditions, making it directly relevant to Philosophy East and West's focus on comparative philosophy and the contemporary relevance of philosophical traditions across civilizations.

The manuscript is approximately 7,000 words, double-spaced, and follows Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition. It has not been previously published and is not under consideration elsewhere. Per journal requirements, the manuscript itself contains no identifying author information.

I would be delighted to provide any additional materials the review process requires. Thank you for considering this submission.

Sincerely,
