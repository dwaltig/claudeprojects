Dear Tricycle Editorial Team,

I'm submitting "The Blues Has Been Teaching Dharma All Along: Recognizing African-American Wisdom in Buddhist Practice," a 3,800-word feature essay exploring the profound connections between blues music and Buddhist teaching.

This essay speaks directly to Tricycle's mission of exploring "Buddhism, culture, and the engaged life." As Buddhism continues to grow in Western culture, it remains predominantly white and Asian. Meanwhile, African-American communities—through blues, gospel, and folk wisdom—have been developing sophisticated responses to suffering that go largely unrecognized as philosophical and spiritual systems. This essay bridges that gap by showing how blues musicians have been teaching dharma for generations.

The piece offers both intellectual depth and personal narrative. I write not as a detached scholar but as a practitioner who has spent over forty years with the Lotus Sutra and a lifetime with blues and gospel music. My decade-long project of translating the Lotus Sutra into blues language revealed what had been true all along: these aren't separate traditions but expressions of the same wisdom.

The essay will resonate with Tricycle's readers who:
- Are interested in Buddhism's relationship to race and cultural accessibility
- Want to deepen their understanding of dharma's universality
- Seek authentic integration of Buddhist practice with other wisdom traditions
- Care about engaged Buddhism and community-based liberation

The article includes concrete examples of blues lyrics articulating Buddhist teachings (impermanence, karma, non-self, community), a side-by-side translation comparison showing how the Lotus Sutra comes alive in blues language, and practical implications for contemporary Buddhist practice.

This piece has not been published elsewhere and is not under simultaneous consideration with other publications.

I believe this work makes a timely contribution to conversations about diversity in American Buddhism, the universality of dharma teaching, and the recognition of African-American spiritual wisdom as serious philosophy.

Thank you for considering this submission. I'm happy to provide additional materials, make revisions, or discuss the piece further.

Best regards,
