## Cover Letter

**To:** Editorial Board, Digital Humanities Quarterly  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Article Title:** Voice, Persona, and Sacred Text: TTS Rendering of Buddhist Sutras

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit "Voice, Persona, and Sacred Text: TTS Rendering of Buddhist Sutras" for consideration by Digital Humanities Quarterly to meet the January 15, 2025 quarterly deadline.

This article presents the first documented methodology for text-to-speech audio production of multi-speaker Buddhist sacred texts, addressing a significant gap at the intersection of digital humanities scholarship, multimodal textual studies, and accessible sacred text preservation.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Answers Patrik's 2007 Call**: Linda Patrik's DHQ article on "Encoding for Endangered Tibetan Texts" called for multimodal preservation linking audio to transcriptions. Seventeen years later, that call has been answered theoretically but not methodologically—until now.

2. **Three Methodological Innovations**:
   - Character-to-voice mapping (15 voices, 532 tags, narrative function-based assignment)
   - Verse optimization (20.6% average token reduction per passage)
   - Quality control procedures (git version control, encoding verification)

3. **Cost Democratization**: Estimated $300-1,000 production cost (93-99.5% reduction vs. professional narration at $3,600-100,000+), making Buddhist sutra audio economically feasible for small organizations.

4. **Replicable Framework**: Transferable to other character-driven sacred texts (Qur'an, Bhagavad Gita, Torah, Homeric epics).

The article includes explicit falsification conditions and acknowledges limitations (small listener sample n=5, prosodic trade-offs, platform dependency), demonstrating the epistemic rigor expected by DHQ readers.

**Word count:** ~7,200 words

I confirm this work is original scholarship not under review elsewhere. Two publication-quality figures accompany the article. I look forward to contributing to DHQ's ongoing conversations about multimodal preservation, sacred text scholarship, and accessible digital humanities.

Sincerely,

William Altig
