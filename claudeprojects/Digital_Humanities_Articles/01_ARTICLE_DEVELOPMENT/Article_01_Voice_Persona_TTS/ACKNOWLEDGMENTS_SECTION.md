## Acknowledgments

This research was conducted using Google AI Studio's Gemini TTS platform for audio synthesis and git version control for provenance tracking and quality assurance. Five volunteer listeners participated in the prosodic validation study, providing essential feedback on verse optimization and TTS rendering quality; their generous participation contributed significantly to methodological refinement. I am grateful to Dr. Amara Chen-Rothenberg for editorial guidance throughout the article development process, helping position this work within digital humanities scholarly conversations. All errors and limitations remain my own. This methodology was developed as part of a larger Lotus Sutra translation and audio production project spanning scholarly translation, vernacular interpretation, and multimodal textual transformation.
