Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit "Voice, Persona, and Sacred Text: TTS Rendering of Buddhist Sutras" for consideration by Digital Humanities Quarterly. This article presents the first documented methodology for text-to-speech audio production of multi-speaker Buddhist sacred texts, addressing a significant gap at the intersection of digital humanities scholarship, multimodal textual studies, and accessible sacred text preservation.

Buddhist sutras are inherently dialogic—recording exchanges between the Buddha, his disciples, and a narrator who bears witness—creating unique challenges for TTS rendering that require character differentiation across dozens of speakers while maintaining the reverence appropriate to sacred material. Through the empirical case study of producing a complete 28-chapter Lotus Sutra audiobook using Google Gemini TTS, this study develops and validates three core innovations: (1) character-to-voice mapping grounded in dharma role analysis (15 voices across 532 voice tags); (2) verse optimization achieving 70-75% API token reduction while preserving prosodic pacing; and (3) quality control procedures integrating git version control and encoding verification. The resulting methodology enables production of an 18-22 hour audiobook at $300-1,000 cost—representing 98-99% cost reduction compared to professional multi-voice narration ($50,000-100,000)—while maintaining scholarly accuracy and contemplative utility.

This work directly responds to Linda Patrik's 2007 DHQ article "Encoding for Endangered Tibetan Texts," which called for multimodal preservation linking audio to transcriptions to enable Buddhist texts to "live again in meditation practices and rituals." Seventeen years later, that call has been answered theoretically but not methodologically. This article provides the practical framework, empirically validated through full-scale production, that makes such preservation economically and technically feasible for Buddhist archives, universities, and accessibility initiatives.

The methodology is designed for replicability. The voice-mapping principles, verse optimization logic, and quality control procedures transfer to other character-driven sacred texts—the Qur'an, Torah, Bhagavad Gita, Homeric epics—advancing digital humanities scholarship on TTS rendering of pre-modern oral literature. The framework extends DHQ's existing conversations on multimodal textual studies while contributing practical tools to the DH community.

I confirm this work is original scholarship not under review elsewhere. Two publication-quality figures (voice distribution analysis, verse optimization comparison) and complete methodology documentation accompany the article. I would be honored to have this work contribute to Digital Humanities Quarterly's mission of advancing rigorous, innovative digital scholarship that speaks to both specialists and the broader DH community.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to DHQ's ongoing conversations about multimodal preservation, sacred text scholarship, and accessible digital humanities.

Sincerely,

William Altig
