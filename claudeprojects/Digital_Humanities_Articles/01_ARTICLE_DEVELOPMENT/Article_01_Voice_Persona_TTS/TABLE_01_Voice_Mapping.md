## Table 1: Voice Mapping Distribution

## Distribution by Dharma Role Category

| Dharma Role | Voices | Tags | % of Total | Characters Included |
|-------------|--------|------|------------|---------------------|
| **Narrator** | Charon | 211 | 39.7% | Ānanda (sutra recorder/framing voice) |
| **Disciples** | Orus, Orion, Puck, Vulcan | 147 | 27.6% | Śāriputra, Mahākāśyapa, supporting disciples |
| **Buddha** | Iapetus, Rasalgethi, Triton | 116 | 21.8% | Buddha in three teaching modes |
| **Bodhisattvas** | Sulafat, Zubenelgenubi, Lyra, Aoede | 47 | 8.8% | Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Maitreya, others |
| **Parables** | Jove, Sadaltager, Leda | 15 | 2.8% | Rich man, physician, sons, daughters in teaching stories |

## Gender Alignment

| Gender | Voices | Tags | % | Rationale |
|--------|--------|------|---|-----------|
| **Male** | 12 voices | 507 | 95.3% | Reflects historical demographics of 5th-century Buddhist assemblies |
| **Female** | 3 voices | 25 | 4.7% | Sulafat (25), Leda (4), Lyra (2), Aoede (1) |

**Note**: Low female percentage reflects traditional Buddhist sutra character demographics (predominantly male monastic assembly). Gender alignment principle preserves historical accuracy while raising questions about representation in digital Buddhist projects (addressed in Discussion section).

## Buddha Voice Variation Analysis

The decision to employ three distinct voices for the Buddha represents this methodology's most significant interpretive move:

| Buddha Voice | Context/Mode | Tags | % of Buddha Tags | % of Total | Deployment Rationale |
|--------------|--------------|------|------------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Iapetus** | Authoritative Doctrinal Teaching | 60 | 51.7% | 11.3% | Primary teaching voice; doctrinal precision and clarity |
| **Rasalgethi** | Gentle Compassionate Guidance | 54 | 46.6% | 10.2% | Encouraging, supportive teaching; emotional warmth |
| **Triton** | Cosmic Revelation | 2 | 1.7% | 0.4% | Reserved for Chapter 16 eternal lifespan teaching only |

**Philosophical Justification**: Multi-voice Buddha embodies Mahayana teaching of *upāya-kauśalya* (skillful means)—the dharma adapts its voice to circumstance and listener capacity. This is TTS methodology as Buddhist philosophy in practice.

## Top 3 Voice Concentration

| Voice | Character | Tags | Cumulative % |
|-------|-----------|------|--------------|
| Charon | Narrator | 211 | 39.7% |
| Orus | Śāriputra | 132 | 64.5% |
| Iapetus | Buddha-Authoritative | 60 | 75.7% |

**Interpretation**: 75.7% concentration in top 3 voices reflects inherent sutra structure: narrator-driven framing + Buddha-disciple dialogue dominates. This pattern is likely replicable in other Mahayana sutras.

---

## Tag Density Analysis

**Overall density**: 532 tags ÷ 200,000 words = 1 tag per 376 words

**Chapter-level variation**:
- Chapter 2 (Skillful Means): 48 tags = 1 per ~580 words (dialogue-heavy)
- Chapter 1 (Introduction): 12 tags = 1 per ~1,400 words (narrator-heavy)

**Interpretation**: Tag density varies by chapter content (dialogue vs. narrative) rather than arbitrary consistency, demonstrating text-responsive methodology.

---

## Replicability Data

**For other projects to adapt this methodology**:

1. **Character inventory**: List all speaking characters across corpus
2. **Dharma role categorization**: Assign to categories (Narrator, Buddha, Disciples, Bodhisattvas, Parables, Other)
3. **Voice audition**: Test available TTS voices against character requirements
4. **Mapping rationale**: Document why each voice fits each character (characteristics + role)
5. **Tagging format**: Use `[VoiceName]: Dialogue text...` for API processing
6. **Verification**: Check all tags match mapping guide before production

### Major Speaking Characters (>10 tags)

| Character | Voice | Tags | Role in Lotus Sutra |
|-----------|-------|------|---------------------|
| Narrator (Ānanda) | Charon | 211 | Framing witness; "Thus have I heard..." |
| Śāriputra | Orus | 132 | Chief disciple; primary questioner |

All other voices (9 voices, 46 tags total) represent supporting disciples, parable figures, and rare speakers. These provide textural differentiation without overwhelming listener tracking capacity.
