## Dimension A: Belief Audit (Do Claims Pay Rent?)

### Original Score: 3.5/5 (B)
### Revised Score: **4.5/5 (A)**
### Improvement: **+1.0**

#### Strengths in Revision

**Floating beliefs removed:**
- ✓ "Reverence" removed from all claims (was never operationalized)
- ✓ "Dharma role" → "narrative function" (operational language)
- ✓ "Natural pacing" → "lexical fidelity and prosodic pacing" + evidence limitations acknowledged
- ✓ "Cosmic witness" → specific acoustic properties (85 Hz fundamental frequency)

**Falsification conditions added:**
- ✓ Appendix specifies 7 observable outcomes that would invalidate core claims
- ✓ Token reduction < 15% would mean optimization not worth effort
- ✓ Comprehension degradation vs. human narration would invalidate quality claims
- ✓ Community rejection (< 3/5 suitability) would invalidate contemplative use claims
- ✓ Character ID at chance level would invalidate voice-mapping value

**Testable predictions retained and strengthened:**
- ✓ 20.6% token reduction per passage (corrected from false 70-75% claim)
- ✓ $300-1,000 estimated cost (now explicitly labeled as estimate, not fact)
- ✓ 14-19 day timeline (verifiable through replication)
- ✓ 532 voice tags across 15 voices (countable, auditable)

#### Remaining Weaknesses

- Some interpretive language retained in Development section 1.4 ("earnestness," "gentleness") but appropriately framed as personal narrative of process, not objective claims
- "Intended to signal" language could be more direct ("I selected X to evoke Y")

#### Assessment

Article now generates **specific, testable predictions** for core empirical claims while removing unfalsifiable quality assertions. Falsification conditions demonstrate **exemplary epistemic practice**. Near-perfect score (4.5/5) reflects only minor opportunities for further clarity.

---

## Dimension B: Rationalization Detection (Bottom-Line vs. Top-Line)

### Original Score: 2.5/5 (C+)
### Revised Score: **4.0/5 (B+)**
### Improvement: **+1.5**

#### Evidence of Reduced Bottom-Line Reasoning

**Alternative hypotheses acknowledged:**
- ✓ Section 3.3: Voice mapping alternatives named (random assignment, different scholar, listener-driven)
- ✓ Section 3.4.1: Four competing hypotheses for why optimization works (strategic punctuation vs. reduced fragmentation vs. any paragraph formatting vs. social desirability bias)
- ✓ Section 5.2: Alternative Buddha voice approaches acknowledged (1 voice for consistency, more voices for variety)

**Evidence limitations acknowledged inline:**
- ✓ Section 3.4.1: n=5, qualitative, no blinding, no human narration comparison → "initial indication" not "validation"
- ✓ Section 4.2: "though the small sample size (n=5) and qualitative methodology limit the strength of this evidence"
- ✓ Section 5.4: "listener validation protocol did not assess whether TTS audio is perceived as appropriate for sacred/contemplative contexts"

**Realistic cost comparisons:**
- ✓ Section 1.2: Single narrator ($3,600-6,600) now prominently mentioned as realistic alternative, not just expensive multi-voice ($50,000-100,000)

**Bias acknowledgment retained:**
- ✓ "Look, I'm biased here—I spent two years on this project" (Section 1.4)
- ✓ "I conducted interviews knowing which samples were optimized" (Section 3.4.1)
- ✓ "I'm aware I'm evaluating my own work here" → expanded to detailed limitations

#### Remaining Pattern to Watch

- Cost comparison still emphasizes TTS advantages, but now includes realistic middle ground
- Author still argues for methodology but with appropriate hedging and acknowledged alternatives

#### Assessment

Article now **actively invites testing against alternatives** rather than presenting methodology as only principled approach. Shifted from confirmatory to **discriminatory evidence framing**. Excellent improvement demonstrating intellectual honesty.

## Dimension C: Word Hygiene (Tabooing Loaded Terms)

### Original Score: 2.0/5 (C)
### Revised Score: **4.0/5 (B+)**
### Improvement: **+2.0** (LARGEST GAIN)

#### Terms Successfully Tabooed or Operationalized

**"Reverence"** (Lines 15, 62, 140, 322-324, 386 in original):
- ✓ **REMOVED** from Abstract, research questions, methodology claims
- ✓ Shifted to community determination: "Whether TTS is appropriate for sacred material is a determination communities must make"
- ✓ Honest limit: "I cannot claim the audio I produced is 'reverent'... based on my limited evidence"

**"Dharma role"** → "Narrative function" (throughout):
- ✓ Consistent terminology change from mystical-sounding to operational language
- ✓ Section 3.3: Explains functions (narrator, questioner, teacher, witness) as structural positions
- ✓ Acknowledged subjective component: "my aesthetic judgment during voice auditioning, guided by character narrative roles"

**"Cosmic witness"** (Lines 31, 173, 314 in original):
- ✓ **REMOVED** from methodology and results
- ✓ Section 3.3: Replaced with measurable property "fundamental frequency ~85 Hz, significantly below average male voice range ~120 Hz"
- ✓ Changed "suggesting cosmic witness" to "intended to signal authoritative witness"

**"Natural pacing"** (Lines 194, 200, 262 in original):
- ✓ Removed "natural" (unevaluated subjective quality)
- ✓ Replaced with "lexical fidelity" (100% verifiable) + "prosodic pacing" (acknowledged without claiming "natural")
- ✓ Evidence limitations acknowledged inline

**"Embodies upāya"** (Lines 103-106, 173-174, 239, 312-313 in original):
- ✓ **REMOVED ENTIRELY** (category error)
- ✓ Section 5.2: Reframed as "author's interpretation" not objective property
- ✓ "Buddhist doctrine about pedagogical content adaptation does not specify audio production methodology"

#### Operational Definitions Added

**Voice characteristics** (Section 3.3):
- ✓ Charon: "deep baritone, fundamental frequency ~85 Hz"
- ✓ Iapetus: "mid-range ~110 Hz"
- ✓ Rasalgethi: "warm mid-range ~100 Hz"
- ✓ Triton: "deeper baritone ~90 Hz"

**Falsification thresholds** (Appendix):
- ✓ Token reduction < 15%
- ✓ Community suitability rating < 3 on 5-point scale
- ✓ Character ID accuracy ≈ 25% (chance level)
- ✓ Cost > $5,000 for 20-hour audiobook

#### Remaining Opportunities

- Could provide even more acoustic detail (timbre descriptors, prosodic measurements)
- "Intended to signal" could be more direct: "I selected X because I associate it with Y"

#### Assessment

**Dramatic improvement.** Removed all semantic stopsigns and curiosity-stoppers. Provided operational definitions where retained. Honest about subjective components. This is **excellent word hygiene** approaching exemplary practice.

---

## Dimension D: Evidence Quality (Can It Discriminate?)

### Original Score: 3.0/5 (B-)
### Revised Score: **4.0/5 (B+)**
### Improvement: **+1.0**

#### Strong Discriminating Evidence (Retained from Original)

**Token reduction** (Table 1):
- ✓ Before/after counts for 5 passages
- ✓ 20.6% average reduction
- ✓ Falsifiable: replication can verify/refute
- ✓ **CORRECTED**: Retracted false 70-75% project-wide claim

**Voice tag distribution** (Section 4.1):
- ✓ 532 tags, 15 voices, specific counts
- ✓ Auditable from tagged files
- ✓ Objective measurement

**Quality control outcomes** (Section 4.4):
- ✓ Zero critical errors, 28/28 chapters verified, 47 git commits
- ✓ Verifiable from git history

#### Evidence Limitations Acknowledged

**Listener validation** (Section 3.4.1):
- ✓ **NEW**: Limitations section naming 4 competing hypotheses
- ✓ **NEW**: "cannot discriminate between competing hypotheses"
- ✓ **NEW**: No blinding acknowledged ("I conducted interviews knowing...")
- ✓ **NEW**: "initial indication of listener acceptability rather than validation of specific prosodic claims"
- ✓ Downgraded from "confirmed" to "provides initial evidence"

**70-75% token reduction**:
- ✓ **EXPLICIT RETRACTION**: "An earlier draft of this article claimed '70-75% token reduction' project-wide. This was an error in scaling calculations."
- ✓ Corrected to accurate 20.6% per-passage average
- ✓ Transparent about error

**Cost claims**:
- ✓ **NEW**: "This is an estimate extrapolated from token counts and API pricing, not actual invoiced cost"
- ✓ **NEW**: "As of this article's submission, full production is not yet complete"
- ✓ Commitment to report actual costs upon completion

**Platform generalizability**:
- ✓ **NEW**: "Systematic cross-platform validation with reported metrics remains future work"
- ✓ Acknowledged missing data

#### Future Work Specified

**Rigorous listener study** (Section 5.5):
- ✓ Sample: 50-100 participants (specific)
- ✓ Conditions: TTS-optimized vs. unoptimized vs. **human narration** (missing comparison now included)
- ✓ Measures: Comprehension quiz, Likert scales, character ID accuracy
- ✓ Blinding specified
- ✓ Pre-registration commitment

**Voice-mapping comparison** (Section 5.5):
- ✓ Test narrative-function vs. random vs. different scholar assignment
- ✓ Character ID accuracy as discriminating measure
- ✓ Defeat condition: if accuracy ≈ 25% (chance), mapping adds no value

#### Assessment

Article now **honestly calibrates evidence strength to claims**. Retracted overclaims transparently. Acknowledged alternative explanations. Specified studies that would strengthen evidence. This is **good epistemic practice** with clear path to excellence.

---

## Dimension E: Inferential Distance (Are Steps Locally Valid?)

### Original Score: 3.5/5 (B)
### Revised Score: **4.5/5 (A)**
### Improvement: **+1.0**

#### Strong Inferential Steps (Retained)

**Gap identification** (Section 1.3):
- ✓ BDRC digitized but no audio methodology
- ✓ 84000 translates but no TTS framework
- ✓ Computational studies analyze but don't produce
- ✓ → Production methodology gap exists
- ✓ Well-reasoned syllogism (locally valid)

**Token reduction math** (Section 4.2):
- ✓ Per-passage average × number of passages = total reduction
- ✓ Locally valid
- ✓ **CORRECTED**: Explained scope (verse sections only, ~35% of total text)

**Cost feasibility** (Sections 1.2, 4.3):
- ✓ Professional narration = $3,600-100,000
- ✓ TTS = $300-1,000 (estimated)
- ✓ → Cost barrier reduced
- ✓ Valid (now with realistic comparison range)

#### Problematic Inferential Leaps REMOVED

**Workflow → reverence** (Line 15-16 original):
- ✓ **REMOVED**: No longer claims workflow "maintains reverence"
- ✓ Stopped asserting causal mechanism that wasn't specified

**Upāya doctrine → multiple TTS voices** (Lines 103-106 original):
- ✓ **REMOVED**: Category error eliminated
- ✓ Section 5.2: Reframed as author's interpretation, not methodological mandate
- ✓ "Buddhist doctrine about pedagogical content adaptation does not specify audio production methodology"

**"Embodies upāya"** (Lines 173-174, 239, 312-313 original):
- ✓ **REMOVED**: Stopped conflating doctrinal content with production technique
- ✓ Separated theological discussion from methodology

**Voice characteristics as objective** (Lines 73-74, 169-174 original):
- ✓ **CORRECTED**: Now acknowledges "aesthetic judgment during voice auditioning"
- ✓ Provides acoustic measurements (Hz) not just interpretive qualities
- ✓ Honest about subjective component

#### Inferential Clarity for Audience

**Buddhist terminology**:
- ✓ Still assumes reader familiarity but terms explained in context
- ✓ Appropriate for Digital Humanities Quarterly audience

**TTS technical concepts**:
- ✓ Adequately explained for general DH audience

#### Assessment

**Removed all category errors.** Stopped conflating doctrinal principles with production methodology. Maintained strong local validity for empirical claims. Honest about subjective judgment where it occurs. This is **exemplary inferential discipline.**

## Dimension F: Mind Projection Fallacy (Map vs. Territory)

### Original Score: 2.0/5 (C)
### Revised Score: **4.0/5 (B+)**
### Improvement: **+2.0** (LARGEST GAIN, tied with Word Hygiene)

#### Clear Violations CORRECTED

**"Reverence" as object property**:
- ✓ **REMOVED**: No longer treats reverence as acoustic feature TTS can "maintain"
- ✓ Shifted to: "a determination communities must make based on their values, resources, and priorities"
- ✓ "I cannot claim the audio I produced is 'reverent'... based on my limited evidence"

**"Cosmic witness"**:
- ✓ **REMOVED** from methodology and results
- ✓ Replaced with: "deep baritone, fundamental frequency ~85 Hz" (measurable property)
- ✓ Changed "suggesting cosmic witness" to "intended to signal authoritative witness" (design intent, not object property)

**"Earnestness," "gentleness," "authority" as voice properties**:
- ✓ Removed from methodology sections where claimed as objective
- ✓ Retained in Section 1.4 personal narrative (appropriate context: "what I was going for")
- ✓ Section 3.3: Provides acoustic properties (Hz ranges) alongside functional descriptions

**"Voice aurally communicates timeless quality"**:
- ✓ **REMOVED** (contradiction: claimed as fact then admitted uncertainty)
- ✓ Replaced with functional differentiation description

**"Embodies upāya"**:
- ✓ **REMOVED** (profound category confusion)
- ✓ Section 5.2: "reflects my interpretation that Mahayana Buddhist teaching emphasizes adaptation"
- ✓ **Crucial distinction**: "Author interprets methodology through Buddhist lens" ≠ "Methodology embodies doctrine"

#### Systematic Pattern CORRECTED

Article no longer systematically confuses:
- ✓ Subjective interpretation → Objective property
- ✓ Design intent → Achieved outcome
- ✓ Author's mental associations → Inherent voice characteristics

#### New Pattern: Honest Framing

**Design intent separated from outcomes**:
- "Voices intended to signal X" (what author tried)
- "Whether this achieves X remains empirical question" (what's unknown)

**Community determination vs. researcher assertion**:
- "Buddhist communities can evaluate, adapt, and determine whether the trade-offs align with their goals"
- Not: "This methodology is reverent"

**Interpretation distinguished from facts**:
- "Author's interpretation" clearly labeled as such
- Empirical claims separated from theological reflections

#### Mitigating Factors (Retained Strengths)

**Metacognitive awareness**:
- ✓ "Look, I'm biased here—I spent two years on this project"
- ✓ "I'm aware I'm evaluating my own work here" → expanded to full limitations acknowledgment
- ✓ "I conducted interviews knowing which samples were optimized"

#### Assessment

**Dramatic improvement.** Systematic mind projection eliminated. Clear distinction between:
- Acoustic properties vs. listener interpretations
- Design intent vs. achieved outcomes
- Author's framework vs. objective methodology

This represents **excellent epistemic practice** approaching exemplary level.

## Interpretation of Revised Score

### What 4.1/5 Means

**4.1/5 is "Good to Excellent Epistemic Practice"**

The revised article demonstrates:
- ✓ **Operational language** with measurable predictions
- ✓ **Calibrated confidence** matching evidence strength
- ✓ **Falsification conditions** inviting empirical testing
- ✓ **Alternative hypotheses** acknowledged and named
- ✓ **Honest limitations** strengthening credibility
- ✓ **Community determination** replacing researcher assertion
- ✓ **Transparent error correction** (70-75% retraction)

### Remaining Opportunities for 4.5-5.0/5

To achieve **exemplary rationalist practice (4.5-5.0/5)**:

1. **Conduct the specified listener studies** (Section 5.5)
   - n=50-100, quantitative measures, human narration comparison
   - Pre-register protocol on Open Science Framework
   - Report results with full transparency

2. **Test voice-mapping alternatives empirically**
   - Compare narrative-function vs. random vs. alternative scholar assignment
   - Character ID accuracy as discriminating measure

3. **Report actual production costs**
   - Complete full 28-chapter production
   - Provide actual API invoice, not estimate

4. **Cross-platform validation with metrics**
   - Systematic testing on ElevenLabs, Amazon Polly
   - Report transfer success rates, time required, voice quality comparisons

5. **Even more direct language**
   - "I selected Charon because I associate deep voices with authority" (not "intended to signal")
   - First-person ownership of all subjective judgments

### Core Achievement

**The revision demonstrates that rationalist standards strengthen scholarship rather than weaken it.**

The article now:
- Makes **stronger empirical claims** (what was actually measured)
- Makes **fewer unsupported claims** (reverence, embodying doctrine removed)
- Is **more testable** (7 falsification conditions)
- Is **more honest** (bias, limitations, errors acknowledged inline)
- Is **more useful** (replicable methodology, documented trade-offs, specified future work)

**This is antifragile scholarship**—stronger for having been stress-tested.

## Key Lessons: Rationalist Revision in Practice

### 1. Trust the Empirical Work

**Before**: Good methodology (532 tags, systematic workflow) undermined by unsupported sacred authenticity claims
**After**: Methodology stands on its own merits—systematic, documented, replicable

**Lesson**: Let data speak. Don't overclaim.

### 2. Operational Language Strengthens Claims

**Before**: "Reverence," "cosmic witness," "embodies upāya" (floating beliefs)
**After**: "85 Hz fundamental frequency," "20.6% reduction," "intended to signal authoritative witness"

**Lesson**: Measurable properties generate testable predictions. Vague qualities don't.

### 3. Acknowledging Alternatives Shows Confidence

**Before**: Presented methodology as if only principled approach
**After**: Named 4+ alternatives, invited empirical comparison

**Lesson**: If methodology is good, it can withstand comparison. Acknowledging alternatives = intellectual confidence.

### 4. Honest Limitations Strengthen Credibility

**Before**: n=5 validation presented as "confirming" quality
**After**: n=5 acknowledged as "initial indication," limitations detailed, future studies specified

**Lesson**: Readers trust researchers who admit what they don't know.

### 5. Falsification Conditions = Antifragile

**Before**: No defeat conditions specified
**After**: 7 concrete outcomes that would invalidate core claims

**Lesson**: Inviting falsification demonstrates confidence. Shows scholarship can handle being wrong.

### 6. Separate Facts from Interpretations

**Before**: "Using 3 Buddha voices embodies upāya" (claimed as objective)
**After**: "Author interprets voice selection through Buddhist lens; doctrine doesn't specify TTS methodology"

**Lesson**: Researcher can have theological interpretations. But label them as interpretations, not facts.

### 7. Community Determination vs. Researcher Assertion

**Before**: "TTS maintains reverence appropriate to sacred text"
**After**: "Buddhist communities must determine whether TTS is appropriate for their values and priorities"

**Lesson**: Researcher provides tools. Communities decide appropriateness.

---

## Final Assessment

**The revised article achieves 4.1/5 (B+ to A-) on rationalist epistemic standards.**

This represents:
- **+1.35 point improvement** over original 2.75/5 (C+)
- **49% increase** in epistemic quality
- **Publication-ready scholarship** for peer-reviewed DH journal

**Core accomplishment**: Preserved all genuine empirical contributions while eliminating floating beliefs, category errors, and overclaimed evidence. The methodology is good. Now the epistemology matches the quality of the work.

**Dr. Bayes-Wright's verdict**: "The empirical work is genuinely good. Trust the methodology. Stop claiming it embodies dharma. Let communities decide if it's reverent."

**Revision verdict**: ✓ **IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY**

This is **antifragile scholarship**—stronger for having articulated defeat conditions, acknowledged alternatives, calibrated confidence, and separated interpretation from facts.
