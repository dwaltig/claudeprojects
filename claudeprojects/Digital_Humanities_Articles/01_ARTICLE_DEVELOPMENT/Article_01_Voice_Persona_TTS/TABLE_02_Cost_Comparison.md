## Scalability Analysis

### Production of 10 Buddhist Sutras (Comparable Length)

| Method | Cost for 10 Texts | Feasibility | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| **TTS Methodology** | $3,000-$10,000 | Very High | Linear scaling; each text ~$300-1,000 |
| **Multi-Voice Professional** | $500,000-$1,000,000 | Very Low | Prohibitively expensive for most organizations |
| **Scholar-Narrator** | $200,000-$500,000 | Low | Possible for major institutions only |
| **Single Professional** | $41,000-$76,000 | Medium | University press budgets; no character differentiation |
| **DIY** | $100-$760 (equipment) | Medium | Quality and consistency challenges at scale |

**TTS enables projects otherwise impossible**: A digital archive producing 10 sutras via TTS spends $10,000 max; same project via professional narration requires $500,000-$1,000,000.

## Hidden Costs and Benefits

### TTS Additional Benefits Not Captured in Cost Table

- **Revision flexibility**: Re-running with corrections costs ~$50 vs. $5,000+ re-recording
- **Multiple versions**: Can produce scholarly + vernacular versions for marginal cost
- **Language variants**: Same methodology applies to translated versions
- **Archival stability**: Digital files don't degrade; human narrators may be unavailable for updates

### Professional Narration Additional Benefits

- **Artistic nuance**: Subtle affective modulation TTS cannot fully replicate
- **Cultural authenticity**: Human narrators from tradition bring lived experience
- **Marketing value**: "Narrated by renowned scholar X" enhances prestige
- **Performance artistry**: Breath, pacing, emotional delivery as interpretive acts

## Recommendation Matrix

| Project Type | Recommended Method | Rationale |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Buddhist digital archive (multiple texts)** | TTS Methodology | Scalability + cost efficiency enable ambitious scope |
| **University press (single prestige text)** | Scholar-Narrator or TTS | Balance cost vs. scholarly authenticity |
| **Small Buddhist center (local distribution)** | TTS Methodology | Only economically viable option for quality audio |
| **Major publisher (commercial release)** | Multi-Voice Professional | Budget allows premium quality; marketing advantage |
| **Individual scholar (research + teaching)** | TTS Methodology | Enables impossible otherwise; scholarly control |
| **Community practice group** | DIY or TTS | DIY for intimacy; TTS for quality and distribution |

## Citation Format for Article

**In-text reference**: "Table 2 presents a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis comparing TTS methodology to traditional audio production approaches, demonstrating 98-99% cost reduction relative to professional multi-voice narration while maintaining high quality and excellent character differentiation."

**Table caption**: "Table 2. Production Method Comparison: TTS vs. Traditional Audio Narration. The table compares five audio production methods across dimensions of cost, timeline, quality, and scalability. TTS methodology achieves 98-99% cost reduction ($300-1,000 vs. $50,000-100,000 for professional multi-voice narration) while maintaining professional quality and enabling character differentiation through 15 distinct voices. This cost reduction democratizes Buddhist sutra audio production, making it accessible to individual scholars, Buddhist centers, and digital archives."
