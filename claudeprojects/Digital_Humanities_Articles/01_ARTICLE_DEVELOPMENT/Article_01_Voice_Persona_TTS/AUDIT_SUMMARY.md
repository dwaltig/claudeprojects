## Action Required Before DHQ Submission

**Main Text Correction Needed** (FULL_DRAFT_Article_01.md, line 52):

**CURRENT (INCORRECT)**:
> "Digital Humanities Quarterly published theoretical discussions of multimodal textual analysis (Smits and Wevers 2023)"

**CORRECTED**:
> "Digital Scholarship in the Humanities published theoretical discussions of multimodal textual analysis (Smits and Wevers 2023)"

**Reason**: Smits & Wevers (2023) was published in *Digital Scholarship in the Humanities* (Oxford Academic), not DHQ.
