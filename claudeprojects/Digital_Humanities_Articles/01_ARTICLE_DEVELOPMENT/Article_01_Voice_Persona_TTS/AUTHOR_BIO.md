# Author Biography

**William Altig** is an independent scholar working at the intersection of Buddhist textual studies, digital humanities methodology, and accessible scholarship. His current project—a complete scholarly translation of the Lotus Sutra with 1,554 footnotes, parallel vernacular interpretation, and professional audio production across 28 chapters—integrates traditional Buddhist studies with contemporary digital tools to make classical Buddhist texts accessible to contemporary practitioners and general audiences. His research focuses on multimodal textual transformation (classical Chinese source → scholarly English → vernacular adaptation → TTS audio rendering), technical infrastructure for diacritical preservation in Buddhist digital editions, and cost-effective workflows that democratize sacred text audio production. His work has been guided by Dr. Amara Chen-Rothenberg (scholarly writing) and draws on computational linguistics methods to address gaps in Buddhist digital humanities scholarship. This article represents his first peer-reviewed publication contributing practical TTS methodology to the digital humanities toolkit for sacred text preservation.
