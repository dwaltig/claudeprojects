# Digital Humanities Articles Project

**Created**: December 21, 2024
**Purpose**: Academic article development for Digital Humanities publications
**Focus**: Comparative religion/philosophy through the lens of digital Buddhist textual studies

## Project Goals

This project mines insights from the **Lotus Sutra translation and audio production work** to contribute to Digital Humanities scholarship at the intersection of:

- Buddhist textual studies
- TTS and audio rendering of sacred texts
- Translation methodology (scholarly, vernacular, blues interpretation)
- Digital accessibility and multimodal scholarship
- Technical infrastructure for diacritical preservation

---

## Target Venues

**Primary Digital Humanities Journals**:
- *Digital Humanities Quarterly*
- *Digital Scholarship in the Humanities* (Oxford)
- *Journal of Digital Humanities*
- *Digital Studies / Le champ numérique*

**Secondary Venues** (Buddhist Studies with DH focus):
- *Journal of Buddhist Ethics* (digital editions section)
- *Buddhist-Christian Studies* (methodology articles)
- *Philosophy East and West* (technology and translation)

## Research Questions

1. **How can TTS technology be optimized for sacred texts with multiple speaker personas?**
2. **What role can vernacular translation play in digital accessibility of Buddhist texts?**
3. **How do we preserve scholarly rigor across multimodal transformations?**
4. **What technical infrastructure is needed for diacritical integrity in digital Buddhist editions?**
5. **Can AI-assisted translation maintain fidelity while improving accessibility?**
