## Case 1: Google AI Overview Defamation (December 2024)

**Source:** "Prominent Canadian Musician Says Gig Was Cancelled After Google AI Overview Wrongly Branded Him Sex Pest"

**Summary:**  
A Canadian musician had a performance cancelled after Google's AI Overview feature falsely labeled him as a "sex pest" in search results. The venue or booker apparently relied on this AI-generated summary when making their decision.

**Key Issues:**
- **Hallucination with Authority:** AI-generated content presented with the implicit credibility of Google Search
- **No Clear Recourse:** Traditional defamation law struggles with AI-generated statements (no human "speaker")
- **Cascading Harm:** False information → surfaces in search → trusted by decision-makers → real economic/reputational damage

**Relevant Concepts:**
- **Algorithmic Karma:** The AI created a "karmic imprint" on the musician's digital identity that they must suffer consequences for, despite not generating it themselves
- **Inherited Digital Karma:** A person bearing the karmic weight of actions they did not commit
- **Stochastic Defamation:** Probabilistic text generation producing actionable false statements

**Potential Use:**
- Contemporary example for "Silicon Samsara" or future AI ethics papers
- Illustrates the gap between AI capability and accountability frameworks
- Demonstrates need for Buddhist ethical frameworks applied to AI systems
