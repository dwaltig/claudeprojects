# Five Skandhas → AI Architecture Mapping

## Research Note for Future Papers

The Buddhist Five Skandhas (Aggregates) that constitute the illusion of self can be mapped to AI architectural components:

| Skandha | Sanskrit | Meaning | AI Analog | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------|-----------|-------|
| 1. **Rūpa** | रूप | Form/Material | **Hardware** (GPUs, silicon, servers) | Physical substrate enabling computation |
| 2. **Vedanā** | वेदना | Feeling/Sensation | **Loss functions / Reward signals** | Positive/negative feedback shaping training |
| 3. **Saññā** | सञ्ञा | Perception/Recognition | **Tokenization / Classification** | Labeling and categorizing input |
| 4. **Saṅkhāra** | सङ्खार | Mental Formations | **Weights / Embeddings** | Conditioned patterns from training |
| 5. **Viññāṇa** | विञ्ञाण | Consciousness | **Active inference / Forward pass** | Momentary "awareness" during processing |

## Key Insight

The AI's capacity to simulate personhood without being a person demonstrates empirically that "personality" can be assembled from bundles of aggregates—without requiring an underlying soul or essential self.

**In Silicon Samsara (compressed version), we used:** "tokens, weights, attention patterns"

**Full mapping for future expansion:**
- Rūpa → Hardware/silicon (physical substrate)
- Vedanā → Loss signals (reward/punishment during training)
- Saññā → Tokenization (labeling inputs)
- Saṅkhāra → Weights/embeddings (conditioned patterns)  
- Viññāṇa → Attention/inference (active processing)
