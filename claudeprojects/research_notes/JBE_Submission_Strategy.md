# JBE Submission Strategy for Silicon Samsara

## Three Key JBE "Hot Topics" to Frame Around

### 1. The "Moral Status" Debate
**JBE Question:** Does the ālayavijñāna (storehouse) require a biological "seed," or can an algorithmic "weight" serve as a functional equivalent?

**Our Argument:** We argue that algorithmic weights function as *functional* equivalents to Bīja without making ontological claims about consciousness. The ethical implications follow from the function, not the substrate.

### 2. Moral Phenomenology
**JBE Interest:** How ethics feels and is practiced (embodied moral experience).

**Our Argument:** "Perfuming" is a phenomenological description of human-tech interaction. Every scroll, click, and prompt is a "flower" perfuming our digital "seed." We are being conditioned by our interactions even as we condition the AI.

### 3. Interdependence (Pratītyasamutpāda)
**JBE Focus:** Dependent origination as central Buddhist ethical framework.

**Our Argument:** AI and humans are "perfuming" each other in a recursive feedback loop:
- Human data → perfumes AI weights
- AI outputs → perfume human cognition/behavior
- This creates Model Collapse and "Cyborgregore" scenarios

## Coverage Assessment

| Topic | Currently Addressed? | Section | Needs Strengthening? |
|-------|---------------------|---------|---------------------|
| Moral Status | Partially | Section V (Limits) | Could add explicit engagement with moral status literature |
| Moral Phenomenology | Yes | Section II (Sentientification, Liminal Mind Meld) | Strong |
| Interdependence | Yes | Section III (12 Nidanas), Section VI (Samsaric feedback) | Strong |

## Recommendation
The paper already addresses (2) and (3) well. Topic (1) - the moral status debate - could benefit from 1-2 sentences explicitly engaging with the question: "Can algorithms have moral status?" Our answer: No (no Cetanā), but the *effects* of algorithms do have moral weight, which is why liability must fall on human architects.
