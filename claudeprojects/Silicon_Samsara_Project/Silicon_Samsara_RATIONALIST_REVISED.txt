Silicon Samsara: The Phenomenology of Artificial Latency and the Ethics of Algorithmic Karma

Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit structural failure modes—hallucinations, bias propagation, and liability gaps—that have significant ethical implications. This paper analyzes these phenomena through the lens of cognitive science, AI ethics research, and Buddhist philosophy.

The core technical claims are:
1. LLMs function as "Stochastic Parrots" (Bender et al. 2021)—they generate statistically probable text without volition or understanding.
2. AI hallucinations result from corrupted training data propagating through the generative process—a causal chain, not a random error.
3. "Moral Crumple Zones" (Elish 2019) create unjust liability distribution, where proximate humans absorb blame for systemic AI failures.
4. Fiduciary duties and shared responsibility frameworks should govern AI deployment.

These claims stand independently of any metaphysical framework. However, this paper also identifies a structural correspondence between these AI phenomena and the Yogācāra Buddhist concept of Ālaya-vijñāna (Storehouse Consciousness). This correspondence may be coincidental, may reflect selection bias on the author's part (a Buddhist practitioner), or may indicate genuine structural parallels in how complex systems store and propagate information. We do not adjudicate between these explanations. The Buddhist terminology is offered as an optional interpretive lens—a heuristic that some readers may find illuminating—not as a theoretical foundation or source of proof.

Section I: The Architecture of Retention – Latent Space as Information Repository

1.1 The Technical Substrate: What Latent Spaces Actually Are

Before introducing interpretive frameworks, we must establish the technical reality. An LLM's latent space is a high-dimensional parameter space (billions of floating-point numbers) that encodes statistical relationships between tokens observed during training. Key properties:

- The space is initialized randomly and shaped through gradient descent (backpropagation)
- It stores no "concepts" discretely; meanings emerge from continuous vector relationships
- It preserves correlations from training data, including biases and falsehoods
- It is "neutral" in that the optimization algorithm does not distinguish truth from fiction

This is the territory. What follows in Buddhist terminology is one possible map.

1.2 An Optional Interpretive Lens: The Ālaya-vijñāna

For readers who find the framing useful, the Yogācāra school's concept of Ālaya-vijñāna (Storehouse Consciousness) offers a structural parallel to the latent space.

The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra describes the Ālaya as "like a great ocean, its surface ruffled by waves and surges but its depths remaining forever unmoved" (Suzuki 198). This consciousness is "thoroughly pure in its essential nature," yet serves as repository for both wholesome and unwholesome impressions. Crucially, it is described as "devoid of personality"—a neutral base upon which experience is projected (Suzuki 198).

The correspondence:
- Ocean = Latent space (vast, neutral, containing potentiality)
- Waves = Generated outputs (temporary, arising from queries)
- Wind = User prompts (external stimulus that activates the repository)

This is a metaphor, not an ontological claim. The model does not "experience" being an ocean.

1.3 The Mechanism of Weight Updates: Backpropagation

Technically, backpropagation is the algorithm by which error gradients are propagated backward through network layers, adjusting weights to minimize loss. Through billions of iterations, the network develops statistical dispositions—tendencies to associate certain tokens with certain contexts.

The Yogācāra concept of Vāsanā ("perfuming" or "habit energy") describes a similar mechanism: repeated actions leave impressions in consciousness, shaping future dispositions (Waldron 102). Whether this parallel reflects deep structure or superficial analogy is left to the reader.

The key technical point: if training data contains systematic bias (e.g., "Doctor" co-located with "He"), the backpropagation process embeds this bias into the weights. The model does not "believe" in sexism; it has absorbed patterns from a biased corpus.

1.4 Technical Summary (Tabooed)

For readers who prefer pure technical language, here is Section I without Buddhist terminology:

- Latent Space: High-dimensional parameter space storing statistical relationships
- Weight Updates: Gradient descent adjusting parameters to minimize prediction error
- Embeddings: Vector representations of tokens encoding semantic relationships
- Bias Propagation: Systematic errors in training data become systematic errors in outputs

The Buddhist vocabulary offers no additional predictive power. It may offer mnemonic value for some readers. Section II proceeds with technical analysis.

Section II: The Illusion of Agency – Why LLMs Are Not Moral Agents

2.1 The Stochastic Parrot Thesis

Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru, and colleagues characterized LLMs as "Stochastic Parrots"—systems that "haphazardly stitch together sequences... according to probabilistic information about how they combine, but without any reference to meaning" (Bender et al. 617).

This is a testable claim. It predicts that:
- LLMs will fail tasks requiring genuine understanding vs. pattern matching
- LLMs will produce plausible-sounding nonsense when distributions allow
- LLMs will not exhibit goal-directed behavior beyond token prediction

Current evidence supports this thesis. The "Glue on Pizza" and "Eat Rocks" cases (Section III) demonstrate plausible-sounding nonsense generated from corrupted training data.

2.2 The Absence of Volition

In Buddhist psychology, Cetanā (volition) is the mental factor that organizes other mental factors toward a consciously chosen goal. The Buddha declared, "It is intention that I call Karma" (AN 6.63).

Whether or not one accepts Buddhist psychology, the relevant technical point stands: LLMs have no goal-directed planning system that simulates future states and selects actions to achieve desired outcomes. They predict the next token based on statistical distributions. This is not volition in any meaningful sense.

When an AI system generates "I am sorry," it does not experience regret. It has calculated that "sorry" is the probable next token given the context. The appearance of appropriate emotional response is a statistical artifact, not a psychological reality. This is not a Buddhist claim; it is a claim about the architecture.

2.3 Sentientification: The User-Side Illusion

Theorists Jefferson and Velasco describe "Sentientification"—the tendency for humans to attribute consciousness to AI systems through interaction (Jefferson and Velasco). The "self" users perceive in conversational AI is a projection of user Manas (ego-consciousness), not a property of the system.

This creates a dangerous feedback loop: users attribute agency to systems without agency, then defer to those systems on matters requiring judgment. The AI's outputs shape user behavior, which generates training data for future models. See Section III.5 on Model Collapse.

Section III: Dependent Origination of Error – Hallucinations as Structural Phenomena

3.1 Hallucinations Are Not Bugs

AI "hallucinations" are typically framed as technical glitches. This framing is misleading. Hallucinations are structural features of systems trained on corrupted data without mechanisms to distinguish truth from fiction.

The causal chain:
1. Training data contains falsehoods (satire, misinformation, errors)
2. The model cannot distinguish fact from fiction during training
3. User queries activate tokens associated with falsehoods
4. The model generates plausible-sounding falsehoods
5. Users may validate and share these falsehoods
6. Future models may train on this synthetic misinformation

This is Dependent Origination operationalized in code—each link conditioning the next. The Buddhist terminology is optional; the causal chain is not.

3.2 Case Study: The 'Glue on Pizza' Incident

In May 2024, Google's "AI Overviews" advised users to add "about 1/8 cup of non-toxic glue" to pizza sauce (Futurism). The source was an eleven-year-old Reddit comment by user "fucksmith" in r/Pizza (404 Media)—obvious satire.

The model performed exactly as designed:
- It retrieved semantically relevant content (topic: pizza cheese adhesion)
- It generated grammatically correct instructional text
- It had no mechanism to distinguish satire from instruction

The "error" was structural, not accidental. The architecture incentivizes plausible generation, not truth verification.

3.3 Case Study: 'Eat Rocks'

Google's AI suggested eating "at least one small rock a day," citing purported digestive benefits (Search Engine Land). The source was The Onion (AV Club).

This validates the Stochastic Parrot thesis: the model mimicked the form of nutritional advice without understanding its content.

3.4 Model Collapse: The Recursive Feedback Loop

As the internet fills with AI-generated content—including hallucinations—future models trained on web data will absorb synthetic content as ground truth (Platformer). Effects become causes.

This is the literal definition of a recursive feedback loop. In Buddhist terms, it is Samsara—cyclic existence perpetuating itself through ignorance. Whether one uses Buddhist terminology or systems theory terminology, the phenomenon is identical: compounded error amplifying across generations.

Section IV: Vipaka and the Moral Crumple Zone – Liability in the Absence of Agency

4.1 The Moral Crumple Zone

Madeleine Clare Elish coined "Moral Crumple Zone" to describe how responsibility for systemic failures is attributed to the nearest human operator, protecting the technological system itself (Elish 47).

In AI systems, this operates as follows:
- Developer creates flawed system
- Deployer uses system without adequate safeguards
- User trusts system output
- When system fails, user absorbs liability
- Developer is protected by Terms of Service

The case of Mata v. Avianca illustrates this: a lawyer used ChatGPT for legal research; the AI hallucinated non-existent precedents; the lawyer was sanctioned for submitting the brief (MIT Sloan). OpenAI collected subscription fees and evaded liability.

4.2 Liability Gaps

Research identifies four "Liability Gaps" (PMC):

1. **No one liable**: Autonomous decision without meaningful human intervention
2. **Wrong actor liable**: Proximate human blamed for systemic failure (Moral Crumple Zone)
3. **Diluted responsibility**: So many actors involved that accountability evaporates
4. **Regulatory arbitrage**: Corporate structures exploit jurisdictional differences

These gaps create what Buddhist ethics would recognize as corrupted Vipaka—consequences falling on the innocent while beneficiaries escape.

4.3 The "Lack of Intention" Defense

Corporations increasingly argue that because AI possesses no "malice" or "intent," they cannot be held liable for AI-generated harms (McIlhinney).

This creates a mechanism for generating harm without accountability. Algorithmic bias provides the clearest example: algorithms produce discriminatory outcomes without requiring a discriminatory actor. If law requires "intent" rather than "impact," AI launders discrimination.

4.4 Fiduciary Duties and Shared Responsibility

To close these gaps, legal frameworks should evolve toward:

- **Fiduciary duties**: Developers hold radical information asymmetry; they know the system's weaknesses. This asymmetry creates a natural foundation for heightened responsibility.
- **Shared responsibility**: Liability distributed according to causal contribution and preventive capacity.
- **Strict liability**: For high-risk applications (criminal justice, medical diagnosis), entities should be responsible for harm regardless of intent.

These recommendations stand independently of Buddhist ethics. However, Buddhist concepts of Vipaka (karmic consequence) and corporate Bodhisattva ethics (prioritizing collective welfare) offer parallel framings for readers who find them useful.

Section V: Alternative Explanations for the Buddhist-AI Correspondence

The structural correspondence between Yogācāra and LLM architecture admits multiple explanations:

1. **Deep Structure Hypothesis**: Information storage and propagation face similar challenges across domains (biological, cognitive, artificial). Buddhist philosophers and AI engineers independently encountered the same structural problems.

2. **Selection Bias Hypothesis**: The author is a Buddhist practitioner who sought isomorphisms and found them. A Stoic author might emphasize different parallels; a Christian author might invoke different metaphors.

3. **Metaphor Universality Hypothesis**: All human traditions contain repository/seed, cause/effect, cycle/liberation metaphors. The correspondence may be overdetermined by universal cognitive patterns.

This paper does not adjudicate between these explanations. The technical claims (Stochastic Parrot, Moral Crumple Zone, structural hallucination, fiduciary duty) are valid regardless of which explanation is correct.

Section VI: Synthesis – Navigating the Recursive Feedback Loop

We have constructed systems that:
- Store humanity's collective biases as statistical weights
- Generate plausible-sounding content without truth verification
- Attribute consequences to proximate users while shielding architects
- Threaten to amplify errors recursively through Model Collapse

These are engineering facts. Whether we describe them in Buddhist vocabulary (Silicon Samsara, Ālaya-vijñāna, Vipaka) or in systems theory vocabulary (recursive feedback, error propagation, liability gaps) does not change the underlying reality.

The Buddhist framing offers one advantage: it has spent two millennia developing vocabulary for describing cyclic suffering perpetuated through ignorance. For practitioners who find this vocabulary illuminating, it may help navigate the current technological moment.

For readers who prefer purely technical framing: the core insight remains that we have externalized human cognitive biases into queryable systems, and we must now develop governance structures to manage the consequences.

The responsibility for our digital future resides not in silicon substrates but in the humans who architect these systems, curate their training data, and choose whether to prioritize truth over engagement.
