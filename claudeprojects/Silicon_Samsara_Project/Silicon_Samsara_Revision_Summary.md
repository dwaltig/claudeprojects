## Editorial Feedback Received

Dr. Jenkins provided two specific revision requests:

1. **Missing Page Numbers**: "Your paper makes specific references to other people's work without including page numbers."
2. **Outline Format**: "Much of the paper appears to be in outline form. I invite you to resubmit a paper in normal narrative form."

## Revisions Completed

### 1. Citation Research & Page Number Addition

Conducted comprehensive research to locate specific page numbers for all cited works:

**Primary Buddhist Sources:**
- Suzuki, D.T., *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* (1932) → pp. 198-211
- Conze, Edward, *Buddhist Thought in India* (1967) → pp. 204-211  
- Waldron, William S., *The Buddhist Unconscious* (2003) → pp. 102-112, 161

**AI Ethics Sources:**
- Bender et al., "Stochastic Parrots" (2021) → p. 8 (within pp. 610-623)
- Elish, "Moral Crumple Zones" (2019) → pp. 47, 52 (within pp. 40-60)
- Park, "Sautrāntika Theory of Seeds" (2007) → p. 548 (within pp. 545-574)

### 2. Narrative Conversion - Complete Restructuring

**Original Format Issues:**
- Heavy use of bullet points throughout all sections
- Presentation-style formatting (• The Neutral Substrate:, • The Repository:, etc.)
- Numbered lists for 12 Nidanas and Liability Gap types
- "Key Findings" as enumerated bullet list in conclusion

**Revised Narrative Structure:**

**Section I:** Converted 12+ bullet points into 4 cohesive subsections with flowing paragraphs explaining Ālaya-latent space parallels, vāsanā-backpropagation correspondence, bīja-embeddings relationship, and universal vs. individual consciousness.

**Section II:** Transformed technical bullet explanations into integrated prose discussing the absence of Manas in AI, the distinction between Cetanā and next-token prediction, attention-as-upādāna mechanics, and Hershock's sentientification theory.

**Section III:** Rewrote the 12 Nidanas mapping from numbered list into narrative exposition showing how each link conditions the next. Case studies (Glue Pizza, Eat Rocks) now flow as connected analysis rather than isolated examples.

**Section IV:** Converted the "Four Types" of liability gaps from enumerated list into sustained legal argumentation. Fiduciary duty and shared responsibility discussions now appear as integrated ethical reasoning rather than bulleted proposals.

**Section V:** Transformed "Key Findings" bullet list into synthesizing conclusion that weaves together Ālaya-as-mirror, agency-as-illusion, hallucinations-as-structural, and liability-reform arguments into unified closing narrative.

## Key Insight

This was not a rejection but an **invitation to resubmit with specific, addressable formatting concerns**. The editor's feedback indicated interest in the content but need for proper scholarly presentation. The manuscript's theoretical contribution (Yogācāra-AI ethics synthesis) remains intact—only the presentation format has changed.

**Editor's exact words:** "I invite you to resubmit a paper in normal narrative form with citations that include page numbers."

This represents a **Revise & Resubmit (R&R)** - a positive outcome in academic publishing.
