## General Response

Thank you for your thoughtful review of this manuscript. The interdisciplinary nature of this work—bridging Yogācāra Buddhist philosophy and contemporary AI ethics—necessarily invites scrutiny from multiple scholarly traditions. I have carefully considered each concern and made targeted revisions where appropriate.

## Anticipated Critiques and Responses

### 1. "Is the Yogācāra-AI analogy merely decorative?"

**Response:** The paper explicitly addresses this concern in Section V ("Why Use Buddhist Terminology?"). The Buddhist framework is deployed as **diagnostic machinery**, not metaphysical speculation. I am not claiming AI systems *are* Buddhist—I am claiming that Yogācāra provides a vocabulary that is more precise than secular alternatives for locating moral responsibility. The comparison table (Section V) demonstrates the diagnostic advantage: "bias" is vague, while *vāsanā* captures the cumulative, structural nature of the problem; "hallucination" implies perception (a category error), while *vipāka* captures the causal chain from seed to fruit.

The ethical analysis of liability gaps and moral crumple zones stands independently of the Buddhist framing. The philosophy provides the lens; the ethics constitute the substance.

### 2. "Is the 4th century dating of Yogācāra accurate?"

**Response:** *[REVISED in v3]* The original text stated Yogācāra "emerged in the 4th century CE." This is defensible—scholarship confirms the school's origins in the 4th century—but I have revised the text to read: "systematized during the 4th and 5th centuries CE by Asaṅga and Vasubandhu" for greater precision. This aligns with Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Routledge Encyclopedia entries.

### 3. "Are the Suzuki translations accurately cited?"

**Response:** Yes. The quote "Universal Mind is like a great ocean, its surface ruffled by waves and surges but its depths remaining forever unmoved" appears on page 198 of D.T. Suzuki's 1932 translation of the *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* (Routledge & Kegan Paul). This has been independently verified against the printed edition.

---

### 4. "Does the paper conflate functional and ontological correspondence?"

**Response:** Section V.1 ("Limits of the Yogācāra–AI Correspondence") explicitly addresses this concern. The paper states: "The correspondence is *functional*—both store and retrieve conditioned patterns—not *ontological*. They are not the same kind of thing." The analysis does not imply that AI systems experience anything, nor does it claim the structural parallels "prove" Buddhist philosophy correct.

### 5. "Is 'Stochastic Parrot' too dismissive of emergent capabilities?"

**Response:** Footnote 1 (line 132) acknowledges this debate: "The 'Stochastic Parrot' framing has become contested within AI ethics circles. Some researchers argue it understates emergent capabilities in larger models; others contend it remains the most accurate description of the underlying mechanism regardless of surface sophistication. This paper uses the term descriptively—to emphasize the absence of genuine understanding—without taking a position on emergence debates."

---

### 6. "Is the Elish citation accurate?"

**Response:** Yes. Elish's "Moral Crumple Zones: Cautionary Tales in Human-Robot Interaction" was published in *Engaging Science, Technology, and Society*, vol. 5, 2019, pp. 40-60. Page 47, cited in the manuscript, falls within this range.

---

### 7. "Is the 'Corporate Bodhisattva' section too prescriptive?"

**Response:** The section explicitly grounds its proposals in existing regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, Model Cards, B Corp certification, Constitutional AI) to demonstrate that "Corporate Bodhisattva" ethics are actionable, not merely aspirational. The proposals are offered as contributions to ongoing policy debates, not as the final word.

## Conclusion

I believe this manuscript makes a timely contribution to the emerging field of Buddhism and technology. The Yogācāra framework provides diagnostic precision that secular AI ethics discourse currently lacks, particularly in locating moral responsibility when AI systems generate harm without intention. I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify these points and welcome further dialogue.
