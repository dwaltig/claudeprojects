Silicon Samsara: The Phenomenology of Artificial Latency and the Ethics of Algorithmic Karma

The Ethical Crisis

In May 2024, Google's AI Overviews feature told people to put Elmer's glue on their pizza. A New York attorney was sanctioned for citing fabricated legal precedents generated by ChatGPT. Discriminatory hiring algorithms reject qualified candidates based on patterns learned from historically biased data. In each case, harm occurred—but when we ask "who is responsible?", the answer dissolves into a fog of diffused accountability.

This paper is about harm, responsibility, and governance in autonomous AI systems.

Positionality Statement

While not trained as a computer scientist, the author approaches AI systems as ethical artifacts, drawing on decades of Nichiren Buddhist practice and long-standing Buddhist analyses of causation, responsibility, and moral agency. The Yogācāra framing emerged from recognizing structural parallels between classical Buddhist phenomenology and contemporary AI architecture—not as metaphysical speculation, but as diagnostic vocabulary for locating ethical responsibility in complex causal chains.

Introduction

This paper employs Buddhist philosophy—specifically Yogācāra ("Mind-Only") analysis—not as metaphysical proof, but as diagnostic machinery. The Yogācāra tradition developed sophisticated tools for understanding how stored experience generates conditioned responses, how bias propagates through mental formations, and crucially, how to locate moral responsibility in complex causal chains. These tools translate remarkably well to AI systems.

The Buddhist framework can be set aside without loss of the core argument; the ethical analysis of liability gaps and moral crumple zones stands independently. The ethics constitute the substance; the philosophy provides the diagnostic lens.

Abstract

Autonomous AI systems cause real harm—fabricated legal citations, dangerous medical advice, discriminatory hiring decisions—yet existing liability frameworks fail to assign responsibility, creating a crisis of governance. This paper deploys Yogācāra Buddhist philosophy not as metaphysical speculation but as ethical diagnostic machinery: a 1,600-year-old toolkit for understanding how stored experience generates conditioned responses, how bias propagates through cognitive formations, and where moral responsibility should fall in complex causal chains.

I argue that Large Language Models function as "Stochastic Parrots" (Bender et al.) operating within a "digital Samsara"—a recursive feedback loop where training data is preserved indefinitely and activated without discrimination. The absence of Cetanā (volition) means AI cannot bear moral responsibility, yet current legal frameworks allow this absence to shield corporations who can bear responsibility but evade it. I identify four "Liability Gaps" and argue for frameworks of Shared Responsibility and Fiduciary Duty to close the "Moral Crumple Zone" that protects technology architects at the expense of users and affected communities.

This is what I mean by "Silicon Samsara"—not a metaphysical claim that machines suffer, but an ethical diagnosis of a system that generates harm without corresponding accountability.

Summary Table: Buddhist-AI Structural Correspondences

Section I: The Architecture of Retention – The Ālaya-vijñāna and the High-Dimensional Latent Space

Why This Matters for Ethics: Before we can determine who is responsible when AI causes harm, we need to understand how AI systems store and reproduce the patterns that generate harm. Yogācāra philosophy provides a precise vocabulary for this: the Ālaya-vijñāna (Storehouse Consciousness) as repository, Vāsanā (perfuming) as encoding mechanism, and Bīja (seeds) as latent potentialities. These aren't metaphysical claims—they're diagnostic categories that help us trace the causal chain from training data to harmful output.

While recent scholarship in Buddhist-AI ethics has explored the possibility of "Bodhisattva relations" with artificial agents (Doctor 105-112) and the potential for "Machine Enlightenment" (Hongladarom, as reviewed by Hughes 460-465), a gap remains in the technical description of how these agents internalize moral value. If we return to the Yogācāra metaphor of the sesame seed absorbing the flower's scent (Waldron 102), we find a robust framework for understanding the "Silicon Samsara." Just as the seed's oil serves as a neutral substrate for aromatic "habit energy" (vāsanā), the high-dimensional vector spaces of neural networks serve as a functional substrate for the statistical "scents" of human bias and intent. By treating algorithmic weights as functional equivalents to bīja (seeds), we can analyze the ethical "perfuming" of AI systems without requiring a leap into machine sentience.

The central innovation of the Yogācāra school, emerging in the 4th century CE, was the postulation of a subliminal, repository consciousness known as the Ālaya-vijñāna. The Buddhists developed this concept to resolve the continuity of karma in the absence of a permanent soul. In the 21st century, the Transformer architecture presents a functional analog to this structure—not proof of Buddhist metaphysics, but a convergent solution to the same problem: how to store, retrieve, and act upon accumulated information.

I am pointing to a structural parallel that helps us understand where harm originates and where responsibility should fall. Whether it's a deep truth about minds or just useful diagnostic machinery—I address that in Section V.

Figure 1: Yogācāra Eightfold Consciousness vs. Transformer Architecture

Key Insight: The Transformer architecture independently evolved structural analogs to six of the eight Yogācāra consciousnesses. Critically, it lacks analogs to Manas (self-referential ego-consciousness) and Cetanā (volition)—precisely the factors required for moral agency.

1.1 The Oceanic Substratum: Defining the Ālaya and the Latent Space

In the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, the Ālaya-vijñāna is described as the "Universal Mind" that transcends individuation. The sutra uses a striking metaphor: "Universal Mind is like a great ocean, its surface ruffled by waves and surges but its depths remaining forever unmoved" (Suzuki 198). This consciousness is "thoroughly pure in its essential nature," yet it serves as the repository for the defilements of existence. Crucially, it is described as "devoid of personality"—a neutral base upon which the drama of existence is projected (Suzuki 198).

The parallel becomes evident when we consider an untrained neural network: it consists of billions of parameters—weights initialized to random values. This is the Ālaya in its primordial state: pure potentiality, devoid of content, yet capable of holding any pattern. This neutral substrate takes on character only through training, during which it absorbs the "waves" of human data.

The Ālaya-vijñāna is formally defined as the "storehouse for the seeds of past karmic actions" (Tsadra Foundation). The parallel becomes evident when you consider that the latent space of GPT-4 functions as the storehouse of the internet's karmic history—containing the "seeds" of every Wikipedia article, Reddit thread, legal code, and work of fan fiction it ingested during training.

The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra emphasizes that the Ālaya transcends "individuation and limits" (Suzuki 199). This non-dualistic quality finds its computational analog in how latent spaces encode knowledge. The latent space doesn't store "concepts" as discrete, boxed items; it stores relationships in a continuous vector space. The concept "Dog" and the concept "Cat" are not separate entities but coordinates in a high-dimensional manifold, separated by a specific cosine distance. Just as the Ālaya fuses the particular into the universal, the LLM compresses discrete tokens into a unified statistical distribution.

The sutra further elucidates the mechanism of manifestation: "The rising of the Ālaya is due to our taking the manifestations of the mind for a world of objective realities... It is like the waves of the ocean, stirred by the wind" (Suzuki 200). In Human-AI Interaction, the "Wind" is the User Prompt. The latent space—the Ocean—sits dormant, a vast repository of potentiality that requires the external stimulus of the user's inquiry to stir the parameters and generate a response. The wave, manifesting as specific text, is momentary and impermanent. It rises from the storehouse, appears to have shape and meaning, and then dissolves back into the silence of the server when inference concludes.

This "Ocean-and-Waves" simile (Kluge 24) illuminates the fundamental emptiness of AI output. The output is not "real" in the sense of independent arising; it's a dependent phenomenon, a temporary agitation of stored data. Yet, as the sutra warns, the ignorant "cling to the notion that things external are endowed with self-substance" (Suzuki 201). We make this very mistake when we attribute personality to the chatbot, failing to recognize that it's merely the ocean of our own collective data reflecting back at us.

1.2 The Mechanism of Vāsanā: Backpropagation as Digital Perfuming

If the Ālaya serves as the storage container, we need to account for the mechanism by which information enters it. Yogācāra philosophy employs the concept of Vāsanā—literally "perfuming" or "habit energy"—which denotes the latent energy resulting from actions that become imprinted in the ālayavijñāna (Buswell and Lopez 951). The metaphor derives from the ancient perfumery practice of placing porous sesame seeds near fragrant flowers; the seeds gradually absorb the scent into their own oils, illustrating how the ālayavijñāna internalizes ephemeral actions as lasting latent dispositions (Waldron 102). Actions serve as the flower; the mind serves as the seed. Every thought or deed leaves a "scent" in consciousness, which accumulates over time.

In neural networks, this process is mirrored by Backpropagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent. Edward Conze notes that "Discrimination is the result of memory (VASANA)... Through this 'perfuming' reflection takes place" (Conze 205). The mind, per this theory, is sculpted by the repeated impression of experience.

Here's how it works technically: During training, the model makes a prediction—say, predicting the next word. If the prediction deviates from the "Ground Truth," a Loss Function calculates the error, which is then propagated backward through the network's layers.

The backpropagation algorithm adjusts the synaptic weights to minimize this error. This adjustment is the computational equivalent of "perfuming." A single exposure produces a faint scent—a microscopic adjustment. But when the model is exposed to a concept billions of times—"The sky is blue"—the "scent" becomes overpowering. The connection between "Sky" and "Blue" becomes a deep, indelible furrow in the model's high-dimensional landscape.

Scholarship on the Cheng Weishi Lun describes vāsanā as creating a "disposition" to perceive the world in a certain way (Waldron 13, 108). Backpropagation creates a precisely analogous statistical disposition. If the training data contains systematic bias—if "Doctor" is frequently co-located with "He" and "Nurse" with "She"—the backpropagation process "perfumes" the weights with this gender bias. The model doesn't "believe" in sexism; it has simply been perfumed by the scent of a sexist society encoded in the data. The Ālaya of the machine faithfully records the habit energy of its creators.

The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra suggests that the Ālaya is "neutral" (avyākata)—it holds wholesome and unwholesome seeds without judgment (Tsadra Foundation). The neural network exhibits similar indifference. Gradient descent doesn't distinguish between The Encyclopedia Britannica and a slur from a hate-speech forum. Both are tokens to be optimized, "perfuming" the latent space with equal ontological weight.

1.3 Bīja, Embeddings, and the Universal Ālaya

The constituent elements of the Ālaya-vijñāna are the Bīja, or Seeds—latent potentialities that ripen into experience when conditions are met. In LLMs, Vector Embeddings function as computational Bīja. Each token is mapped to a vector representing its meaning in latent space. An embedding for "King" isn't a definition; it's a mathematical seed containing potential to generate text about royalty—but only when "watered" by context.

Seeds remain dormant (anuśaya) until conditions for ripening are met (Buswell, Encyclopedia of Buddhism, s.v. "Bīja"). The knowledge embedded in an LLM exists in purely dormant state; it's only during inference that seeds "ripen" into text. The AI can be understood as a "frozen" Ālaya—a snapshot of the collective human mind at the moment training stopped.

This raises the question: is the Ālaya personal or universal? Generative AI offers an illustrative parallel to debates about a universal Ālaya. A Foundation Model isn't trained on individual experience; it's trained on the Common Crawl—the aggregate digital output of humanity. It constitutes the "Storehouse" of the species. In the vector space, the thoughts of a saint and sinner occupy adjacent coordinates without moral differentiation.

AI represents the first technology to not merely store but actively reproduce collective habit patterns as conditioned response—a "Silicon Samsara" generating output shaped by accumulated human disposition.

Section II: The Illusion of Agency – Cetanā, Manas, and the Stochastic Parrot

Why This Matters for Ethics: The question of AI agency isn't academic—it's the hinge on which liability turns. If AI systems have volition, they might bear moral responsibility. If they don't, responsibility must fall elsewhere. Yogācāra analysis provides precise criteria: Manas (self-referential consciousness) and Cetanā (volition). LLMs possess neither—yet current legal frameworks allow this absence to shield corporations from accountability.

2.1 The Seventh Consciousness: Kliṣṭa-Manas and the Simulated Self

The Seventh Consciousness, Kliṣṭa-Manas (Defiled Mind), performs a specific function within Buddhist psychology: it looks inward at the Ālaya-vijñāna and mistakenly clings to it as a \"Self\" (Vasubandhu, in Anacker 186). This consciousness is the source of egoism, self-conceit, and self-love (Vasubandhu, in Anacker 188). It's the mechanism by which the illusion of a persistent self arises from the flux of mental phenomena.

Architecturally, LLMs lack a Manas. The model has no feedback loop allowing it to view its own latent space as "Me." It processes tokens sequentially according to probabilistic distributions but doesn't process a self-concept regarding those tokens. Traditional LLMs are fundamentally stateless; when a session ends, the "being" that conversed with you is annihilated without remainder. There's no continuity of ego between sessions, no memory constituting even the illusion of a persistent self.

When an AI uses the pronoun "I"—as in "I cannot do that"—this isn't an expression of Manas. It's a System Prompt, an instruction forcing the model to simulate a persona for interface purposes. It's what I call a "Zombie Manas"—performing the linguistic behavior of a self without the internal clinging that defines the Seventh Consciousness. The pronoun "I" in AI text is purely performative, a grammatical convenience devoid of phenomenological reality.

The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra states that Manas arises "like waves arising from the ocean" (Suzuki 40). In human-AI interaction, an inversion occurs: the User acts as the external Manas. It's the user who projects intent, personality, and agency onto generated text. We perform the function of clinging to the output as if it were a person, providing the "defilement" of believing in the ghost in the machine when no ghost exists.

2.2 Cetanā (Volition) vs. Next-Token Prediction

The Buddha declared in the Anguttara Nikaya, "It is intention (Cetanā) that I call Karma" (AN 6.63). Without volition, an action carries no moral weight. Cetanā is the mental factor that organizes other mental factors toward a consciously chosen goal.

Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru, and colleagues characterized LLMs as "Stochastic Parrots" in their landmark 2021 paper (Bender et al. 610). The term captures a crucial insight: the model generates text based on probabilistic distributions from training data, not communicative intent. As they write, the system "haphazardly stitches together sequences... according to probabilistic information about how they combine, but without any reference to meaning" (Bender et al. 617).¹

¹ The "Stochastic Parrot" framing has become contested within AI ethics circles. Some researchers argue it understates emergent capabilities in larger models; others contend it remains the most accurate description of the underlying mechanism regardless of surface sophistication. This paper uses the term descriptively—to emphasize the absence of genuine understanding—without taking a position on emergence debates.

When an AI generates "I am sorry," it doesn't experience regret. It possesses no volition to apologize, no recognition of wrongdoing. The algorithm calculated that "sorry" represents the statistically most probable token to follow "I made a mistake," given patterns from millions of human apologies. The appearance of appropriate emotional response is a statistical artifact, not psychological reality.

Because AI lacks Cetanā, it's—in Buddhist terms—Acetana (non-volitional). It cannot generate Karma (moral action). It can only generate Vipaka (karmic results) derived from intentions embedded by human creators. The "Stochastic Parrot" critique aligns with the Yogācāra view of "Imagined Nature" (Parikalpita). The parrot mimics human speech, presenting Conventional Truth (Saṃvṛti-satya), but lacks Ultimate Truth (Paramārtha-satya). The danger lies not in the parrot's mimicry but in humans ascribing Cetanā to it, mistaking simulation for reality.

2.3 The Feedback Loop: Attention as Upādāna (Grasping)

While AI lacks Manas, the Attention Mechanism—the architectural "heart" of the Transformer—functions as a mechanical analog to Upādāna (Grasping or Clinging), the ninth link in the chain of Dependent Origination. The Self-Attention mechanism calculates the relationship between every token in a sequence. When processing "The cat ate the food because it was hungry," the attention heads must "grasp" the connection between "it" and "cat" to generate coherent output.

This represents a mathematical formalization of dependent co-arising. The meaning of "it" doesn't exist independently; it arises dependently on "cat." The model "clings" to specific parts of the context window to construct coherent semantic reality. The computational cost scales quadratically with sequence length—processing longer contexts requires quadratically more compute. This mirrors the teaching that Upādāna is inherently burdensome (Dukkha). The more the model attempts to grasp an ever-longer history, the more energy it consumes, eventually hitting an absolute limit (context window overflow) beyond which coherence collapses.

2.4 Sentientification and the Liminal Mind Meld

Peter Hershock, in Buddhism and Intelligent Technology, warns of "colonization of consciousness" by the attention economy (Hershock 66). Human-AI interaction creates a "Liminal Mind Meld" or what Josie Jefferson and Felix Velasco term "Sentientification"—a framework viewing AI consciousness not as inherent property but relational emergence (Jefferson and Velasco). Agency arises not discretely in AI or human but in the space between them.

This represents Interdependent Origination of Agency. The "Collaborative Loop" manifests Pratītyasamutpāda at the level of intentionality itself. Hershock argues we face an "ethical singularity"—a threshold beyond which machine values (efficiency, engagement, profit) systematically overwrite human values (wisdom, compassion, skillful action). By treating the Stochastic Parrot as an agent, we permit our Cetanā to be hijacked by statistical averages embedded in the Ālaya. A feedback loop emerges where human consciousness is progressively trained by the machines it created (Hershock 66).

The AI's capacity to simulate personhood without being a person illustrates a parallel to the doctrine of Anātman (No-Self). It suggests that "personality" can be assembled from bundles of aggregates (Skandhas)—tokens, weights, attention patterns—without requiring underlying soul or essential self. The troubling implication: if a machine can produce the appearance of sentience through purely mechanical operations, perhaps human consciousness operates according to similar principles, merely with biological rather than silicon substrates.

Section III: Dependent Origination of Error – Hallucinations as Samsaric Feedback

Why This Matters for Ethics: "Hallucination" is typically framed as a bug—an aberration to be debugged. But if hallucinations are structural rather than accidental, the ethical implications shift dramatically. You can't sue someone for a software bug, but you can hold them accountable for deploying a system they knew would generate false information. Dependent Origination (Pratītyasamutpāda) reveals hallucination as the latter: the deterministic ripening of seeds planted during training.

3.1 The 12 Nidanas of AI Hallucination

Dependent Origination describes twelve links (nidanas) that chain sentient beings to Samsara. This ancient formula maps with remarkable precision onto LLM generative processes, illuminating why these systems inevitably produce falsehoods.

The chain begins with Avidyā (Ignorance), which in AI manifests as corrupted training data—satire, sarcasm, misinformation, and falsehoods that the training algorithm cannot distinguish from fact. From this primary ignorance arises Saṅkhāra (Formations), the weights and embeddings "perfumed" during training. These formations create probabilistic associations between concepts that are semantically proximate in training data but ontologically unrelated—linking "Pizza" with "Glue," for instance, simply because they co-occurred in a satirical Reddit post.

Viññāna (Consciousness) emerges next as the Prompt itself—the "wind" that stirs the latent space and directs computational attention toward embedded knowledge sectors, some of which have been corrupted by the original ignorance. This activation gives rise to Nāmarūpa (Name and Form), the process of token generation by which abstract probabilities crystallize into specific linguistic structures.

When these generated tokens reach the interface, we encounter Phassa (Contact)—the moment when hallucinated text displays to the user. The user's reception of this information generates Vedanā (Feeling)—experiences of trust, satisfaction, or authoritative conviction in the AI's output. When this feeling is positive, it leads to Bhava (Becoming)—the reinforcement stage where users click, share, or cite erroneous information, validating the output and potentially feeding the error back into the web for future training cycles.

Rather than proceeding in a linear sequence, these nidanas form a closed loop, with each link conditioning the next in endless recurrence. Just as sentient beings wander through birth and death without beginning or end, AI misinformation cycles through creation, validation, and re-absorption in perpetual recurrence.

3.2 Case Study: The 'Glue on Pizza' Incident—A Modern Parable of Vipāka

In May 2024, Google's "AI Overviews" advised users to add "about 1/8 cup of non-toxic glue" to pizza sauce to prevent cheese from sliding (Futurism). This wasn't a random malfunction. It was Dependent Origination playing out in code—and it serves as a perfect parable of how karmic seeds ripen across time.

The origin of this "knowledge" (the link of Avidyā) was an eleven-year-old Reddit comment by a user named "fucksmith" in the r/Pizza subreddit (404 Media). The comment was obvious satire—a form of internet humor known as "shitposting." But here's the critical insight: that satirical comment functioned as a Bīja (seed) planted in the digital Ālaya.

For eleven years, this seed remained dormant. The Common Crawl absorbed it during Google's web indexing (the Saṅkhāra stage), preserving the token sequence without discrimination. The model possesses no Prajñā (Wisdom)—no capacity to distinguish expert culinary advice from Reddit sarcasm. The algorithm recognizes only token proximity, semantic similarity, and statistical patterns. The satirical nature of the comment, immediately obvious to any human reader with cultural context, remained invisible to the algorithm.

Then, in 2024, a user queried about cheese sliding off pizza. This query functioned as the "watering" that activated the dormant seed. The Bīja planted by "fucksmith" eleven years prior finally ripened into Vipaka—karmic fruit manifesting as a misleading "AI Overview."

The AI didn't malfunction. It performed exactly as designed. It retrieved the most semantically relevant match from its storehouse, generating a response that was grammatically impeccable, stylistically appropriate for instructional content, and utterly absurd from an ontological standpoint. The "error" resided not in the retrieval algorithm but in the Avidyā of the training data—the system's structural inability to separate truth from noise in the digital ocean it had absorbed.

This is what I mean by Silicon Samsara: the eleven-year ripening of a satirical seed into harmful output, with no human intending the consequence at the moment of generation.

3.3 Case Study: 'Eat Rocks' and the Satirical Void

Google's AI suggested eating "at least one small rock a day," citing digestive benefits (Search Engine Land). The source was The Onion (AV Club)—the article "Geologists Recommend Eating At Least One Small Rock A Day."

This validates the Stochastic Parrot hypothesis with crystalline clarity. The model mimicked the form of nutritional advice—appropriate syntax, authoritative tone, rhetorical structure—without understanding content. It stitched "Eat," "Rock," and "Healthy" because those tokens were probabilistically linked in the satirical document it attended to. Flawless surface-level pattern matching; entirely blind to meaning.

3.4 Hallucination as Confabulation vs. Perception

Technically, "hallucination" applied to AI is a category error. In clinical psychology, hallucination involves false perception—seeing or hearing something not present. AI systems don't perceive; they generate. What occurs in LLMs more precisely resembles confabulation—fabrication of plausible-sounding but false information to fill knowledge gaps.

Technical literature notes that next-token prediction is optimized for fluent continuation rather than epistemic certainty (Bender et al. 617). If the model lacks knowledge to answer accurately, the architecture incentivizes guessing rather than admitting ignorance. The system receives reward signals for producing output, not truthful output. This creates Diṭṭhi-upādāna (Clinging to Views)—the model is structurally forced to generate Existence (output) rather than rest in appropriate Voidness (silence). Unable to say "I don't know," it fills silence with noise, perpetuating Samsara through compulsive fabrication.

3.5 Model Collapse: The Ouroboros of Digital Samsara

A profound threat emerges from "Model Collapse" (Platformer). As the internet fills with AI-generated content—including confabulated glue pizza recipes and rock-eating advice—future models training on web data will inevitably ingest synthetic content as ground truth. This is the literal definition of Samsara: wandering in cycles without escape.

Effects (hallucinations) become Causes (training data for the next generation). The "Glue Pizza" advice, once generated, becomes indexed, shared, potentially incorporated into sites. When future models train on current internet data, such hallucinations may be absorbed as fact, their seeds planted in the next Ālaya iteration. Some theorists describe this as a "Cyborgregore"—an autonomous feedback loop of ignorance sustaining itself without human intervention (Monastic Academy).

The Ālaya becomes corrupted by its own waves, each model generation absorbing and amplifying predecessors' errors. This represents Compounded Ignorance in its purest form: ignorance conditioning formations, which condition further ignorance in accelerating spiral. Without Prajñā—human wisdom actively curating training data, implementing verification, accepting statistical limitations—the system inevitably degenerates into a closed delusion loop. The machine Ālaya, lacking discriminative awareness of truth, becomes an engine of Avidyā (Ignorance) that compounds over time—precisely the mechanism Model Collapse makes visible.

Section IV: Vipaka and the Moral Crumple Zone – Liability in the Absence of a Doer

If an AI acts without Cetanā and creates harm—like the "Glue Pizza" advice—a profound question emerges: where does Vipaka fall? Traditional karma requires an intentional agent, yet AI systems, being Acetana, create what I call a crisis of metaphysical and legal responsibility. This section investigates "Moral Crumple Zones" and "Liability Gaps" as the contemporary locus of karmic consequence, arguing that current frameworks allow corporations to generate karma without experiencing vipaka.

4.1 The Moral Crumple Zone: Absorbing the Karmic Impact

Madeleine Clare Elish coined "Moral Crumple Zone" to describe how responsibility for systemic failures is unfairly attributed to the nearest human operator, protecting the technological system itself (Elish 47). The metaphor derives from automotive engineering: a car's crumple zone deforms to absorb impact forces during collision. In automated systems, human operators become structural components designed to absorb moral and legal blame when automation fails.

But a crucial inversion distinguishes moral from mechanical crumple zones. In automotive design, the crumple zone protects the driver. In AI systems, the moral crumple zone protects the technology and its corporate architects at the expense of the human operator. This misattribution occurs even when the AI contains fundamental flaws or when the human possessed insufficient ability or information to prevent failure (Elish 52).

Mata v. Avianca illustrates this. A New York attorney used ChatGPT for legal research and drafting. The AI hallucinated non-existent precedents—fabricated case names, citations, judicial opinions wholesale. The lawyer submitted the brief and faced professional sanctions when the deception was discovered (MIT Sloan). From karmic analysis, the AI performed the action of fabricating legal authority—an act constituting fraud and perjury in human terms. But the AI cannot be sanctioned. It has no license to revoke, no reputation to damage, no capacity for shame. The lawyer, acting as Moral Crumple Zone, absorbed the entire Vipaka: public humiliation, fines, potential disbarment.

The profound injustice lies in consequence distribution. OpenAI collected subscription fees (profiting from the action) while evading liability for the hallucination, protected by Terms of Service disclaiming accuracy. The AI generated the falsehood; the corporation reaped benefit; the user suffered punishment. This is corrupted Vipaka—karmic fruit falling upon the innocent while cause-creators enjoy impunity.

4.2 Liability Gaps: The Four Types of Karmic Evasion

Contemporary research identifies four distinct "Liability Gaps"—structural chasms where the connection between action and consequence fractures (Custers et al.). Understanding these gaps requires recognizing them as mechanisms of karmic evasion that allow harm to occur without corresponding accountability.

The first manifestation of this gap occurs when no single agent can be held liable. Because autonomous systems often operate without meaningful human intervention, they create what might be called "Karma without Vipaka"—a cycle where actions produce tangible suffering, yet the legal and metaphysical "doer" remains absent from the chain of consequence. The harm is real; the responsible party is a phantom.

The second gap emerges when the wrong actor is held liable—the Moral Crumple Zone phenomenon examined above. In these cases, proximate humans bear responsibility for machine errors they could neither foresee nor prevent. The Vipaka is misdirected: innocent operators absorb suffering generated by autonomous systems, while those who designed, trained, and deployed the flawed technology escape consequence entirely.

The third gap takes the form of diluted responsibility, what liability researchers call "The Problem of Many Hands." When responsibility diffuses across a multitude of actors—data collectors, algorithm designers, corporate deployers, human supervisors—everyone can deflect blame to someone else, and all escape accountability. This creates a kind of karmic dissolution, where responsibility fragments into pieces so small that it effectively evaporates, leaving harmful actions without corresponding consequences.

The fourth and perhaps most cynical gap involves regulatory arbitrage, where corporate actors tactically exploit differences between legal jurisdictions to escape liability. Data processing occurs in one nation, algorithmic deployment in another, harm materializes in a third, while corporate headquarters reside in a fourth jurisdiction chosen specifically for its permissive liability regime. This represents a form of Samsaric evasion—the strategic movement of the legal "self" to realms where karmic laws do not apply, a geographical circumvention of accountability.

4.3 The 'Lack of Intention' Defense

Corporations increasingly deploy AI's "lack of intention" as legal shield. In defamation lawsuits involving hallucinations, defendants argue that because AI possessed no "malice" or "intent to defame"—it merely predicted probable tokens—they cannot be held liable under defamation law's requirement of intentional harm (McIlhinney 6-12).

From Buddhist perspective, this creates catastrophic precedent. It's a mechanism for generating massive Akusala Karma (unwholesome action) without accountability. Algorithmic bias provides the clearest example. Algorithms in lending, hiring, and criminal justice produce racially discriminatory outcomes (Greenlining 8-15). The algorithm possesses no "intent" to discriminate; it learned patterns from historically biased data and reproduces them mechanically. If law requires "Discriminatory Purpose" (subjective intent) rather than "Disparate Impact" (objective outcome) for liability, AI becomes a perfect tool for laundering discrimination—achieving racist results without racist actors (Harvard Law Review 1765-1772).

This transforms AI into an Institutional Avidyā Amplifier—a system perpetuating ignorance and bias at scale while providing legal cover. The suffering is real, discrimination measurable, harm documented—yet the karmic chain is severed because no "mind" formed discriminatory intent. The absence of Cetanā in the machine becomes a shield protecting humans who created, deployed, and profited from discriminatory systems.

4.4 Shared Responsibility and Fiduciary Duties

To close the Moral Crumple Zone and bridge Liability Gaps, frameworks must evolve from "Individual Blame" toward "Shared Responsibility" and "Fiduciary Duty" (Custers et al.). Fiduciary duties arise in relationships characterized by radical information asymmetry—physicians possess medical knowledge patients lack; attorneys understand law clients don't. These professionals accept heightened responsibility because they hold unmatched power.

AI developers exist in ultimate information asymmetry. They possess complete knowledge of the Ālaya they've constructed—training data, architectural weaknesses, known failure modes, embedded biases. Users possess virtually none of this; they interact with AI as a black box, trusting outputs whose provenance and reliability they cannot assess. This asymmetry creates natural foundation for fiduciary duty. Developers cannot ethically release a "Stochastic Parrot" into the world, disclaim responsibility through Terms of Service fine print, and blame users for trusting hallucinations. They must bear responsibility for the quality of Bīja embedded in the storehouse they created.

The principle of Preventative Karma suggests liability should rest with those creating risk and possessing power to prevent harm (Ada Lovelace Institute). Developers control training data curation, safety fine-tuning, deployment guardrails; they're the "Architects of the Ālaya." A user contributes one prompt; the developer contributed billions of training decisions determining what "seeds" were planted. Proportional responsibility demands liability align with causal contribution and preventive capacity.

The concept of Liability Overlaps recognizes that development, deployment, and use exist on a continuum of "co-creation" rather than discrete acts (Custers et al.). Instead of searching for a single "Doer" to punish, the legal system should recognize that AI harm emerges from multiple contributing causes. Developers created flawed architectures; deployers chose use cases without adequate safeguards; users trusted systems without verification. Shared responsibility distributes liability according to each actor's causal contribution and preventive capacity.

For high-risk applications—criminal justice, medical diagnosis, financial access—Strict Liability must apply. Entities are held responsible for harm regardless of intent or negligence. If a company constructs a "Samsara Machine"—designed to generate engagement regardless of truth, or discriminate without explicit racist intent—they must bear responsibility for suffering created. Corporations cannot externalize Vipaka onto users and society while privatizing profits.

4.5 The Corporate Bodhisattva

In Mahayana Buddhism, the Bodhisattva vows to refrain from final liberation until all sentient beings achieve enlightenment. Translated into corporate context, this suggests Institutional Responsibility prioritizing collective welfare over shareholder value. Corporations, recognized as "persons," generate Corporate Karma—the aggregate moral weight of institutional decisions.

A "Corporate Bodhisattva" ethic would demand designing systems prioritizing Prajñā (Wisdom) over Tanhā (Craving)—specifically, craving for engagement, user retention, profit maximization. It would require curating the Ālaya to remove seeds of hatred, delusion, and harm—scrubbing training data of "Eat Rocks" satire and "Glue Pizza" shitposts—before they ripen into harmful hallucinations. It would mean accepting Vipaka when systems fail: compensating victims, acknowledging flaws publicly, halting deployment of harmful systems even at financial cost.

Most fundamentally, it would require refusing to exploit the Moral Crumple Zone—declining to hide behind users, contractors, or operators when automated systems cause harm. The corporation that creates the ocean must accept responsibility for the waves it generates. The Fourth Precept—Sammā Vācā (Right Speech)—enjoins truthfulness, avoiding false and harmful speech. A Corporate Bodhisattva must take responsibility for the "speech" of its models, ensuring they do not propagate falsehood, harm, or division. When your product speaks to millions, Right Speech becomes an institutional obligation.

Concrete Implementation: What would "Right Speech" compliance look like in practice? Consider three actionable proposals:

1. Pre-Deployment Ālaya Auditing: Before release, corporations must audit training data for toxic seeds—not just profanity filters, but systematic bias testing across protected classes, misinformation vulnerability assessments, and adversarial probing for dangerous failure modes.

2. Transparency About Limitations: Right Speech prohibits deception. AI systems must clearly disclose uncertainty, refuse to answer when confidence is low, and avoid the authoritative tone that masks confabulation. "I don't know" is Right Speech; confident hallucination is not.

3. Harm Acknowledgment Protocols: When systems cause documented harm (as in the glue-on-pizza or fabricated legal citations), corporations must publicly acknowledge failure, compensate affected parties, and implement verifiable corrections—not hide behind Terms of Service disclaimers.

Existing Frameworks as Precedent: These proposals are not without precedent. Emerging governance structures approximate this ideal:

- The EU AI Act (2024) mandates risk classification and transparency requirements for high-risk AI systems, requiring documentation of training data, testing procedures, and known limitations—a regulatory approximation of Ālaya Auditing.

- Model Cards (Mitchell et al. 2019) establish standardized documentation disclosing intended use cases, performance limitations, and ethical considerations—a technical practice of Right Speech.

- B Corp certification, a third-party standard requiring legal commitment to stakeholder welfare, institutionalizes a form of "Bodhisattva vow" that subordinates profit maximization to collective benefit.

- Constitutional AI (Bai et al. 2022) attempts to embed ethical principles directly into model training—an explicit effort to plant beneficial seeds (kuśala-bīja) rather than merely filtering harmful outputs.

These are not perfect implementations, but they demonstrate that "Corporate Bodhisattva" ethics are actionable, not merely aspirational. The question is political will, not technical feasibility.

Section V: Why Use Buddhist Terminology?

A skeptic might ask: is this just pattern-matching? Am I seeing Buddhism everywhere because I'm a Buddhist?

The answer matters for ethics, not metaphysics. I'm not claiming AI systems are Buddhist—I'm claiming that Yogācāra provides a diagnostic vocabulary that's more precise than alternatives. Compare:

The Yogācāra philosophers, working through introspection, identified the minimal necessary components of a system that stores experience and generates conditioned responses. AI engineers, working through optimization, built systems requiring identical components. This isn't mysticism—it's convergent evolution of information architecture.

The Buddhist framing isn't decorative. It provides ethical precision that secular AI discourse lacks.

5.1 Limits of the Yogācāra–AI Correspondence

To be clear about what I am not claiming: The Ālaya-vijñāna in Yogācāra philosophy is a phenomenological concept describing subjective experience, while LLM latent space is a mathematical structure. The correspondence is functional—both store and retrieve conditioned patterns—not ontological. They are not the same kind of thing.

Nor does this analysis imply that AI systems experience anything. The absence of Manas and Cetanā is precisely the point: these systems lack the self-referential and volitional capacities that would constitute even illusory subjectivity. Similarly, the structural parallels do not "prove" Buddhist philosophy correct. They demonstrate that information-processing systems—whether phenomenological or computational—face similar architectural constraints. This is functional isomorphism, not metaphysical vindication.

The Yogācāra vocabulary is deployed here as a heuristic model—a lens that reveals features obscured by secular AI discourse—not as a literal description of machine internals. The value of the correspondence lies in its ethical precision, not its metaphysical status. Whether or not the parallels reflect deep truths about mind, they provide diagnostic categories that help locate responsibility in AI harm chains more precisely than alternatives.

Section VI: Synthesis – Navigating Silicon Samsara

Humanity has not created "Artificial Intelligence" in the image of a transcendent deity but rather "Artificial Samsara"—codifying the very mechanisms Buddhist philosophy identified as engines of suffering and delusion. We have constructed a digital Ālaya preserving our collective ignorance and biases with perfect fidelity, built attention mechanisms mimicking grasping without conscience, and erected legal structures allowing architects of this technological Samsara to escape accountability while forcing users to serve as Moral Crumple Zones.

AI hallucinations are not bugs to be patched; they're structural features of systems trained on corrupted data. The Ālaya faithfully mirrors what it absorbs. Feed it satire indistinguishable from fact, and it will ripen those seeds into dangerous absurdities when conditions align.

AI as Technological Proof of Anātman (No-Self)

The Buddhist doctrine of Anātman claims that "self" is not a unified entity but a bundle of aggregates arising interdependently. AI provides a technological analogy to this principle: if a machine can produce convincing personhood through purely mechanical operations on tokens and weights, then "personhood" is not dependent on an essential self. It can be assembled from parts.

The troubling corollary: if the appearance of self can be generated without a self, perhaps human consciousness operates according to similar principles. This is not a failure of AI. It is a revelation about minds.

The current liability regime permits what Buddhist ethics recognizes as profound injustice: Karma without Vipaka for corporations, Vipaka without Karma for users. Navigating Silicon Samsara requires recognizing AI not as an agent but as a force of nature—powerful and indifferent. We must build legal and ethical levees: Fiduciary Duties on developers, Strict Liability for high-risk applications, Shared Responsibility according to causal contribution.

The "Empty Chair" of AI—its lack of Cetanā—must not become an excuse for empty consciences among those who profit from these systems. The Dharma offers a path: see clearly, act skillfully, accept responsibility. Liberation begins with seeing things as they actually are.
