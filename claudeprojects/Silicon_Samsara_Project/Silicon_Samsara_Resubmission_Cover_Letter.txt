Dear Dr. Jenkins,

Thank you for your preliminary review of "Silicon Samsara: The Phenomenology of Artificial Latency and the Ethics of Algorithmic Karma" and the opportunity to resubmit.

I have addressed both concerns from your feedback:

**1. Page Numbers:** All citations now include specific page numbers where ideas or quotes are referenced. I have conducted a comprehensive citation audit to ensure proper attribution throughout.

**2. Narrative Form:** The manuscript has been restructured from outline format into flowing academic prose. All bullet-pointed sections have been converted to integrated paragraphs suitable for scholarly publication.

Additionally, I have replaced informal web sources with scholarly references where possible and standardized citation formatting throughout the Works Cited section.

The revised manuscript maintains the original analytical content—the synthesis of Yogācāra phenomenology with contemporary AI ethics—while meeting JBE's formatting standards.

Thank you for the constructive feedback.

Sincerely,

William Altig
