# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 181-190 (Practical Blues)

## 181. Don't Lie, but Don't Overshare.
Lying kills your reputation instantly. But that doesn't mean you have to tell everyone everything. Keep some cards face down. Not everyone deserves to know your whole heart.

## 182. Have Some Balls.
A little bit of boldness goes a long way. Don't be "frozen" by fear. A dash of audacity is the secret ingredient in every major success.

## 183. Don't Be a Wall.
Being firm is good; being a statue is stupid. You have to be able to pivot when the market or the situation changes. If you refuse to move, you'll eventually be knocked down. Adapt or die.

## 184. Skip the Red Tape.
Don't be the guy who cares more about the "rules" and the "ceremony" than the results. Don't let etiquette get in the way of business. Get to the point.

## 185. Don't Go All In.
Never bet your whole life on one deal. If it fails, you're finished. Break it down. Take smaller risks. Always keep some chips on the table for the next round.

## 186. Know the Crazy of Your Time.
Every decade has its own flavor of nonsense—fads, cults, bad ideas. Figure out what the current "crazy" is so you don't get swept up in it. Stay grounded in common sense.

## 187. Give the Good News, Outsource the Bad.
If you're giving out raises, do it in person. If you're firing someone, let HR do it. Be the guy associated with the wins and the favors. Let someone else be the "bad guy."

## 188. Talk People Up.
Be the guy who notices when someone else is crushing it. It makes you look confident, not jealous. And when you praise others, they'll usually return the favor.

## 189. Use the "Need" Factor.
Figure out what people are missing in their lives—respect, money, excitement. If you can provide what they need, you own their loyalty. "Need" is the ultimate leverage.

## 190. Find the Silver Lining.
There’s a win in every loss if you look hard enough. Don't just sit there crying over the "gall"; look for the "honey." A positive mindset is a strategic advantage.
