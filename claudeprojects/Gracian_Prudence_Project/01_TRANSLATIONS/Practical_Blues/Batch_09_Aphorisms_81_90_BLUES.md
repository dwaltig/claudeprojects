# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 81-90 (Practical Blues)

## 81. Rebrand.
Even the best show gets old. If people get used to you, they stop clapping. You need a "Phoenix" moment. Reinvent yourself. Change the game. Go away for a while so they miss you, then come back with something new.

## 82. Leave Some Juice in the Orange.
Don't squeeze everything dry. If you push a good thing too far, it turns bad. If you work too hard, you burn out. If you party too hard, you crash. Moderation isn't boring; it's sustainable. "Don't milk the cow until it bleeds."

## 83. Make a Mistake on Purpose.
If you're too perfect, people hate you. They can't relate to a god. So, drop the ball once in a while. Have a harmless flaw. Let them criticize your tie so they don't attack your soul. Throw the bull a cape so it doesn't gore the matador.

## 84. Use Your Haters.
Your enemies are your best quality control. Friends lie to make you feel good; enemies tell you exactly where you suck. Listen to them. Fix the flaws they point out. Let their hate make you perfect.

## 85. Don't Be the Utility Guy.
The "Malilla" is the wild card—useful everywhere, respected nowhere. If you're available for everything, you're special to no one. Don't be the office handyman. Be the specialist. Scarcity creates value.

## 86. Kill the Rumor.
One bad joke can ruin a reputation. The mob loves a scandal. If you give them a reason to laugh at you, you're finished. Spot the rumor early and crush it. Prevention is easier than the cure.

## 87. Get Polished.
Nobody likes a roughneck. You might be a diamond, but if you're covered in dirt, you look like a rock. Cultivate yourself. Dress well, speak well, act well. "Culture" isn't just about museums; it's about not being a barbarian.

## 88. Don't Sweat the Small Stuff.
Great men don't count pennies. Don't be the guy who argues over the tip or corrects every typo. It makes you look small. Ignore the minor slights. Let things slide. It's called "noble generality."

## 89. Know Your Stats.
You need to know your own character sheet. What's your IQ? What's your stamina? What triggers your anger? You can't run the machine if you don't know the specs. Look in the mirror—the real one.

## 90. The Secret to Long Life.
Don't be stupid, and don't be evil. Vice kills you fast (drugs, stress, enemies). Virtue keeps you chill. A good life feels longer because it's actually worth living. If you want to live forever, leave a legacy.
