# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 201-210 (Practical Blues)

## 201. Assume Everyone is Stupid.
If someone looks like an idiot, they are. But half the people who look smart are actually idiots too. Real wisdom starts with knowing how much you don't know. If you think you've got it all figured out, you're the mark.

## 202. Talk the Talk, Walk the Walk.
Being a smooth talker is great for the head; being a high-level doer is great for the heart. You need both to be the real deal. Let your results be your loudest argument.

## 203. Recognize the Heavy Hitters.
True greatness is rare. Don't be fooled by the hype of the "pretty good" guys. When you see a real Phoenix—a once-in-a-century talent—pay attention.

## 204. Stay Focused, Stay Chill.
When a job looks easy, don't get lazy—treat it like it's a monster. When a job looks impossible, don't panic—treat it like a walk in the park. Diligence makes the hard stuff easy.

## 205. Play Hard to Get.
If you chase something too hard, it runs away. The best way to get what you want is to act like you don't really need it. When you stop acting desperate, the world starts coming to you.

## 206. Bums are Everywhere.
Having a fancy office or a big title doesn't mean someone isn't a "vulgar" soul. Don't trust someone just because they're important. The mob is always wrong, no matter what they're wearing.

## 207. Don't Blow Your Top.
Self-control is your internal brake system. If you just react to every insult or every problem, you’re going to crash. You need that buffer of logic.

## 208. Don't Die Over Nothing.
Fools die of stress and taking things too personally. Don't let your own head kill you. Grow a thicker skin. Learn to tolerate mistakes and keep moving.

## 209. Quit the Hive Mind.
The "common opinion" is usually just a shared hallucination. Break out of the box. Look under the surface. Truth isn't found in a crowd; it's found in thinking for yourself.

## 210. Tell the Truth, but Be Careful.
The truth is like a loaded gun—you don't just wave it around. You have to know when to use it and who to use it on. Learn to package it and time it.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 211-220 (Practical Blues)

## 211. Don't Be a Hater Magnet.
If everyone is taking shots at you, you're doing something wrong. Sometimes being "unlucky" is just a polite way of saying you're an idiot. Build a shield of respect so the haters don't even try it.

## 212. Don't Flex.
The more you show off, the less people actually respect you. If you have to tell everyone you're a boss, you're probably not. Let your skills speak for themselves. The best moves look like you weren't even trying.

## 213. Master the "Strategic No."
Sometimes you have to disagree with someone just to see where they stand. It’s a way to test their will and keep them from taking you for granted.

## 214. Don't Be a Wall.
If you're impossible to talk to, you're impossible to help. Inaccessibility isn't power; it's just being a jerk. Keep the door open for advice from people you trust.

## 215. Watch the High-Pressure Salesman.
Beware the guy who tries to rush you or pressure you into a deal. Don't let someone else's stress become your problem. Use your own logic as a brake.

## 216. Learn from Other People's Screw-ups.
When you see someone else mess up, don't just laugh—study it. Figure out how to turn their failure into your advantage. A genius learns from everyone else's mistakes.

## 217. Be Consistent.
Don't be the guy who's a hero on Monday and a flake on Tuesday. If people can't predict what you're going to do, they won't trust you with the big stuff.

## 218. Skip the Fake Pomp.
Too much ceremony is just a mask for a lack of substance. Be polite, but don't be a suck-up. Real respect doesn't need a three-page introduction.

## 219. Don't Put It All on Red.
Never gamble your whole brand on one move. If you miss, you're done. Diversify your risks. Take small steps. Always keep something in the tank.

## 220. Stay a Little Hungry.
If you have everything you ever wanted, you're finished. Happiness is a trap if it stops you from moving. Save a little bit of "want" for tomorrow.

# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 231-240 (Practical Blues)

## 231. Don't Show Your Work Until It's Finished.
Nobody wants to see the messy middle. If you show a client or a boss a half-baked project, they'll only see the flaws. Wait until it's polished.

## 232. Be Real.
Theoretical brilliance is useless if you don't know how to navigate the real world. Don't be a genius on paper and a disaster in person. Have some "street smarts."

## 233. Don't Gloat Over Someone Else's Failures.
It’s petty and it makes you look small. Instead of celebrating their mistake, figure out how to avoid making it yourself. Focus on your own game.

## 234. Don't Put All Your Chips on One Number.
If that number doesn't come up, you're broke. Diversify. Have multiple streams of income and multiple connections.

## 235. Master the Ask.
Knowing how to ask for a favor or a raise is 90% of the battle. Timing is everything. Find the right moment, the right words, and the right person.

## 236. Turn a Favor into an Asset.
When someone does you a solid, don't just say thanks and forget it. Use that momentum. Let other people know you're "well-connected."

## 237. Speak for Yourself.
Don't just repeat what other people are saying. Have your own opinions. Being an "echo" is for people who can't think for themselves.

## 238. Know When You're Hot.
Success comes in waves. When you're on a winning streak, double down. When you're cold, back off. Learn to recognize your own "Lucky Star."

## 239. Don't Care What People Think.
The "many" are usually idiots. If you base your self-worth on popular opinion, you're letting fools run your life. Be your own judge.

## 240. Weaponize the Insults.
When someone tries to slide you, don't get mad. Figure out how to use it. Turn their "slights" into your weapons.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 241-250 (Practical Blues)

## 241. Take a Joke, Don't Make One.
Being able to take a ribbing shows you've got class and a thick skin. But being the guy who's always making jokes at other people's expense is a fast way to get punched in the mouth.

## 242. Get the W.
Good intentions don't pay the rent. People only care if you won. If you win, nobody asks how you did it. Focus on the result.

## 243. Don't Be a 24/7 Guy.
Save some of yourself for *you*. If you're always available, you're a commodity. Have a private life. Keep some secrets.

## 244. Put People in Your Debt.
Do favors *before* you need them. It's much cheaper to buy loyalty with kindness than with cash. When you've already helped someone, they feel like they *have* to help you back.

## 245. Go Against the Grain.
Don't be afraid to be the only one in the room who sees the truth. The crowd is usually wrong. If everyone is zigging, look for the reason to zag.

## 246. Stop Apologizing.
If you haven't been called out, don't explain yourself. When you start making excuses, you're basically admitting you're guilty. Wait until they ask.

## 247. Use Their Hate.
When someone tries to slide you, don't get defensive—get offensive. Use their "slight" as a reason to be tougher or to move faster.

## 248. Don't Fall for the "Last Chance" Hype.
Salesmen love to tell you this is the "last one" or the "final offer." It's almost always a lie. Don't let the pressure of the "last" cloud your judgment.

## 249. Don't Be a Parrot.
If someone else is mad at a person, that's their problem. Don't adopt their beefs. Speak from your own experience, not from the gossip you heard.

## 250. Play Your Strengths.
Figure out when you're most "lucky" and go all in then. Don't fight the tide. If the universe is giving you a win, take it.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 251-260 (Practical Blues)

## 251. Work Like It’s All on You, Pray Like It’s All on Him.
Use every human resource, every trick, and every bit of effort as if no higher power exists. But have the faith that something bigger is moving the pieces.

## 252. Don't Give Away the Whole Store.
Don't be 100% available to 100% of the people. If you give everything you have to everyone, you’ll end up with nothing for yourself. Keep a private stash of your time.

## 253. Don't Be a Nitpicker.
Notice everything, but don't feel the need to comment on everything. Correcting every tiny mistake makes you look small. Let the small stuff slide so you can focus on the big wins.

## 254. Don't Ignore the "Small" Problems.
A tiny leak can sink a huge ship. If you let a "minor" evil in the door, it’ll bring its big brothers along later. Discard the bad cards early.

## 255. Drip-Feed the Favors.
Don't do everyone a massive favor all at once. Spread it out. Give a little now, a little later. It keeps people wanting more and keeps them in your debt longer.

## 256. Stay Strapped (With Prudence).
Always be ready for the idiots. They are everywhere and they are bold. Keep your guard up. Stay focused on the business at hand.

## 257. Don't Burn the Bridge Until You've Crossed It.
Never make a scene or a "rupture" unless you absolutely have to. A graceful exit is better than a loud explosion. If you have to leave, leave with your head high.

## 258. Find a Bodyguard for Your Reputation.
If things are going south, find someone else to share the blame. You can't lead if you're the only target for everyone's anger. Have a "shield" to take the heat.

## 259. Flip the Script.
When someone tries to insult you, turn it into a compliment. When they try to hurt you, turn it into a favor. Use their own energy to win.

## 260. Own Yourself.
If you belong to everyone else's opinions and moods, you don't belong to yourself. Be your own boss. Don't let someone else's bad day ruin yours.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 261-270 (Practical Blues)

## 261. Don't Be Stubborn About Being Wrong.
If you're heading in the wrong direction, turning around isn't weakness—it's intelligence. Admit the mistake, fix it, and move on.

## 262. Learn to Forget.
Your brain only has so much space. Don't fill it with old grudges or minor insults. If it doesn't help you win tomorrow, let it go today.

If you spend all your time talking about how great someone else is, you’re just their fan. Build your own brand. Focus on your own climb.

If people always pick on you, it’s because you let them. Build a reputation that makes people think twice before they slight you.

Do favors for people *before* they can do anything for you. It puts you in a position of power. It’s the cheapest way to buy loyalty.

If your friend hates someone, that doesn't mean you have to. Don't be the "echo" of someone else's drama. Stay neutral.

Recognize when things are going your way and press the bet. If luck is on your side, don't walk away. Know your own "Star."

When someone tries to slide you, turn it into a win. Turn their "slights" into your advantages.

## 270. Keep Your Hunger.
Don't get too comfortable. Happiness is a trap if it stops you from moving. Always leave a little something "to desire."
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 271-280 (Practical Blues)

# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 281-290 (Practical Blues)

If you spend all your time talking about how great someone else is, you're just their PR agent. Build your own brand. Acknowledge their success, but don't let their fame eclipse yours.

Learn to delete the trash in your head. Grudges and small insults are just dead weight. If it doesn't help you win tomorrow, let it go today.
