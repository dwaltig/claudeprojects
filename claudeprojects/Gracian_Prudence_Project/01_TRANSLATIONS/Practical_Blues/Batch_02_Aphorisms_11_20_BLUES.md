# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 11-20 (Practical Blues)

## 11. Pick Your Crew Wisely.
Your friends shouldn't just be fun; they should be upgrades. Hang out with people who are already where you want to be. If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room. Turn every conversation into a free masterclass.

## 12. Polish the Diamond.
Natural talent is cool, but it's raw. Without "Art"—without discipline, style, and polish—you're just a rough stone. Nature gives you the material; you have to do the work. Don't be a barbarian with potential; be a masterpiece.

## 13. The Head Fake.
Life is war. The other guy is trying to read your mind. So, fake left, go right. Sometimes, fake left, *go left*. Keep them guessing. If they think they know your move, you're dead.

## 14. Style Matters.
It's not what you do; it's how you do it. You can be right and still lose if you're an asshole about it. A smooth "no" is better than a rough "yes." Good manners are the WD-40 of life—they stop the friction.

## 15. Rent a Brain.
You can't know everything. The smartest move a boss makes is hiring people smarter than him. Let them do the heavy lifting. Why study for twenty years when you can hire the guy who already did? That’s the ultimate leverage.

## 16. Don't Be an Evil Genius.
Smart + Good = Success. Smart + Evil = A Monster. If you use your brain to hurt people, you're just a weaponized idiot. Eventually, it blows up in your face.

## 17. Don't Be Predictable.
If you always do the same thing, they'll build a trap for you. Switch it up. Don't have a "signature move." Your only signature should be winning.

## 18. The Grind.
Talent is cheap. Hustle pays the bills. A mediocre guy who works hard will beat a lazy genius every day of the week. If you have both talent and hustle? You're unstoppable.

## 19. Undersell, Overdeliver.
Hype is a trap. If you walk in with everyone expecting a miracle, you're doomed. Even if you're great, they'll be disappointed. Lower the bar, then clear it by a mile.

## 20. Timing is Everything.
Some people are born too early; some too late. You might be a genius in a world of idiots. Don't sweat it. If you don't fit your time, make your work timeless. The game might be rigged against you right now, but quality lasts forever.
