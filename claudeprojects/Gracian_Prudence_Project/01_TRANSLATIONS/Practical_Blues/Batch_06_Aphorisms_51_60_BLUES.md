# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 51-60 (Practical Blues)

## 51. Pick a Lane.
Life is just a series of choices. If you have bad taste, you're doomed. Some smart guys always pick the losing team or the crazy girl. Don't be that guy. Choosing well is a talent. Cultivate it.

## 52. Never Lose Your Cool.
If you panic, you lose. A real boss never looks rattled. Even if the building is burning down, walk out slowly. People trust the guy who doesn't flinch.

## 53. Think Fast, Move Faster.
Fools rush in blind. Smart guys overthink and freeze. The trick is the middle: Think it through, then execute immediately. "Make haste slowly." Don't leave anything for tomorrow.

## 54. Show Your Teeth.
If people think you're soft, they'll eat you alive. If you back down once, you'll be backing down forever. Fight the first battle hard so you don't have to fight the next ten. Be the bee: honey for friends, sting for enemies.

## 55. The Waiting Game.
Patience is a weapon. Most people crack under silence or delay. If you can wait, you can win. "Time and I against any two." Let the other guy rush and make a mistake.

## 56. Think on Your Feet.
Some guys need a week to prepare; others are better when the heat is on. If you're an "impromptu" guy, trust your gut. Don't overthink it. Your first instinct is usually the killer one.

## 57. Built to Last.
Quick fixes fall apart. If you want to build an empire, it takes time. Don't rush the foundation. "Done fast" is forgotten; "Done right" is forever.

## 58. Don't Overshoot.
Don't use a cannon to kill a mosquito. It looks desperate. Save your big guns for the big fights. If you show everything you've got on day one, you're boring by day two. Keep something in the tank.

## 59. Stick the Landing.
Everyone loves a grand entrance, but the exit is what they remember. Don't be the guy who stays too long at the party. Leave while they still want more. A bad ending ruins a good story.

## 60. Born Wise.
Some people just have common sense encoded in their DNA. If that's you, use it. Trust your gut over the "latest trends." In serious business, stability beats creativity every time.
