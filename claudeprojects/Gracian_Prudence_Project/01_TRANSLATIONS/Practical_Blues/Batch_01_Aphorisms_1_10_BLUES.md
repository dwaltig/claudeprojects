# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 1-10 (Practical Blues)

## 1. The Bar is Higher Now.
Back in the day, being smart was easy. Now? Every single person you meet is a game of chess. To be a real "Individual" today, you gotta bring seven times the heat.

## 2. Brains and Vibe.
You need both. If you're smart but you've got no soul, you're halfway to nowhere. Don't be the idiot who picks the wrong crew or the wrong job. Know your lane.

## 3. Don't Show Your Hand.
Mystery is money. If they know what you're thinking, they know how to play you. Keep them guessing. Let them think you've got a secret weapon, even if you're just bluffing. Silence is your best guard.

## 4. Knowledge is Power, but Guts is Glory.
Being smart is just a map; being brave is the gas in the tank. A genius with no heart is just a flashlight with dead batteries.

## 5. Make Yourself Essential.
Don't wait for "thank you." Gratitude is short-lived; necessity lasts forever. Make sure they can't breathe without you. Keep the boss hungry, but don't let him starve.

## 6. Keep Cooking.
You aren't a finished product yet. Every day, sharpen your eyes and clean up your act. Most people are half-baked. Don't stop until you're the one everyone wants at the table.

## 7. Never Outshine the Boss.
Winning is a crime if you do it against the guy who signs the checks. Everyone is cool with you being lucky, but nobody wants you being smarter than them. Be like the moon—shine bright, but let the sun own the day.

## 8. Stay Cool.
If you lose your temper, you lose the room. The only real boss is the one who bosses his own feelings. Don't let the small stuff get under your skin.

## 9. Drop the Baggage.
Where you're from matters, but don't let it be a cage. Every hometown has its dirt. Scrub it off. Be the one guy from your neighborhood who actually leveled up.

## 10. Cash or Credit.
Fortune is the cash you spend today; Fame is the credit that outlives you. You want both, but remember: Fortune can leave you in a heartbeat, but a solid name is armor against time.
