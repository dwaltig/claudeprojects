# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 151-160 (Practical Blues)

## 151. Stay Five Steps Ahead.
Plan today for next month. If you're reacting to things as they happen, you've already lost. A real player is never surprised because he already imagined every possible screw-up and has a plan for it.

## 152. Don't Be the Opening Act for a Superstar.
If you hang out with someone who is way cooler, richer, or smarter than you, you’re just the "plus one." You become invisible in their shadow. If you want to actually *be* better, hang with the giants, but don't expect to get the credit.

## 153. Don't Follow a Legend.
Taking a job right after a superstar left is a trap. Everyone will compare you to them, and you'll almost always come up short. Find a place where the bar is low, and then blow it out of the water.

## 154. Trust Nobody, Love Slowly.
If you believe everything you hear, you're a mark. If you fall in love with every person who is nice to you, you're a fool. Most people are selling something. Wait until they show their true colors.

## 155. Don't Lose Your Mind.
Anger is a luxury you can't afford. The moment you get mad, you stop thinking clearly, and that’s when you make the mistakes that kill you. A boss who can't control his temper is a liability.

## 156. Pick Your Circle.
Don't just be friends with whoever is around. Hand-pick your crew. Your friends are a reflection of your judgment. You want "Center" friends—people who have your back when the world ends.

## 157. Don't Get Played.
Knowing how to read people is more important than knowing how to read a spreadsheet. If you pick the wrong partner, the wrong employee, or the wrong friend, it doesn't matter how good your plan is.

## 158. Use People for What They're Good At.
Everyone has a role. Some people are good for a fun Friday night; some are good for a business loan. Use the right person for the right job.

## 159. Learn to Ignore Idiots.
The world is full of fools. If you try to argue with them or change them, you're just wasting your time and lowering your own IQ. Let their nonsense slide off you like rain on a windshield.

## 160. Watch Your Mouth.
When you talk to an enemy, be careful. When you talk to a friend, be careful. You can always say more later, but you can never take back what you already said. Talk like every word is costing you a hundred dollars.
