# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 241-250 (Practical Blues)

## 241. Take a Joke, Don't Make One.
Being able to take a ribbing shows you've got class and a thick skin. But being the guy who's always making jokes at other people's expense is a fast way to get punched in the mouth.

## 242. Get the W.
Good intentions don't pay the rent. People only care if you won. If you win, nobody asks how you did it. Focus on the result.

## 243. Don't Be a 24/7 Guy.
Save some of yourself for *you*. If you're always available, you're a commodity. Have a private life. Keep some secrets.

## 244. Put People in Your Debt.
Do favors *before* you need them. It's much cheaper to buy loyalty with kindness than with cash. When you've already helped someone, they feel like they *have* to help you back.

## 245. Go Against the Grain.
Don't be afraid to be the only one in the room who sees the truth. The crowd is usually wrong. If everyone is zigging, look for the reason to zag.

## 246. Stop Apologizing.
If you haven't been called out, don't explain yourself. When you start making excuses, you're basically admitting you're guilty. Wait until they ask.

## 247. Use Their Hate.
When someone tries to slide you, don't get defensive—get offensive. Use their "slight" as a reason to be tougher or to move faster.

## 248. Don't Fall for the "Last Chance" Hype.
Salesmen love to tell you this is the "last one" or the "final offer." It's almost always a lie. Don't let the pressure of the "last" cloud your judgment.

## 249. Don't Be a Parrot.
If someone else is mad at a person, that's their problem. Don't adopt their beefs. Speak from your own experience, not from the gossip you heard.

## 250. Play Your Strengths.
Figure out when you're most "lucky" and go all in then. Don't fight the tide. If the universe is giving you a win, take it.
