# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 31-40 (Practical Blues)

## 31. Don't Hang with Losers.
Bad luck is contagious. Usually, people are "unlucky" because they're stupid. If you hang around them, you catch their stupid. Cut them loose. Discard the bad cards before they ruin your hand.

## 32. Be the Good Guy.
If you're the boss, your only real perk is the power to help people. Use it. Make people like you. Be the guy who solves problems, not the one who creates them.

## 33. Know When to Ghost.
Learn to say "no." Learn to disappear. Don't let people steal your time with their drama. If you're always available, you're worth nothing. Save some of yourself for *you*.

## 34. Find Your Superpower.
Figure out the one thing you're better at than anyone else, and go all in on that. Don't try to be good at everything. Be a god at one thing. That's your "King Attribute."

## 35. Think It Through.
Most people are sleepwalking. They don't see the truck until it hits them. Wake up. Analyze the situation. Drill down. Don't just react; understand.

## 36. Check Your Luck Pulse.
Is today your day? If you're hot, press the bet. Go big. Luck loves boldness. But if you're cold? Fold. Walk away. Don't chase losses. Knowing when to quit is as important as knowing when to play.

## 37. The Litmus Test.
People throw out little comments—"varillas"—just to see how you react. They're testing you. Or they're trying to stab you with a smile. Watch out for the "joke" that isn't a joke. Don't react; decode it.

## 38. Quit While You're Ahead.
The house always wins eventually. If you're up, cash out. A smart gambler knows when to leave the table. Don't push your luck until it breaks. A graceful exit is better than a tragic defeat.

## 39. Timing the Peak.
Everything has a peak—a fruit, a career, a joke. Enjoy it when it's ripe. Don't wait until it rots. Catch the wave, ride it, and get off before it crashes.

## 40. Be Popular.
It's not enough to be respected; you want to be loved. Being the "people's champ" is a superpower. Be nice. Do favors. And make friends with writers—they're the ones who decide how history remembers you.
