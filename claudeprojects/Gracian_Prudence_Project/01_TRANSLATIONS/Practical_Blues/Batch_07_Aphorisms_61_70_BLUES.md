# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 61-70 (Practical Blues)

## 61. Be Great at Something That Matters.
Being the world's best tiddlywinks player won't make you a legend. If you're going to be eminent, pick a field that people actually care about. Excellence in a small game makes you a small king. Excellence in a big game makes you a god.

## 62. Don't Use Cheap Tools.
Never handicap yourself just to show off how smart you are. Using bad employees or cheap tools is a disaster waiting to happen. If you win, you get the credit. If you lose, you get the blame—not your tools. So pick the best tools money can buy.

## 63. Be First.
Originality pays double. The guy who invents the game gets the biggest slice of the pie. The copycats fight over crumbs. If you can't be first in the big league, find a new league where you can be number one. "Better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven."

## 64. Dodge the Drama.
Your peace of mind is your most valuable asset. Don't let people dump their garbage news on you. Block the negativity. And never, ever set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.

## 65. Elevate Your Taste.
You are what you like. If you have cheap taste, you have a cheap soul. Aim high. But don't become one of those snobs who hates everything just to look cool. That's not "refined"; that's just annoying.

## 66. Win.
Nobody cares how hard you tried or how perfect your plan was. They care if you won. Results are the only scoreboard. If you have to break the "rules" of art to get the win, break them. History forgives the winner.

## 67. Pick the Spotlight.
Do jobs that people actually see. You can be the most brilliant guy in the basement, and nobody will care. Pick the roles that get applause. Be the quarterback, not the equipment manager.

## 68. Be the Idea Guy.
Sometimes people are stuck. Drop a hint. Give them the idea, but let them think they thought of it. It's subtle. "Give understanding"—light the spark, but stay in the shadows.

## 69. Don't Be Moody.
Mood swings are for children. A real player is consistent. Don't let a bad morning ruin your decisions for the day. Know yourself well enough to know when you're being irrational, and shut it down.

## 70. The Art of "No."
You can't say "yes" to everyone. If you do, you're worthless. But you don't have to be a jerk about it. Learn to say "no" so smoothly that they thank you for it. Wrap the rejection in sugar. "No" is a complete sentence, but a polite "no" keeps bridges intact.
