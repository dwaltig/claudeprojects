# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 211-220 (Practical Blues)

## 211. Don't Be a Hater Magnet.
If everyone is taking shots at you, you're doing something wrong. Sometimes being "unlucky" is just a polite way of saying you're an idiot. Build a shield of respect so the haters don't even try it.

## 212. Don't Flex.
The more you show off, the less people actually respect you. If you have to tell everyone you're a boss, you're probably not. Let your skills speak for themselves. The best moves look like you weren't even trying.

## 213. Master the "Strategic No."
Sometimes you have to disagree with someone just to see where they stand. It’s a way to test their will and keep them from taking you for granted.

## 214. Don't Be a Wall.
If you're impossible to talk to, you're impossible to help. Inaccessibility isn't power; it's just being a jerk. Keep the door open for advice from people you trust.

## 215. Watch the High-Pressure Salesman.
Beware the guy who tries to rush you or pressure you into a deal. Don't let someone else's stress become your problem. Use your own logic as a brake.

## 216. Learn from Other People's Screw-ups.
When you see someone else mess up, don't just laugh—study it. Figure out how to turn their failure into your advantage. A genius learns from everyone else's mistakes.

## 217. Be Consistent.
Don't be the guy who's a hero on Monday and a flake on Tuesday. If people can't predict what you're going to do, they won't trust you with the big stuff.

## 218. Skip the Fake Pomp.
Too much ceremony is just a mask for a lack of substance. Be polite, but don't be a suck-up. Real respect doesn't need a three-page introduction.

## 219. Don't Put It All on Red.
Never gamble your whole brand on one move. If you miss, you're done. Diversify your risks. Take small steps. Always keep something in the tank.

## 220. Stay a Little Hungry.
If you have everything you ever wanted, you're finished. Happiness is a trap if it stops you from moving. Save a little bit of "want" for tomorrow.
