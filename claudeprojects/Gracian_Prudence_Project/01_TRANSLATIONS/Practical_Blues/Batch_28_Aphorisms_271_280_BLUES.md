# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 271-280 (Practical Blues)

## 271. Keep a Private Stash.
Don't put everything you have on the table. Keep some resources, some ideas, and some secrets for yourself. Mystery is your best defense.

## 272. Weaponize Their Insults.
When someone tries to slide you, don't get defensive—get offensive. Use their "slight" as a reason to be tougher or to move faster.

## 273. Speak for Yourself.
Don't just repeat what other people are saying. Have your own opinions. Being an "echo" is for people who can't think for themselves.

## 274. Ride Your Luck.
Success comes in waves. When you're on a winning streak, double down. When you're cold, back off. Learn to recognize your own "Lucky Star."

## 275. Don't Be a Sheep.
The crowd is usually wrong. If you base your self-worth on popular opinion, you're letting fools run your life. Be your own world.

## 276. Stay a Little Hungry.
If you have everything you ever wanted, you're finished. Happiness is a trap if it stops you from moving. Always leave a little something "to desire."

## 277. Be the Real Deal.
Integrity is your foundation. If you're a "man of rectitude," people will trust you even when they don't like you.

## 278. Don't Flex.
The more you show off, the less people actually respect you. If you have to tell everyone you're a boss, you're probably not.

## 279. The Strategic "No."
Sometimes you have to disagree with someone just to see where they stand. It’s a way to test their will and keep them from taking you for granted.

## 280. Don't Be a Jerk.
If you're impossible to talk to, you're impossible to help. Inaccessibility isn't power; it's just being a jerk. Keep the door open for advice from people you trust.
