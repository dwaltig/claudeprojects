# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 141-150 (Practical Blues)

## 141. Don't Fall in Love with Your Own Voice.
The guy who talks and then waits for an applause break is a clown. If you're listening to yourself while you speak, you're not communicating; you're posing. Keep your ears on the room, not on your own mouth.

## 142. Don't Be Petty Just to Be Different.
Don't pick the losing side just because your enemy picked the winning one. Be on the side of whatever works, no matter who thought of it first. Stubbornness is a fast way to lose respect.

## 143. Don't Be a Hipster Just to Be Different.
Being a contrarian for the sake of it is just as bad as being a mindless follower. Don't trade common sense for a "unique" mistake. If a truth is common, it’s probably because it’s true.

## 144. Use Their Goal to Reach Yours.
If you want to move someone, start by moving in their direction. Talk about what they want, and then slowly steer the ship toward where *you* want to go. It’s the "Trojan Horse" of negotiation.

## 145. Hide Your Weak Spot.
If you tell people where it hurts, that’s exactly where they’re going to kick you. Don't complain about your problems in public. Haters look for the crack in the armor. Keep your "sore finger" in your pocket.

## 146. Look Under the Hood.
The first impression is almost always a lie. Scammers are always the first to show up. Truth takes its time. Save 50% of your belief for the stuff that hasn't been said yet.

## 147. Listen to Advice.
Nobody is so smart that they don't need a second opinion. Let your trusted friends tell you when you're being an idiot. Admitting you need help doesn't make you look weak; it makes you look like a man who values results over ego.

## 148. Master the Hang.
Conversation is where you really see what a man is made of. It's the most common thing we do, but the hardest to do well. If you can talk with weight and listen with intent, you've already won half the battle.

## 149. Have a Fall Guy.
If you're the boss, you can't take the hit for every mistake. You need a "shield"—someone else who can take the blame when things go sideways. Protect your reputation by letting the "slights" hit someone else.

## 150. Learn to Sell.
Being good isn't enough. You have to make people *want* what you have. Price it high to show value. Don't be too easy to get, or people will think you're cheap. Use that mystery and exclusivity.
