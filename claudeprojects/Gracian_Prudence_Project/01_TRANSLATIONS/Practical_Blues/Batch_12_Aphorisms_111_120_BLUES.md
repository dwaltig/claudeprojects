# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 111-120 (Practical Blues)

## 111. Networking is Everything.
Friends are your second life. You’re only as valuable as people say you are. To get people on your side, you gotta win their hearts first. The best way to make a friend is to do them a solid.

## 112. Get People to Like You.
You can be the smartest guy in the room, but if people hate your guts, you're going nowhere. Talent is a long road if you don't have "favor." When people like you, they ignore your flaws and invent virtues for you.

## 113. Fix the Roof While the Sun is Shining.
Stockpile favors and friends while you’re winning. When things go south, everyone gets expensive and hard to find. Build your crew in the summer so you don't freeze in the winter.

## 114. Don't Enter the Pissing Contest.
Competition ruins your brand. The moment you start fighting someone, they start digging up your dirt. Competition is a mud fight—even if you win, you're covered in shit. Stay above the fray.

## 115. Tolerate the Toxic (If You Have To).
Sometimes you're stuck with a boss or a partner who is a total nightmare. If you can't leave, get used to them. Build up an immunity to their BS so they can't rattle you when it counts.

## 116. Only Deal with People Who Have Skin in the Game.
Stick with people who have a reputation to lose. They'll act right because they have to. Never do business with someone who has no honor and nothing to lose.

## 117. Shut Up About Yourself.
If you brag, you're a narcissist. If you self-deprecate, you're a loser. Either way, nobody wants to hear it. Save the talk for the work. And don't talk about the people in the room either.

## 118. Be a Class Act.
Manners are a cheat code. Being polite makes people like you and, more importantly, it makes them feel safe. It costs you nothing and buys you everything. Even if you hate a guy, treat him with respect.

## 119. Don't Be a Hater Magnet.
Some people just naturally attract hate because they have a shitty attitude. Don't be that guy. Once someone decides they hate you, it's almost impossible to change their mind.

## 120. Stay Current.
Don't be the guy talking about "the good old days." Keep your skills and your style up to date. If the world is moving on, move with it. The only thing that stays the same is being a good person.
