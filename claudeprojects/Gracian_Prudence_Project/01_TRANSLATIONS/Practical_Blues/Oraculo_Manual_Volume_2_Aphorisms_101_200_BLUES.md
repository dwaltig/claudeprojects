# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 101-110 (Practical Blues)

## 101. Everyone’s a Critic.
Half the world thinks the other half is crazy. Don't be the guy who thinks his taste is the only "right" one. Different strokes for different folks. If the heavy hitters in your game respect you, you're fine.

## 102. Grow a Bigger Appetite.
Don't choke on a little bit of success. If a small promotion makes you act like a king, you've reached your limit. A real player handles a million-dollar win like it’s a Tuesday.

## 103. Act Like Royalty.
You might not have the crown, but you can have the class. High-level thoughts, high-level moves. If you carry yourself like a boss, people start treating you like one.

## 104. Know the Job.
Every role is different. Some need a sledgehammer, some need a scalpel. Managing people is the hardest gig there is, especially when they're idiots. You need double the brains to handle a guy who has none.

## 105. Keep it Short.
Brevity is a power move. The longer you talk, the more you look like a salesman. Get in, say your piece, and get out. If it's good, less is more.

## 106. Don't Flex Your Luck.
Showing off your status is the fastest way to get hated. If you’re truly a man of substance, you don’t need the fancy title to get respect. Flex your skills, not your bank account.

## 107. Stay Hungry, Stay Humble.
Being a hater of your own life is weak, but being a fanboy of yourself is stupid. If you think you're perfect, you've stopped growing. A smart man is always looking for the leak in his own boat.

## 108. Trade Your Vibe.
Hang out with people who have the traits you lack. If you're too impulsive, find a chill partner. If you're too quiet, find a loud one. Personality traits are contagious.

## 109. Don't Be a Hater.
Some guys wake up looking for a reason to be mad. They find a "crime" in everything. Be the guy who finds an excuse for people, not the guy who finds a reason to hang them.

## 110. Leave the Party Early.
Don't wait for the lights to come up and the music to stop. Cash out while you're still winning. Don't wait for people to get sick of you. A graceful exit is a victory in itself.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 111-120 (Practical Blues)

## 111. Networking is Everything.
Friends are your second life. You’re only as valuable as people say you are. To get people on your side, you gotta win their hearts first. The best way to make a friend is to do them a solid.

## 112. Get People to Like You.
You can be the smartest guy in the room, but if people hate your guts, you're going nowhere. Talent is a long road if you don't have "favor." When people like you, they ignore your flaws and invent virtues for you.

## 113. Fix the Roof While the Sun is Shining.
Stockpile favors and friends while you’re winning. When things go south, everyone gets expensive and hard to find. Build your crew in the summer so you don't freeze in the winter.

## 114. Don't Enter the Pissing Contest.
Competition ruins your brand. The moment you start fighting someone, they start digging up your dirt. Competition is a mud fight—even if you win, you're covered in shit. Stay above the fray.

## 115. Tolerate the Toxic (If You Have To).
Sometimes you're stuck with a boss or a partner who is a total nightmare. If you can't leave, get used to them. Build up an immunity to their BS so they can't rattle you when it counts.

## 116. Only Deal with People Who Have Skin in the Game.
Stick with people who have a reputation to lose. They'll act right because they have to. Never do business with someone who has no honor and nothing to lose.

## 117. Shut Up About Yourself.
If you brag, you're a narcissist. If you self-deprecate, you're a loser. Either way, nobody wants to hear it. Save the talk for the work. And don't talk about the people in the room either.

## 118. Be a Class Act.
Manners are a cheat code. Being polite makes people like you and, more importantly, it makes them feel safe. It costs you nothing and buys you everything. Even if you hate a guy, treat him with respect.

## 119. Don't Be a Hater Magnet.
Some people just naturally attract hate because they have a shitty attitude. Don't be that guy. Once someone decides they hate you, it's almost impossible to change their mind.

## 120. Stay Current.
Don't be the guy talking about "the good old days." Keep your skills and your style up to date. If the world is moving on, move with it. The only thing that stays the same is being a good person.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 121-130 (Practical Blues)

## 121. Don't Be a Drama Queen.
Some people turn every tiny detail into a major production. If you treat everything like a "big deal," then nothing is a big deal. Learn to ignore the small stuff so it stays small.

## 122. Move Like a Boss.
Carry yourself with weight. It starts before you even open your mouth. It’s in how you walk, how you look at people, and how you take up space. Have that internal gravity that makes people pay attention.

## 123. Keep it Natural.
The harder you try to look cool, the less cool you look. Real talent should look easy. Do the hardest thing in the world like it’s no big deal. That's "Despejo."

## 124. Be the Guy Everyone Wants.
If nobody wants you around, you've already lost. You want to be the guy people "need" because of your skills and "want" because of your personality. Skill gets you in the door; vibes keep you there.

## 125. Don't Be a Snitch or a Gossip.
The guy who’s always talking about everyone else's mess usually has a mess of his own he's trying to hide. Digging in other people's dirt just gets you dirty. Keep your eyes on your own paper.

## 126. Hide Your Mistakes.
Everyone screws up. The difference between a pro and an amateur is that the pro knows how to bury the evidence. If you can't be perfect, at least be quiet.

## 127. The Secret Sauce (Despejo).
There’s a "don't know what" factor that makes certain people magnetic. It’s not just talent; it’s the *way* they use it. It’s that effortless vibe that says, "I'm better than this, but I'm doing it anyway."

## 128. Think Big.
Have a "High Spirit." Don't be petty. Don't be jealous. Elevate your thoughts, your goals, and your taste. A big heart attracts big opportunities.

## 129. No Whining.
Nobody likes a complainer. When you complain, you're telling the world you're a victim, and the world hates victims. Instead of talking about how you got screwed, talk about who's helping you.

## 130. Do the Work, Then Show the Work.
Being good is 50% of the battle. The other 50% is making sure people *know* you're good. You have to market your results. Reality is just what people think is real.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 131-140 (Practical Blues)

## 131. Be a Class Act.
Don't be petty. Don't count every favor you do like you're keeping a ledger. A real player has a big heart and a big vision. Act like you've been there before.

## 132. Double-Check the Plan.
Don't rush into a major move. Sleep on it. Patience is a tactical advantage. Let the situation marinate until the right move is obvious.

## 133. Don't Be a Lonely Genius.
If the whole world is going one way, don't stand in the middle of the road shouting that they're wrong. Sometimes it’s smarter to play along with the crowd's BS than to be the only "sane" person in the asylum.

## 134. Have a Backup Plan.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Have a Plan B, a Plan C, and a secret Plan D. Never rely on just one client, one skill, or one connection.

## 135. Don't Be the "Actually..." Guy.
Nobody likes the person who argues just for the sake of arguing. Save your energy for the arguments that actually matter.

## 136. Get to the Point.
Stop dancing around the issue. Figure out the *one thing* that actually matters in a deal or a problem and focus on that. Be the guy who cuts through the noise.

## 137. Be Your Own Best Friend.
If you're solid on the inside, you're untouchable on the outside. A wise man can lose everything and still be okay because he hasn't lost himself. Don't rely on others for your happiness.

## 138. Let It Slide.
Most of the stuff that happens in a day isn't worth getting mad about. Learn to "not see" things. Being a "professional ignorer" is a key survival skill.

## 139. Watch the Vibe.
Some days you're the windshield, some days you're the bug. Don't try to force a win when the universe is pushing back. Wait for your "hot" days to make your big moves.

## 140. Find the Win.
In every bad situation, there’s a silver lining. Don't go looking for the dirt; look for the opportunity. If you train your brain to see the "good" in everything, you'll always find a way to profit.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 141-150 (Practical Blues)

## 141. Don't Fall in Love with Your Own Voice.
The guy who talks and then waits for an applause break is a clown. If you're listening to yourself while you speak, you're not communicating; you're posing. Keep your ears on the room, not on your own mouth.

## 142. Don't Be Petty Just to Be Different.
Don't pick the losing side just because your enemy picked the winning one. Be on the side of whatever works, no matter who thought of it first. Stubbornness is a fast way to lose respect.

## 143. Don't Be a Hipster Just to Be Different.
Being a contrarian for the sake of it is just as bad as being a mindless follower. Don't trade common sense for a "unique" mistake. If a truth is common, it’s probably because it’s true.

## 144. Use Their Goal to Reach Yours.
If you want to move someone, start by moving in their direction. Talk about what they want, and then slowly steer the ship toward where *you* want to go. It’s the "Trojan Horse" of negotiation.

## 145. Hide Your Weak Spot.
If you tell people where it hurts, that’s exactly where they’re going to kick you. Don't complain about your problems in public. Haters look for the crack in the armor. Keep your "sore finger" in your pocket.

## 146. Look Under the Hood.
The first impression is almost always a lie. Scammers are always the first to show up. Truth takes its time. Save 50% of your belief for the stuff that hasn't been said yet.

## 147. Listen to Advice.
Nobody is so smart that they don't need a second opinion. Let your trusted friends tell you when you're being an idiot. Admitting you need help doesn't make you look weak; it makes you look like a man who values results over ego.

## 148. Master the Hang.
Conversation is where you really see what a man is made of. It's the most common thing we do, but the hardest to do well. If you can talk with weight and listen with intent, you've already won half the battle.

## 149. Have a Fall Guy.
If you're the boss, you can't take the hit for every mistake. You need a "shield"—someone else who can take the blame when things go sideways. Protect your reputation by letting the "slights" hit someone else.

## 150. Learn to Sell.
Being good isn't enough. You have to make people *want* what you have. Price it high to show value. Don't be too easy to get, or people will think you're cheap. Use that mystery and exclusivity.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 151-160 (Practical Blues)

## 151. Stay Five Steps Ahead.
Plan today for next month. If you're reacting to things as they happen, you've already lost. A real player is never surprised because he already imagined every possible screw-up and has a plan for it.

## 152. Don't Be the Opening Act for a Superstar.
If you hang out with someone who is way cooler, richer, or smarter than you, you’re just the "plus one." You become invisible in their shadow. If you want to actually *be* better, hang with the giants, but don't expect to get the credit.

## 153. Don't Follow a Legend.
Taking a job right after a superstar left is a trap. Everyone will compare you to them, and you'll almost always come up short. Find a place where the bar is low, and then blow it out of the water.

## 154. Trust Nobody, Love Slowly.
If you believe everything you hear, you're a mark. If you fall in love with every person who is nice to you, you're a fool. Most people are selling something. Wait until they show their true colors.

## 155. Don't Lose Your Mind.
Anger is a luxury you can't afford. The moment you get mad, you stop thinking clearly, and that’s when you make the mistakes that kill you. A boss who can't control his temper is a liability.

## 156. Pick Your Circle.
Don't just be friends with whoever is around. Hand-pick your crew. Your friends are a reflection of your judgment. You want "Center" friends—people who have your back when the world ends.

## 157. Don't Get Played.
Knowing how to read people is more important than knowing how to read a spreadsheet. If you pick the wrong partner, the wrong employee, or the wrong friend, it doesn't matter how good your plan is.

## 158. Use People for What They're Good At.
Everyone has a role. Some people are good for a fun Friday night; some are good for a business loan. Use the right person for the right job.

## 159. Learn to Ignore Idiots.
The world is full of fools. If you try to argue with them or change them, you're just wasting your time and lowering your own IQ. Let their nonsense slide off you like rain on a windshield.

## 160. Watch Your Mouth.
When you talk to an enemy, be careful. When you talk to a friend, be careful. You can always say more later, but you can never take back what you already said. Talk like every word is costing you a hundred dollars.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 161-170 (Practical Blues)

## 161. Accept the Glitches.
Nobody is 100% perfect. Don't throw away a great partner just because they have a small flaw. Learn to live with the "venial" sins if the "mortal" virtues are solid.

## 162. Make 'Em Miss You.
If you're always around, you're just part of the furniture. Absence creates value. When you leave, people start remembering only the good stuff and forgetting the annoying stuff.

## 163. Keep Your Eye on the Goal.
Don't let your feelings drive the car. You need to be the boss of your own head. The moment you let anger, fear, or lust take the wheel, you're heading for a crash.

## 164. Throw a Curveball.
If you want to know what someone is really thinking, drop a "test" comment. Say something controversial or do something unexpected and watch their face. It’s like throwing a rock into a pond.

## 165. Fight Fair.
Even when you're taking someone down, don't be a scumbag. Don't use low blows or "poisoned" gossip. Winning by being a snake isn't winning; it's just surviving as a snake.

## 166. Talkers vs. Doers.
This is the big one. Some people talk a big game but never deliver. Others shut up and get it done. Learn to spot the difference early so you don't waste your time.

## 167. Be Your Own Cavalry.
When things get ugly, don't look around for someone to save you. Save yourself. A big heart and a clear head are the only backup you really have.

## 168. Don't Be a High-Level Idiot.
There are plenty of dumb people, but the most dangerous kind is the one who uses logic to justify their stupidity. Don't be the guy who thinks he's brilliant while he's walking off a cliff.

## 169. Start Strong, Finish Stronger.
First impressions are the hook, but the ending is the check. You want people to remember the "exit" more than the "entrance."

## 170. Don't Be a Hater’s Puppet.
Don't let someone else's grudge become yours. If a guy hates your friend, that doesn't mean you have to hate him too. Don't be an "echo" for someone else's anger.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 171-180 (Practical Blues)

## 171. Guard Your Credit.
Reputation is your only real bank account. If you spend it on stupid stuff or small favors, you won't have any left when you really need it. Save your chips for the big game.

## 172. Don't Fight a Guy with Nothing to Lose.
It’s a sucker’s bet. Never get into a mud-wrestling match with a pig—the pig likes it, and you just get dirty. If a guy has no money and no future, he can do anything to you and it won't hurt him.

## 173. Don't Be Fragile.
Some people are like glass—one wrong word and they shatter. Don't be that guy. Be solid. Be tough enough to take a hit or a joke without falling apart.

## 174. Don't Rush Life.
If you're always running to the next thing, you're never actually *at* the thing you're at. Learn to slow down and enjoy the win.

## 175. Be the Real Deal.
Some guys are all jewelry and no bank account. Be the guy with "substance." Have real skills and real assets. The "bark" looks good, but the "core" is what lasts.

## 176. Know How to Ask.
Asking is an art. Figure out who you're talking to and what kind of mood they're in before you make your move.

## 177. Don't Get Too Cozy with the Boss.
Familiarity breeds contempt. If you get too close to the people at the top, they stop respecting you. Keep a professional distance. You want them to value you, not get used to you.

## 178. Play the Part.
If you're the manager, act like the manager. Don't be a "monstrosity"—a guy who's one thing on paper and something else in person. People need to know what to expect from you.

## 179. Don't Be a Hater of What’s Popular.
Even if you think a new trend is stupid, don't go on a crusade against it. Don't be the "old man yelling at clouds." Respect the crowd, even if you don't follow them.

## 180. Don't Repeat Insults.
If someone says something bad about you, don't be the one who tells everyone else. Be the "tomb" for bad news. Let the insults die with you.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 181-190 (Practical Blues)

## 181. Don't Lie, but Don't Overshare.
Lying kills your reputation instantly. But that doesn't mean you have to tell everyone everything. Keep some cards face down. Not everyone deserves to know your whole heart.

## 182. Have Some Balls.
A little bit of boldness goes a long way. Don't be "frozen" by fear. A dash of audacity is the secret ingredient in every major success.

## 183. Don't Be a Wall.
Being firm is good; being a statue is stupid. You have to be able to pivot when the market or the situation changes. If you refuse to move, you'll eventually be knocked down. Adapt or die.

## 184. Skip the Red Tape.
Don't be the guy who cares more about the "rules" and the "ceremony" than the results. Don't let etiquette get in the way of business. Get to the point.

## 185. Don't Go All In.
Never bet your whole life on one deal. If it fails, you're finished. Break it down. Take smaller risks. Always keep some chips on the table for the next round.

## 186. Know the Crazy of Your Time.
Every decade has its own flavor of nonsense—fads, cults, bad ideas. Figure out what the current "crazy" is so you don't get swept up in it. Stay grounded in common sense.

## 187. Give the Good News, Outsource the Bad.
If you're giving out raises, do it in person. If you're firing someone, let HR do it. Be the guy associated with the wins and the favors. Let someone else be the "bad guy."

## 188. Talk People Up.
Be the guy who notices when someone else is crushing it. It makes you look confident, not jealous. And when you praise others, they'll usually return the favor.

## 189. Use the "Need" Factor.
Figure out what people are missing in their lives—respect, money, excitement. If you can provide what they need, you own their loyalty. "Need" is the ultimate leverage.

## 190. Find the Silver Lining.
There’s a win in every loss if you look hard enough. Don't just sit there crying over the "gall"; look for the "honey." A positive mindset is a strategic advantage.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 191-200 (Practical Blues)

## 191. Don't Be Fooled by Over-the-Top Politeness.
When someone is being *too* nice, they're usually trying to sell you something or hide something. Words are cheap; deeds are expensive. If it feels like a spell, it probably is.

## 192. Stay Chill, Live Longer.
Peace isn't just a vibe; it's a health strategy. The guy who's always picking fights and stressing out dies young. The guy who knows how to "let live" is the one who ends up running the show.

## 193. Watch the Guy with the Secret Agenda.
There’s always someone who pretends to be helping you while they’re actually helping themselves. Be a "lynx"—see through the fake smiles and find the real target.

## 194. Keep Your Cool.
Don't get too hyped up or too depressed about anything. Extremes are where you make mistakes. Keep your judgments moderate. If something looks too good to be true, it is.

## 195. Wait for the Right Moment.
Patience is the ultimate power move. Most people fail because they rush. Let the fruit ripen. Let the deal cook. Time is the one thing you can't buy, but you can definitely use it.

## 196. Find Your Lane.
Everybody has a time and a place where they shine. Figure out when your "star" is shining and make your big moves then. Don't try to be a daytime hero if you're a creature of the night.

## 197. Don't Follow the Crowd.
If the "many" are doing it, it’s probably a bad idea. The mob is usually wrong. Be your own world. If you know you're right, stay right, even if you're the only one.

## 198. Turn Their Hate into Your Gain.
When someone tries to slide you or insult you, don't just take it. Figure out how to use it. If they call you "ruthless," use that fear to close a deal.

## 199. Be Straight.
Integrity is your foundation. If you're a "man of rectitude," people will trust you even when they don't like you. In a world full of fakes, being the real deal is the ultimate luxury.

## 200. Always Keep Wanting More.
If you have everything, you have nothing left to live for. The "total" win is actually a loss because it kills your drive. Save a little bit of "desire" for tomorrow.
