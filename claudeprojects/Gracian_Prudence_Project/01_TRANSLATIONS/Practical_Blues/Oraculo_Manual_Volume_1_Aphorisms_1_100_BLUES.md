# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 1-10 (Practical Blues)

## 1. The Bar is Higher Now.
Back in the day, being smart was easy. Now? Every single person you meet is a game of chess. To be a real "Individual" today, you gotta bring seven times the heat.

## 2. Brains and Vibe.
You need both. If you're smart but you've got no soul, you're halfway to nowhere. Don't be the idiot who picks the wrong crew or the wrong job. Know your lane.

## 3. Don't Show Your Hand.
Mystery is money. If they know what you're thinking, they know how to play you. Keep them guessing. Let them think you've got a secret weapon, even if you're just bluffing. Silence is your best guard.

## 4. Knowledge is Power, but Guts is Glory.
Being smart is just a map; being brave is the gas in the tank. A genius with no heart is just a flashlight with dead batteries.

## 5. Make Yourself Essential.
Don't wait for "thank you." Gratitude is short-lived; necessity lasts forever. Make sure they can't breathe without you. Keep the boss hungry, but don't let him starve.

## 6. Keep Cooking.
You aren't a finished product yet. Every day, sharpen your eyes and clean up your act. Most people are half-baked. Don't stop until you're the one everyone wants at the table.

## 7. Never Outshine the Boss.
Winning is a crime if you do it against the guy who signs the checks. Everyone is cool with you being lucky, but nobody wants you being smarter than them. Be like the moon—shine bright, but let the sun own the day.

## 8. Stay Cool.
If you lose your temper, you lose the room. The only real boss is the one who bosses his own feelings. Don't let the small stuff get under your skin.

## 9. Drop the Baggage.
Where you're from matters, but don't let it be a cage. Every hometown has its dirt. Scrub it off. Be the one guy from your neighborhood who actually leveled up.

## 10. Cash or Credit.
Fortune is the cash you spend today; Fame is the credit that outlives you. You want both, but remember: Fortune can leave you in a heartbeat, but a solid name is armor against time.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 11-20 (Practical Blues)

## 11. Pick Your Crew Wisely.
Your friends shouldn't just be fun; they should be upgrades. Hang out with people who are already where you want to be. If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room. Turn every conversation into a free masterclass.

## 12. Polish the Diamond.
Natural talent is cool, but it's raw. Without "Art"—without discipline, style, and polish—you're just a rough stone. Nature gives you the material; you have to do the work. Don't be a barbarian with potential; be a masterpiece.

## 13. The Head Fake.
Life is war. The other guy is trying to read your mind. So, fake left, go right. Sometimes, fake left, *go left*. Keep them guessing. If they think they know your move, you're dead.

## 14. Style Matters.
It's not what you do; it's how you do it. You can be right and still lose if you're an asshole about it. A smooth "no" is better than a rough "yes." Good manners are the WD-40 of life—they stop the friction.

## 15. Rent a Brain.
You can't know everything. The smartest move a boss makes is hiring people smarter than him. Let them do the heavy lifting. Why study for twenty years when you can hire the guy who already did? That’s the ultimate leverage.

## 16. Don't Be an Evil Genius.
Smart + Good = Success. Smart + Evil = A Monster. If you use your brain to hurt people, you're just a weaponized idiot. Eventually, it blows up in your face.

## 17. Don't Be Predictable.
If you always do the same thing, they'll build a trap for you. Switch it up. Don't have a "signature move." Your only signature should be winning.

## 18. The Grind.
Talent is cheap. Hustle pays the bills. A mediocre guy who works hard will beat a lazy genius every day of the week. If you have both talent and hustle? You're unstoppable.

## 19. Undersell, Overdeliver.
Hype is a trap. If you walk in with everyone expecting a miracle, you're doomed. Even if you're great, they'll be disappointed. Lower the bar, then clear it by a mile.

## 20. Timing is Everything.
Some people are born too early; some too late. You might be a genius in a world of idiots. Don't sweat it. If you don't fit your time, make your work timeless. The game might be rigged against you right now, but quality lasts forever.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 21-30 (Practical Blues)

## 21. Make Your Own Luck.
Luck isn't magic; it's math. You can wait by the door hoping Fortune lets you in, or you can kick the door down. The "lucky" guy is usually just the guy who prepared the most. Prudence is the only real luck.

## 22. Be Interesting.
Nobody likes a boring genius. You need "walking around knowledge"—current events, good jokes, style. Being able to hold a conversation is worth more than a PhD. Don't be a library; be a newsfeed.

## 23. Fix the Glitch.
One tiny flaw can ruin a perfect package. It's like a Ferrari with a scratch—everyone stares at the scratch. Don't let a small bad habit eclipse your massive talent. If you can't fix it, hide it. If you can't hide it, style it out like Caesar.

## 24. Control Your Head.
Your imagination is a wild horse. If you don't ride it, it rides you. It can make you miserable by inventing problems that don't exist, or reckless by promising wins that aren't real. Put a bridle on it. Stay in reality.

## 25. Read Between the Lines.
People never say what they mean. Especially when it matters. You need to be a "lynx" for intentions—see through the fog. If the news is too good, doubt it. If it's bad, assume it's true and get ready.

## 26. Find Their Button.
Everyone wants something. Money, fame, pleasure, power. Find out what that *one thing* is for the person you're dealing with. That's their "handle." Once you grab that handle, you own them. Checkmate.

## 27. Quality Over Quantity.
Don't try to be everything. Be the *best* at something. A thimble of diamonds is worth more than a mountain of mud. Deep beats wide every time. Don't be a "Jack of all trades, master of none." Be the master of one.

## 28. Don't Be Basic.
If everyone likes you, you're doing something wrong. The crowd has bad taste. If the mob is cheering, check your work. Excellence is lonely. Don't chase "likes"; chase respect.

## 29. Stand Your Ground.
Be the guy who can't be bought. It's rare. Everyone loves integrity until it costs them money. Be the "Phoenix of Equity." Even if you lose friends or money, you keep your soul. And eventually, people will trust you more than anyone else because they know you don't fold.

## 30. Don't Be a Weirdo.
Don't chase jobs or hobbies that make you look like a clown. There are plenty of "sects of caprice"—cults, fads, weird obsessions. Stay away. Don't be famous for being a joke. Stick to the stuff that commands respect.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 31-40 (Practical Blues)

## 31. Don't Hang with Losers.
Bad luck is contagious. Usually, people are "unlucky" because they're stupid. If you hang around them, you catch their stupid. Cut them loose. Discard the bad cards before they ruin your hand.

## 32. Be the Good Guy.
If you're the boss, your only real perk is the power to help people. Use it. Make people like you. Be the guy who solves problems, not the one who creates them.

## 33. Know When to Ghost.
Learn to say "no." Learn to disappear. Don't let people steal your time with their drama. If you're always available, you're worth nothing. Save some of yourself for *you*.

## 34. Find Your Superpower.
Figure out the one thing you're better at than anyone else, and go all in on that. Don't try to be good at everything. Be a god at one thing. That's your "King Attribute."

## 35. Think It Through.
Most people are sleepwalking. They don't see the truck until it hits them. Wake up. Analyze the situation. Drill down. Don't just react; understand.

## 36. Check Your Luck Pulse.
Is today your day? If you're hot, press the bet. Go big. Luck loves boldness. But if you're cold? Fold. Walk away. Don't chase losses. Knowing when to quit is as important as knowing when to play.

## 37. The Litmus Test.
People throw out little comments—"varillas"—just to see how you react. They're testing you. Or they're trying to stab you with a smile. Watch out for the "joke" that isn't a joke. Don't react; decode it.

## 38. Quit While You're Ahead.
The house always wins eventually. If you're up, cash out. A smart gambler knows when to leave the table. Don't push your luck until it breaks. A graceful exit is better than a tragic defeat.

## 39. Timing the Peak.
Everything has a peak—a fruit, a career, a joke. Enjoy it when it's ripe. Don't wait until it rots. Catch the wave, ride it, and get off before it crashes.

## 40. Be Popular.
It's not enough to be respected; you want to be loved. Being the "people's champ" is a superpower. Be nice. Do favors. And make friends with writers—they're the ones who decide how history remembers you.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 41-50 (Practical Blues)

## 41. Don't Hype It.
Superlatives are for liars. If you say everything is "amazing," nothing is. When you over-promise, you set yourself up to fail. Keep it chill. Let the results speak louder than the pitch.

## 42. The "It" Factor.
Some people just have it. They walk in, and everyone shuts up. You can't fake this. It's not about being loud; it's about being solid. It's a "Natural Empire." If you have it, use it. If you don't, don't try to fake it—you'll just look annoying.

## 43. Think Like a Genius, Talk Like a Regular Guy.
Don't be the guy correcting everyone's grammar or logic at the bar. It makes people hate you. Keep your brilliant thoughts to yourself (or your smart friends) and speak the language of the room. Swimming upstream just gets you drowned.

## 44. Vibe with Winners.
Winners recognize winners. It's a chemical thing. If you feel a connection with a "Hero"—someone crushing it—lean into it. That sympathy is worth gold. It’s not magic; it’s game recognizing game.

## 45. Don't Look Like You're Thinking.
If people see you calculating, they stop trusting you. Hide the gears. Be smart, but look natural. The moment they think you're "plotting," they put their guards up.

## 46. Don't Hate the Player.
We all have gut reactions to people. Sometimes you just hate a guy's face. Fix that. Especially if that guy is a heavy hitter. Hating successful people makes you look petty and small. Learn to respect the game, even if you don't like the player.

## 47. Don't Get Stuck.
Avoid "Empeños"—sticky situations, obligations, messes. It's easier to stay out than to get out. Don't volunteer for drama. Keep your freedom. A smart man sees a trap and walks around it; a hero walks into it and tries to fight his way out. Be the smart man.

## 48. Be Deep.
Don't be a movie set—all front, no back. Some people run out of conversation in five minutes. Be a "Man of Funds." Have layers. The more they dig, the more they should find.

## 49. Read the Room.
Be a scanner. Look at people and X-ray them. Don't just see the suit; see the insecurity. Don't just hear the words; hear the agenda. "Anatomy of a capacity"—dissect them before they dissect you.

## 50. Don't Be a Slob When You're Alone.
Character is what you do when nobody's watching. If you have to wait for a cop to act right, you're not a good person; you're just a scared one. Respect yourself enough to keep your standards high, even in the dark.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 51-60 (Practical Blues)

## 51. Pick a Lane.
Life is just a series of choices. If you have bad taste, you're doomed. Some smart guys always pick the losing team or the crazy girl. Don't be that guy. Choosing well is a talent. Cultivate it.

## 52. Never Lose Your Cool.
If you panic, you lose. A real boss never looks rattled. Even if the building is burning down, walk out slowly. People trust the guy who doesn't flinch.

## 53. Think Fast, Move Faster.
Fools rush in blind. Smart guys overthink and freeze. The trick is the middle: Think it through, then execute immediately. "Make haste slowly." Don't leave anything for tomorrow.

## 54. Show Your Teeth.
If people think you're soft, they'll eat you alive. If you back down once, you'll be backing down forever. Fight the first battle hard so you don't have to fight the next ten. Be the bee: honey for friends, sting for enemies.

## 55. The Waiting Game.
Patience is a weapon. Most people crack under silence or delay. If you can wait, you can win. "Time and I against any two." Let the other guy rush and make a mistake.

## 56. Think on Your Feet.
Some guys need a week to prepare; others are better when the heat is on. If you're an "impromptu" guy, trust your gut. Don't overthink it. Your first instinct is usually the killer one.

## 57. Built to Last.
Quick fixes fall apart. If you want to build an empire, it takes time. Don't rush the foundation. "Done fast" is forgotten; "Done right" is forever.

## 58. Don't Overshoot.
Don't use a cannon to kill a mosquito. It looks desperate. Save your big guns for the big fights. If you show everything you've got on day one, you're boring by day two. Keep something in the tank.

## 59. Stick the Landing.
Everyone loves a grand entrance, but the exit is what they remember. Don't be the guy who stays too long at the party. Leave while they still want more. A bad ending ruins a good story.

## 60. Born Wise.
Some people just have common sense encoded in their DNA. If that's you, use it. Trust your gut over the "latest trends." In serious business, stability beats creativity every time.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 61-70 (Practical Blues)

## 61. Be Great at Something That Matters.
Being the world's best tiddlywinks player won't make you a legend. If you're going to be eminent, pick a field that people actually care about. Excellence in a small game makes you a small king. Excellence in a big game makes you a god.

## 62. Don't Use Cheap Tools.
Never handicap yourself just to show off how smart you are. Using bad employees or cheap tools is a disaster waiting to happen. If you win, you get the credit. If you lose, you get the blame—not your tools. So pick the best tools money can buy.

## 63. Be First.
Originality pays double. The guy who invents the game gets the biggest slice of the pie. The copycats fight over crumbs. If you can't be first in the big league, find a new league where you can be number one. "Better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven."

## 64. Dodge the Drama.
Your peace of mind is your most valuable asset. Don't let people dump their garbage news on you. Block the negativity. And never, ever set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.

## 65. Elevate Your Taste.
You are what you like. If you have cheap taste, you have a cheap soul. Aim high. But don't become one of those snobs who hates everything just to look cool. That's not "refined"; that's just annoying.

## 66. Win.
Nobody cares how hard you tried or how perfect your plan was. They care if you won. Results are the only scoreboard. If you have to break the "rules" of art to get the win, break them. History forgives the winner.

## 67. Pick the Spotlight.
Do jobs that people actually see. You can be the most brilliant guy in the basement, and nobody will care. Pick the roles that get applause. Be the quarterback, not the equipment manager.

## 68. Be the Idea Guy.
Sometimes people are stuck. Drop a hint. Give them the idea, but let them think they thought of it. It's subtle. "Give understanding"—light the spark, but stay in the shadows.

## 69. Don't Be Moody.
Mood swings are for children. A real player is consistent. Don't let a bad morning ruin your decisions for the day. Know yourself well enough to know when you're being irrational, and shut it down.

## 70. The Art of "No."
You can't say "yes" to everyone. If you do, you're worthless. But you don't have to be a jerk about it. Learn to say "no" so smoothly that they thank you for it. Wrap the rejection in sugar. "No" is a complete sentence, but a polite "no" keeps bridges intact.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 71-80 (Practical Blues)

## 71. Don't Be a Flake.
Consistency is king. If you're hot one day and cold the next, people can't rely on you. Don't let your mood dictate your business. Be the rock. Even if you're faking it, be the *same* fake every day.

## 72. Pull the Trigger.
Indecision is death. A bad decision is often better than no decision, because at least you're moving. Don't be the guy who needs a committee to pick a lunch spot. Be the guy who says, "We're going here," and everyone follows.

## 73. The Art of the Dodge.
When someone corners you, don't fight. Slip away. Use a joke, a smile, or a subject change. It's like judo—use their momentum to slide past them. "Not understanding" is sometimes the smartest move you can make.

## 74. Don't Be a Jerk.
Some people get a little power and turn into monsters. They think being inaccessible makes them important. It just makes them hated. If people are scared to talk to you, you're not a leader; you're a bully. And bullies get taken down eventually.

## 75. Pick Your Idol.
Find someone who did it better than you and chase them. Don't just copy them—try to beat them. Alexander the Great cried because Achilles was famous and he wasn't. That jealousy? That's fuel. Use it.

## 76. The Clown Principle.
If you're always joking, nobody takes you seriously. Being funny is great, but being *only* funny is a career killer. People don't promote the court jester; they promote the king. Save the jokes for the right moment.

## 77. Be a Chameleon.
Read the room. If you're with scholars, talk books. If you're with saints, talk God. If you're with sharks, talk money. Mirroring people makes them trust you. It's not being fake; it's being versatile.

## 78. Testing the Waters.
Don't jump in with both feet until you know how deep the water is. Fools rush in. Smart guys send a scout. Test the ground. If it feels shaky, back off. Only commit when you know you can win.

## 79. Have a Vibe.
Being serious is good, but being fun is better. A little bit of charm opens doors that logic can't. If you can make people smile while you take their money, they'll thank you for it.

## 80. Check Your Sources.
Most of what you hear is BS. People lie, exaggerate, or just get it wrong. Don't believe the hype, and definitely don't believe the gossip. "Trust but verify." The guy praising you wants something; the guy hating on you lost something. Figure out the angle before you buy the story.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 81-90 (Practical Blues)

## 81. Rebrand.
Even the best show gets old. If people get used to you, they stop clapping. You need a "Phoenix" moment. Reinvent yourself. Change the game. Go away for a while so they miss you, then come back with something new.

## 82. Leave Some Juice in the Orange.
Don't squeeze everything dry. If you push a good thing too far, it turns bad. If you work too hard, you burn out. If you party too hard, you crash. Moderation isn't boring; it's sustainable. "Don't milk the cow until it bleeds."

## 83. Make a Mistake on Purpose.
If you're too perfect, people hate you. They can't relate to a god. So, drop the ball once in a while. Have a harmless flaw. Let them criticize your tie so they don't attack your soul. Throw the bull a cape so it doesn't gore the matador.

## 84. Use Your Haters.
Your enemies are your best quality control. Friends lie to make you feel good; enemies tell you exactly where you suck. Listen to them. Fix the flaws they point out. Let their hate make you perfect.

## 85. Don't Be the Utility Guy.
The "Malilla" is the wild card—useful everywhere, respected nowhere. If you're available for everything, you're special to no one. Don't be the office handyman. Be the specialist. Scarcity creates value.

## 86. Kill the Rumor.
One bad joke can ruin a reputation. The mob loves a scandal. If you give them a reason to laugh at you, you're finished. Spot the rumor early and crush it. Prevention is easier than the cure.

## 87. Get Polished.
Nobody likes a roughneck. You might be a diamond, but if you're covered in dirt, you look like a rock. Cultivate yourself. Dress well, speak well, act well. "Culture" isn't just about museums; it's about not being a barbarian.

## 88. Don't Sweat the Small Stuff.
Great men don't count pennies. Don't be the guy who argues over the tip or corrects every typo. It makes you look small. Ignore the minor slights. Let things slide. It's called "noble generality."

## 89. Know Your Stats.
You need to know your own character sheet. What's your IQ? What's your stamina? What triggers your anger? You can't run the machine if you don't know the specs. Look in the mirror—the real one.

## 90. The Secret to Long Life.
Don't be stupid, and don't be evil. Vice kills you fast (drugs, stress, enemies). Virtue keeps you chill. A good life feels longer because it's actually worth living. If you want to live forever, leave a legacy.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 91-100 (Practical Blues)

## 91. Don't Doubt Yourself.
If you hesitate, they smell blood. If you think you might be wrong while you're doing it, you're definitely going to look wrong when you're done. Either do it with 100% conviction or don't do it at all. "Maybe" is a losing strategy.

## 92. Common Sense is King.
Forget being clever. Be sensible. A grain of wisdom is worth a ton of wit. Clever people get applause; wise people get paid. If the smart guys respect you, you're winning.

## 93. Be the Renaissance Man.
Don't be a one-trick pony. The guy who can talk business, art, and sports is the guy everyone invites back. Variety makes you indispensable. Be a whole universe in one person.

## 94. Keep 'Em Guessing.
Never let them see the bottom of your tank. If they know your limits, they can control you. If they think your potential is endless, they'll fear and respect you. Mystery is power. Don't be fully "knowable."

## 95. The Sequel Strategy.
Always save something for the next act. If you drop your best hit on day one, day two is a letdown. Keep raising the stakes. Make them wonder, "What's he gonna do next?"

## 96. Trust Your Gut.
"Synderesis" is a fancy word for that little voice that tells you not to be an idiot. Listen to it. It's your internal compass. If it feels wrong, it is wrong. It's the armor you put on before you walk out the door.

## 97. Build Your Rep.
Reputation is interest on the capital of fame. It's hard to get but easy to keep. Once you have it, it does the work for you. People assume you're great before you even open your mouth. Guard it with your life.

## 98. Poker Face.
Your passions are leaks in your armor. If they know what you want, they can manipulate you. If they know what you hate, they can provoke you. Be a "cuttlefish"—ink the water so they can't see where you're going.

## 99. Optics Matter.
It doesn't matter if you're right if you look wrong. People judge the book by the cover. You have to be the real deal *and* look the part. Substance without style is invisible; style without substance is a fraud. You need both.

## 100. The Red Pill.
Be "undeceived." See the world for what it really is—a game, a test, a mess. But don't go around preaching it like a buzzkill. Be a philosopher on the inside, but a smooth operator on the outside. Knowing the truth is your secret weapon, not your conversation starter.
