# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 231-240 (Practical Blues)

## 231. Don't Show Your Work Until It's Finished.
Nobody wants to see the messy middle. If you show a client or a boss a half-baked project, they'll only see the flaws. Wait until it's polished.

## 232. Be Real.
Theoretical brilliance is useless if you don't know how to navigate the real world. Don't be a genius on paper and a disaster in person. Have some "street smarts."

## 233. Don't Gloat Over Someone Else's Failures.
It’s petty and it makes you look small. Instead of celebrating their mistake, figure out how to avoid making it yourself. Focus on your own game.

## 234. Don't Put All Your Chips on One Number.
If that number doesn't come up, you're broke. Diversify. Have multiple streams of income and multiple connections.

## 235. Master the Ask.
Knowing how to ask for a favor or a raise is 90% of the battle. Timing is everything. Find the right moment, the right words, and the right person.

## 236. Turn a Favor into an Asset.
When someone does you a solid, don't just say thanks and forget it. Use that momentum. Let other people know you're "well-connected."

## 237. Speak for Yourself.
Don't just repeat what other people are saying. Have your own opinions. Being an "echo" is for people who can't think for themselves.

## 238. Know When You're Hot.
Success comes in waves. When you're on a winning streak, double down. When you're cold, back off. Learn to recognize your own "Lucky Star."

## 239. Don't Care What People Think.
The "many" are usually idiots. If you base your self-worth on popular opinion, you're letting fools run your life. Be your own judge.

## 240. Weaponize the Insults.
When someone tries to slide you, don't get mad. Figure out how to use it. Turn their "slights" into your weapons.
