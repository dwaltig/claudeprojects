# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 91-100 (Practical Blues)

## 91. Don't Doubt Yourself.
If you hesitate, they smell blood. If you think you might be wrong while you're doing it, you're definitely going to look wrong when you're done. Either do it with 100% conviction or don't do it at all. "Maybe" is a losing strategy.

## 92. Common Sense is King.
Forget being clever. Be sensible. A grain of wisdom is worth a ton of wit. Clever people get applause; wise people get paid. If the smart guys respect you, you're winning.

## 93. Be the Renaissance Man.
Don't be a one-trick pony. The guy who can talk business, art, and sports is the guy everyone invites back. Variety makes you indispensable. Be a whole universe in one person.

## 94. Keep 'Em Guessing.
Never let them see the bottom of your tank. If they know your limits, they can control you. If they think your potential is endless, they'll fear and respect you. Mystery is power. Don't be fully "knowable."

## 95. The Sequel Strategy.
Always save something for the next act. If you drop your best hit on day one, day two is a letdown. Keep raising the stakes. Make them wonder, "What's he gonna do next?"

## 96. Trust Your Gut.
"Synderesis" is a fancy word for that little voice that tells you not to be an idiot. Listen to it. It's your internal compass. If it feels wrong, it is wrong. It's the armor you put on before you walk out the door.

## 97. Build Your Rep.
Reputation is interest on the capital of fame. It's hard to get but easy to keep. Once you have it, it does the work for you. People assume you're great before you even open your mouth. Guard it with your life.

## 98. Poker Face.
Your passions are leaks in your armor. If they know what you want, they can manipulate you. If they know what you hate, they can provoke you. Be a "cuttlefish"—ink the water so they can't see where you're going.

## 99. Optics Matter.
It doesn't matter if you're right if you look wrong. People judge the book by the cover. You have to be the real deal *and* look the part. Substance without style is invisible; style without substance is a fraud. You need both.

## 100. The Red Pill.
Be "undeceived." See the world for what it really is—a game, a test, a mess. But don't go around preaching it like a buzzkill. Be a philosopher on the inside, but a smooth operator on the outside. Knowing the truth is your secret weapon, not your conversation starter.
