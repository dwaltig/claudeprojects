# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 131-140 (Practical Blues)

## 131. Be a Class Act.
Don't be petty. Don't count every favor you do like you're keeping a ledger. A real player has a big heart and a big vision. Act like you've been there before.

## 132. Double-Check the Plan.
Don't rush into a major move. Sleep on it. Patience is a tactical advantage. Let the situation marinate until the right move is obvious.

## 133. Don't Be a Lonely Genius.
If the whole world is going one way, don't stand in the middle of the road shouting that they're wrong. Sometimes it’s smarter to play along with the crowd's BS than to be the only "sane" person in the asylum.

## 134. Have a Backup Plan.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Have a Plan B, a Plan C, and a secret Plan D. Never rely on just one client, one skill, or one connection.

## 135. Don't Be the "Actually..." Guy.
Nobody likes the person who argues just for the sake of arguing. Save your energy for the arguments that actually matter.

## 136. Get to the Point.
Stop dancing around the issue. Figure out the *one thing* that actually matters in a deal or a problem and focus on that. Be the guy who cuts through the noise.

## 137. Be Your Own Best Friend.
If you're solid on the inside, you're untouchable on the outside. A wise man can lose everything and still be okay because he hasn't lost himself. Don't rely on others for your happiness.

## 138. Let It Slide.
Most of the stuff that happens in a day isn't worth getting mad about. Learn to "not see" things. Being a "professional ignorer" is a key survival skill.

## 139. Watch the Vibe.
Some days you're the windshield, some days you're the bug. Don't try to force a win when the universe is pushing back. Wait for your "hot" days to make your big moves.

## 140. Find the Win.
In every bad situation, there’s a silver lining. Don't go looking for the dirt; look for the opportunity. If you train your brain to see the "good" in everything, you'll always find a way to profit.
