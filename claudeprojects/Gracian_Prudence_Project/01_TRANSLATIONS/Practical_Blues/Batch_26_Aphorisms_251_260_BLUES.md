# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 251-260 (Practical Blues)

## 251. Work Like It’s All on You, Pray Like It’s All on Him.
Use every human resource, every trick, and every bit of effort as if no higher power exists. But have the faith that something bigger is moving the pieces.

## 252. Don't Give Away the Whole Store.
Don't be 100% available to 100% of the people. If you give everything you have to everyone, you’ll end up with nothing for yourself. Keep a private stash of your time.

## 253. Don't Be a Nitpicker.
Notice everything, but don't feel the need to comment on everything. Correcting every tiny mistake makes you look small. Let the small stuff slide so you can focus on the big wins.

## 254. Don't Ignore the "Small" Problems.
A tiny leak can sink a huge ship. If you let a "minor" evil in the door, it’ll bring its big brothers along later. Discard the bad cards early.

## 255. Drip-Feed the Favors.
Don't do everyone a massive favor all at once. Spread it out. Give a little now, a little later. It keeps people wanting more and keeps them in your debt longer.

## 256. Stay Strapped (With Prudence).
Always be ready for the idiots. They are everywhere and they are bold. Keep your guard up. Stay focused on the business at hand.

## 257. Don't Burn the Bridge Until You've Crossed It.
Never make a scene or a "rupture" unless you absolutely have to. A graceful exit is better than a loud explosion. If you have to leave, leave with your head high.

## 258. Find a Bodyguard for Your Reputation.
If things are going south, find someone else to share the blame. You can't lead if you're the only target for everyone's anger. Have a "shield" to take the heat.

## 259. Flip the Script.
When someone tries to insult you, turn it into a compliment. When they try to hurt you, turn it into a favor. Use their own energy to win.

## 260. Own Yourself.
If you belong to everyone else's opinions and moods, you don't belong to yourself. Be your own boss. Don't let someone else's bad day ruin yours.
