# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 21-30 (Practical Blues)

## 21. Make Your Own Luck.
Luck isn't magic; it's math. You can wait by the door hoping Fortune lets you in, or you can kick the door down. The "lucky" guy is usually just the guy who prepared the most. Prudence is the only real luck.

## 22. Be Interesting.
Nobody likes a boring genius. You need "walking around knowledge"—current events, good jokes, style. Being able to hold a conversation is worth more than a PhD. Don't be a library; be a newsfeed.

## 23. Fix the Glitch.
One tiny flaw can ruin a perfect package. It's like a Ferrari with a scratch—everyone stares at the scratch. Don't let a small bad habit eclipse your massive talent. If you can't fix it, hide it. If you can't hide it, style it out like Caesar.

## 24. Control Your Head.
Your imagination is a wild horse. If you don't ride it, it rides you. It can make you miserable by inventing problems that don't exist, or reckless by promising wins that aren't real. Put a bridle on it. Stay in reality.

## 25. Read Between the Lines.
People never say what they mean. Especially when it matters. You need to be a "lynx" for intentions—see through the fog. If the news is too good, doubt it. If it's bad, assume it's true and get ready.

## 26. Find Their Button.
Everyone wants something. Money, fame, pleasure, power. Find out what that *one thing* is for the person you're dealing with. That's their "handle." Once you grab that handle, you own them. Checkmate.

## 27. Quality Over Quantity.
Don't try to be everything. Be the *best* at something. A thimble of diamonds is worth more than a mountain of mud. Deep beats wide every time. Don't be a "Jack of all trades, master of none." Be the master of one.

## 28. Don't Be Basic.
If everyone likes you, you're doing something wrong. The crowd has bad taste. If the mob is cheering, check your work. Excellence is lonely. Don't chase "likes"; chase respect.

## 29. Stand Your Ground.
Be the guy who can't be bought. It's rare. Everyone loves integrity until it costs them money. Be the "Phoenix of Equity." Even if you lose friends or money, you keep your soul. And eventually, people will trust you more than anyone else because they know you don't fold.

## 30. Don't Be a Weirdo.
Don't chase jobs or hobbies that make you look like a clown. There are plenty of "sects of caprice"—cults, fads, weird obsessions. Stay away. Don't be famous for being a joke. Stick to the stuff that commands respect.
