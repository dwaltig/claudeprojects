# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 191-200 (Practical Blues)

## 191. Don't Be Fooled by Over-the-Top Politeness.
When someone is being *too* nice, they're usually trying to sell you something or hide something. Words are cheap; deeds are expensive. If it feels like a spell, it probably is.

## 192. Stay Chill, Live Longer.
Peace isn't just a vibe; it's a health strategy. The guy who's always picking fights and stressing out dies young. The guy who knows how to "let live" is the one who ends up running the show.

## 193. Watch the Guy with the Secret Agenda.
There’s always someone who pretends to be helping you while they’re actually helping themselves. Be a "lynx"—see through the fake smiles and find the real target.

## 194. Keep Your Cool.
Don't get too hyped up or too depressed about anything. Extremes are where you make mistakes. Keep your judgments moderate. If something looks too good to be true, it is.

## 195. Wait for the Right Moment.
Patience is the ultimate power move. Most people fail because they rush. Let the fruit ripen. Let the deal cook. Time is the one thing you can't buy, but you can definitely use it.

## 196. Find Your Lane.
Everybody has a time and a place where they shine. Figure out when your "star" is shining and make your big moves then. Don't try to be a daytime hero if you're a creature of the night.

## 197. Don't Follow the Crowd.
If the "many" are doing it, it’s probably a bad idea. The mob is usually wrong. Be your own world. If you know you're right, stay right, even if you're the only one.

## 198. Turn Their Hate into Your Gain.
When someone tries to slide you or insult you, don't just take it. Figure out how to use it. If they call you "ruthless," use that fear to close a deal.

## 199. Be Straight.
Integrity is your foundation. If you're a "man of rectitude," people will trust you even when they don't like you. In a world full of fakes, being the real deal is the ultimate luxury.

## 200. Always Keep Wanting More.
If you have everything, you have nothing left to live for. The "total" win is actually a loss because it kills your drive. Save a little bit of "desire" for tomorrow.
