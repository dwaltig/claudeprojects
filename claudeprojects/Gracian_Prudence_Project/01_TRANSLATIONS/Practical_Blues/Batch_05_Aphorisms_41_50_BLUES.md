# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 41-50 (Practical Blues)

## 41. Don't Hype It.
Superlatives are for liars. If you say everything is "amazing," nothing is. When you over-promise, you set yourself up to fail. Keep it chill. Let the results speak louder than the pitch.

## 42. The "It" Factor.
Some people just have it. They walk in, and everyone shuts up. You can't fake this. It's not about being loud; it's about being solid. It's a "Natural Empire." If you have it, use it. If you don't, don't try to fake it—you'll just look annoying.

## 43. Think Like a Genius, Talk Like a Regular Guy.
Don't be the guy correcting everyone's grammar or logic at the bar. It makes people hate you. Keep your brilliant thoughts to yourself (or your smart friends) and speak the language of the room. Swimming upstream just gets you drowned.

## 44. Vibe with Winners.
Winners recognize winners. It's a chemical thing. If you feel a connection with a "Hero"—someone crushing it—lean into it. That sympathy is worth gold. It’s not magic; it’s game recognizing game.

## 45. Don't Look Like You're Thinking.
If people see you calculating, they stop trusting you. Hide the gears. Be smart, but look natural. The moment they think you're "plotting," they put their guards up.

## 46. Don't Hate the Player.
We all have gut reactions to people. Sometimes you just hate a guy's face. Fix that. Especially if that guy is a heavy hitter. Hating successful people makes you look petty and small. Learn to respect the game, even if you don't like the player.

## 47. Don't Get Stuck.
Avoid "Empeños"—sticky situations, obligations, messes. It's easier to stay out than to get out. Don't volunteer for drama. Keep your freedom. A smart man sees a trap and walks around it; a hero walks into it and tries to fight his way out. Be the smart man.

## 48. Be Deep.
Don't be a movie set—all front, no back. Some people run out of conversation in five minutes. Be a "Man of Funds." Have layers. The more they dig, the more they should find.

## 49. Read the Room.
Be a scanner. Look at people and X-ray them. Don't just see the suit; see the insecurity. Don't just hear the words; hear the agenda. "Anatomy of a capacity"—dissect them before they dissect you.

## 50. Don't Be a Slob When You're Alone.
Character is what you do when nobody's watching. If you have to wait for a cop to act right, you're not a good person; you're just a scared one. Respect yourself enough to keep your standards high, even in the dark.
