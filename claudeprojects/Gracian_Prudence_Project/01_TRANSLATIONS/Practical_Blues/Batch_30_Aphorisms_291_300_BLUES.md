# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 291-300 (Practical Blues)

## 291. Build a Reputation for Being Tough.
If people always try to slide you, it's because they think they can get away with it. Don't be the "unlucky" target. Build a reputation that says, "Don't even try it."

## 292. Weaponize the Hate.
When someone tries to insult you, don't get defensive—get offensive. Use their "slight" as a reason to be tougher or to move faster. Turn their malevolence into your fuel.

## 293. Keep Your Own Counsel.
Don't be an "echo" for someone else's drama. If your friend hates someone, that's their problem. Stay neutral. Your reputation is too valuable to waste on someone else's enemies.

## 294. Ride the Wave.
Recognize when you're hot and push your advantage. When you're cold, back off. Know your own "Star."

## 295. Don't Care What the Idiots Think.
The crowd is usually wrong. Be your own world. If you know you're right, stay right, even if you're the only one.

## 296. Always Keep a Goal in Front of You.
If you have everything, you have nothing left to live for. Always leave a little something "to desire." It’s the only thing that keeps you sharp.

## 297. Be the Real Deal.
Integrity is your foundation. In a world full of fakes, being real is the ultimate luxury.

## 298. Don't Flex.
The more you show off, the less people actually respect you. Let your skills speak for themselves.

## 299. The Strategic "No."
Sometimes you have to disagree with someone just to see where they stand. It’s a way to test their will and keep them from taking you for granted.

## 300. The Final Word: Have Character.
If you want the ultimate win, be a "Saint"—not the religious kind, but the kind who is so solid, so wise, and so integral that nobody can touch you. Virtue is the ultimate strategic advantage. It makes you unstoppable, untouchable, and a legend.
