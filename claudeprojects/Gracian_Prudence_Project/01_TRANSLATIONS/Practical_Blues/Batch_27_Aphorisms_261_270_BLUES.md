# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 261-270 (Practical Blues)

## 261. Don't Be Stubborn About Being Wrong.
If you're heading in the wrong direction, turning around isn't weakness—it's intelligence. Admit the mistake, fix it, and move on.

## 262. Learn to Forget.
Your brain only has so much space. Don't fill it with old grudges or minor insults. If it doesn't help you win tomorrow, let it go today.

## 263. Don't Ride Someone Else's Coattails.
If you spend all your time talking about how great someone else is, you’re just their fan. Build your own brand. Focus on your own climb.

## 264. Avoid Being the Punching Bag.
If people always pick on you, it’s because you let them. Build a reputation that makes people think twice before they slight you.

## 265. Pay It Forward (Tactically).
Do favors for people *before* they can do anything for you. It puts you in a position of power. It’s the cheapest way to buy loyalty.

## 266. Don't Carry Other People's Beef.
If your friend hates someone, that doesn't mean you have to. Don't be the "echo" of someone else's drama. Stay neutral.

## 267. Ride the Hot Hand.
Recognize when things are going your way and press the bet. If luck is on your side, don't walk away. Know your own "Star."

## 268. Ignore the Mob.
If a thousand fools say something is good, it’s probably trash. Don't let popular opinion run your life. Be your own world.

## 269. Flip the Insult.
When someone tries to slide you, turn it into a win. Turn their "slights" into your advantages.

## 270. Keep Your Hunger.
Don't get too comfortable. Happiness is a trap if it stops you from moving. Always leave a little something "to desire."
