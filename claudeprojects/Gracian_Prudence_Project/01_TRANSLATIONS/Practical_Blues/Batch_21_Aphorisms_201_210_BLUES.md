# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 201-210 (Practical Blues)

## 201. Assume Everyone is Stupid.
If someone looks like an idiot, they are. But half the people who look smart are actually idiots too. Real wisdom starts with knowing how much you don't know. If you think you've got it all figured out, you're the mark.

## 202. Talk the Talk, Walk the Walk.
Being a smooth talker is great for the head; being a high-level doer is great for the heart. You need both to be the real deal. Let your results be your loudest argument.

## 203. Recognize the Heavy Hitters.
True greatness is rare. Don't be fooled by the hype of the "pretty good" guys. When you see a real Phoenix—a once-in-a-century talent—pay attention.

## 204. Stay Focused, Stay Chill.
When a job looks easy, don't get lazy—treat it like it's a monster. When a job looks impossible, don't panic—treat it like a walk in the park. Diligence makes the hard stuff easy.

## 205. Play Hard to Get.
If you chase something too hard, it runs away. The best way to get what you want is to act like you don't really need it. When you stop acting desperate, the world starts coming to you.

## 206. Bums are Everywhere.
Having a fancy office or a big title doesn't mean someone isn't a "vulgar" soul. Don't trust someone just because they're important. The mob is always wrong, no matter what they're wearing.

## 207. Don't Blow Your Top.
Self-control is your internal brake system. If you just react to every insult or every problem, you’re going to crash. You need that buffer of logic.

## 208. Don't Die Over Nothing.
Fools die of stress and taking things too personally. Don't let your own head kill you. Grow a thicker skin. Learn to tolerate mistakes and keep moving.

## 209. Quit the Hive Mind.
The "common opinion" is usually just a shared hallucination. Break out of the box. Look under the surface. Truth isn't found in a crowd; it's found in thinking for yourself.

## 210. Tell the Truth, but Be Careful.
The truth is like a loaded gun—you don't just wave it around. You have to know when to use it and who to use it on. Learn to package it and time it.
