# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 121-130 (Practical Blues)

## 121. Don't Be a Drama Queen.
Some people turn every tiny detail into a major production. If you treat everything like a "big deal," then nothing is a big deal. Learn to ignore the small stuff so it stays small.

## 122. Move Like a Boss.
Carry yourself with weight. It starts before you even open your mouth. It’s in how you walk, how you look at people, and how you take up space. Have that internal gravity that makes people pay attention.

## 123. Keep it Natural.
The harder you try to look cool, the less cool you look. Real talent should look easy. Do the hardest thing in the world like it’s no big deal. That's "Despejo."

## 124. Be the Guy Everyone Wants.
If nobody wants you around, you've already lost. You want to be the guy people "need" because of your skills and "want" because of your personality. Skill gets you in the door; vibes keep you there.

## 125. Don't Be a Snitch or a Gossip.
The guy who’s always talking about everyone else's mess usually has a mess of his own he's trying to hide. Digging in other people's dirt just gets you dirty. Keep your eyes on your own paper.

## 126. Hide Your Mistakes.
Everyone screws up. The difference between a pro and an amateur is that the pro knows how to bury the evidence. If you can't be perfect, at least be quiet.

## 127. The Secret Sauce (Despejo).
There’s a "don't know what" factor that makes certain people magnetic. It’s not just talent; it’s the *way* they use it. It’s that effortless vibe that says, "I'm better than this, but I'm doing it anyway."

## 128. Think Big.
Have a "High Spirit." Don't be petty. Don't be jealous. Elevate your thoughts, your goals, and your taste. A big heart attracts big opportunities.

## 129. No Whining.
Nobody likes a complainer. When you complain, you're telling the world you're a victim, and the world hates victims. Instead of talking about how you got screwed, talk about who's helping you.

## 130. Do the Work, Then Show the Work.
Being good is 50% of the battle. The other 50% is making sure people *know* you're good. You have to market your results. Reality is just what people think is real.
