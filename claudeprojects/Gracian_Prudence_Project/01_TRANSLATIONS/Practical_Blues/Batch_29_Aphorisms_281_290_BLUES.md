# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 281-290 (Practical Blues)

## 281. Don't Be a Fanboy.
If you spend all your time talking about how great someone else is, you're just their PR agent. Build your own brand. Acknowledge their success, but don't let their fame eclipse yours.

## 282. Selective Memory.
Learn to delete the trash in your head. Grudges and small insults are just dead weight. If it doesn't help you win tomorrow, let it go today.

## 283. Admit the Mistake.
If you're wrong, pivot immediately. Only a fool doubles down on a losing hand. Being able to admit you messed up and fixing it fast is a sign of high-level game.

## 284. Don't Adopt Other People's Beef.
If your partner or friend hates someone, that's their problem. Don't be their "echo." Your reputation is too valuable to waste on someone else's drama.

## 285. Watch Your Winning Streaks.
Everyone has a "Lucky Star"—those times when everything just clicks. Recognize when you're hot and push your advantage.

## 286. Don't Be a Sheep.
If everyone is doing it, it’s probably a bad idea. The crowd is usually wrong. Be your own world. If you know you're right, stay right.

## 287. Stay a Little Bit Hungry.
Never get 100% comfortable. If you have everything, you have no drive. Always save a little "desire" for tomorrow.

## 288. Be the Real Deal.
Integrity is your foundation. If you're a "man of rectitude," people will trust you even when they don't like you. In a world full of fakes, being real is the ultimate luxury.

## 289. Don't Flex.
The more you show off, the less people actually respect you. If you have to tell everyone you're a boss, you're probably not. Let your skills speak for themselves.

## 290. Master the "Strategic No."
Sometimes you have to disagree with someone just to see where they stand. It’s a way to test their will and keep them from taking you for granted.
