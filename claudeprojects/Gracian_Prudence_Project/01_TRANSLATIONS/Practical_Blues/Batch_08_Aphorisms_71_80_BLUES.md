# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 71-80 (Practical Blues)

## 71. Don't Be a Flake.
Consistency is king. If you're hot one day and cold the next, people can't rely on you. Don't let your mood dictate your business. Be the rock. Even if you're faking it, be the *same* fake every day.

## 72. Pull the Trigger.
Indecision is death. A bad decision is often better than no decision, because at least you're moving. Don't be the guy who needs a committee to pick a lunch spot. Be the guy who says, "We're going here," and everyone follows.

## 73. The Art of the Dodge.
When someone corners you, don't fight. Slip away. Use a joke, a smile, or a subject change. It's like judo—use their momentum to slide past them. "Not understanding" is sometimes the smartest move you can make.

## 74. Don't Be a Jerk.
Some people get a little power and turn into monsters. They think being inaccessible makes them important. It just makes them hated. If people are scared to talk to you, you're not a leader; you're a bully. And bullies get taken down eventually.

## 75. Pick Your Idol.
Find someone who did it better than you and chase them. Don't just copy them—try to beat them. Alexander the Great cried because Achilles was famous and he wasn't. That jealousy? That's fuel. Use it.

## 76. The Clown Principle.
If you're always joking, nobody takes you seriously. Being funny is great, but being *only* funny is a career killer. People don't promote the court jester; they promote the king. Save the jokes for the right moment.

## 77. Be a Chameleon.
Read the room. If you're with scholars, talk books. If you're with saints, talk God. If you're with sharks, talk money. Mirroring people makes them trust you. It's not being fake; it's being versatile.

## 78. Testing the Waters.
Don't jump in with both feet until you know how deep the water is. Fools rush in. Smart guys send a scout. Test the ground. If it feels shaky, back off. Only commit when you know you can win.

## 79. Have a Vibe.
Being serious is good, but being fun is better. A little bit of charm opens doors that logic can't. If you can make people smile while you take their money, they'll thank you for it.

## 80. Check Your Sources.
Most of what you hear is BS. People lie, exaggerate, or just get it wrong. Don't believe the hype, and definitely don't believe the gossip. "Trust but verify." The guy praising you wants something; the guy hating on you lost something. Figure out the angle before you buy the story.
