# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 101-110 (Practical Blues)

## 101. Everyone’s a Critic.
Half the world thinks the other half is crazy. Don't be the guy who thinks his taste is the only "right" one. Different strokes for different folks. If the heavy hitters in your game respect you, you're fine.

## 102. Grow a Bigger Appetite.
Don't choke on a little bit of success. If a small promotion makes you act like a king, you've reached your limit. A real player handles a million-dollar win like it’s a Tuesday.

## 103. Act Like Royalty.
You might not have the crown, but you can have the class. High-level thoughts, high-level moves. If you carry yourself like a boss, people start treating you like one.

## 104. Know the Job.
Every role is different. Some need a sledgehammer, some need a scalpel. Managing people is the hardest gig there is, especially when they're idiots. You need double the brains to handle a guy who has none.

## 105. Keep it Short.
Brevity is a power move. The longer you talk, the more you look like a salesman. Get in, say your piece, and get out. If it's good, less is more.

## 106. Don't Flex Your Luck.
Showing off your status is the fastest way to get hated. If you’re truly a man of substance, you don’t need the fancy title to get respect. Flex your skills, not your bank account.

## 107. Stay Hungry, Stay Humble.
Being a hater of your own life is weak, but being a fanboy of yourself is stupid. If you think you're perfect, you've stopped growing. A smart man is always looking for the leak in his own boat.

## 108. Trade Your Vibe.
Hang out with people who have the traits you lack. If you're too impulsive, find a chill partner. If you're too quiet, find a loud one. Personality traits are contagious.

## 109. Don't Be a Hater.
Some guys wake up looking for a reason to be mad. They find a "crime" in everything. Be the guy who finds an excuse for people, not the guy who finds a reason to hang them.

## 110. Leave the Party Early.
Don't wait for the lights to come up and the music to stop. Cash out while you're still winning. Don't wait for people to get sick of you. A graceful exit is a victory in itself.
