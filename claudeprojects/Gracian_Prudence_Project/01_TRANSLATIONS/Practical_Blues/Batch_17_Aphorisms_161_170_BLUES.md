# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 161-170 (Practical Blues)

## 161. Accept the Glitches.
Nobody is 100% perfect. Don't throw away a great partner just because they have a small flaw. Learn to live with the "venial" sins if the "mortal" virtues are solid.

## 162. Make 'Em Miss You.
If you're always around, you're just part of the furniture. Absence creates value. When you leave, people start remembering only the good stuff and forgetting the annoying stuff.

## 163. Keep Your Eye on the Goal.
Don't let your feelings drive the car. You need to be the boss of your own head. The moment you let anger, fear, or lust take the wheel, you're heading for a crash.

## 164. Throw a Curveball.
If you want to know what someone is really thinking, drop a "test" comment. Say something controversial or do something unexpected and watch their face. It’s like throwing a rock into a pond.

## 165. Fight Fair.
Even when you're taking someone down, don't be a scumbag. Don't use low blows or "poisoned" gossip. Winning by being a snake isn't winning; it's just surviving as a snake.

## 166. Talkers vs. Doers.
This is the big one. Some people talk a big game but never deliver. Others shut up and get it done. Learn to spot the difference early so you don't waste your time.

## 167. Be Your Own Cavalry.
When things get ugly, don't look around for someone to save you. Save yourself. A big heart and a clear head are the only backup you really have.

## 168. Don't Be a High-Level Idiot.
There are plenty of dumb people, but the most dangerous kind is the one who uses logic to justify their stupidity. Don't be the guy who thinks he's brilliant while he's walking off a cliff.

## 169. Start Strong, Finish Stronger.
First impressions are the hook, but the ending is the check. You want people to remember the "exit" more than the "entrance."

## 170. Don't Be a Hater’s Puppet.
Don't let someone else's grudge become yours. If a guy hates your friend, that doesn't mean you have to hate him too. Don't be an "echo" for someone else's anger.
