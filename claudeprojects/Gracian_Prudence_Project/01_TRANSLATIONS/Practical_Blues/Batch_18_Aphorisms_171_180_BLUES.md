# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 171-180 (Practical Blues)

## 171. Guard Your Credit.
Reputation is your only real bank account. If you spend it on stupid stuff or small favors, you won't have any left when you really need it. Save your chips for the big game.

## 172. Don't Fight a Guy with Nothing to Lose.
It’s a sucker’s bet. Never get into a mud-wrestling match with a pig—the pig likes it, and you just get dirty. If a guy has no money and no future, he can do anything to you and it won't hurt him.

## 173. Don't Be Fragile.
Some people are like glass—one wrong word and they shatter. Don't be that guy. Be solid. Be tough enough to take a hit or a joke without falling apart.

## 174. Don't Rush Life.
If you're always running to the next thing, you're never actually *at* the thing you're at. Learn to slow down and enjoy the win.

## 175. Be the Real Deal.
Some guys are all jewelry and no bank account. Be the guy with "substance." Have real skills and real assets. The "bark" looks good, but the "core" is what lasts.

## 176. Know How to Ask.
Asking is an art. Figure out who you're talking to and what kind of mood they're in before you make your move.

## 177. Don't Get Too Cozy with the Boss.
Familiarity breeds contempt. If you get too close to the people at the top, they stop respecting you. Keep a professional distance. You want them to value you, not get used to you.

## 178. Play the Part.
If you're the manager, act like the manager. Don't be a "monstrosity"—a guy who's one thing on paper and something else in person. People need to know what to expect from you.

## 179. Don't Be a Hater of What’s Popular.
Even if you think a new trend is stupid, don't go on a crusade against it. Don't be the "old man yelling at clouds." Respect the crowd, even if you don't follow them.

## 180. Don't Repeat Insults.
If someone says something bad about you, don't be the one who tells everyone else. Be the "tomb" for bad news. Let the insults die with you.
