# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 1-10 (Scholarly)

## 1. Todo está ya en su punto, y el ser persona en el mayor.
Everything is now at its peak, and being a person at its greatest. Today more is required for one sage than was required for seven in the past; and more is needed to deal with a single man in these times than with a whole people in ages gone by.

## 2. Genio y Ingenio.
Character and Intellect. These are the two axes of brilliance. One without the other is half-happiness. Understanding is not enough; a specific disposition is required. The misfortune of the fool is to err in his vocation, rank, and associations.

## 3. Llevar sus cosas con suspensión.
Keep things in suspense. The admiration of novelty is the estimation of success. Playing with cards exposed is neither useful nor pleasant. Not declaring yourself immediately keeps others in suspense, especially when the height of your position makes you the object of universal expectation. It is the reserved silence that is the sanctuary of wisdom.

## 4. El saber y el valor alternan grandeza.
Wisdom and Valor alternated in greatness. Because they are so, they make one immortal. A man is as much as he knows, and the wise man can do all things. A man without information is a world in darkness. Wisdom without valor is sterile.

## 5. Hazer depender.
Create dependency. It is not the one who gilds the idol who makes the god, but the one who adores it. The shrewd man prefers those who need him over those who are grateful to him. Dependency ends when satisfaction begins. Keep the patron in need of you, but do not allow them to fall into ruin for your own benefit.

## 6. Hombre en su punto.
Man at his peak. One is not born complete. Every day one perfects the person, the occupation, until reaching the point of consummate being. This is known by the elevation of taste, the purification of intellect, the maturity of judgment, and the refinement of the will.

## 7. Escusar vitorias del patrón.
Avoid victories over the superior. All defeat is odious, and defeating one's master is either foolish or fatal. Superiority is always hated, especially by those who are already superior. One may cede in luck or character, but never in intellect. The stars teach us this: they are brilliant, yet they never dare to outshine the sun.

## 8. Hombre inapassionable.
A man without passion. This is a sign of the greatest height of spirit. Superiority redeems one from the subjection of common impressions. There is no greater lordship than that of oneself.

## 9. Desmentir los achaques de su nación.
Belie the defects of your nation. Water takes the qualities of the veins it passes through; man takes the climate of where he is born. No nation escapes some original defect. Shrewdly correct or at least conceal these national stains.

## 10. Fortuna y Fama.
Fortune and Fame. What the former has of inconstancy, the latter has of firmness. The first is for living; the second for what comes after. Fortune is desired; Fame is earned through virtue.
