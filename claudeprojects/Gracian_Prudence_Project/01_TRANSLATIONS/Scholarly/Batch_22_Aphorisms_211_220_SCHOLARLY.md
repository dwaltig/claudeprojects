# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 211-220 (Scholarly)

## 211. No ser "infeliz" en los desdoros.
Do not be "unfortunate" in the slights. For even a slight can be a crime of folly. One must not be the "target" of everyone's malevolence. Let prudence be the "shield" against the audacity of the foolish.

## 212. Nunca "ostentar" sus prendas.
Never "ostentate" your qualities. For the more they are shown, the less they are esteemed. Affectation is the "soul" of the artificial. Perfections are worth as much as they are "natural."

## 213. Saber "contradezir" con advertencia.
Know how to "contradict" with warning. It is a singular art: to show yourself "contrary" to secure the will. One must not be a "slave" to another's humor.

## 214. No ser "in-acesible" de genio.
Do not be "un-accessable" by character. For it is a species of ferocity. Inaccessibility is the vice of those unknown to themselves. One must have the "door" open to a friendly warning.

## 215. Atención al que obra de "apretamiento."
Be careful with him who acts by "suit" (*de apretamiento*). For it is a species of tyranny. One must not be a "victim" of another's passion. Let prudence be the "brakeman" of the will.

## 216. Saber "valerse" de los "yerros" ajenos.
Know how to "utilize" the "errors" of others. For it is a singular art. One must not be a "martyr" to another's malevolence... but a "master" of it.

## 217. Nunca ser "desigual" en su proceder.
Never be "unequal" in your procedure. For the wise man was always the same in everything perfect. In matters of prudence, variety is ugly.

## 218. No ser "ceremonioso" por affectación.
Do not be "ceremonious" by affectation. For it is a species of hypocrisy. Too much ceremony is a burden of life. Let the prudent man be polite, but not "punctilious."

## 219. Nunca "arriesgar" su reputación a una sola suerte.
Never "risk" your reputation on a single cast. For if it fails, the damage is total. One must have "reserves" of credit. Let things be attempted by parts.

## 220. Dexar algo que "dessear."
Leave something to "Desire." So as not to be "miserable" in happiness. The "body" itself needs the "hope" of more... for the "total" fruition is the "death" of the spirit.
