## 101. La metad del mundo se está riendo de la otra metad.
One half of the world is laughing at the other half, with the folly of all. Perfections do not depend on a single liking. The standard of true satisfaction is the approval of men of reputation. One does not live by a single vote.

## 102. Estómago para grandes vocados de la fortuna.
A stomach for great mouthfuls of fortune. A large capacity is composed of large parts. He who deserves greater fortunes is not embarrassed by good ones. Show that you still have room for greater things.

## 103. Cada uno la magestad en su modo.
Each one the majesty in his mode. Let all actions, if not those of a King, be worthy of one. Represent a King by merits, if not by reality, for true sovereignty consists in the integrity of customs.

## 104. Tener tomado el pulso a los empleos.
Have the pulse of employments taken. Piden unos valor y otros sutileza. Governing men is a laborious occupation, especially fools or madmen: double sense is needed for one who has none.

Do not weary. Brevity is flattering and more business-like. Good things, if brief, are twice as good. Discreet men should excuse embarrassing others, especially great personages who are very busy. Well said is said quickly.

## 106. No afectar la fortuna.
Do not affect your fortune. Ostentating dignity offends more than ostentating the person. Esteem is achieved less the more it is sought. Let it be the eminence of your talents rather than adventitious dignity.

## 107. No mostrar satisfación de sí.
Do not show satisfaction with yourself. Live neither discontented, which is smallness, nor satisfied, which is folly. Satisfaction in most arises from ignorance. Prudence is always useful for prevention.

A shortcut to being a person: knowing how to associate. Intercourse is very effective. Customs and tastes are communicated. With the communication of extremes, a very discreet mean will be adjusted.

Do not wait to be a setting Sun. It is a maxim of the prudent to leave things before they leave you. Steal your body away from the sunsets. The observant man retires the racehorse in time.

## 113. Prevenirse en la fortuna próspera para la adversa.
Prepare in prosperous fortune for the adverse. Favors go cheap then, and friendships are abundant. Adversity is expensive and lacks everything. Have a reserve of friends and the grateful.

## 115. Hazerse a las malas condiciones de los familiares.
Accustom yourself to the bad conditions of familiars. Just as to bad faces: it is a convenience where dependency mediates. Reflection prevents the disgusts or tolerates them.

Deal always with people of obligations. Their very obligation is the greatest guarantee of their dealing. It is better to fight with good people than to triumph over bad people.

## 117. Nunca hablar de sí.
Never speak of yourself. Either you must praise yourself, which is vanity, or you must vituperate yourself, which is smallness. The same inconvenience of prudence lies in speaking of those present.

Gain the fame of Courtly. Which is enough to make you plausible. Courtesy is the principal part of culture, a species of spell. Courtesy must always be more rather than less.

## 119. No hazerse de mal querer.
Do not make yourself ill-willed. Aversion should not be provoked. Malevolence prevents obligation. Show, then, that you estimate in order to be estimated.

Highness of spirit. One of the principal requisites for the Hero. It seasons the taste, enlarges the heart, elevates the thought. It never admits envy, that moth of perfections.

Never complain. Complaining always brings discredit. It rather solicits the audacity of passion in him who hears it than his consolation. The prudent man must never mention his slights.

## 130. Hazer, y hazer parecer.
Do and make it seen. Things do not pass for what they are, but for what they seem. Worthy and being seen to be so is double being. Deceit is very common; things are judged by the exterior.
