# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 91-100 (Scholarly)

## 91. Obrar siempre sin escrúpulos de imprudencia.
Act always without scruples of imprudence. The suspicion of error in the one who executes is already evidence in the one who watches. Actions in doubt of prudence are dangerous. Prudence does not admit probabilities.

## 92. Seso trascendental.
Transcendental sense. It is the first and supreme rule of acting and speaking. A grain of prudence is worth more than pounds (*arrobas*) of subtlety. It will suffice to satisfy the wise, whose vote is the touchstone of successes.

## 93. Hombre universal.
A universal man. Composed of all perfection, he is worth many. He makes life very happy, communicating this enjoyment to familiarity. Variety with perfection is the entertainment of life.

## 94. Incomprehensibilidad de caudal.
Incomprehensibility of capacity. Allow yourself to be known, not comprehended. Let no one ascertain the limits of your capacity. Opinion and doubt of where each one's capacity reaches cause greater effects of veneration than the evidence of it.

## 95. Saber entretener la expectación.
Know how to keep expectation alive. Let the much promise more, and let the best action be a bid for greater ones. One must not throw the whole remainder (*el resto*) at the first cast.

## 96. De la gran sindéresis.
Of the great *synderesis*. It is the throne of reason, the base of prudence. It is a gift of Heaven, and the most desired for being first and best. All the actions of life depend on its influence.

## 97. Conseguir y conservar la reputación.
Obtain and preserve reputation. It is the usufruct of fame. It costs much, because it is born of eminences. Once obtained, it is preserved with ease. It obliges much and works more.

## 98. Cifrar la voluntad.
Write the will in cipher (*Cifrar la voluntad*). Passions are the breaches of the mind. The most practical knowledge consists in dissimulating. Let your taste not be known, so that it may not be forestalled.

## 99. Realidad y apariencia.
Reality and appearance. Things do not pass for what they are, but for what they seem. Few are those who look inside, and many those who are satisfied with the apparent. It is not enough to be right with a face of malice.

## 100. Varón desengañado.
A man undeceived (*desengañado*): a Christian sage, a Courtly philosopher. But not to seem so, much less to affect it. Philosophizing is discredited... But disillusion was always the food of prudence.
