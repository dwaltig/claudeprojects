# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 21-30 (Scholarly)

## 21. Arte para ser dichoso.
Art for being lucky. There are rules of luck, for not all is chance for the wise; it can be aided by industry. Some content themselves with standing gracefully at the gates of Fortune and waiting for her to act. Others, better, go forward and make use of prudent audacity.

## 22. Hombre de plausibles noticias.
A man of plausible knowledge. Courtly, pleasant erudition is the ammunition of the discreet: a practical knowing of everything current, more for news than for scholarship. Conversational wisdom has been worth more to some than all the Seven Liberal Arts.

## 23. No tener algún desdoro.
Have no blemish. The fate of perfection. Few live without some defect, moral or natural, and they become passionate about them when they could easily cure them. A single cloud is enough to eclipse a whole Sun.

## 24. Templar la imaginación.
Temper the imagination. Sometimes correcting it, sometimes aiding it. It tends to be a tyrant; it is not content with speculation but acts, and even lords over life. All this it can do, if prudent judgment (*sindéresis*) does not curb it.

## 25. Buen entendedor.
A good understander. It was once an art of arts to know how to reason; now it is not enough, one must divine. Truths that matter most to us always come half-said. There are diviners of the heart and lynxes of intentions.

## 26. Hallarle su torcedor a cada uno.
Find each person's handle (*torcedor*). It is the art of moving wills; it consists more in skill than in resolution. All are idolaters: some of esteem, others of interest, and most of pleasure. The trick lies in knowing these idols.

## 27. Pagarse más de intensiones que de extensiones.
Prefer intensity to extent. Perfection does not consist in quantity, but in quality. All that is very good was always scant and rare; abundance is discredit. Extent alone never exceeds mediocrity... Intensity gives eminence.

## 28. En nada vulgar.
In nothing vulgar. Not in taste. Gluts of common applause do not satisfy the discreet. Nor in understanding: do not be paid by the miracles of the vulgar, which are nothing but scarecrows for the ignorant.

## 29. Hombre de entereza.
A man of integrity. Always on the side of reason, with such tenacity of purpose that neither vulgar passion nor tyrannical violence ever forces him to cross the line of reason. The constant man judges dissimulation as a species of treason.

## 30. No hazer professión de empleos desautorizados.
Do not profess unauthorized employments. Much less those of chimera, which serve more to solicit contempt than credit. Even in the profession of the wise, the attentive man must not signal himself, much less in those that make their affectors ridiculous.
