# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 81-90 (Scholarly)

## 81. Usar el renovar su lucimiento.
Use renewing your brilliance. It is the privilege of the Phoenix. Excellence usually ages, and with it, fame. Habit diminishes admiration. Use, then, rebirth in valor, in intellect, in fortune, in everything.

## 82. Nunca apurar, ni el mal, ni el bien.
Never drain (*apurar*) either bad or good. A sage reduced all wisdom to moderation in everything. The supreme right becomes wrong, and the orange that is squeezed too much yields bitterness. Even in enjoyment, one must never reach the extremes.

## 83. Permitirse algún venial desliz.
Allow yourself some venial slip. For a carelessness is sometimes the greatest recommendation of talents. Envy has its Ostracism. It accuses the very perfect of sinning by not sinning. Let Homer nod, then, sometimes.

## 84. Saber usar de los enemigos.
Know how to use enemies. All things must be known how to be taken, not by the blade, which cuts, but by the handle, which defends. Enemies profit the wise man more than friends the fool. Flattery is more fierce than hatred.

## 85. No ser Malilla.
Do not be the "wild card" (*Malilla*). It is the defect of everything excellent that its much use comes to be abuse. It is a great unhappiness to be good for nothing; not less to want to be good for everything. The only remedy for everything extreme is to keep a mean in brilliance.

## 86. Prevenir las malas vozes.
Prevent bad rumors. The vulgar have many heads, and thus many eyes for malice and many tongues for discredit. Sometimes a bad rumor runs in it that tarnishes the greatest credit. It is very easy to acquire a sinister fame, because the bad is very credible.

## 87. Cultura, y aliño.
Culture and polish. Man is born a barbarian; he redeems himself from the beast by cultivating himself. Culture makes persons. Ignorance is very rough. Not only must understanding be polished, but also willing, and even more, conversing.

## 88. Sea el trato por mayor.
Let intercourse be majestic (*por mayor*), procuring sublimity in it. The great man must not be minute in his procedure. One must never individuate much in things. One must proceed ordinarily with a noble generality.

## 89. Comprehensión de sí.
Comprehension of oneself. In Character, in Intellect; in judgments, in affections. One cannot be master of oneself if one does not first comprehend oneself. There are mirrors of the face, there are none of the mind.

## 90. Arte para vivir mucho: vivir bien.
Art to live long: live well. Two things end life quickly: folly or wickedness. Just as virtue is its own reward, so vice is its own punishment. The integrity of the mind is communicated to the body.
