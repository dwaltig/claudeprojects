# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 101-110 (Scholarly)

## 101. La metad del mundo se está riendo de la otra metad.
One half of the world is laughing at the other half, with the folly of all. Perfections do not depend on a single liking. The standard of true satisfaction is the approval of men of reputation. One does not live by a single vote.

## 102. Estómago para grandes vocados de la fortuna.
A stomach for great mouthfuls of fortune. A large capacity is composed of large parts. He who deserves greater fortunes is not embarrassed by good ones. Show that you still have room for greater things.

## 103. Cada uno la magestad en su modo.
Each one the majesty in his mode. Let all actions, if not those of a King, be worthy of one. Represent a King by merits, if not by reality, for true sovereignty consists in the integrity of customs.

## 104. Tener tomado el pulso a los empleos.
Have the pulse of employments taken. Piden unos valor y otros sutileza. Governing men is a laborious occupation, especially fools or madmen: double sense is needed for one who has none.

## 105. No cansar.
Do not weary. Brevity is flattering and more business-like. Good things, if brief, are twice as good. Discreet men should excuse embarrassing others, especially great personages who are very busy. Well said is said quickly.

## 106. No afectar la fortuna.
Do not affect your fortune. Ostentating dignity offends more than ostentating the person. Esteem is achieved less the more it is sought. Let it be the eminence of your talents rather than adventitious dignity.

## 107. No mostrar satisfación de sí.
Do not show satisfaction with yourself. Live neither discontented, which is smallness, nor satisfied, which is folly. Satisfaction in most arises from ignorance. Prudence is always useful for prevention.

## 108. Atajo para ser persona: saberse ladear.
A shortcut to being a person: knowing how to associate. Intercourse is very effective. Customs and tastes are communicated. With the communication of extremes, a very discreet mean will be adjusted.

## 109. No ser acriminador.
Do not be a criminalizer. There are men of fierce genius; they make everything a crime. They condemn everyone, making beams out of atoms. Ingenuity finds a way out for everything.

## 110. No aguardar a ser Sol que se pone.
Do not wait to be a setting Sun. It is a maxim of the prudent to leave things before they leave you. Steal your body away from the sunsets. The observant man retires the racehorse in time.
