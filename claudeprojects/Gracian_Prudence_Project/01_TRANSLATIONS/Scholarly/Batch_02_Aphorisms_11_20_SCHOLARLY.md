# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 11-20 (Scholarly)

## 11. Tratar con quien se pueda aprender.
Associate with those from whom you can learn. Let friendly intercourse be a school of erudition, and conversation a refined teaching. Make your friends your teachers, blending the utility of learning with the pleasure of conversation.

## 12. Naturaleza y arte; materia y obra.
Nature and Art; material and work. There is no beauty without help, nor perfection that does not descend into barbarism without the enhancement of artifice. Art corrects the bad and perfects the good. Nature commonly leaves us at our best; let us resort to art.

## 13. Obrar de intención, ya segunda, y ya primera.
Act with intention, now second, now first. The life of man is a militia against the malice of man. Sagacity fights with stratagems of intention. It never does what it indicates; it aims, yes, to dazzle... Thus combat the craftiness of Python against the candor of Apollo.

## 14. La realidad y el modo.
The reality and the mode. Substance is not enough; circumstance is also required. A bad manner spoils everything, even justice and reason. A good manner supplies everything: it gilds a "no," sweetens the truth, and beautifies old age itself.

## 15. Tener ingenios auxiliares.
Have auxiliary wits. The happiness of the powerful: to accompany themselves with brave men of understanding who can extract them from every ignorant squeeze. A new kind of lordship: to make servants by art of those whom nature made superior.

## 16. Saber con recta intención.
Knowledge with right intention. They ensure a fecundity of successes. A monstrous violence was always a good Understanding married to a bad Will. Knowledge without sense is double madness.

## 17. Variar de tenor en el obrar.
Vary your manner of acting. Not always in one way, so as to dazzle the attention, especially if it is a rival. The gambler never plays the piece the opponent presumes, and certainly not the one he desires.

## 18. Aplicación y Minerva.
Application and Capacity (Minerva). There is no eminence without both, and if they concur, excess. A mediocrity achieves more with application than a superiority without it. Reputation is bought at the price of work.

## 19. No entrar con sobrada expectación.
Do not enter with excessive expectation. It is the ordinary slight of everything much celebrated beforehand not to arrive afterwards at the excess of what was conceived. Hope is a great falsifier of truth.

## 20. Hombre en su siglo.
A man in his century. Eminently rare subjects depend on the times. Not all had the one they deserved, and many, although they had it, did not manage to utilize it. But wisdom has an advantage: it is eternal.
