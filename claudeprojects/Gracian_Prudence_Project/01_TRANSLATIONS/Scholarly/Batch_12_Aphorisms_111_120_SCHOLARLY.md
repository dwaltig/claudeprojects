# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 111-120 (Scholarly)

## 111. Tener amigos.
Have friends. It is the second being. Every friend is good and wise for his friend. One will be worth as much as others want him to be. There is no spell like good service.

## 112. Ganar la pía afición.
Gain the pious affection (*pía afición*). One enters the concept through the affection. Benevolence facilitates and supplies everything. It does not always presuppose qualities, but puts them there.

## 113. Prevenirse en la fortuna próspera para la adversa.
Prepare in prosperous fortune for the adverse. Favors go cheap then, and friendships are abundant. Adversity is expensive and lacks everything. Have a reserve of friends and the grateful.

## 114. Nunca competir.
Never compete. Every pretension with opposition damages credit. Competition aims immediately to tarnish in order to outshine. The heat of contrariety enlivens or resurrects dead infamies.

## 115. Hazerse a las malas condiciones de los familiares.
Accustom yourself to the bad conditions of familiars. Just as to bad faces: it is a convenience where dependency mediates. Reflection prevents the disgusts or tolerates them.

## 116. Tratar siempre con gente de obligaciones.
Deal always with people of obligations. Their very obligation is the greatest guarantee of their dealing. It is better to fight with good people than to triumph over bad people.

## 117. Nunca hablar de sí.
Never speak of yourself. Either you must praise yourself, which is vanity, or you must vituperate yourself, which is smallness. The same inconvenience of prudence lies in speaking of those present.

## 118. Cobrar fama de Cortés.
Gain the fame of Courtly. Which is enough to make you plausible. Courtesy is the principal part of culture, a species of spell. Courtesy must always be more rather than less.

## 119. No hazerse de mal querer.
Do not make yourself ill-willed. Aversion should not be provoked. Malevolence prevents obligation. Show, then, that you estimate in order to be estimated.

## 120. Vivir a lo plático.
Live in the practical manner (*a lo plático*). Even knowledge must be current. Reasoning and tasting change with the times. Follow that for the time... Only in goodness does this rule not apply.
