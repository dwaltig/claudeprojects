# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 201-210 (Scholarly)

## 201. Todos los que parecen necios, lo son; y la metad de los que no lo parecen.
All who seem fools are so, and half of those who do not. Folly has taken possession of the world. The greatest fool is he who does not think he is one. He who thinks he does not know, knows.

## 202. Dichos y hechos hazen un varón perfecto.
Sayings and deeds make a perfect man. One must speak the best and work the most relevant. Sayings are the shadows of deeds. It is better to be celebrated for deeds than for words.

## 203. Conocer la Grandeza del siglo.
Know the Greatness of the century. In its eminent subjects. They are not many. Sovereign eminences are rare. Many have been held as great until they were compared with the truly great.

## 204. Lo fácil se ha de emprender como difícil; y lo difícil, como fácil.
What is easy should be undertaken as if it were difficult; and what is difficult, as if it were easy. By the first, confidence does not neglect; by the second, difficulty does not discourage.

## 205. Saber jugar de la pieza del desprecio.
Know how to play the piece of contempt. It is a singular trick for achieving things: not to prize them. They usually escape when sought and come when disdained. It is the greatest art of the "intent": to show itself careless.

## 206. Saber que hay "vulgaridad" en todas partes.
Know that there are "vulgar" spirits everywhere. Even in the highest posts. It is not the place, but the spirit that makes the vulgar. Folly is universal.

## 207. Usar de la "retenida."
Use self-control (*retenida*). Prudence must be the "brakeman" of the passions. One must have a "reserve" of reason to stop the heat of the irascible. Master yourself, and you will be master of everything.

## 208. No morir de mal de necios.
Do not die of the disease of fools. Which is to die of "suit" (*de apretamiento*). Fools die of their own fancies; the wise man lives by his disillusion. Let the heart be large enough to tolerate the errors of others.

## 209. Librarse de la necedad común.
Free yourself from common folly. It is a great part of wisdom. One must not be a "slave" to the popular concept. Truth is always for the few.

## 210. Saber jugar de la "verdad."
Know how to handle the "truth." It is a dangerous thing. It is like a bleeding of the heart. One must know the "time," the "mode," and the "person."
