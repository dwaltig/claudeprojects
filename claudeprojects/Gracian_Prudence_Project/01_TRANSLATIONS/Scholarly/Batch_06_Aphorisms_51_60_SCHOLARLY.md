# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 51-60 (Scholarly)

## 51. Hombre de buena Elección.
A man of good Choice. Most of life is lived by it. It presupposes good taste and the most rectitudinous judgment. There is no perfection where there is no selection (*delecto*). Many of fertile and subtle intellect... when they come to choosing, they are lost.

## 52. Nunca descomponerse.
Never lose your composure. A great subject of prudence: never to fall apart. It argues much man, a crowned heart. Let him be so much a master of himself... that neither in the most prosperous nor in the most adverse can anyone censure him as perturbed.

## 53. Diligente y Inteligente.
Diligent and Intelligent. Diligence executes quickly what intelligence thinks prolixly. Haste is the passion of fools. Wise men, on the contrary, often sin by detention. Swiftness is the mother of luck.

## 54. Tener bríos a lo cuerdo.
Have spirit (*bríos*) rationally. Even hares pull the beard of a dead Lion. There is no joking with valor. The spirit of the mind exceeds that of the body. Nature joined the sweetness of honey with the sting of the bee not without providence.

## 55. Hombre de espera.
A man of waiting. It argues a great heart, with widths of suffering. One must walk through the spaces of time to the center of the occasion. The crutch of Time does more than the iron club of Hercules. A great saying: "Time and I, against any two."

## 56. Tener buenos repentes.
Have good impromptus. They are born of a happy promptness. There are no squeezes nor chances for it. Some think much only to err in everything later, and others hit the mark in everything without thinking of it before.

## 57. Más seguros son los pensados.
More secure are the thoughtful ones. Done quickly enough if done well. What is done immediately is undone immediately. Understanding with depth achieves eternities. What is worth much costs much.

## 58. Saberse atemperar.
Know how to temper oneself. One must not show oneself equally intelligent with everyone, nor employ more strength than is necessary. Let there be no waste of knowledge or valor. Do not always be on display.

## 59. Hombre de buen dexo.
A man of good ending (*buen dexo*). Attention to the ending; putting more care into the happiness of the exit than the applause of the entrance. It is the common slight of the fortunate to have very favorable beginnings and very tragic ends.

## 60. Buenos dictámenes.
Good judgments. Some are born prudent; they enter with this advantage of connatural *synderesis* into wisdom. They abominate every caprice as a temptation of prudence, especially in matters of state.
