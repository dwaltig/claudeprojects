# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 141-150 (Scholarly)

## 141. No escucharse.
Do not listen to yourself. To speak and listen to yourself at the same time is not to talk, but to "gaze" at oneself. It is a great fault of prudence to have one's ear in one's own mouth.

## 142. Nunca por "porfía" seguir el peor bando.
Never for a "suit" follow the worse side. Just because the rival preceded to the better. Stubbornness is for losing. The prudent man is always on the side of reason.

## 143. No ser "Paradoxico" por huir de "Vulgar."
Do not be "Paradoxical" to avoid the "Vulgar." Both are extremes of discredit. Every paradox is a species of deception. It is the ruin of prudence. What truth cannot be maintained is a ghost of folly.

## 144. Entrar con la ajena, para salir con la suya.
Enter with the another's, to leave with your own. It is the strategy of the intent. To follow another's intent, the better to secure your own. Deceit is to be expected; let it be forestalled with subtlety.

## 145. No mostrar el "dedo malo."
Do not show your "sore finger." For everything will hit it. Malice always goes where the fault is. Do not let the place of your sorrow be known.

## 146. Mirar por dentro.
Look inside. One finds that things are very different from what they seem. Deceit is always the first to arrive. Truth always arrives last; let the prudent man reserve half his credulity for her.

## 147. No ser "in-acesible."
Do not be "un-accessable" (*in-acesible*). No one is so perfect that he does not sometimes need advice. Even the most sovereign must have the door open to a friendly warning. Reputation is gained by being a man of reason.

## 148. Tener el arte de conversar.
Have the art of conversing. Where man shows himself most as a person. No human exercise requires more attention. There is no worse "anatomy" of a mind than conversation.

## 149. Saber echar la "culpa" a otro.
Know how to throw the "blame" on another. It is a great part of lordship to have someone on whom the slights of non-success may fall. One must have a "shield" for slights.

## 150. Saber vender sus cosas.
Know how to sell your things. It is not enough that they are good. A good price is the greatest recommendation of things. To sell by "I don't know what" (*por un no sé qué*) is the greatest art.
