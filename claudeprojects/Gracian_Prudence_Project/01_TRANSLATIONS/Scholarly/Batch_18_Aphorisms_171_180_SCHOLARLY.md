# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 171-180 (Scholarly)

## 171. No desperdiciar el crédito.
Do not waste credit. For if you lose it once, you lose it forever. It is the treasury of the soul. One must not use it for things that are not worth it. Let credit be the last resort of prudence.

## 172. Nunca tratar con quien no tiene que perder.
Never deal with those who have nothing to lose. For they will engage you in a "bad war." He who has no honor does not estimate yours.

## 173. No ser "vidrioso" en el trato.
Do not be "glassy" (*vidrioso*) in your dealing. And much less in your friendship. Some break with a slight saying. Let the prudent man be "metallic," or at least "solid."

## 174. No vivir de prisa.
Do not live in a hurry. To know how to distribute life is to know how to enjoy it. One must not live as if always on the point of a journey.

## 175. Hombre de "sustancia."
A man of "substance." He who has it is worth more than he who only has "appearance." Some are all bark; others are all core.

## 176. Saber preguntar.
Know how to ask. There are those who do not know how to grant, and others who do not know how to ask. One must know the "time," the "mode," and the "person."

## 177. Nunca ser demasiado "familiar" con los superiores.
Never be too "familiar" with superiors. For it is a danger to lose the respect. The "sun" burns the more one approaches it. One must keep a "prudent distance."

## 178. Tener el "ayre" del empleo.
Have the "air" of the post. In everything. Let the magistrate act as a magistrate, and the soldier as a soldier. One must not be a "monstrosity" of character.

## 179. Respetar la "veneración" de los muchos.
Respect the "veneration" of the many. Even if you do not share it. One must not be a "rebel" against common sentiment.

## 180. Nunca ser el "eco" del desdoro.
Never be the "echo" of a slight. Especially if it is against yourself. One must not be the "reporter" of one's own infamy. Let the prudent man be the "tomb" of slights.
