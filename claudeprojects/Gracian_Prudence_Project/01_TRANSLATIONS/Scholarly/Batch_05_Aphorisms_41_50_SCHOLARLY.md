# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 41-50 (Scholarly)

## 41. Nunca exagerar.
Never exaggerate. A great matter of attention, not to speak in superlatives, either to avoid offending truth or to avoid tarnishing one's judgment. Exaggerations are prodigalities of esteem. To overrate is a branch of lying.

## 42. Del Natural Imperio.
Of Natural Empire. It is a secret force of superiority. It must not proceed from annoying artifice, but from an imperious nature. All submit to it without knowing how. These are lordly Geniuses, kings by merit.

## 43. Sentir con los menos y hablar con los más.
Feel with the few and speak with the many. To want to go against the current is as impossible to disillusion as it is easy to danger. Truth is for the few; deception is as common as it is vulgar.

## 44. Sympatía con los Grandes varones.
Sympathy with great men. It is the quality of a Hero to combine with Heroes. There is a kinship of hearts and of temperaments. It does not stop at mere esteem, but advances to benevolence.

## 45. Usar, no abusar, de las reflexas.
Use, do not abuse, reflection. It must not be affected, much less shown. All art must be concealed, for it is suspicious, and that of caution most of all. Reflection in proceeding is a great advantage in acting.

## 46. Corregir su Antipatía.
Correct your Antipathy. We tend to hate by instinct, even before seeing the qualities. Let prudence correct it, for there is no worse discredit than to hate the best.

## 47. Huir los Empeños.
Avoid Commitments (*Empeños*). This is one of the first matters of prudence. It is easier to avoid the occasion than to come out of it well. One commitment brings another greater one, and one is very near the edge of the precipice.

## 48. Hombre con fondos.
A man with depth (*fondos*). He has as much of a person as he has depth. The interior must always be twice as much as the exterior. There are subjects of mere façade, like houses unfinished because funds ran out.

## 49. Hombre juicioso y notante.
A judicious and observant man. He masters objects, not objects him. He sounds the bottom of the greatest depth; he knows how to make an anatomy of a capacity with perfection.

## 50. Nunca perderse el respeto a sí mismo.
Never lose respect for yourself. Nor become too familiar with yourself when alone. Let your own integrity be the standard of your rectitude. Come to fear yourself, and you will not need the imaginary tutor of Seneca.
