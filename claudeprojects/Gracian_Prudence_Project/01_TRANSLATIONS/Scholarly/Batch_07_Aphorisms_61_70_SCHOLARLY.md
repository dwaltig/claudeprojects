# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 61-70 (Scholarly)

## 61. Eminencia en lo mejor.
Eminence in the best. A great singularity among the plurality of perfections. There can be no Hero who does not have some sublime extreme. Eminence in a relevant employment lifts one from the ordinary vulgar and raises one to the category of the rare.

## 62. Obrar con buenos instrumentos.
Work with good instruments. Some want the extreme of their subtlety to shine forth in the vileness of their instruments: a dangerous satisfaction. The goodness of the minister never diminished the greatness of the Patron. Fame always goes with the first.

## 63. Excelencia de primero.
Excellence of being first. And if with eminence, double. A great advantage to play the hand (*jugar de mano*), for it wins on equality. The first ones take possession of the birthright of fame. Some prefer to be first in the second category than second in the first.

## 64. Saberse escusar pesares.
Know how to avoid sorrows. It is profitable wisdom to save oneself from disgusts. Prudence avoids many. Nor is it a rule of preservation to want to give oneself a sorrow for a whole life to give pleasure once to another.

## 65. Gusto relevante.
Relevant taste. Culture fits in it, just as in the intellect. The height of a capacity is known by the elevation of its affection. But one must not make a profession of being displeased with everything.

## 66. Atención a que le salgan bien las cosas.
Attention to making things turn out well. He who conquers does not need to give satisfactions. Most do not perceive the punctuality of circumstances, but only the good or bad outcomes. A good end gilds everything.

## 67. Preferir los Empeños plausibles.
Prefer plausible Employments. Most things depend on the satisfaction of others. There are employments exposed to universal acclamation, and others, though greater, in no way expectable. Let the great man prefer celebrated employments that all perceive.

## 68. Dar entendimiento.
Give understanding. It is of more skill than giving memory. One of the greatest advantages of the mind is to have what matters occur to it. Let him who has light give it... but with detention.

## 69. No rendirse a un vulgar humor.
Do not surrender to a vulgar humor. A great man is he who never subjects himself to strange impressions. It is a lesson of warning to reflect upon oneself: to know one's actual disposition and prevent it.

## 70. Saber negar.
Know how to deny. Not everything is to be granted, nor to everyone. Here enters the mode: the "no" of some is more esteemed than the "yes" of others. Denial must not be abrupt... nor must it be total.
