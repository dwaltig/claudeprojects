# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 121-130 (Scholarly)

## 121. No hazer negocio del no nada.
Do not make a business of nothing. Many things that were something, by being passed over became nothing; and others that were nothing, by being taken much into account became something.

## 122. Magestad en el dezir, y hazer.
Majesty in speaking and acting. It makes a great place for itself everywhere. It is a great victory to capture spirits. This is not the ferocity of the foolish, but an imperious spirit aided by merits.

## 123. Varón sin affectación.
A man without affectation. The more qualities, the less affectation. Perfections are worth as much as they are natural. The best should be done as if it were not meant.

## 124. Hazerse dessear.
Make yourself desired. Eminence in talent and in offices, and pleasantness in mode. Eminence makes itself needed, and pleasantness desired.

## 125. No ser libro de memorias ajenas.
Do not be a "Book of Accounts." Some want to hide their own stains by noting those of others. He who probes into the dirt of others always ends up dirtying himself.

## 126. No es nezio el que haze la nezedad, sino el que no la sabe encubrir.
Not a fool he who commits a folly, but he who does not know how to hide it. One must have one's affections under key. Reputation consists more in reserve than in deeds.

## 127. El despejo en todo.
The "unthought-of" (*El despejo*) in everything. It is the life of qualities, the breath of speech, the soul of deeds. It consists more in a connatural promptness than in an affected study. It wins by "I don't know what" (*un no sé qué*).

## 128. Alteza de ánimo.
Highness of spirit. One of the principal requisites for the Hero. It seasons the taste, enlarges the heart, elevates the thought. It never admits envy, that moth of perfections.

## 129. Nunca quexarse.
Never complain. Complaining always brings discredit. It rather solicits the audacity of passion in him who hears it than his consolation. The prudent man must never mention his slights.

## 130. Hazer, y hazer parecer.
Do and make it seen. Things do not pass for what they are, but for what they seem. Worthy and being seen to be so is double being. Deceit is very common; things are judged by the exterior.
