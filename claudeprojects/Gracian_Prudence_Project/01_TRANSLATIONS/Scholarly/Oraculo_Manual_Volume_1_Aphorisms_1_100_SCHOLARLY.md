# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 1-10 (Scholarly)

## 1. Todo está ya en su punto, y el ser persona en el mayor.
Everything is now at its peak, and being a person at its greatest. Today more is required for one sage than was required for seven in the past; and more is needed to deal with a single man in these times than with a whole people in ages gone by.

## 2. Genio y Ingenio.
Character and Intellect. These are the two axes of brilliance. One without the other is half-happiness. Understanding is not enough; a specific disposition is required. The misfortune of the fool is to err in his vocation, rank, and associations.

## 3. Llevar sus cosas con suspensión.
Keep things in suspense. The admiration of novelty is the estimation of success. Playing with cards exposed is neither useful nor pleasant. Not declaring yourself immediately keeps others in suspense, especially when the height of your position makes you the object of universal expectation. It is the reserved silence that is the sanctuary of wisdom.

## 4. El saber y el valor alternan grandeza.
Wisdom and Valor alternated in greatness. Because they are so, they make one immortal. A man is as much as he knows, and the wise man can do all things. A man without information is a world in darkness. Wisdom without valor is sterile.

## 5. Hazer depender.
Create dependency. It is not the one who gilds the idol who makes the god, but the one who adores it. The shrewd man prefers those who need him over those who are grateful to him. Dependency ends when satisfaction begins. Keep the patron in need of you, but do not allow them to fall into ruin for your own benefit.

## 6. Hombre en su punto.
Man at his peak. One is not born complete. Every day one perfects the person, the occupation, until reaching the point of consummate being. This is known by the elevation of taste, the purification of intellect, the maturity of judgment, and the refinement of the will.

## 7. Escusar vitorias del patrón.
Avoid victories over the superior. All defeat is odious, and defeating one's master is either foolish or fatal. Superiority is always hated, especially by those who are already superior. One may cede in luck or character, but never in intellect. The stars teach us this: they are brilliant, yet they never dare to outshine the sun.

## 8. Hombre inapassionable.
A man without passion. This is a sign of the greatest height of spirit. Superiority redeems one from the subjection of common impressions. There is no greater lordship than that of oneself.

## 9. Desmentir los achaques de su nación.
Belie the defects of your nation. Water takes the qualities of the veins it passes through; man takes the climate of where he is born. No nation escapes some original defect. Shrewdly correct or at least conceal these national stains.

## 10. Fortuna y Fama.
Fortune and Fame. What the former has of inconstancy, the latter has of firmness. The first is for living; the second for what comes after. Fortune is desired; Fame is earned through virtue.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 11-20 (Scholarly)

## 11. Tratar con quien se pueda aprender.
Associate with those from whom you can learn. Let friendly intercourse be a school of erudition, and conversation a refined teaching. Make your friends your teachers, blending the utility of learning with the pleasure of conversation.

## 12. Naturaleza y arte; materia y obra.
Nature and Art; material and work. There is no beauty without help, nor perfection that does not descend into barbarism without the enhancement of artifice. Art corrects the bad and perfects the good. Nature commonly leaves us at our best; let us resort to art.

## 13. Obrar de intención, ya segunda, y ya primera.
Act with intention, now second, now first. The life of man is a militia against the malice of man. Sagacity fights with stratagems of intention. It never does what it indicates; it aims, yes, to dazzle... Thus combat the craftiness of Python against the candor of Apollo.

## 14. La realidad y el modo.
The reality and the mode. Substance is not enough; circumstance is also required. A bad manner spoils everything, even justice and reason. A good manner supplies everything: it gilds a "no," sweetens the truth, and beautifies old age itself.

## 15. Tener ingenios auxiliares.
Have auxiliary wits. The happiness of the powerful: to accompany themselves with brave men of understanding who can extract them from every ignorant squeeze. A new kind of lordship: to make servants by art of those whom nature made superior.

## 16. Saber con recta intención.
Knowledge with right intention. They ensure a fecundity of successes. A monstrous violence was always a good Understanding married to a bad Will. Knowledge without sense is double madness.

## 17. Variar de tenor en el obrar.
Vary your manner of acting. Not always in one way, so as to dazzle the attention, especially if it is a rival. The gambler never plays the piece the opponent presumes, and certainly not the one he desires.

## 18. Aplicación y Minerva.
Application and Capacity (Minerva). There is no eminence without both, and if they concur, excess. A mediocrity achieves more with application than a superiority without it. Reputation is bought at the price of work.

## 19. No entrar con sobrada expectación.
Do not enter with excessive expectation. It is the ordinary slight of everything much celebrated beforehand not to arrive afterwards at the excess of what was conceived. Hope is a great falsifier of truth.

## 20. Hombre en su siglo.
A man in his century. Eminently rare subjects depend on the times. Not all had the one they deserved, and many, although they had it, did not manage to utilize it. But wisdom has an advantage: it is eternal.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 21-30 (Scholarly)

## 21. Arte para ser dichoso.
Art for being lucky. There are rules of luck, for not all is chance for the wise; it can be aided by industry. Some content themselves with standing gracefully at the gates of Fortune and waiting for her to act. Others, better, go forward and make use of prudent audacity.

## 22. Hombre de plausibles noticias.
A man of plausible knowledge. Courtly, pleasant erudition is the ammunition of the discreet: a practical knowing of everything current, more for news than for scholarship. Conversational wisdom has been worth more to some than all the Seven Liberal Arts.

## 23. No tener algún desdoro.
Have no blemish. The fate of perfection. Few live without some defect, moral or natural, and they become passionate about them when they could easily cure them. A single cloud is enough to eclipse a whole Sun.

## 24. Templar la imaginación.
Temper the imagination. Sometimes correcting it, sometimes aiding it. It tends to be a tyrant; it is not content with speculation but acts, and even lords over life. All this it can do, if prudent judgment (*sindéresis*) does not curb it.

## 25. Buen entendedor.
A good understander. It was once an art of arts to know how to reason; now it is not enough, one must divine. Truths that matter most to us always come half-said. There are diviners of the heart and lynxes of intentions.

## 26. Hallarle su torcedor a cada uno.
Find each person's handle (*torcedor*). It is the art of moving wills; it consists more in skill than in resolution. All are idolaters: some of esteem, others of interest, and most of pleasure. The trick lies in knowing these idols.

## 27. Pagarse más de intensiones que de extensiones.
Prefer intensity to extent. Perfection does not consist in quantity, but in quality. All that is very good was always scant and rare; abundance is discredit. Extent alone never exceeds mediocrity... Intensity gives eminence.

## 28. En nada vulgar.
In nothing vulgar. Not in taste. Gluts of common applause do not satisfy the discreet. Nor in understanding: do not be paid by the miracles of the vulgar, which are nothing but scarecrows for the ignorant.

## 29. Hombre de entereza.
A man of integrity. Always on the side of reason, with such tenacity of purpose that neither vulgar passion nor tyrannical violence ever forces him to cross the line of reason. The constant man judges dissimulation as a species of treason.

## 30. No hazer professión de empleos desautorizados.
Do not profess unauthorized employments. Much less those of chimera, which serve more to solicit contempt than credit. Even in the profession of the wise, the attentive man must not signal himself, much less in those that make their affectors ridiculous.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 31-40 (Scholarly)

## 31. Conocer los afortunados y los desdichados.
Know the fortunate to choose them, and the unfortunate to flee from them. Unhappiness is usually a crime of folly... There is no contagion so sticky. Never open the door to the lesser evil.

## 32. Estar en opinión de dar gusto.
Have the reputation of giving pleasure. For those who govern, it is a great credit to please: a sovereign enhancement to conquer universal grace. This alone is the advantage of ruling: to be able to do more good than anyone else.

## 33. Saber abstraher.
Know how to withdraw (*abstraher*). If it is a great lesson of life to know how to deny, it is a greater one to know how to deny oneself, to business, to personages. He must not be so much everyone's that he is not his own.

## 34. Conocer su realce Rei.
Know your dominant quality (*realce Rei*). The relevant talent, cultivating it, and aiding the others. Anyone would have achieved eminence in something if he had known his advantage. Observe your "King Attribute" and load your application there.

## 35. Hazer concepto.
Form a concept. And most of all about what matters most. Fools are lost by not thinking: they never conceive the half of things. The wise man forms a concept of everything... reflection reaches where apprehension did not.

## 36. Tener tanteada su fortuna.
Have your fortune gauged. For proceeding, for engaging. It matters more than the observation of temperament. It is a great art to know how to rule it, now waiting for it... now utilizing it. If you have observed it favorable, proceed with boldness.

## 37. Conocer y saber usar de las varillas.
Know and know how to use the "little rods" (*varillas*). It is the subtlest point of human intercourse. They are thrown out to test spirits... There are other malicious, projectile ones, touched with the herb of envy... imperceptible thunderbolts to topple one from grace.

## 38. Saberse dexar ganando con la fortuna.
Know how to leave winning with fortune. It is for gamblers of reputation. A beautiful retreat matters as much as a gallant attack. Continued happiness was always suspicious... Fortune tires of carrying one on her back for so long.

## 39. Conocer las cosas en su punto.
Know things at their point, in their season, and know how to enjoy them. The works of nature all reach the complement of their perfection; up to there they were gaining, from there losing. It is the eminence of a good taste to enjoy each thing in its complement.

## 40. Gracia de las gentes.
Grace of the people. It is much to achieve common admiration, but more to achieve affection. It requires benevolence for benevolence: doing good on all hands... Courtesy is the greatest political spell of great personages.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 41-50 (Scholarly)

## 41. Nunca exagerar.
Never exaggerate. A great matter of attention, not to speak in superlatives, either to avoid offending truth or to avoid tarnishing one's judgment. Exaggerations are prodigalities of esteem. To overrate is a branch of lying.

## 42. Del Natural Imperio.
Of Natural Empire. It is a secret force of superiority. It must not proceed from annoying artifice, but from an imperious nature. All submit to it without knowing how. These are lordly Geniuses, kings by merit.

## 43. Sentir con los menos y hablar con los más.
Feel with the few and speak with the many. To want to go against the current is as impossible to disillusion as it is easy to danger. Truth is for the few; deception is as common as it is vulgar.

## 44. Sympatía con los Grandes varones.
Sympathy with great men. It is the quality of a Hero to combine with Heroes. There is a kinship of hearts and of temperaments. It does not stop at mere esteem, but advances to benevolence.

## 45. Usar, no abusar, de las reflexas.
Use, do not abuse, reflection. It must not be affected, much less shown. All art must be concealed, for it is suspicious, and that of caution most of all. Reflection in proceeding is a great advantage in acting.

## 46. Corregir su Antipatía.
Correct your Antipathy. We tend to hate by instinct, even before seeing the qualities. Let prudence correct it, for there is no worse discredit than to hate the best.

## 47. Huir los Empeños.
Avoid Commitments (*Empeños*). This is one of the first matters of prudence. It is easier to avoid the occasion than to come out of it well. One commitment brings another greater one, and one is very near the edge of the precipice.

## 48. Hombre con fondos.
A man with depth (*fondos*). He has as much of a person as he has depth. The interior must always be twice as much as the exterior. There are subjects of mere façade, like houses unfinished because funds ran out.

## 49. Hombre juicioso y notante.
A judicious and observant man. He masters objects, not objects him. He sounds the bottom of the greatest depth; he knows how to make an anatomy of a capacity with perfection.

## 50. Nunca perderse el respeto a sí mismo.
Never lose respect for yourself. Nor become too familiar with yourself when alone. Let your own integrity be the standard of your rectitude. Come to fear yourself, and you will not need the imaginary tutor of Seneca.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 51-60 (Scholarly)

## 51. Hombre de buena Elección.
A man of good Choice. Most of life is lived by it. It presupposes good taste and the most rectitudinous judgment. There is no perfection where there is no selection (*delecto*). Many of fertile and subtle intellect... when they come to choosing, they are lost.

## 52. Nunca descomponerse.
Never lose your composure. A great subject of prudence: never to fall apart. It argues much man, a crowned heart. Let him be so much a master of himself... that neither in the most prosperous nor in the most adverse can anyone censure him as perturbed.

## 53. Diligente y Inteligente.
Diligent and Intelligent. Diligence executes quickly what intelligence thinks prolixly. Haste is the passion of fools. Wise men, on the contrary, often sin by detention. Swiftness is the mother of luck.

## 54. Tener bríos a lo cuerdo.
Have spirit (*bríos*) rationally. Even hares pull the beard of a dead Lion. There is no joking with valor. The spirit of the mind exceeds that of the body. Nature joined the sweetness of honey with the sting of the bee not without providence.

## 55. Hombre de espera.
A man of waiting. It argues a great heart, with widths of suffering. One must walk through the spaces of time to the center of the occasion. The crutch of Time does more than the iron club of Hercules. A great saying: "Time and I, against any two."

## 56. Tener buenos repentes.
Have good impromptus. They are born of a happy promptness. There are no squeezes nor chances for it. Some think much only to err in everything later, and others hit the mark in everything without thinking of it before.

## 57. Más seguros son los pensados.
More secure are the thoughtful ones. Done quickly enough if done well. What is done immediately is undone immediately. Understanding with depth achieves eternities. What is worth much costs much.

## 58. Saberse atemperar.
Know how to temper oneself. One must not show oneself equally intelligent with everyone, nor employ more strength than is necessary. Let there be no waste of knowledge or valor. Do not always be on display.

## 59. Hombre de buen dexo.
A man of good ending (*buen dexo*). Attention to the ending; putting more care into the happiness of the exit than the applause of the entrance. It is the common slight of the fortunate to have very favorable beginnings and very tragic ends.

## 60. Buenos dictámenes.
Good judgments. Some are born prudent; they enter with this advantage of connatural *synderesis* into wisdom. They abominate every caprice as a temptation of prudence, especially in matters of state.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 61-70 (Scholarly)

## 61. Eminencia en lo mejor.
Eminence in the best. A great singularity among the plurality of perfections. There can be no Hero who does not have some sublime extreme. Eminence in a relevant employment lifts one from the ordinary vulgar and raises one to the category of the rare.

## 62. Obrar con buenos instrumentos.
Work with good instruments. Some want the extreme of their subtlety to shine forth in the vileness of their instruments: a dangerous satisfaction. The goodness of the minister never diminished the greatness of the Patron. Fame always goes with the first.

## 63. Excelencia de primero.
Excellence of being first. And if with eminence, double. A great advantage to play the hand (*jugar de mano*), for it wins on equality. The first ones take possession of the birthright of fame. Some prefer to be first in the second category than second in the first.

## 64. Saberse escusar pesares.
Know how to avoid sorrows. It is profitable wisdom to save oneself from disgusts. Prudence avoids many. Nor is it a rule of preservation to want to give oneself a sorrow for a whole life to give pleasure once to another.

## 65. Gusto relevante.
Relevant taste. Culture fits in it, just as in the intellect. The height of a capacity is known by the elevation of its affection. But one must not make a profession of being displeased with everything.

## 66. Atención a que le salgan bien las cosas.
Attention to making things turn out well. He who conquers does not need to give satisfactions. Most do not perceive the punctuality of circumstances, but only the good or bad outcomes. A good end gilds everything.

## 67. Preferir los Empeños plausibles.
Prefer plausible Employments. Most things depend on the satisfaction of others. There are employments exposed to universal acclamation, and others, though greater, in no way expectable. Let the great man prefer celebrated employments that all perceive.

## 68. Dar entendimiento.
Give understanding. It is of more skill than giving memory. One of the greatest advantages of the mind is to have what matters occur to it. Let him who has light give it... but with detention.

## 69. No rendirse a un vulgar humor.
Do not surrender to a vulgar humor. A great man is he who never subjects himself to strange impressions. It is a lesson of warning to reflect upon oneself: to know one's actual disposition and prevent it.

## 70. Saber negar.
Know how to deny. Not everything is to be granted, nor to everyone. Here enters the mode: the "no" of some is more esteemed than the "yes" of others. Denial must not be abrupt... nor must it be total.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 71-80 (Scholarly)

## 71. No ser desigual.
Do not be unequal (*desigual*), of anomalous procedure. Neither by nature nor by affectation. The prudent man was always the same in everything perfect. In matters of prudence, variety is ugly. He who yesterday was the white of his "yes," today is the black of his "no."

## 72. Hombre de resolución.
A man of resolution. Bad execution is less harmful than irresolution. Matters are not spoiled so much when they run as when they stagnant. Ingenious is the difficulty-maker, but more so is he who finds the exit from inconveniences.

## 73. Saber usar del desliz.
Know how to use the slip (*desliz*). It is the disengagement of the prudent. With the gallantry of a witticism, they often escape from the most intricate labyrinth. A courteous trick of denying is to change the verb.

## 74. No ser intratable.
Do not be intractable. In the most populated places are the true wild beasts. Inaccessibility is the vice of those unknown to themselves. It is not a means to esteem to begin by annoying.

## 75. Elegir idea Heroica.
Choose a Heroic idea. More for emulation than for imitation. Let each one propose the first in his employment, not so much to follow as to surpass. Alexander wept not for Achilles buried, but for himself.

## 76. No estar siempre de burlas.
Do not always be joking. Prudence is known in seriousness. He who is always joking is never a man of truth. One never knows when they speak in judgment, which is as much as having none.

## 77. Saber hazerse a todos.
Know how to adapt to everyone. A discreet Proteus: learned with the learned, holy with the holy. A great art to win everyone, for similarity conciliates benevolence.

## 78. Arte en el intentar.
Art in attempting. Folly always enters abruptly, for all fools are bold. But prudence enters with great caution. Its scouts are warning and reserve. It is proper to go detained where much depth is feared.

## 79. Genio Genial.
Genial temper (*Genio Genial*). If with temperance, it is a quality, not a defect. A grain of pleasantness seasons everything. It indicates placability, the hook of hearts.

## 80. Atención al informarse.
Attention in informing oneself. Most of life is lived by information. The ear is the second door of truth and the principal one of lies. Truth is ordinarily seen, extravagantly heard.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 81-90 (Scholarly)

## 81. Usar el renovar su lucimiento.
Use renewing your brilliance. It is the privilege of the Phoenix. Excellence usually ages, and with it, fame. Habit diminishes admiration. Use, then, rebirth in valor, in intellect, in fortune, in everything.

## 82. Nunca apurar, ni el mal, ni el bien.
Never drain (*apurar*) either bad or good. A sage reduced all wisdom to moderation in everything. The supreme right becomes wrong, and the orange that is squeezed too much yields bitterness. Even in enjoyment, one must never reach the extremes.

## 83. Permitirse algún venial desliz.
Allow yourself some venial slip. For a carelessness is sometimes the greatest recommendation of talents. Envy has its Ostracism. It accuses the very perfect of sinning by not sinning. Let Homer nod, then, sometimes.

## 84. Saber usar de los enemigos.
Know how to use enemies. All things must be known how to be taken, not by the blade, which cuts, but by the handle, which defends. Enemies profit the wise man more than friends the fool. Flattery is more fierce than hatred.

## 85. No ser Malilla.
Do not be the "wild card" (*Malilla*). It is the defect of everything excellent that its much use comes to be abuse. It is a great unhappiness to be good for nothing; not less to want to be good for everything. The only remedy for everything extreme is to keep a mean in brilliance.

## 86. Prevenir las malas vozes.
Prevent bad rumors. The vulgar have many heads, and thus many eyes for malice and many tongues for discredit. Sometimes a bad rumor runs in it that tarnishes the greatest credit. It is very easy to acquire a sinister fame, because the bad is very credible.

## 87. Cultura, y aliño.
Culture and polish. Man is born a barbarian; he redeems himself from the beast by cultivating himself. Culture makes persons. Ignorance is very rough. Not only must understanding be polished, but also willing, and even more, conversing.

## 88. Sea el trato por mayor.
Let intercourse be majestic (*por mayor*), procuring sublimity in it. The great man must not be minute in his procedure. One must never individuate much in things. One must proceed ordinarily with a noble generality.

## 89. Comprehensión de sí.
Comprehension of oneself. In Character, in Intellect; in judgments, in affections. One cannot be master of oneself if one does not first comprehend oneself. There are mirrors of the face, there are none of the mind.

## 90. Arte para vivir mucho: vivir bien.
Art to live long: live well. Two things end life quickly: folly or wickedness. Just as virtue is its own reward, so vice is its own punishment. The integrity of the mind is communicated to the body.
# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 91-100 (Scholarly)

## 91. Obrar siempre sin escrúpulos de imprudencia.
Act always without scruples of imprudence. The suspicion of error in the one who executes is already evidence in the one who watches. Actions in doubt of prudence are dangerous. Prudence does not admit probabilities.

## 92. Seso trascendental.
Transcendental sense. It is the first and supreme rule of acting and speaking. A grain of prudence is worth more than pounds (*arrobas*) of subtlety. It will suffice to satisfy the wise, whose vote is the touchstone of successes.

## 93. Hombre universal.
A universal man. Composed of all perfection, he is worth many. He makes life very happy, communicating this enjoyment to familiarity. Variety with perfection is the entertainment of life.

## 94. Incomprehensibilidad de caudal.
Incomprehensibility of capacity. Allow yourself to be known, not comprehended. Let no one ascertain the limits of your capacity. Opinion and doubt of where each one's capacity reaches cause greater effects of veneration than the evidence of it.

## 95. Saber entretener la expectación.
Know how to keep expectation alive. Let the much promise more, and let the best action be a bid for greater ones. One must not throw the whole remainder (*el resto*) at the first cast.

## 96. De la gran sindéresis.
Of the great *synderesis*. It is the throne of reason, the base of prudence. It is a gift of Heaven, and the most desired for being first and best. All the actions of life depend on its influence.

## 97. Conseguir y conservar la reputación.
Obtain and preserve reputation. It is the usufruct of fame. It costs much, because it is born of eminences. Once obtained, it is preserved with ease. It obliges much and works more.

## 98. Cifrar la voluntad.
Write the will in cipher (*Cifrar la voluntad*). Passions are the breaches of the mind. The most practical knowledge consists in dissimulating. Let your taste not be known, so that it may not be forestalled.

## 99. Realidad y apariencia.
Reality and appearance. Things do not pass for what they are, but for what they seem. Few are those who look inside, and many those who are satisfied with the apparent. It is not enough to be right with a face of malice.

## 100. Varón desengañado.
A man undeceived (*desengañado*): a Christian sage, a Courtly philosopher. But not to seem so, much less to affect it. Philosophizing is discredited... But disillusion was always the food of prudence.
