# Oráculo Manual: Aphorisms 181-190 (Scholarly)

## 181. No mentir, mas no dezir toda la verdad.
Do not lie, but do not tell the whole truth. Nothing requires more subtlety than truth. A single lie ruins a whole fame for integrity... but all truths are not to be said.

## 182. Un grano de audacia en todo.
A grain of audacity in everything. It is a great part of prudence. One must temper the fear so as not to be a "frozen" mind. A grain of boldness seasons the most relevant deeds.

## 183. No ser inmoble.
Do not be "unshakable" (*No ser inmoble*). Every tenacity of purpose should have its limit. One must not be a "statue" of oneself. Prudence consists in knowing how to yield to the time and the occasion.

## 184. No ser ceremonioso.
Do not be "ceremonious." It is a species of hypocrisy. Too much ceremony is a burden of life. The prudent man must be polite, but not "punctilious."

## 185. Nunca arriesgar la reputación a una sola suerte.
Never risk your reputation on a single cast. For if it fails, the damage is total. One must have "reserves" of credit. Let things be attempted by parts.

Know the "monstrosities" of your century. For every age has its own. One must know how to navigate in the "sea" of one's time.

## 187. Las cosas plausibles: hágalas por sí; las odiosas: por otro.
Plausible things: do them yourself; hateful ones: through another. By the first you gain grace; by the second you avoid slights. Let the "sun" show itself in the favors.

Bring "things of praise" to the conversation. It is to be a "merchant" of credit. One must celebrate the eminences of others so that they celebrate yours.

## 189. Valerse de la necesidad ajena.
Utilize the "needs" of others. For it is the greatest hook of wills. One must know what each one lacks... for "need" is the mistress of the will.
