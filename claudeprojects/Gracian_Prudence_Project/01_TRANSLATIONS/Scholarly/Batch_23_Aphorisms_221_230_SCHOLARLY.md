## 221. No ser "infeliz" en los desdoros.
Do not be "unfortunate" in the slights. For even a slight can be a crime of folly. One must not be the "target" of everyone's malevolence. Let prudence be the "shield" against the audacity of the foolish.

## 223. Nunca ser "desigual" en su proceder.

## 224. Saber "contradezir" con advertencia.

## 226. Atención al que obra de "apretamiento."
Be careful with him who acts by "suit" (*de apretamiento*). For it is a species of tyranny. One must not be a "victim" of another's passion... but a "master" of it. Let prudence be the "brakeman" of the will.

## 229. No ser "ceremonioso" por affectación.
Do not be "ceremonious" by affectation. For it is a species of hypocrisy. Too much ceremony is a burden of life. Let the prudent man be polite, but not "punctilious."

## 230. Nunca "arriesgar" su reputación a una sola suerte.
Never "risk" your reputation on a single cast. For if it fails, the damage is total. One must have "reserves" of credit. Let things be attempted by parts... for the total risk is the temptation of folly.
